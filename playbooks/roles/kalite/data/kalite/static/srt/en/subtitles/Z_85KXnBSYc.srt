1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
   

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,790
Let's see if we can
learn a thing or

3
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:08,189
two about Sn2 reactions.

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,790
And you're going to see a lot of
these in organic chemistry.

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,880
This sounds like a
very fancy term.

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,100
But it really just stands
for-- the S stands for

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,350
substitution.

8
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,360
   

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,600
The n stands for nucleophilic.

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:31,590
   

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,810
And then the 2, and this is
probably maybe the least

12
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,040
obvious part of Sn2, the 2 comes
from the fact that the

13
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,570
rate-determining step
in this reaction

14
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,230
involves both reactants.

15
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,595
And I'm going to show
you what we mean.

16
00:00:44,595 --> 00:00:47,970
And it'll actually be probably
more clear when we compare it

17
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,800
to Sn1 reactions.

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,740
So let me show you
an Sn2 reaction.

19
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,840
Let's say we have
bromomethane.

20
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,270
And let me draw it in
three dimensions.

21
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,190
You have a hydrogen
sticking out.

22
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,980
Maybe the bromine is
right over there.

23
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,900
And then you have another
hydrogen in the back.

24
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:14,080
And then you have a hydrogen
that comes up just like that.

25
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,570
And here, the three dimensions
won't matter that much.

26
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:21,160
This is not a chiral carbon.

27
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,800
There's no handedness here.

28
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,560
But in the future, we'll think
about chiral carbons and what

29
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,640
might happen to them as they
undergo Sn2 reactions.

30
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,440
So I have this bromomethane
here.

31
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,920
And let's say we also have
some hydroxide in

32
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,810
solution with it.

33
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,640
So it's a hydroxide,
and this oxygen has

34
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,590
seven valence electrons.

35
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:48,070
You could imagine that the way
that you get a hydroxide is if

36
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:52,620
you start off with water,
that looks like this.

37
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:57,200
   

38
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,160
And maybe there's another water
someplace else that

39
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,630
looks like that.

40
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,860
And maybe in one step, this
water right here takes this

41
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,509
guy's hydrogen.

42
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:11,390
Remember, there's a partially
positive charge on the

43
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,220
hydrogen, partially negative
charge on the oxygen.

44
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:20,070
So maybe he gives one of his
electrons to the hydrogen,

45
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,850
which will end up with
a positive charge.

46
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,190
It'll be a hydronium cation.

47
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:29,740
And then this electron takes
back that extra electron from

48
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,560
the hydrogen.

49
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,180
And so now, he's going to have
seven valence electrons.

50
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,220
He's going to have this one.

51
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,970
That was at this end of the
bond of the one that he's

52
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:36,870
taking back.

53
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,560
And then that's two, three,
four, five, six, and then this

54
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,680
electron right there, seven.

55
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:48,440
So he's going to have one, two,
three, four, five, six,

56
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,740
seven valence electrons.

57
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,250
And he's going to have
a negative charge.

58
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,610
It's neutral when it's water.

59
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,060
When he takes an extra electron,
it's going to have a

60
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:56,670
negative charge.

61
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,600
And you could imagine this is in
a solution with water, that

62
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,570
water is our solvent.

63
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:04,390
So let me put a negative
charge right here.

64
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,010
I can write minus 1 if I want.

65
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,850
And in this reaction, just so
we know what's what, this

66
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:15,610
hydroxide molecule, or this
hydroxide anion, is our

67
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,240
nucleophile.

68
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,900
It is the nucleophile
right there.

69
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,870
   

70
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,430
And the best way to think about
a nucleophile is it

71
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,970
likes other people's
nucleuses.

72
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,600
It likes them because nucleuses
are positive.

73
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,040
It has extra electrons.

74
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,300
In this case, it has a negative
charge, so it is

75
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,020
attracted to other nucleuses.

76
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,530
Nucleuses of atoms are positive,
so it is attracted

77
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,800
to electrons.

78
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,950
Phile, I'm not a Greek scholar,
but it means to be

79
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,230
attracted or to like

80
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,670
something, so it likes nucleuses.

81
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:55,320
And if you want to compare it
to acids or bases, you'd

82
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,520
classify this actually as a
Lewis base, something that

83
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,180
gives electrons.

84
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,910
But we're not going to go
into that right now.

85
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,990
This is a nucleophile.

86
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:05,700
It is attracted to nucleuses,
to positive things.

87
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,390
It wants to give
away electrons.

88
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,780
Now, what's going to happen is
that this is going to give an

89
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,580
electron to this carbon.

90
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,980
This carbon's going to say,
oh, I got an electron.

91
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,775
Let me give away an electron to
somebody who probably wants

92
00:04:18,775 --> 00:04:19,620
it really badly.

93
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,470
And in this case, it's going
to be the bromine because

94
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,820
we've seen multiple times
that the bromine is very

95
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,710
electronegative.

96
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,770
It already is starting to hog
the electrons, and it would

97
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,830
like to take an electron
altogether.

98
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,700
And so let me show
you the reaction.

99
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,630
It's going to happen
very quickly.

100
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,172
Or it's actually going to happen
very quickly the way I

101
00:04:37,172 --> 00:04:39,630
drew it, because it's really
a one-step reaction.

102
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:46,780
So you're going to have one of
these electrons right here

103
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,310
will attack the carbon.

104
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,310
Or I shouldn't say attack.

105
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,670
It sounds very aggressive.

106
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,070
It will be given
to the carbon.

107
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,430
And then the carbon says, oh,
I'm getting an electron from

108
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,980
this direction.

109
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,840
It actually has a slightly
positive charge at this end,

110
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,960
because the bromine is hogging
some of the electrons, so

111
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,410
they'll be attracted
to each other.

112
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:09,080
They're going to bump into each
other just the right way.

113
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,820
And then at the exact same time,
this all has to happen

114
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,800
kind of simultaneously.

115
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,310
At the exact same time, this
electron, sitting at that end

116
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:20,110
of the bond, is going to
go to the bromine.

117
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:24,680
And so what is it going to look
like when this reaction

118
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,120
has actually occurred?

119
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,630
So it's literally a
one-step reaction.

120
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,220
So you have your carbon.

121
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,480
You have the hydrogen
that is pointing up.

122
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,710
Now, let me color code this.

123
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,860
So that'll make it
interesting.

124
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,750
So you have this hydrogen,
that is

125
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,253
coming out of the screen.

126
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:45,320
   

127
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,960
And it's still just coming
straight out of the screen,

128
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,070
but I'm going to draw it to the
down right, because this

129
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,010
hydroxide's attacking
from behind.

130
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,290
And this bromine, which we call
the leaving group, or

131
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,420
actually, it's going to be a
bromide anion once it leaves,

132
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,800
that's going to leave
from the right.

133
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,330
Attack from the left, leave
from the right,

134
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,890
from different sides.

135
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,090
So then this is that hydrogen
that's sticking out.

136
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,830
The hydrogen in the back--
well, we know it's in the

137
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:16,960
back, so I'll just continue to
draw it in the back like that.

138
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,570
And now this hydroxide
is going to be

139
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,100
attached to the carbon.

140
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:29,140
So this carbon now gets one of
those electrons, and it is

141
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:33,530
bonded now to the oxygen.

142
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,620
Let me draw the oxygen.

143
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,640
So you have the oxygen.

144
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,960
Let me see the best way
that I could do this.

145
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,710
So you have the oxygen here
bonded to a hydrogen.

146
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,150
And let me draw its
valence electrons.

147
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:50,930
So it had one, two, three, four,
five, six, and then it

148
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,520
had a seventh electron, but
it just gave it away.

149
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,890
So its seventh electron is going
to bond with this one.

150
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,480
They were already a
pair over here.

151
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,800
Let me make it very clear
what the color is.

152
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,030
This electron right over
there is this electron.

153
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,800
But it was already paired with
this guy, so when he gives it

154
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,150
away to the carbon, it forms
this covalent bond right here.

155
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:16,500
So now you have this OH group,
this hydroxyl group, off of

156
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,450
the carbon now.

157
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:22,850
And now the bromine, you had a
negatively charged group here.

158
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,150
Now, what I've drawn so far,
everything is neutral.

159
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,630
So something has to be
negatively charged.

160
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,850
It's going to be the bromine
because that's what getting

161
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,180
the electron.

162
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,940
So now the bromine, if I wanted
to draw bromine's

163
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,750
valence shell, before it would
have seven electrons, so one,

164
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,910
two, three, four, five,
six, seven.

165
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,040
Now that it's taking that
electron from carbon, it's

166
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:49,710
going to have eight: one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven,

167
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,220
and let me color
code it again.

168
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,880
So this electron right here,
when it goes to the bromine,

169
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,850
is going to be that electron
right there, and we're going

170
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,630
to have a negative charge.

171
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:02,510
And so here, in this situation,
just to make sure,

172
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,950
this is the nucleophile.

173
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:09,030
The bromine right here, this
is the leaving group.

174
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:13,400
   

175
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,200
And then the carbon, I guess
the thing that is reacting,

176
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,850
that's getting substituted,
where the bromine leaves it

177
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:24,370
and the hydroxide joins it,
that's called the substrate.

178
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,610
So I could draw it like this.

179
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:28,860
This is the substrate.

180
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,059
   

181
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,470
And the whole reason why
I did it, this was

182
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,720
not a chiral carbon.

183
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,630
But you could imagine, once we
deal with chiral carbons, when

184
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,760
they undergo an Sn2 reaction
like this, their chirality

185
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,039
will actually change.

186
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,340
So I'll leave you
there right now.

187
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,490
That'll give you something to
think about, Sn2 reactions.

188
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,270
And then in the next video,
we'll think a

189
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,220
little bit about Sn1.

190
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,810
Oh, and before I leave you, I
left you hanging on the 2.

191
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,210
I said this is called
substitution.

192
00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:00,740
You saw that the bromine was
substituted by the hydroxide.

193
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,710
It's nucleophilic.

194
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:05,460
It involved this hydroxide,
which likes nucleuses.

195
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,610
And then I said the
rate-determining step involves

196
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,440
both reactants.

197
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,030
And here, it might not be
completely clear, but the

198
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,570
rate-determining step
was actually what's

199
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,690
going on right here.

200
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,900
And if I were to draw an
intermediate, you could

201
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:24,242
actually draw an intermediate
step here.

202
00:09:24,242 --> 00:09:30,100
Let me copy and paste
this down here.

203
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,606
   

204
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:35,210
So you could actually draw an
intermediate step, so let me

205
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,210
copy the other one.

206
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,880
Let me copy this.

207
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,540
Copy and paste.

208
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,300
This all happens over one step,
but if we wanted to show

209
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:54,290
what happens in between, for a
small amount of time, you have

210
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:58,400
this transition state, where the
carbon is going to have a

211
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,740
partial bond, so it has
this hydrogen in blue.

212
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,790
Let me draw this hydrogen
in blue sticking out.

213
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:09,020
And it has another hydrogen
behind it.

214
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,960
I'll draw it like it's
right behind it.

215
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,600
And then for some small fraction
of time, it is bonded

216
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,415
to both the bromine-- so I'll
draw it with a dotted line.

217
00:10:18,415 --> 00:10:21,450
It is bonded to both the
bromine, which now will have a

218
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,450
partial negative charge because
it's starting to get

219
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:35,170
an electron, and it's also
bonded to the hydroxide, which

220
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,360
also has a partial
negative charge.

221
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,230
You can imagine this negative
charge is now getting split

222
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:39,730
between the two.

223
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,320
This is a transition state.

224
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,360
And the notation for a
transition state, you put

225
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,830
brackets around it, or
parentheses, in some cultures,

226
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:51,020
they call them, and you write
this little symbol up here.

227
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,020
This tells us this is
a transition state.

228
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,100
This is not one of the
semi-stable intermediates.

229
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,890
This is something that
we're going through.

230
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,680
This is an Sn2 reaction because
this transition state

231
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,460
is actually what determines
the rate of the reaction.

232
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:08,490
This requires the highest energy
state of this reaction.

233
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,300
This is what's going to-- well,
I said it already--

234
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,500
determine its rate.

235
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,000
And in this transition state,
this rate-determining step,

236
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,270
you have all of the reactants.

237
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:21,830
You have your hydroxide right
there, and you also have your

238
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:26,070
bromomethane that we
started with, so it

239
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,860
has two of the reactants.

240
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,560
That's why it's called
an Sn2 reaction.

241
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:30,867
