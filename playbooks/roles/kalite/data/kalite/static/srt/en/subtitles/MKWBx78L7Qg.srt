1
00:00:00,274 --> 00:00:01,415
What we're going to go over

2
00:00:01,415 --> 00:00:02,564
in this video is

3
00:00:02,564 --> 00:00:04,207
one of the core principles

4
00:00:04,207 --> 00:00:05,123
in Calculus,

5
00:00:05,123 --> 00:00:06,083
and you're going to use it anytime

6
00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:07,206
you take the derivative

7
00:00:07,206 --> 00:00:08,835
of anything even reasonably complex.

8
00:00:08,835 --> 00:00:11,274
And it's called the chain rule.

9
00:00:11,274 --> 00:00:12,423
And when you're first exposed to it

10
00:00:12,423 --> 00:00:13,667
it can seem a little daunting

11
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:14,753
and a little bit convoluted,

12
00:00:14,753 --> 00:00:16,270
but as you see more and more examples

13
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,344
it will start to make sense

14
00:00:17,344 --> 00:00:18,674
and hopefully it will even start to seem

15
00:00:18,674 --> 00:00:21,093
a little bit simple and intuitive over time.

16
00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:23,202
So let's say that I had a function.

17
00:00:23,202 --> 00:00:25,758
Let's say I have a function, h of x.

18
00:00:25,758 --> 00:00:28,207
And it is equal to,

19
00:00:28,207 --> 00:00:29,675
just for example,

20
00:00:29,675 --> 00:00:31,467
let's say it's equal to

21
00:00:31,467 --> 00:00:32,344
sine of x -

22
00:00:32,344 --> 00:00:35,869
let's say it's equal to sine of x,

23
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:36,936
squared.

24
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:37,874
Now I could have written that,

25
00:00:37,874 --> 00:00:39,004
I could have written it like this:

26
00:00:39,004 --> 00:00:40,676
sine squared of x,

27
00:00:40,676 --> 00:00:41,734
but it will be a little bit clearer using,

28
00:00:41,734 --> 00:00:43,779
using that type of notation.

29
00:00:43,779 --> 00:00:45,824
So let me make it so I have h of x.

30
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,869
And what I'm curious about is,

31
00:00:47,869 --> 00:00:49,748
what is h prime of x?

32
00:00:49,748 --> 00:00:51,627
So I want to know h prime of x,

33
00:00:51,627 --> 00:00:53,506
which another way of writing it is

34
00:00:53,506 --> 00:00:55,067
the derivative of h

35
00:00:55,067 --> 00:00:56,672
with respect to x -

36
00:00:56,672 --> 00:00:57,936
these are just different notations -

37
00:00:57,936 --> 00:01:01,006
and to do this I am going to use the chain rule.

38
00:01:01,006 --> 00:01:03,142
I am going to use the chain rule.

39
00:01:03,142 --> 00:01:06,007
The chain rule comes into play any time

40
00:01:06,007 --> 00:01:08,675
your function can be viewed as a composition

41
00:01:08,675 --> 00:01:09,802
of more than one function,

42
00:01:09,802 --> 00:01:12,342
and that might not seem obvious right now

43
00:01:12,342 --> 00:01:14,942
but it will hopefully maybe by the end of this video

44
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:15,939
or the next one.

45
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:17,161
Now what I want to do is

46
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:21,095
a little bit of a thought experiment.

47
00:01:21,095 --> 00:01:23,758
If I were to ask you what is the derivative,

48
00:01:23,758 --> 00:01:24,756
with respect to x,

49
00:01:24,756 --> 00:01:26,193
if I were just to apply the derivative operator

50
00:01:26,193 --> 00:01:29,688
to x squared with respect to x,

51
00:01:29,688 --> 00:01:30,828
what do I get?

52
00:01:30,828 --> 00:01:31,990
Well this gives me two x.

53
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,467
We've seen that many, many, many, many times.

54
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:36,093
Now what if I were to take the derivative

55
00:01:36,093 --> 00:01:38,606
with respect to a of a squared?

56
00:01:38,606 --> 00:01:40,417
Well it's the exact same thing.

57
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:42,341
I just swapped an a for the x's.

58
00:01:42,341 --> 00:01:45,647
This is still going to be equal to two a.

59
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:46,819
Now I will do something

60
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:48,502
that might be a little bit more bizarre -

61
00:01:48,502 --> 00:01:50,137
What if I were to take the derivative

62
00:01:50,137 --> 00:01:53,401
with respect to sine of x

63
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:55,174
with respect to sine of x,

64
00:01:55,174 --> 00:01:58,341
of sine of x,

65
00:01:58,341 --> 00:02:01,006
sine of x, squared?

66
00:02:01,006 --> 00:02:03,930
Well, wherever I have the x's up here

67
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:04,754
or the a's over here

68
00:02:04,754 --> 00:02:06,269
I just replace it with the sine of x.

69
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:10,342
So this is just going to be two times the thing that I had.

70
00:02:10,342 --> 00:02:12,274
So whatever I'm taking the derivative with respect to -

71
00:02:12,274 --> 00:02:13,273
here it was with respect to x,

72
00:02:13,273 --> 00:02:14,530
here is was with respect to a

73
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,203
here's with respect to sine of x.

74
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:21,255
So it's going to be two times sine of x.

75
00:02:21,255 --> 00:02:23,676
So the chain rule tells us

76
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:25,538
that this derivative is going to be

77
00:02:25,538 --> 00:02:29,838
the derivative of our whole function with respect,

78
00:02:29,838 --> 00:02:31,939
or the derivative of this outer function,

79
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:35,752
x squared, the derivative of x squared,

80
00:02:35,752 --> 00:02:39,269
the derivative of this outer function

81
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:41,538
with respect to sine of x,

82
00:02:41,538 --> 00:02:44,269
so that is going to be two sine of x -

83
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:47,073
two sine of x -

84
00:02:47,073 --> 00:02:48,347
so we can view it as the derivative of

85
00:02:48,347 --> 00:02:50,870
the outer function with respect to the inner,

86
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,006
two sine of x,

87
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:54,687
we can just treat sine of x like it's kind of an "x"

88
00:02:54,687 --> 00:02:55,795
and it would have been two x,

89
00:02:55,795 --> 00:02:57,005
but instead it's a sine of x.

90
00:02:57,005 --> 00:02:58,538
And we say, two sine of x

91
00:02:58,538 --> 00:03:04,782
times, times the derivative of sine of x

92
00:03:04,782 --> 00:03:06,339
with respect to x -

93
00:03:06,339 --> 00:03:10,352
times the derivative of sine of x with respect to x.

94
00:03:10,352 --> 00:03:11,404
Well that's more straight forward

95
00:03:11,404 --> 00:03:12,800
and a little bit more intuitive.

96
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,897
The derivative of sine of x with respect to x,

97
00:03:15,897 --> 00:03:17,675
we've seen multiple times,

98
00:03:17,675 --> 00:03:19,755
is cosine of x.

99
00:03:19,755 --> 00:03:21,602
So times cosine of x.

100
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:23,273
And so there we've applied the chain rule

101
00:03:23,273 --> 00:03:25,090
There's the derivative of the outer function

102
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,041
with respect to the inner,

103
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,341
so derivative of sine of x, squared

104
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,641
with respect to sine of x

105
00:03:29,641 --> 00:03:30,943
is two sine of x,

106
00:03:30,943 --> 00:03:33,418
and then we multiply that times the derivative

107
00:03:33,418 --> 00:03:36,343
of sine of x with respect to x.

108
00:03:36,343 --> 00:03:37,937
So let me make it clear -

109
00:03:37,937 --> 00:03:38,937
this right over here

110
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:41,454
is the derivative -

111
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:44,274
we're taking the derivative of

112
00:03:44,274 --> 00:03:47,878
sine of x, squared.

113
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:48,780
So let me make it clear -

114
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,879
that's what we're taking the derivative of

115
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,629
with respect to sine of x

116
00:03:55,629 --> 00:03:57,000
and then we're multiplying that

117
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,754
times the derivative of sine of x

118
00:03:59,754 --> 00:04:03,269
the derivative of sine of x

119
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:06,915
with respect to x.

120
00:04:06,915 --> 00:04:08,757
And this is where it might start making

121
00:04:08,757 --> 00:04:10,856
a little bit of intuition.

122
00:04:10,856 --> 00:04:13,526
You can't really treat these differentials,

123
00:04:13,526 --> 00:04:16,196
this d whatever, this d x, this d sin of x,

124
00:04:16,196 --> 00:04:18,868
as a number.

125
00:04:18,868 --> 00:04:19,910
And you really can't -

126
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,498
the notation makes it look like a fraction

127
00:04:21,498 --> 00:04:23,086
because intuitively that's what we're doing.

128
00:04:23,086 --> 00:04:24,674
But if you were to treat them like fractions,

129
00:04:24,674 --> 00:04:28,086
then you could think about canceling that and that.

130
00:04:28,086 --> 00:04:29,657
And once again, this isn't a rigorous thing to do,

131
00:04:29,657 --> 00:04:31,228
but it can help with the intuition -

132
00:04:31,228 --> 00:04:32,801
and then what you're left with is the derivative

133
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:36,737
of this whole sine of x squared with respect to x.

134
00:04:36,737 --> 00:04:38,508
So you're left with,

135
00:04:38,508 --> 00:04:39,541
you're left with

136
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:43,022
the derivative of essentially our original function

137
00:04:43,022 --> 00:04:48,207
sine of x, squared, with respect to x.

138
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:50,363
Which is exactly what dh/dx is.

139
00:04:50,363 --> 00:04:53,334
This right over here is

140
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:56,505
our original function, h.

141
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,086
That's our original function, h.

142
00:04:58,086 --> 00:05:00,136
So it might seem a little bit daunting now.

143
00:05:00,136 --> 00:05:01,874
What I'll do in the next video

144
00:05:01,874 --> 00:05:03,606
is another several examples

145
00:05:03,606 --> 00:05:07,000
and then we'll try to abstract this a little bit.
