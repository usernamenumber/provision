1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,240
We've already seen alcohols in
many of these videos, but I

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,710
thought it was about time
that I actually

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,436
made a video on alcohols.

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,160
Now, alcohols is the general
term for any molecule that

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,860
fits the pattern some type of
functional group or chain of

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,200
carbons OH.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,540
And they use the letter R.

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,500
And I've used it before.

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,600
R stands for radical.

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,110
And I don't want you to confuse

11
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,970
this R with free radical.

12
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,020
It means completely
different things.

13
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,450
R in this form really just means
a functional group or a

14
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,890
chain of carbons here.

15
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,960
It doesn't mean a
free radical.

16
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,640
This just means it could be
just something attached to

17
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,260
this OH right there.

18
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,640
Now another point of
clarification, do not think

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,740
that anything that fits this
pattern is drinkable.

20
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,480
Do not associate it with the
traditional alcohol that you

21
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,580
may or may not have
been exposed to.

22
00:00:53,580 --> 00:01:03,400
Traditional drinking alcohol
is actually ethanol.

23
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,100
Alcohol is actually--
let me write out

24
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,430
the molecular formula.

25
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:12,160
CH3, CH2, and then OH.

26
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:17,430
This is what is inside of wine
and beer and hard liquor, or

27
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,400
whatever you might want.

28
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,060
You do not want to drink and
maybe you might not actually

29
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,720
want to drink this either, but
you definitely do not want to

30
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,200
drink something like methanol.

31
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,900
It might kill you.

32
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,750
So you do not want to do
something like this.

33
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,000
You do not want to
ingest that.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,290
Might kill or blind you.

35
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,310
This might do it in a
more indirect way.

36
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,230
So I want to get that out of
the way and just so that we

37
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,710
get kind of a little bit more
comfortable with alcohols, and

38
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,520
we've seen them involved
in other reactions.

39
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,880
We've seen hydroxides act
as nucleophiles and Sn2

40
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,650
substitution reactions
create alcohols.

41
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,760
But I want to do is just learn
to get comfortable and really

42
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,870
make sure we know how to
name these things.

43
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,510
So let's just name these
molecules that I drew right

44
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,430
before I pressed record
right over here.

45
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,610
So over here, like everything
else, we always want to define

46
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,110
the longest carbon chain.

47
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:09,070
We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 carbons.

48
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,320
So it's going to be pent.

49
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,260
And there's no double bonds.

50
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:16,840
So it's a pentane.

51
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,200
So I'll just write pentane
right then.

52
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,910
And we're not going to just
write a pentane because

53
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,860
actually, the fact that makes
it an alcohol, that takes

54
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,070
precedence over the fact
that it is an alkane.

55
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:31,650
So it actually, the suffix of
the word will involve the

56
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,740
alcohol part.

57
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,990
So it is pentanol.

58
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,970
That tells us that's
an alcohol.

59
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,070
And to know where the OH is
grouped, we'll start numbering

60
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,350
closest to the OH.

61
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,740
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

62
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,710
Sometimes it'll be called
2-pentanol.

63
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,720
And this is pretty clear because
we only have one group

64
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,680
here, only one OH.

65
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,240
So we know that that is
what the 2 applies to.

66
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,720
But a lot of times, if people
want to be a little bit more

67
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,615
particular, they might
write pentan-2-ol.

68
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,800
And this way is more useful,
especially if you have

69
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,740
multiple functional groups.

70
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,420
So you know exactly
where they sit.

71
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,880
This one is harder to say.

72
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,170
2-pentanol is pretty
straightforward.

73
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,940
Now let's try the name this
beast right over here.

74
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,900
So we have a couple of
things going on.

75
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,200
This is an alkyne.

76
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,870
We have a triple bond.

77
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,920
It's an alkyne.

78
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,020
We have two bromo groups here.

79
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,800
And it's also an alcohol.

80
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,340
And alcohol takes precedence
on all of them.

81
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,770
So we want to start numbering
closest to the alcohol.

82
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,710
So we want to start numbering
from this end

83
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,940
of the carbon chain.

84
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:47,375
And we have 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8 carbons.

85
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,120
We want to call it an octyne.

86
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,190
But because we have an alcohol
there, we want to call this an

87
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,560
octyne-- let me make
it very clear.

88
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,320
So oct tells us that
we have 8 carbons.

89
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,300
Now we have to specify where
that triple bond is.

90
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,120
The triple bond is
on the 5 carbon.

91
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,320
You always specify the lower
number of the carbons on that

92
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:12,980
triple bond.

93
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,230
So it is oct-5-yn.

94
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,029
That tells us that's where
the triple bond is.

95
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:23,640
And then we have the
OH on the 4 carbon.

96
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,890
So 4-ol.

97
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,210
And now we have these
two bromo groups

98
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,590
here on the 7 carbon.

99
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:40,710
So it's 7,7-dibromo
oct-5-yn-4-al.

100
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,520
And this would all
be one word.

101
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,010
Let me make sure that
you realize that

102
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:46,850
this should be connected.

103
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,640
I just ran out of space.

104
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,875
So that's probably about as
messy of a thing you'll have

105
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,620
to name, but just showing
you that these

106
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,120
things can be named.

107
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,950
Now let's think about this
one over here in green.

108
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,850
So we have 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6 carbons.

109
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,850
So it's going to be a hex.

110
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,560
And they're all single bonds,
so it's a hexane.

111
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,100
It's a cyclohexane.

112
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,920
But then of course, the
hydroxide or the hydroxy group

113
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,140
I should call it,
takes dominance.

114
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,550
It's a hexanol.

115
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,870
So this is a cyclohexanol.

116
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:28,230
And once again, that comes
from the OH right there.

117
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,460
And you don't have
to number it.

118
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,220
Because no matter what carbon
it's on, it's on the same one.

119
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,410
If you had more than one of
these OH groups, then we would

120
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,300
have to worry about
numbering them.

121
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,280
Let's just do this one
right over here.

122
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,620
So once again, what is
our carbon chain?

123
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,670
We have 1, 2, 3 carbons.

124
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:49,050
And we have the hydroxy
group attached to

125
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,630
the 1 and the 3 carbon.

126
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,800
Prop is our prefix.

127
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,060
It is an alkane.

128
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,590
So we would call this--
and there's a couple

129
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,330
of ways to do this.

130
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:04,500
We could call this 1 comma
3 propanediol.

131
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,530
Actually, I don't have
to put a dash their.

132
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,350
Propanediol.

133
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,860
And over here, we would add the
E because we have the D

134
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,330
right there.

135
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,700
So it's propanediol.

136
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,790
If it wasn't diol, it
would be propanal.

137
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,330
You wouldn't have the E,
D and the I there.

138
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,800
So this would specify we're at
the 1 and the 3 carbons.

139
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,580
We have the hydroxy group.

140
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:38,260
Or this could also be written
as propane- 1, 3- diol.

141
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,110
And once again, the di is
telling us that we have two of

142
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,380
the hydroxy groups attached
to this thing.

143
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,120
But either of these things are
ways that you would see this

144
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,550
molecule named.
