1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,650
   

2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,250
In this playlist, we've been
constructing a monetary or

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,850
banking system that reasonably--
in the simplified

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,160
form, approximates the
system we're in.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,560
So we said, OK, we need
a banking system.

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:19,310
   

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,340
And we went the fractional
reserve route.

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,810
We said, we'll take deposits,
but we realize that most of

9
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,010
the deposits just sit there.

10
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,200
People really don't use them so
let's re-lend out some of--

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,160
90% or 50% of the deposit--
some amount.

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,580
So we have to keep some fraction
aside as reserves and

13
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,370
that way we can use that money
to lend more, but in the

14
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,850
process, we create a multiplier

15
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:41,860
effect and create money.

16
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,105
So that's what we described; a
fractional reserve system.

17
00:00:44,105 --> 00:00:53,930
   

18
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,190
And when we talk about reserves,
what we originally

19
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,430
talked about reserves
was gold.

20
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,750
It was gold based.

21
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,740
We started off with
the farmers.

22
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,670
They had their gold.

23
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,920
Gold was the unit of exchange
from primitive times.

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,210
It was the first agreed
upon medium, and

25
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,400
people kept with that.

26
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,360
And then we eventually showed
that in a fractional reserve

27
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,050
system when you have this
multiplier effect and you

28
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:18,350
become kind of an advanced
Western industrial economy, to

29
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,770
some degree the gold might just
sit in the central bank

30
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,240
vaults and just kind of
provide this kind of

31
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,760
confidence in the system, but
really, it does nothing there.

32
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,180
It just provides a confidence.

33
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,990
And at some point we show--
I think it was in the last

34
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,650
video-- that you can actually
just go off the gold standard

35
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,380
and you could go onto a
non-hard currency-- or

36
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,520
not-backed by gold.

37
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,540
And the point of that is really
to get to where we are

38
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,510
today and to show that
it isn't crazy.

39
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:50,070
There's a lot of-- I guess you
could call them conspiracy

40
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,540
theorists who think that there
was kind of a negative intent

41
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,020
behind going off of the gold
standard and that it was

42
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,870
somehow stealing money.

43
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,600
And you know what?

44
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,550
I'm not 100% sure that they're
not wrong, but I'm just saying

45
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,410
since then, it's not like we've
had wealth destruction

46
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:07,660
and that we've turned
into some type of

47
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,699
post-apocalyptic society.

48
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,520
Economic growth has been pretty
fast. There's been

49
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,450
innovation.

50
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,570
Productivity has increased.

51
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,440
So at least as far as I can
tell, it seems like you can

52
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,570
have a reasonable economic
system that's not backed by

53
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:23,540
gold, that's actually backed
by the actual wealth, where

54
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,650
the wealth is the productive
capacity of a country.

55
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,690
So, not backed by gold.

56
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,900
And that's where we got
to in the last video.

57
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,340
I think I struck a nerve a
little bit because the gold

58
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,080
really isn't fundamentally doing
something and it really

59
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,780
is just a medium of exchange.

60
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,100
And some people said, how
can you say that?

61
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,960
Gold is definitely
worth something.

62
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,740
There's no reality
in which gold

63
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,830
cannot be worth something.

64
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,290
Gold controls other assets.

65
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,530
So it it's good to, I think,
one, think about what other

66
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,730
routes we could've taken
down this banking

67
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,580
system evolution tree.

68
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,270
And then also think about-- I
guess, revisit the notion of

69
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,870
gold itself.

70
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,670
So if we just think about--
let's revisit gold first

71
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,340
because I think that's what a
lot of people care about.

72
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,910
So there's two things
that I was drawing

73
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,790
a difference between.

74
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,800
And it's a philosophical
difference, but I think it's

75
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,420
an important one.

76
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,410
It really helps, I guess,
get a handle on

77
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,600
things in the world.

78
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:23,720
So there's money and then
there's wealth-- and this is

79
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,080
tricky because at the end, these
are just definitions and

80
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,130
definitions take on different
meanings as time goes on.

81
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:32,360
I looked up wealth in Wikipedia
and it gave the Adam

82
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,550
Smith definition-- from The
Wealth of Nations-- and he

83
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:40,030
talks about wealth as the land
and-- I think it was the land

84
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,340
and labor that produce
utility for humans or

85
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,050
something of that sort.

86
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,590
So essentially his definition
is, wealth would be things

87
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:53,910
like land, it would be food, it
would be shelter, it'd be

88
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:59,160
transportation, it would be,
I don't know, it would be

89
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,210
entertainment to some
degree, right?

90
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,770
That provides some utility.

91
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,020
It makes us happier.

92
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,140
   

93
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,690
Or it could be things that help
produce these things like

94
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:13,470
factories or-- who knows what
else-- computers, things that

95
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,000
help us produce all of these
things more efficiently.

96
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,630
And if you stay in that mindset,
money is not wealth.

97
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,950
Money is just a medium of
exchange for wealth.

98
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:30,660
   

99
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,720
You could say money has value.

100
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,200
The value of money really is the
oil or the lubrication of

101
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,730
the economy.

102
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:42,060
Without any form of money, you
would have to be bartering.

103
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,640
If I was a a home builder and I
wanted to get bread, I would

104
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,560
have to exchange a house for, I
don't know, 10,000 loaves of

105
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,210
bread, which just is
not practical.

106
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,410
Instead, I can exchange it for
money and then later exchange

107
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,330
that money for bread.

108
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,790
And within this money medium of
exchange context, there's

109
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,070
different types of
money, right?

110
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,460
There's paper money.

111
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:05,040
   

112
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,880
There's hard currency,
et cetera.

113
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,790
And gold would fall under
this context.

114
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,450
And then there's a fundamental
question: Is gold

115
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:23,410
fundamentally, intrinsically,
worth more than paper money?

116
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,860
And I guess it goes to
just, what do you

117
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,230
think is going to happen?

118
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:31,030
I mean, the benefit or the
negative of gold or a lot of

119
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,770
hard currencies is
that it's scarce.

120
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,910
   

121
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:40,460
And by it being scarce, it's
not like you can just print

122
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,200
this stuff and there's
always going to be a

123
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,440
set supply of it.

124
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,380
And so if someone took a
negative spin on it, scarcity

125
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,630
would mean less flexible.

126
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:54,240
   

127
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,950
Or if you took a positive spin
on it, you could say it can't

128
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,200
be manipulated.

129
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,420
   

130
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:06,780
And both of these are probably
true to some degree, right?

131
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,130
But that's what it is.

132
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,740
It's just a scarce
unit of exchange.

133
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,870
And so I'm not saying that gold
will one day lose its

134
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,300
ability to control some of these
things or be exchanged

135
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,580
for some of these things.

136
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,420
I'm just saying that money or
the unit of exchange is

137
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,420
fundamentally different than
these things that actually

138
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,320
provide utility.

139
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,670
I mean, gold does have
some applications.

140
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,130
Maybe you say it provides
entertainment

141
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,650
in the form of jewelry.

142
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,590
Maybe does provide
some utility.

143
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,010
It can be used as fillings
or in some industrial or

144
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,680
electronic applications,
but primarily

145
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,010
it's a unit of exchange.

146
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,420
And as a unit of exchange, it
helps just facilitate the

147
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:45,270
transactions amongst wealth and
helps the economy allocate

148
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,780
resources efficiently.

149
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,470
Now, paper money is
not scarce, right?

150
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,720
It's controllable.

151
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,610
   

152
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,590
And so you could take a negative
or positive spin on

153
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,320
that, right?

154
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,730
You could say it's flexible.

155
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:02,300
That would be the positive
spin on it.

156
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,420
Or you could say it could
be manipulated.

157
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:10,540
And there are times in history
where many governments, just

158
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:16,580
kind of push for populist
agendas or to somehow try to

159
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,870
defer problems maybe until the
next guy shows up, they did

160
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,660
manipulate currencies.

161
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,910
And that did lead to
hyperinflation and eventually

162
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,190
the paper money becomes
worthless, but then there's

163
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:29,040
other examples where the paper
money, for the most part,

164
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,650
really does retain its value.

165
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,450
So that's another thing
to think about.

166
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:38,200
And so just going back to the
question of whether gold will

167
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,070
or will not lose its value,
that's just really-- I mean,

168
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:44,340
what is it going to lose its
value relative to and what

169
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,510
would be the catalyst for it?

170
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,520
So a lot of people right now,
they'll say, the dollar--

171
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,170
there's going to be
hyperinflation because the Fed

172
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:53,440
is being so proactive, so
I'm going to buy gold.

173
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,610
And they might be right.

174
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,440
I'm not sure about that.

175
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,730
If I knew about that
I would go and

176
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,110
speculate on gold myself.

177
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:05,170
But the main thing in any type
of investment is to realize

178
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:08,120
that you're making a bet on
what human beings will do,

179
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,530
what the Federal government
will do.

180
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:13,640
And just as an example, in real
terms, if you adjust it

181
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:23,130
for today's dollars, gold
in 1980 was-- this is in

182
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:26,650
inflation adjusted dollars-- I
think it was on the order of

183
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,450
$2,400, right?

184
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:31,520
So even today, even with all
of this talk-- I guess it's

185
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,210
2009 now-- even with all this
talk about hyperinflation, the

186
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:39,620
Fed being overly aggressive and
us pumping up the money

187
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,750
supply and the Fed's balance
sheet expanding-- even today,

188
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,690
gold-- in today's terms-- this
is $2,400 in today's terms. I

189
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,440
think it's at $840
or something.

190
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,280
And back in 1980, a very
reasonable person could have

191
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,530
said, my God, we have
hyperinflation, we just got

192
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,330
through these oil shocks,
inflation is going through the

193
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,980
roof-- inflation was already
much more rampant than it has

194
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,320
been in recent memory-- and
you're like, boy, the dollar's

195
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,370
going to be worthless
before we know it.

196
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:12,070
I'm just going to buy gold,
although-- what

197
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,980
should gold be worth?

198
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,860
Should it be worth $24,000?

199
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,130
Should it be worth $2 million?

200
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,290
Who knows?

201
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,850
Does gold just go to infinity
in terms of dollars or does

202
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,370
the dollar just go to zero?

203
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,790
So someone could've made a very
reasonable argument back

204
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:28,910
then that they should get out
of their bank accounts and

205
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,240
convert it all to gold and they
wouldn't have been able

206
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,110
to predict that Paul Volcker
would show up in the early

207
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,510
'80s and increase interest
rates despite all of the

208
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,380
political pressure to maybe
do the opposite and he got

209
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,410
inflation under control.

210
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,870
And then by-- what was it?

211
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:48,460
   

212
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,190
By the late '90s, in today's
terms, gold was-- I think in

213
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,420
the $200 range or it might've
been even lower.

214
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,280
We'll say approximately $200.

215
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,850
And even if that person said,
even in the late '90s, I'm

216
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:04,480
going to hold to my bet and keep
holding gold, it would've

217
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,270
taken-- if they'd had it all the
way to today, they still

218
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,110
would have been better off in
1980 keeping their money in a

219
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,350
bank account that gets more
interest than inflation.

220
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,530
So if you just got 3% or 4% on
your bank account starting in

221
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:18,250
1980, you still would have been
better off than holding

222
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,420
gold-- even though there was a
very credible argument for

223
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,270
inflation at that time.

224
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,360
So it's just a very, very
hard thing to predict.

225
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,470
And with any of these things
where you're really just

226
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,460
betting on the medium of
exchange, it's very

227
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,200
hard to price it.

228
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,650
It's very hard to say
what that unit of

229
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,580
exchange really is.

230
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,920
So now gold has ran up from
the late '90s to $840.

231
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,420
It's based on a lot of people
thinking that the dollar's

232
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,110
going to lose its value,
et cetera.

233
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,260
It's completely possible.

234
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,000
We might have an irresponsible
government.

235
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,920
Inflation looks like it's under
control right now, but

236
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,670
who knows what happens
in a year or two?

237
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,670
Maybe all this liquidity starts
to get a multiplier

238
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,460
effect and the dollar
gets debased and

239
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,850
gold jumps up to $8,000.

240
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:02,140
Then those people just have made
a great bet, but maybe

241
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,170
inflation isn't the problem.

242
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,210
Maybe it's deflation and
maybe people don't lose

243
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,030
faith in the currency.

244
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:11,250
Maybe a Paul Volcker-like
character shows up and tackles

245
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,610
inflation and then gold
goes back to $200.

246
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,340
But the bottom line here is
that it's really hard to

247
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:21,080
predict because it's actually
not generating utility itself,

248
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,730
it's a measure of utility.

249
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,430
But anyway, I don't want to
fixate on that too much, but

250
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,370
it's an interesting
discussion.

251
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,080
But anyway, just going back to
the original thing, there's

252
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,980
other ways that we could have
gone down the evolutionary

253
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,080
path of banking systems. I just
wanted to go over the

254
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,550
path that we've gone.

255
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,170
Instead of a fractional reserve,
you could have a full

256
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,420
reserve system.

257
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:42,340
   

258
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,230
That's-- instead of me taking a
deposit and saying that you

259
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,840
can demand the deposit at any
given point, but still lending

260
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,170
90% of it out-- that's what I do
in the fractional reserve--

261
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,600
I would tell you, 90%
of your money, you

262
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,620
can't take it out tomorrow.

263
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,770
It's going to be locked
in for six months.

264
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,610
It'd be like a CD and the money
that you want to have

265
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,100
tomorrow, I'm just going to put
it aside, you're not going

266
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,040
to get any interest on it, and
you might have to even pay me

267
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,660
a little bit of money to keep
it safe and to be able to

268
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,780
access it from an ATM.

269
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,600
That's completely fine.

270
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,870
Someone could argue that
this is less flexible.

271
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:15,720
That would be the negative
spin on it.

272
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,580
But then the positive spin on it
is maybe it's less subject

273
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,830
to manipulation.

274
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,960
   

275
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,910
Or maybe there will be a few
less booms and busts, right?

276
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,020
Maybe these bubbles
won't form.

277
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,210
I'm not so sure about that,
but I think it's

278
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,190
a reasonable argument.

279
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,230
And then even within full
reserve, we could have gone

280
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,890
gold or not gold.

281
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,520
And once again, that would
have just been a question

282
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,320
about how much flexibility you
have. The most restrictive

283
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,310
system would be a full reserve
system based on some type of

284
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:51,170
hard currency that can't be
printed or can't be controlled

285
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,860
by humans to some degree.

286
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,940
Or you could have something that
is printed and then to

287
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,510
some degree this could be
manipulated a little bit.

288
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,240
And just like on the fractional
reserve--

289
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,520
fractional reserve backed by
gold-- little less flexible,

290
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,270
but maybe that's good.

291
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,240
Little less game-able as well.

292
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,160
Anyway, I just wanted to give
you this kind of overview of

293
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:08,560
everything.

294
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,700
Because I think I maybe struck
some nerves in the last time.

295
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,030
I didn't want to in any way
insult gold and I don't think

296
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,830
that tomorrow gold will
be worthless.

297
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,190
I just wanted to make it
very clear that from a

298
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,840
philosophical point of view,
there's a difference between

299
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,000
gold and the things that it can
be exchanged for, just as

300
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,240
there is a difference between
money or-- any kind of money--

301
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,680
paper money and the things that
it can be exchanged for.

302
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,410
And in general, I think gold
does have a special place

303
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,160
relative to any other
hard currencies.

304
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:42,400
Relative to diamonds, or
nanotubes, or anything else--

305
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,340
and that's just because it
has a history, right?

306
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:50,020
From the beginning of recorded
history, people used gold as a

307
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,040
medium of exchange, so it's
almost ingrained in our

308
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,690
cultural DNA and that's what
gives it its robustness as a

309
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,490
unit of exchange, but other
than that, it's really no

310
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,110
different than diamonds,
or carbon

311
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,170
