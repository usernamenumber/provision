1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,750
   

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,200
We're on problem 36.

3
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,130
It says which of the following
sentences is true about the

4
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:08,230
graphs of y is equal to 3 times
x minus 5 squared plus 1

5
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:12,270
and y equals 3 times x plus
5 squared plus 1?

6
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,120
So let's do something very
similar to what we did in the

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,430
past. If you think about it,
both of these equations, y is

8
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,090
going to be 1 or greater.

9
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,110
Let's just analyze this
a little bit.

10
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:28,140
This term right here, since
we're squaring, is always

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,170
going to be positive.

12
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,470
Even if what's inside the
parentheses becomes negative,

13
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,030
if we have x is minus 10, inside
the parenthesis becomes

14
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,180
negative, but when
you square it, it

15
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:38,870
always becomes positive.

16
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,810
You're going to multiply 3 times
a positive number, so

17
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,250
you're going to get
a positive number.

18
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,560
So the lowest value that
this could be is 0.

19
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,420
The lowest value that y could
be is actually 1.

20
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,470
The same thing here, this
number can become very

21
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,790
negative, but when you
square it, it's

22
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,070
going to become positive.

23
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,250
So this expression with the
squared here is going to be

24
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,320
positive, and you multiply
it by 3, and

25
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,430
it's going to be positive.

26
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,126
So the lowest value here is
always going to be zero when

27
00:01:05,126 --> 00:01:08,210
you include this whole term.

28
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,160
So similarly, the lowest
value y can be is 1.

29
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,760
I just want to think about it
a little bit just give you a

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,380
little bit of an intuition.

31
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,750
Let's think of this in the
context of what we learned

32
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,282
last time with the shifting.

33
00:01:17,282 --> 00:01:21,390
So let me draw it in a color
that you can see.

34
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,220
So if that is the y-axis, and
I'll just draw mainly the

35
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:34,240
positive area, so if I were to
just draw y is equal to x

36
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,100
squared plus 1, it would look
like this where this is 1.

37
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,120
That's y is equal to 1.

38
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,330
The graph would look something
along this.

39
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,600
y is equal to x squared
plus 1.

40
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,030
That's a horrible drawing.

41
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,790
Normally, I wouldn't redo it,
but that was just atrocious.

42
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,070
y is equal to x squared plus 1
looks something like that.

43
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,540
It's symmetric.

44
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,180
You get the idea.

45
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,890
You've seen these parabolas
before.

46
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,970
This is y is equal to
x squared plus 1.

47
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,720
   

48
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:07,720
Now, if we were to do x minus
5 squared plus 1,

49
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,520
what happens to it?

50
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,190
Well, let me think about it.

51
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,910
What is 3x squared plus 1?

52
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,940
Well, then it just increases
a little bit faster.

53
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,340
So if I were say y equals 3x
squared plus 1, it might look

54
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,860
something like this.

55
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,670
It'll just increase a little
bit faster, three times as

56
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,550
fast actually.

57
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,630
So that would be 3x
squared plus 1.

58
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,590
The rate of increase in both
directions just goes faster

59
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,680
because you have this constant
term 3 out there multiplying

60
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,140
the numbers.

61
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,730
OK, now what happens
when you shift it?

62
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,980
So let's do x minus 5.

63
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:40,830
So where x equals 0 was the
minimum point before, now if

64
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,490
we substitute a 5 here, that'll
be our minimum point.

65
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,470
Because then that whole
term becomes zero.

66
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,785
So this vertex will now be
shifted to the right.

67
00:02:50,785 --> 00:02:53,370
Let me do it in another color.

68
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,560
So if this is the point 5, now
this would be the graph.

69
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,870
If you just took this graph and
you shifted it over to the

70
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:04,240
right by 5-- I won't draw the
whole thing-- that graph right

71
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:10,230
there would be 3 times x
minus 5 squared plus 1.

72
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,990
Remember, the y shift
is always intuitive.

73
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,400
If you add 1, you're
shifting it up.

74
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,250
If you subtract 1, you're
shifting it down.

75
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,100
The x shift isn't.

76
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,800
We subtracted 5, x minus 5.

77
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,080
We replaced x with x minus 5,
but we shifted to the right.

78
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,900
The intuition is there, because
now plus 5 makes this

79
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,980
expression zero.

80
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,590
So that's 3x minus 5 squared.

81
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:34,430
In the same logic, 3 times x
plus 5 squared is going to be

82
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,830
to here, plus 1.

83
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,720
That's going to be shifted
to-- let me pick a good

84
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,740
color-- to the left.

85
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,840
This is going to look
something like this.

86
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,890
It's going to be this blue graph
shifted to the left.

87
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,370
This is minus 5.

88
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:53,670
So this is the graph right
here of 3 times x plus 5

89
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,570
squared plus 1

90
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,810
Now, hopefully, you
have an intuition.

91
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,190
So let's read their statements
and see which one makes sense.

92
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,580
Which of the following
is true?

93
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,500
Their vertices are maximums.
No, that's not

94
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,545
true of any of these.

95
00:04:03,545 --> 00:04:06,610
Because the vertices is that
point right there.

96
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,120
It's actually the
minimum point.

97
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,900
A maximum point would look
something like that.

98
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,540
We know that, because you
just go positive.

99
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,510
This term can only
be positive.

100
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,399
If this was a negative 3, then
it would flip it over.

101
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,220
So it's not choice A.

102
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,820
The graphs have the same shape
with different vertices.

103
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,330
Yeah, both of these graphs have
the shape of 3x squared,

104
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,370
but 1 vertices is 10 to the
left of the other one.

105
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,660
So I think B is our choice.

106
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,860
Let's read the other ones.

107
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,960
The graphs have different
shapes

108
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,610
with different vertices.

109
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,880
No, they have the same shape.

110
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,100
They definitely have
the same shape.

111
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,040
They both have this
3x squared shape.

112
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,580
One graph has a vertex that is
a maximum, while the other

113
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,570
has-- no, that's not right.

114
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,410
They both are upward facing,
so they both

115
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,270
have minimum points.

116
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,710
So it's choice B.

117
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:59,420
Next problem, problem 37.

118
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,530
Let me see what it says.

119
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,965
What are the x-intercepts?

120
00:05:03,965 --> 00:05:05,580
Let me copy and paste that.

121
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,620
   

122
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,530
OK, I'll paste it there.

123
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,080
What are the x-intercepts
of the graph of that?

124
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,190
Well, the x-intercepts, whatever
this graph looks

125
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,850
like, I don't know exactly
what it looks like.

126
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:22,730
   

127
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,470
This graph is going to look
something like this.

128
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,800
I actually have no idea
what it looks like

129
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,540
until I solve it.

130
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,550
It's going to look something
like this.

131
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,820
When they say x-intercepts,
they're like, where does it

132
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,120
intersect the x-axis?

133
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,080
So that's like there
and there.

134
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,180
I don't know if those are the
actual points, right?

135
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,680
To do that, we set the function
equal to zero,

136
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,630
because this is the point
y is equal to 0.

137
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,440
You're essentially saying when
does this function equal zero

138
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,230
because that's the x-axis
when y is equal to 0.

139
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:55,080
So you set y is equal to 0, and
you get 0 is equal to 12x

140
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,030
squared minus 5x minus 2.

141
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:03,260
Whenever I have a coefficient
larger than 1 in front of the

142
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,540
x squared term, I find that very
hard to just eyeball and

143
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,920
factor, so I use the
quadratic equation.

144
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,200
So negative B, this is the B.

145
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,650
B is minus 5.

146
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,310
So negative negative
5 is plus 5.

147
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,720
Negative B plus or minus the
square root of B squared,

148
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:27,530
negative 5 squared is 25, minus
4 times A, which is 12,

149
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,775
times C, which is minus 2.

150
00:06:29,775 --> 00:06:32,440
   

151
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,730
So let's just make that
times plus 2 and put

152
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,600
the plus out there.

153
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,370
A minus times a minus
is a plus.

154
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:42,650
All of that over 2A, all of
that over 24, 2 times A.

155
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:48,440
So that is equal to 5 plus or
minus the square root-- let's

156
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:58,130
see, it was 25 plus 4
times 12 times 2.

157
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,080
Because that was a minus 2,
but we had a minus there

158
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,920
before, so 8 times 12, so
96, all of that over 24.

159
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,830
What's 25 plus 96?

160
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:13,490
It's 121, which is 11 squared.

161
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:21,820
So this becomes 5 plus
or minus 11 over 24.

162
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:26,250
Remember, these are the x-values
where that original

163
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,050
function will equal zero.

164
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,050
It's always important
to remember

165
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,320
what we're even doing.

166
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:36,750
So let's see, if x is equal to
5 plus 11 over 24, that is

167
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,890
equal to 16/24, which
is equal to 2/3.

168
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,850
That's one potential
intercept.

169
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,610
So maybe that's right here.

170
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,500
That's x is equal to 2/3
and y is equal to 0.

171
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,460
The other value is x is equal
to 5 minus 11 over 24.

172
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:00,860
That's minus 6/24, which is
equal to minus 1/4, which

173
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,650
could be this point.

174
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,940
I actually drew the graph
not that far off of

175
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,470
what it could be.

176
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,480
So this would be x is
equal to minus 1/4.

177
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,370
Those are the x-intercepts
of that graph.

178
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:17,240
So 2/3 and minus 1/4 is
choice C on the test.

179
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,700
We have time for at
least one more.

180
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,290
   

181
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,900
Oh boy, they drew us all
these this graphs.

182
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,250
Let me shrink it.

183
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,790
   

184
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,030
I want to be able to
fit all the graphs.

185
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:35,919
So let me copy and paste
their graphs.

186
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,289
So this is one where the
clipboard is definitely going

187
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:41,539
to come in useful.

188
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:52,450
   

189
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,700
OK that's good enough.

190
00:08:53,700 --> 00:09:02,030
   

191
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:05,400
I've never done something
this graphical.

192
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:10,740
So the graph they say is y is
equal to minus 2 times x minus

193
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,640
1 squared plus 1.

194
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,380
So that's what we have
to find the graph of.

195
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,670
   

196
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,220
So immediately when you look
at it, you say, OK, this is

197
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,640
like the same thing as y is
equal to minus 2x squared plus

198
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,970
1, but they shifted the x.

199
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,780
They shifted the x to
the right by 1.

200
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,300
I know it says a minus 1,
but think about it.

201
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:38,470
When x is equal to positive
1, this is equal to 0.

202
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:43,080
So it's going to be shifted
to the right by 1, plus 1.

203
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,870
We know that.

204
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:50,600
We know that it's going to be
shifted up by 1, so up plus 1.

205
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,610
Then we have to think
is it going to be

206
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,110
opening upwards or downwards?

207
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:57,970
Think of it this way: If this
was y is equal to 2x squared

208
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,830
plus 1, then this term would
always be positive.

209
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,780
It'll just become more and
more positive as you get

210
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,680
further and further away from
zero, so it would open up.

211
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,760
But if you put a negative number
there, if you say y is

212
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,630
equal to minus 2x squared
plus 1, then you're

213
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,470
going to open downward.

214
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,760
You're just going to get more
and more negative as you get

215
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,280
away from your vertex.

216
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,565
So we're shifted to the right
by 1, we're shifted up by 1,

217
00:10:20,565 --> 00:10:22,640
and we're going to be
opening downwards.

218
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,050
So if we look at our
choices, only these

219
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,690
two are opening downwards.

220
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:29,410
   

221
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,540
Both of them are shifted
up by 1.

222
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,520
Their vertex is at
y is equal to 1.

223
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,740
But this is shifted 1 to
the right and this is

224
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,380
shifted 1 to the left.

225
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,350
Remember, we said it was
x minus 1 squared.

226
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,370
So the vertex happens
when this whole

227
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:48,070
expression is equal to zero.

228
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:52,370
This whole expression is equal
to zero when x is equal to

229
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,370
positive 1.

230
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,340
So that's right here.

231
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,555
So it's actually choice C.

232
00:10:59,555 --> 00:11:02,580
   

233
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,710
When your shifting graphs, that
can be one of the hardest

234
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,430
things to ingrain.

235
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:09,760
But I just really encourage
you to explore graphs,

236
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,960
practice with graphs with your
graphing calculator and really

237
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,590
try to plot points and try to
get a really good grasp of why

238
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:19,190
when you go from minus 2x
squared plus 1 to minus 2

239
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:22,830
times x minus 1 squared, why
when you replace an x with an

240
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:26,870
minus 1, why this shifts the
graph to the right by 1.

241
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,470
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.

242
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,500
