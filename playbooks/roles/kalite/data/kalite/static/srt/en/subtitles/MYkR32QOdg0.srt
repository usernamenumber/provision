I just realized that I didn't answer a question that might be burning in your brain after watching the

2
00:00:05,921 --> 00:00:11,726
video on life insurance where we talk about term life and whole life because in whole life we talk about

3
00:00:11,726 --> 00:00:16,927
the scenario where you can pay this premium your whole entire life and in the event and you can just

4
00:00:16,927 --> 00:00:25,333
all the way until the day you die so that when you die your family will definitely get the payoff. They

5
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:33,831
will get the $500k upon your death. And we also talked about the scenario where any time before that

6
00:00:33,831 --> 00:00:39,636
you decide that I don't need life insurance anymore, you can stop paying your premium. Your family won't get

7
00:00:39,636 --> 00:00:46,835
the death benefit in the event that you die but you would get the cash payout or whatever is left

8
00:00:46,835 --> 00:00:52,918
after the insurance company has taken their fees and and set aside some for the insurance component of

9
00:00:52,918 --> 00:01:00,116
what they are selling you but the question you might ask is what happens to the cash amount? Because

10
00:01:00,116 --> 00:01:06,525
before you die you can cash it out; if you die, you definitely get the payoff. But what happens to the

11
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:16,045
cash amount? And the answer there is that you don't get it. It's kind of viewed as what is backing up

12
00:01:16,045 --> 00:01:23,244
your death benefit. And what's kind of unfortunate if for whatever reason the cash amount is even larger

13
00:01:23,244 --> 00:01:30,117
than the death benefit. Maybe you lived an unusually long amount of time maybe you lived 50 years and

14
00:01:30,117 --> 00:01:39,451
you're paying... or you live to 90 so you live 50 years from the start of the policy. So you pay $250k

15
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:44,327
but you have to remember compound interest, you're getting returns on that year after year. Maybe this

16
00:01:44,327 --> 00:01:52,733
cash payout becomes $600k when you accrue all the interest and everything else in it. Regardless of that

17
00:01:52,733 --> 00:02:00,256
fact, although, this would be a silly thing for you to do, if you were to die your family would only

18
00:02:00,256 --> 00:02:07,640
get the $500k dollars. Which really makes you ask the question if you know your cash payout is larger

19
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:13,445
than the amount that is going to be paid off when you die, then the best thing to do is just to stop

20
00:02:13,445 --> 00:02:19,436
paying the premium and get the cash payout and give that to your family rather than waiting around to

21
00:02:19,436 --> 00:02:25,937
die. This is worse in 2 ways, first you die, and in the 2nd way, you're getting less money. Just to answer y

22
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:34,715
our question, in the event of your death, your family does not see the savings portion, they only get this payout right over here.
