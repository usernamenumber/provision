What I want to do in this video

2
00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:03,537
is give you a bunch of properties of limits

3
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:05,444
and we're not going to prove it rigorously here -

4
00:00:05,444 --> 00:00:07,102
- in order to have the rigorous proof of these properties

5
00:00:07,102 --> 00:00:09,409
we need a rigorous definition of what a limit is

6
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:11,035
and we're not doing that in this tutorial -

7
00:00:11,035 --> 00:00:14,634
- we'll do that in the tutorial on the epsilon-delta definition of limit -

8
00:00:14,634 --> 00:00:17,085
- but most of these should be fairly intuitive

9
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:19,680
and they're very helpful for simplifying limit problems

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,934
in the future

11
00:00:20,934 --> 00:00:24,144
So let's say we know that the limit of some function

12
00:00:24,144 --> 00:00:28,824
f(x) as x approaches c is equal to L

13
00:00:28,824 --> 00:00:32,533
and let's say that we also know that the limit of some

14
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:36,279
other function, let's say g(x), as x approaches c

15
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:38,976
is equal to M

16
00:00:38,976 --> 00:00:42,403
Now, given that, what would be the limit

17
00:00:42,403 --> 00:00:49,034
of f(x) plus g(x) as x approaches c?

18
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,621
Well, and you could look at this visually

19
00:00:51,621 --> 00:00:53,812
- if you look at the graphs of two arbitrary functions

20
00:00:53,812 --> 00:00:55,334
you essentially just add those two functions -

21
00:00:55,334 --> 00:00:57,993
it'll be pretty clear that this is going to be equal to -

22
00:00:57,993 --> 00:00:59,498
- and once again, I'm not doing a rigorous proof;

23
00:00:59,498 --> 00:01:01,796
I'm just really giving you the properties here -

24
00:01:01,796 --> 00:01:06,386
- this is going to be the limit of f(x) as x approaches c

25
00:01:06,386 --> 00:01:11,537
plus the limit of g(x) as x approaches c

26
00:01:11,537 --> 00:01:15,098
which is equal to - well, this right over here is -

27
00:01:15,098 --> 00:01:16,799
(we'll do that in that same color)

28
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,321
- this right here is just equal to L: it's going to be equal

29
00:01:21,321 --> 00:01:27,794
to L plus M - this right over here is equal to M

30
00:01:27,794 --> 00:01:28,962
Not too difficult

31
00:01:28,962 --> 00:01:32,029
This is often called the Sum Rule

32
00:01:32,029 --> 00:01:35,160
or the Sum Property of Limits

33
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,886
and we could come up with a very similar one

34
00:01:36,886 --> 00:01:44,094
with differences - the limit as x approaches c of f(x) minus g(x)

35
00:01:44,094 --> 00:01:47,226
is just going to be L minus M

36
00:01:47,226 --> 00:01:49,399
It's just the limit of f(x) as x approaches c

37
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:52,393
minus the limit of g(x) as x approaches c

38
00:01:52,393 --> 00:01:55,697
So it's just going to be L minus...

39
00:01:55,697 --> 00:01:58,693
L minus M

40
00:01:58,693 --> 00:02:00,495
It's often called the Difference Rule

41
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,634
or the Difference Property of Limits

42
00:02:02,634 --> 00:02:04,427
and these once again are very, very (hopefully)

43
00:02:04,427 --> 00:02:06,560
reasonably intuitive

44
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,822
Now what happens if you take the product of the functions?

45
00:02:08,822 --> 00:02:17,027
The limit of f(x) times g(x) as x approaches c?

46
00:02:17,027 --> 00:02:19,005
Well, lucky for us this is going to be equal to

47
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:28,360
the limit of f(x) as x approaches c times the limit of g(x) as x approaches c

48
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,760
Lucky for us, this is kind of a fairly intuitive property of limits

49
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,191
So in this case this is just going to be equal to -

50
00:02:34,191 --> 00:02:38,764
- this is L times M

51
00:02:38,764 --> 00:02:40,493
L times...

52
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:44,203
...this is just going to L times M

53
00:02:44,203 --> 00:02:47,205
Same thing, if instead of having a function here we had a constant

54
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:50,226
So if we just had the limit -

55
00:02:50,226 --> 00:02:51,760
(I'll do that in the same color)

56
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:58,564
- the limit of k times f(x) as x approaches c

57
00:02:58,564 --> 00:02:59,901
where k is just some constant

58
00:02:59,901 --> 00:03:03,230
This is going to be the same thing as k times the limit

59
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:08,653
of f(x) as x approaches c and that is just equal to...

60
00:03:08,653 --> 00:03:11,738
...this is just equal to L...

61
00:03:11,738 --> 00:03:13,828
This is equal to L, so this whole thing

62
00:03:13,828 --> 00:03:17,501
simplifies to k times...

63
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:20,029
...k times L

64
00:03:20,029 --> 00:03:22,433
And we can do the same thing with the differences -

65
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:25,255
- this is often called the Constant Multiple Property -

66
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:27,925
- we can do the same thing with the differences

67
00:03:27,925 --> 00:03:31,512
So if we have the limit as x approaches c

68
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:35,636
of f(x) divided by g(x), this is the exact

69
00:03:35,636 --> 00:03:40,432
same thing as the limit of f(x) as x approaches c

70
00:03:40,432 --> 00:03:46,361
divided by the limit of g(x) as x approaches c

71
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:48,440
which is going to be equal to -

72
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,433
- I think you get it now -

73
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:56,628
- this is going to be equal to L over M

74
00:03:56,628 --> 00:03:59,233
And finally - this is sometimes called the Quotient Property -

75
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:01,961
- finally, we'll look at the Exponent Property

76
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:03,493
So if I have...

77
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,493
...if I have the limit of -

78
00:04:06,493 --> 00:04:07,628
- let me write it this way -

79
00:04:07,628 --> 00:04:09,787
- of f(x) to some power

80
00:04:09,787 --> 00:04:10,561
- and actually let me even

81
00:04:10,561 --> 00:04:11,709
write it as a fractional power -

82
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,162
to the r over s power,

83
00:04:13,162 --> 00:04:15,495
where both r and s are integers -

84
00:04:15,495 --> 00:04:18,901
then the limit of f(x) to the r over s power

85
00:04:18,901 --> 00:04:24,756
as x approaches c is going to be the exact same

86
00:04:24,756 --> 00:04:31,828
thing as the limit of f(x) as x approaches c

87
00:04:31,828 --> 00:04:33,731
raised to the r over s power

88
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,694
once again, when r and s are both integers

89
00:04:35,694 --> 00:04:38,366
and s is not equal to zero, otherwise this exponent

90
00:04:38,366 --> 00:04:40,094
would not make much sense

91
00:04:40,094 --> 00:04:41,660
and this is the same thing...

92
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,368
...this is the same thing as L...

93
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:47,028
...this is the same thing as L to the r over s power

94
00:04:47,028 --> 00:04:49,893
This is equal to L to the...

95
00:04:49,893 --> 00:04:54,590
...L to the r over s power

96
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,592
So, using these we can actually find the limit

97
00:04:56,592 --> 00:04:58,927
of many, many, many things and what's neat about it

98
00:04:58,927 --> 00:05:01,763
is the properties of limits kind of are the things that

99
00:05:01,763 --> 00:05:03,510
you would naturally want to do and if you

100
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,925
graph some of these functions actually it

101
00:05:04,925 --> 00:05:08,000
turns out to be quite intuitive
