1
00:00:00,733 --> 00:00:03,000
Some of you might be wondering

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,533
Why are we even worried about this drake equation?

3
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:09,225
Or why are we even tempted to go through

4
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:10,800
this thought experiment of the number of

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,933
detectable civilizations in the galaxy,

6
00:00:12,933 --> 00:00:15,079
when we dont have a clue of some of these

7
00:00:15,079 --> 00:00:16,333
assumptions. We dont know what

8
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:18,744
fraction of planets capable of sustaining life

9
00:00:18,744 --> 00:00:22,077
actually do generate life. We dont know of all of

10
00:00:22,077 --> 00:00:24,900
the planets that have life what fraction of those

11
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,800
planets go on to have intelligent life and what

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,154
fraction of those civilizations go on to using

13
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:32,300
electromagnetic radiation as a form of

14
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,810
communication. We don't know these answers.

15
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,600
In fact, we probably won't know some of

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,467
these answers for some time.

17
00:00:38,467 --> 00:00:40,133
So what's the point of going through this

18
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:43,400
exercise? And that is a valid point of view.

19
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,533
The drake equation or even this little equation that

20
00:00:45,533 --> 00:00:48,000
we have set up here, it's not an equation in the

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,267
traditional sense where we can immediately apply

22
00:00:50,267 --> 00:00:52,467
it to some engineering problem or some physical

23
00:00:52,467 --> 00:00:55,000
problem or anything like that. I view it

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,600
more as a bit of a thought experiment.

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,333
And what's interesting about it is that

26
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,667
it can kinda structure our thought around the

27
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:03,533
problem and I think that's where it has

28
00:01:03,533 --> 00:01:05,133
the most value.

29
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:07,000
We'll probably not get a solid number

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,800
on this any time soon, but it does lead

31
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,400
us to thinking about these interesting problems

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,533
of what does it mean or what do we think has

33
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:19,133
to happen for a planet to start getting life

34
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:20,933
even if it has all the right ingredients?

35
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:23,667
Then what does it mean for things to eventually get

36
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:26,133
to the point that you have intelligent life?

37
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:28,467
You know, in all fairness to this, is

38
00:01:28,467 --> 00:01:30,425
that probably two hundred years ago there

39
00:01:30,425 --> 00:01:32,575
would have been no way to even have

40
00:01:32,575 --> 00:01:34,682
a decent estimate of the number of

41
00:01:34,682 --> 00:01:36,948
stars in the galaxy. Now we are starting to

42
00:01:36,948 --> 00:01:39,333
do an okay job on that. 20 to 30 years ago

43
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,333
it would have been viewed impossible to say

44
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:43,733
the fraction of stars that have planets, but

45
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:46,067
now we are finding exoplanets. We are seeing

46
00:01:46,067 --> 00:01:47,733
stars wobble. We are finding we are getting

47
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,533
more and more accurate instruments.

48
00:01:49,533 --> 00:01:51,333
So we can start to think about planets that are

49
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:55,000
closer to the size of earth so we are even making

50
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,733
headway there. There are other indirect

51
00:01:57,733 --> 00:01:59,800
methods to think about: You know, some of these

52
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,733
exoplanets look like they're in the right zone and

53
00:02:01,733 --> 00:02:03,267
they look like they have the right chemical

54
00:02:03,267 --> 00:02:05,000
signature based on other information

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,800
that we are getting that maybe they are

56
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,667
capable of sustaining life.

57
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:10,467
So as time goes on and as technology

58
00:02:10,467 --> 00:02:12,400
improves we might get better and better at

59
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,333
this. With that said, it's not going to happen

60
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,533
any time soon and the real value of all this

61
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:19,800
is really to structure our thoughts

62
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,000
about really a super interesting topic.

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,800
Now the other thing I want to talk about is

64
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,000
a slight clarification of what I talked about

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,467
in the last video. In the last video for this L

66
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:33,000
I said it's the civilization's lifespan, but

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,067
what's actually relevant is the lifespan of

68
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:42,000
the civilization while it is detectable. So detectable.

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,067
So, it doesn't matter if the civilization

70
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:46,800
is around a hundred thousand years,

71
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,733
but it's not releasing any type of thing that

72
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:50,467
we can detect. That's not what we care about.

73
00:02:50,467 --> 00:02:53,933
We care about the 5,000 years or the 10,000

74
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:56,400
years or the 100,000 years when they

75
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,533
are actually using some type of communications

76
00:02:58,533 --> 00:03:01,267
or some type of electromagnetic radiation

77
00:03:01,267 --> 00:03:04,667
that we can eventually detect once those things

78
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:07,133
reach us. Now the other thing I want to make

79
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:09,333
clear is we're talking about the number of

80
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,600
detectable civilizations in the galaxy right

81
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,400
now. And I will write now in quotation marks

82
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,733
because we're not talking about a

83
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:20,733
civilization that is maybe even a peer civilization

84
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:24,667
with us that developed radio communication

85
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:26,867
on the order of a hundred years ago because

86
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:29,467
frankly, they would have to be no more than

87
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:31,067
a hundred light years away for us to

88
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:32,667
be able to detect those signals now.

89
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:34,200
If they were on the other side of the galaxy,

90
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,733
we wouldn't be able to detect their signal

91
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:38,667
for another tens of thousands of years.

92
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:41,133
So when I talk about now, I am saying that the

93
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:43,933
signals are getting to us. Signals getting

94
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:50,733
Signals recieved. The signals are being received

95
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:54,267
right now. So you could have a civilization

96
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:57,867
that developed radio seventy thousand

97
00:03:57,867 --> 00:03:59,867
years ago, but they are seventy thousand light

98
00:03:59,867 --> 00:04:01,600
years away and maybe they collapsed

99
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,333
ten thousand years later, but we are just

100
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,467
receiving their first radio signal.

101
00:04:06,467 --> 00:04:09,800
So that would be a civilization that I would count

102
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,667
in this equation that we are setting up.

103
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:15,067
So just to make sure that we understand

104
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:17,333
it and then we can play with some numbers, let's

105
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,267
remind ourselves. This is the number of

106
00:04:19,267 --> 00:04:21,533
our estimate of the number of stars

107
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:23,533
in the galaxy. Multiplied by this, you now

108
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:25,800
know the number of stars in the galaxy

109
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,667
that have planets. You multiply

110
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,800
by this N sub P (the average number

111
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,667
of planets capable of sustaining life) and these

112
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:34,667
first three terms will give you

113
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:43,000
the total number of planets in the galaxy

114
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,867
that have been capable of sustaining life

115
00:04:45,867 --> 00:04:49,200
at some point in their history. Multiply it by this.

116
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,852
This is the number of planets in

117
00:04:51,852 --> 00:04:54,533
the galaxy that have sustained actual life.

118
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:55,800
Not just capability of it. They actually had

119
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,333
life on them at some point in their history.

120
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,467
Multiply it by this. This is the fraction

121
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,600
that have developed intelligent life on these

122
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,667
planets. The number of planets with

123
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:06,467
intelligent life at some point in their history.

124
00:05:06,467 --> 00:05:08,667
Multiply it by this fraction.

125
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:10,533
All of these terms, you have the

126
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:12,667
number of planets in the galaxy that have had

127
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:16,400
intelligent life that became detectable, that

128
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,067
started emitting some type of radio signature

129
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:20,467
We don't know, some type of thing like that

130
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:24,200
at some point in their history

131
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,867
So over here, all of these first six terms

132
00:05:27,867 --> 00:05:30,400
tell us the number of detectable civilizations

133
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,667
that occured at some point in the history

134
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:35,333
of the stars, the solar systems, the planets that

135
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,600
are out there right now. But, we care

136
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,605
about the ones that are detectable now.

137
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:41,333
We don't care about the ones that came and

138
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,667
went and their radio signature went past us

139
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:46,733
while we were still living in caves or we were

140
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:48,133
hunter-gatherers. We care about the ones that

141
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:50,933
their radio signatures are recieving us now.

142
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,533
And that's why we have this little term right

143
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:58,600
over here. So this is the length of the detectable

144
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,800
civilization, so while they were actually releasing a

145
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,400
radio signature divided by the life of that

146
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,333
planet or that solar system or that star

147
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,667
So for any given star or planet that

148
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:12,533
meets all of these criteria. whats the

149
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:15,333
probability that it's releasing its....

150
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:19,133
So at some point in the history there was a

151
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:21,400
detectable civilization or more that was

152
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,867
releasing some type of a radio signature.

153
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:26,467
But, what's the probability that it's doing it right now?

154
00:06:26,467 --> 00:06:29,533
So that's the detectable lifespan of that

155
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:34,067
civilization divided by the life of that solar

156
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:35,867
system or that planet because frankly,

157
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:38,333
the star and the solar system and

158
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,800
the planet are all going to essentially have

159
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,333
give or take, a few hundreds of thousands

160
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,267
of years or even a few millions of years

161
00:06:43,267 --> 00:06:44,800
because we are thinking in the billions here.

162
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,333
They're going to have roughly the same life span.

163
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:51,400
And so if you have let's say, and

164
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,933
just to make this a little bit more

165
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:58,333
tangible, lets say the sun has a lifespan and

166
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,267
lets say that with the Earth and our solar system

167
00:07:00,267 --> 00:07:02,733
has a lifespan of approximately ten billion years.

168
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:05,533
Ten billion years.

169
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:09,867
And let's say that us as humans,

170
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,800
let me be pretty optimistic about it.

171
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,667
Let's say that we are detectable as

172
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:17,733
a civilization for one million years. So we

173
00:07:17,733 --> 00:07:19,933
have our best days ahead of us.

174
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:23,667
So we are detectable for one million years.

175
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:25,867
So this term right over here will be

176
00:07:25,867 --> 00:07:28,267
1 million over 10 billion.

177
00:07:28,267 --> 00:07:31,733
So this will be 1 over 10 thousand.

178
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:33,867
So even though we might be around

179
00:07:33,867 --> 00:07:36,200
sending out detactable signals for a million

180
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,667
years, the odds relative to the entire span

181
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:48,733
of the history of the planet and our sun,

182
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:51,867
if someone is just randomly sampling our

183
00:07:51,867 --> 00:07:55,533
solar system at a random time in its history and a

184
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:57,400
random part of this ten billion years, there is only

185
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,533
a one in ten thousand chance that

186
00:07:59,533 --> 00:08:03,267
they will be sampling us at a time that we are

187
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:04,867
releasing signals. Assuming that there weren't

188
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:07,733
any other civilizations on Mars or Venus or

189
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:10,533
that there weren't any other civilizations on Earth

190
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:12,600
hundreds of thousands of years ago

191
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,733
that were doing this, they would definitely

192
00:08:14,733 --> 00:08:16,667
only have a one in ten thousand chance of

193
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:18,600
detecting us assuming that they are sampling

194
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,533
There could have been a civilization that

195
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,067
was around three million years ago and they

196
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:26,067
did this whole search for extraterrestrial life and

197
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:28,933
maybe they are twenty or a hundred or a thousand

198
00:08:28,933 --> 00:08:31,200
light years away and they pointed their telescopes

199
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,800
at us, but a million or two million years ago they

200
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,667
would have pointed it at the direction of our sun

201
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:37,533
and they would have not gotten any radio

202
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:39,533
signals and they are like "Man, when is this

203
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:41,333
extraterrestrial life going to show up?"

204
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,800
Even though the sun and Earth does

205
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,667
eventually develop us, they weren't

206
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:47,933
able to observe us because when they

207
00:08:47,933 --> 99:59:59,999
sampled was outside of that 1 in 10,000 window.
