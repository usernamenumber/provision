00:00:04,843 --> 00:00:10,550
We're in the Brera, in Milan and we're looking at an important early Raphael

2
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:15,482
Raphael is in his early twenties when he paints this and the subject is the marriage of the virgin

3
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:19,458
and it's taken from a book called the Golden Legend

4
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:25,362
now, this is a medival book, it basically tries to fill in all the missing stories in the Bible

5
00:00:25,362 --> 00:00:28,099
Now, when you think about this deeply religious Christian culture

6
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:32,669
they looked at the Bible to understand the secret story but there're so many omissions

7
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:36,908
there're so many things that are missing that people created the glue that tied the stories together.

8
00:00:36,908 --> 00:00:41,046
And that's what's collected in the book we know today as The Golden Legend.

9
00:00:41,046 --> 00:00:45,150
So this story is about the marriage of the virgin Mary to Saint Joseph

10
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:50,888
and that story says, that there're number of people that want to marry Mary

11
00:00:50,888 --> 00:00:54,399
..many suitors.. and each of these suitors had a rod

12
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,763
and that she would be married to the one whose rod flowered,

13
00:00:58,763 --> 00:01:01,197
miraculously flowered, needless to say.

14
00:01:01,197 --> 00:01:06,816
And so they went to the temple and the man whose rod flowered was Joseph

15
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:12,412
and we can see that in this painting - Joseph who's got that wonderful yellow drape over his shoulder and

16
00:01:12,412 --> 00:01:17,182
around his waist is putting a ring tenderly on the virgin Mary's finger

17
00:01:17,182 --> 00:01:21,920
and he holds in his left hand a rod that indeed has leaves at its end

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,759
and there are other suitors behind him, you can see, have rod without flowers on the end.

19
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,697
And one suitor in front is annoyed, decided to brake the rod on the knee.

20
00:01:32,697 --> 00:01:40,315
There's wonderful human narrative quality here. This is not just sacred event, that really is an acting it before us as a kind of performance.

21
00:01:40,315 --> 00:01:45,642
And so right in center we have a priest marrying Mary and Joseph

22
00:01:45,642 --> 00:01:53,951
and the painting is so symmetrical in so many ways with that temple behind and this rationally constructed perspective space

23
00:01:53,951 --> 00:01:59,623
and that priest is in the middle between Mary and Joseph, tits his head little bit so he's just off centre.

24
00:01:59,623 --> 00:02:04,066
In fact there's little bit of the chaos of the crowd that people're moving this way ahead

25
00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:06,565
The people're refocusing here and there.

26
00:02:06,565 --> 00:02:14,040
This painting is often compared to an early renaissance painting by Raphael's teacher Perugino "The Giving of the Keys to Saint Peter"

27
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:20,846
and you can begin to see here in this early work by Raphael indications of what we understand now

28
00:02:20,846 --> 00:02:27,983
as the high renaissance style as opposed to the kind of stiffness of the 15th century of the early renaissance.

29
00:02:27,983 --> 00:02:32,399
Raphael I guess has figures who seem to move very easily and elegantly.

30
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:37,564
So, make no mistake, this is painting that is to clearly ??? to Perugino, why?

31
00:02:37,564 --> 00:02:41,965
I think you're absolutely right, Raphel is beginning to step out of his master shadow.

32
00:02:41,965 --> 00:02:51,010
He signed the painting, if you look very closely the front of temple it says "Raphael vrbinas" - Raphael from Urbino.

33
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,899
And there is a beautiful sense of elegance, especially in the version of Mary,

34
00:02:55,899 --> 00:03:01,287
she is painted so tenderly and she stands in a lovely counterpose though, tilts her head down.

35
00:03:01,287 --> 00:03:08,160
It's that typical Raphael's sweetness. So whereas the early renaissance so often was trying to reveal

36
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,983
the truths of what we see of the world that we live in, here there's an attempt to perfect

37
00:03:12,983 --> 00:03:18,371
to create that kind of balanced harmony as representation of ideal heavenly place.

38
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:24,608
Ideal beauty, perfection, harmony are qualities associated with the high renaissance

39
00:03:24,608 --> 00:03:30,581
and we see that in background of this painting. If we follow the linio perspective system

40
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:37,356
and we track the ??? created by those paving stones behind the freezed figures in the front

41
00:03:37,356 --> 00:03:43,093
we see a centrally planned temple in the background a form that was considered ideal

42
00:03:43,093 --> 00:03:48,900
by the architects and artists of the high renaissance, we can think of ??? for example and his Tempietto.

43
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:56,706
It's a spectacular building and I love the way that the lining perspective leads her eye back, they passed the freezed figure in the foreground

44
00:03:56,706 --> 00:04:00,344
and then our eyes are allowed to move around that arcade

45
00:04:00,344 --> 00:04:05,116
that's occupied by those smaller figures, but then my eye goes back

46
00:04:05,116 --> 00:04:09,789
to the doorway and then through the building to the doorway on its far side

47
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:14,024
and to the sky that's revealed beyond even that

48
00:04:14,024 --> 00:04:19,830
and there is that diminishment of the scale of the one doorway and then the further doorway

49
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:23,602
giving us a real sense of the completeness of this space.

50
00:04:23,602 --> 00:04:30,741
There's real love of creating an illusion of space an the way that the sizes of the figure shift

51
00:04:30,741 --> 00:04:35,946
as we move further back in the space we have this real harmony here that I think is really typical

52
00:04:35,946 --> 00:04:41,732
of the high renaissance between the architecture and figures, where one ennobles and the other were

53
00:04:41,732 --> 00:04:47,399
one as ideal and perfect as the other, it's this high renaissance moment,

54
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:53,679
although very beginnings. And of course we're looking with high insight to what will happened.
