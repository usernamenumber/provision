1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,390
   

2
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,650
Let's review a bit of what we
learned in the last video.

3
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,760
If I have some linear
transformation that's a

4
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,750
mapping from rn to rn, and if
we're dealing with standard

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,750
coordinates, that transformation
-- applied to

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,530
some vector x in standard
cooridenties -- will be equal

7
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,740
to the matrix a times x.

8
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,220
So let me write this down.

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:29,730
If we are dealing with standard
coordinates-- So I

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,350
have x in standard
coordinates .

11
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:36,210
If I apply the transformation,
that is equivalent to

12
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,770
multiplying x by a.

13
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,730
If I multiply x by a then
I'm going to get the

14
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,220
transformation of x in
standard corodinates.

15
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,340
This is a world that we're
very, very familiar with.

16
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,220
Now, let's say that we have
an alternate basis to rn.

17
00:00:54,220 --> 00:01:02,860
So let's say that b is equal to
v1, v2, all the way to vn.

18
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,370
So it has n linearly independent
vectors.

19
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:12,310
Let's say b is a basis for rn.

20
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,840
So it's a basis for rn, but
it's a nonstandard basis.

21
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,880
These aren't just our standard
basis vectors.

22
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,760
So b is a basis for rn.

23
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,980
And let's say that c , which
just has these guys as it's

24
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:32,210
column vectors, v1, v2, all the
way to vn , is the change

25
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:44,710
of basis matrix for
the basis b.

26
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,800
Now, we've learned -- we've
seen this several times

27
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:53,750
already -- that if I have some
vector x in rn represented in

28
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,310
b coordinates, or in coordinates
with respect to b,

29
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:01,310
I can multiply it by the change
of basis matrix and

30
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,520
then I'll get just the standard
coordinates for x.

31
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,270
Or, if you multiply both sides
of this equation by c inverse,

32
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,760
you can get -- And, if I start
with the standard coordinates

33
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,710
for x , I can multiply it by c
inverse and then I can get the

34
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,140
b coordinates for x, or the
alternate nonstandard

35
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,710
coordinates for x.

36
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,810
So we've seen both
of these before.

37
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,430
So let's apply that to this
little diagram here.

38
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,300
So if I want to get x and if
I wanted to write it in

39
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,980
nonstandard coordinates,
what do I do?

40
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:39,400
Well, if I have x, and if I want
to write it, what do I

41
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,710
multiply it by if I want to go
to nonstandard coordinates?

42
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,410
Well, I multiply it
by c inverse.

43
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:49,140
If I multiply it by c inverse--
Whatever I write

44
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:49,840
next to this line.

45
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,370
You could say, what matrix do
you have to multiply by to get

46
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,310
to the other end point
on your line?

47
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:03,380
So I multiply x by c inverse
then I get the b

48
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,490
coordinates for x.

49
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:20,920
So these are coordinates
with respect to b.

50
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,480
I could do the same thing here
with the transformation of x.

51
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,910
This is just the standard
representation of the

52
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,000
transformation of x.

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,100
So I could multiply it by c
inverse if we want to go in

54
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,030
that direction.

55
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,650
And then we're going to get
the transformation of x

56
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,490
represented in b coordinates.

57
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:44,580
Now, in the last video what we
saw was, hey, why do these

58
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,250
separately?

59
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,730
Maybe there is some matrix --
and we found out what it is --

60
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,850
maybe there's some matrix d that
if we multiply this guy

61
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,760
times it, I can go straight from
the b coordinates of x to

62
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,290
the b coordinates of the
transformation of x.

63
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,600
And we said that is matrix d.

64
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,400
And in that last video we
showed that d can be

65
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,090
represented by a-- Actually you
could go around the circle

66
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,060
and rederive it, if you like.

67
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,200
But we found out that -- let me
write in another color --

68
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,810
that d is equal to c inverse
times a times c.

69
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,270
Now, this is all a review of
everything that we learned in

70
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:22,750
the last video.

71
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,070
Hopefully, it clarified things
up a little bit.

72
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,750
It's nice to just realize that
these are just alternate ways

73
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,910
of doing the same thing.

74
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,440
Both of these are the
transformation.

75
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,650
When you multiply by a you're
applying the same

76
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,440
transformation when
you multiply by d.

77
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,030
You're just doing it in a
different coordinate system.

78
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,610
Different coordinate systems
are just different ways of

79
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,350
representing the same vector.

80
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:49,020
This and this are different
labels for the same vector.

81
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,510
This and this are different
labels for the same vector.

82
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:56,990
So these are both performing
the transformation d.

83
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,280
Now, this was a relation we
got in the last video.

84
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,300
That if we have our change of
basis matrix, we have it's

85
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:09,190
inverse, and we have just our
standard basis linear

86
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,460
transformation matrix, we're
able to get this.

87
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,970
Let's see if we can
go the other way.

88
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,440
If we have d, can
we solved for a?

89
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,900
Well, if you multiply both sides
of this equation on the

90
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:24,280
right by c inverse, you get dc
inverse is equal to c inverse

91
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,150
acc inverse.

92
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,940
I just put a c inverse on the
right-hand side of both sides

93
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,890
of this equation.

94
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,300
This is going to be the
identity matrix, so

95
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,780
we can ignore it.

96
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,800
And then let's multiply both
sides on the left by c.

97
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,690
So then you get cdc inverse
is equal to cc inverse a.

98
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,830
And this is going to be
the identity matrix.

99
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:50,520
And then you're left with a is
equal to c times d c inverse.

100
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,040
Which is another interesting
result.

101
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,380
It's another thing to
put in our tool kit.

102
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,460
Now, everything I've been doing

103
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,070
has been fairly abstract.

104
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,880
Let's actually apply some of
these principles with a real

105
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,590
concrete example.

106
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:11,310
So let's say that I have a
transformation T -- I'll keep

107
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,900
these guys around just because
they might be useful -- that

108
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,270
is a mapping from R2 to R2.

109
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:22,150
And let's say that the
transformation matrix for T,

110
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:27,580
so let's say that T of x in
standard coordinates, is equal

111
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:38,360
to the matrix 3, 2, minus 2,
minus 2, minus 2 times x.

112
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,080
In the example we just said,
this would be our

113
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,230
transformation matrix with
respect to the standard basis.

114
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,750
And we could call that
a right there.

115
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,525
Now let's say we have some
alternate basis.

116
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:52,110
   

117
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:58,720
So alternate R2 basis.

118
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,680
Let's call that b, because
we've been

119
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,400
calling it b so far.

120
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,470
And let's say this alternate
R2 basis is

121
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:11,600
vectors 1, 2 and 2, 1.

122
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,140
So let's see, given this
alternate basis, whether we

123
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,280
can come up for a transformation
matrix in that

124
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,660
coordinate world.

125
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:31,090
So we're looking for some matrix
d such that, if I apply

126
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:40,490
my transformation to x and b
coordinates, or in coordinates

127
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:44,410
with respect to this alternate
basis, it should be equal to

128
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,860
this matrix.

129
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:54,390
It should be equal to d times
x in the v coordinates.

130
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,950
So this is what I'm
looking for.

131
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,860
I'm looking for that.

132
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,370
Or, if we go back to our
diagram, I'm looking for that.

133
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,690
You give me x and b coordinates
and you multiply

134
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,020
it by d, and I'm going to give
you the transformation of x

135
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,280
and b coordiniates.

136
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,830
Now, just applying it to this
concrete example here.

137
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,230
We have this formula
right here.

138
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,000
This is the formula
for d, which we

139
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,320
proved in the last video.

140
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,650
So we have to figure
out c inverse.

141
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:22,610
So what is the change of
basis matrix for b.

142
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,770
I want to leave this up here.

143
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:37,865
So change of basis matrix for b
is just going to be -- let's

144
00:08:37,865 --> 00:08:38,730
just call it c.

145
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:42,539
And it's going to be the basis
vectors for b's within the

146
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:45,820
columns so 1, 2 and 2, 1.

147
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,835
And then we're going to want
to figure out it's inverse.

148
00:08:47,835 --> 00:08:50,780
So let's figure out it's
determinant first. So the

149
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:55,490
determinate of c is equal to
1 times 1 minus 2 times 2.

150
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:58,340
So 1 minus 4 is minus 3.

151
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,950
And so c inverse is going to
be equal to 1 over the

152
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,070
determinent.

153
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:07,410
1 over minus 3 or minus
1/3 times -- We

154
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,550
switch these two guys.

155
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,170
So we switched the 1 and the 1,
and then we make these two

156
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,610
guys negative minus
2, minus 2.

157
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,230
That is c inverse.

158
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:22,160
So this d vector right here is
going to be equal to c inverse

159
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,830
times a times the transformation
matrix with

160
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,820
respect to the standard
basis times c.

161
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,070
Let me write it down here.

162
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,410
   

163
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:39,740
So the d that we're looking for
is going to be equal to c

164
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,970
inverse times a times c.

165
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:51,170
Which is equal to-- c inverse
is minus 1/3 times 1 minus 2

166
00:09:51,170 --> 00:10:00,570
minus 2, 1 times a -- Let me do
this in a different color,

167
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,200
I like to switch colors.

168
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,770
So c inverse times a -- a is
right there -- times 3 minus

169
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:12,330
2, 2 minus 2 times c.

170
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,820
c is right there.

171
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,300
I'll do it in yellow.

172
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:20,410
Times c, which is 1,
2 and then 2, 1.

173
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,880
Let's do this piece by piece.

174
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,870
Let's work through this.

175
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,170
So what is this piece going
to be equal to?

176
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,850
We have a 2 by 2
times a 2 by 2.

177
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,730
That's going to give us
another 2 by 2 matrix.

178
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,980
So this first term right here is
going to be 3 times 1 plus

179
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,200
minus 2 times 2.

180
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,025
So 3, 3 minus 4.

181
00:10:40,025 --> 00:10:42,160
So it's going to be
minus 1, right?

182
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,490
3 times 1 plus minus
2 times 2.

183
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,130
Right, it's minus 1.

184
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:51,490
Then you have 3 times 2, which
is 6, minus 2 times 1.

185
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:53,330
So that is 4.

186
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,480
3 times 2 minus 2 is 4.

187
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,130
And then when you go down
here, 2 times 1

188
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,740
minus 2 times 2.

189
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,920
That's 2 minus 4.

190
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,630
That's minus 2.

191
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,860
And then 2 times 2 is
4 minus 2 times 1.

192
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,610
So 4 minus 2 is just 2.

193
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:14,990
So our matrix d is going to be
equal to minus 1/3 times this

194
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:19,560
guy -- 1 minus 2 minus 2, 1 --
times this guy, which was just

195
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,030
the product of those
two matrices.

196
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,320
Now let's figure out
what this is.

197
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,760
If I take the product of these
two guys it's going to be

198
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,850
another 2 by 2 matrix.

199
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:31,210
So 1 times minus 1.

200
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:37,560
which is minus 1, plus minus
2 times minus 2--

201
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,700
So let me be sure.

202
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:44,130
So minus 2 times minus 2
is 4, and then 1 times

203
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,440
minus 1 is minus 1.

204
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,060
So it's going to be 3.

205
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,130
And then we go to
the next term.

206
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:56,700
We have 1 times 4 plus
minus 2 times 2.

207
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,130
So that's 4 minus
4, which is 0.

208
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:05,200
And then we have minus 2 times
minus 1 which is 2 plus 1

209
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,750
times minus 2.

210
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,710
So that is 0.

211
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:12,600
And then finally, we have minus
2 times 4, which is

212
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,230
minus 8, right?

213
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,175
Plus 1 times 2.

214
00:12:18,175 --> 00:12:21,470
So minus 8 -- minus 2 times
4 is minus 8 --

215
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:24,150
plus 2 is minus 6.

216
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:27,230
And all that times minus 1/3.

217
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:30,950
So this is going to be equal
to-- 3 times minus 1/3 is

218
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,030
minus 1 --0 and then 0.

219
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:39,460
Minus 6 times minus 1/3 is 2.

220
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:47,410
So d is now our transformation
matrix with respect

221
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:51,020
to the basis b.

222
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,550
So we were able to figure
it out just applying

223
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,490
this formula here.

224
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:59,570
Now, what happens -- Actually
I'll save that

225
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,350
for the next video.

226
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,155
Where we actually show
that it works.

227
00:13:02,155 --> 00:13:04,800
   

228
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,440
We can actually take some
vectors x, apply the

229
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,420
transformation or apply the
change of coordinates, get to

230
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,000
this, and then apply d.

231
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,300
And then maybe we could go up
that way, multiply by c to get

232
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:15,715
the transformation.

233
00:13:15,715 --> 00:13:17,410
It's going to be equivalent
to a.

234
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,490
I'll do that in the
next video.

235
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:19,600
