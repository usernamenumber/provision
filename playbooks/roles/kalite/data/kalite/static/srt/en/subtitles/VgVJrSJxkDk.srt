1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
   

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,240
Let's learn a little bit
about sequences and series.

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,020
So what's a sequence?

4
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:06,980
Well, a sequence is just a
bunch of numbers in some order.

5
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,630
You know, the most difficult
sequence is 1, 2, 3, 4.

6
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,370
You get the point.

7
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:14,480
And what's a series?

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,550
Well, it's often represented--
it's just a sum of sequences,

9
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,980
a sum of a sequence.

10
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,350
So, for example, the arithmetic
sequence-- sorry the arithmetic

11
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,920
series is just the sum of
the arithmetic sequence.

12
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,630
So 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus--
we could keep going

13
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,440
until maybe some number.

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,345
This is called the
arithmetic series.

15
00:00:36,345 --> 00:00:42,750
   

16
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,370
Nothing too fancy here.

17
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,860
But before we move forward,
let's get a notation for how we

18
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,630
can represent these sums
without necessarily having to

19
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,430
write out all of the digits or
having to keep doing this dot,

20
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,140
dot, dot, plus notation.

21
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,475
And that notation
is Sigma notation.

22
00:00:59,475 --> 00:01:03,320
   

23
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,740
That's an upper case Sigma.

24
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,510
And how do you use
Sigma notation?

25
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,490
Well, let's say I wanted
to represent this

26
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,020
arithmetic series.

27
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,590
So I would say, well,
let's add up a bunch of--

28
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,940
let's call them k's.

29
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,810
This is an arbitrary variable.

30
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,480
And we'll start at k equals 1.

31
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,240
We'll start at k equals
1, and we'll go to k

32
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,850
is equal to big N.

33
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,795
And this is the exact same
thing, so we first make k equal

34
00:01:27,795 --> 00:01:32,100
to 1, and then we add it to k
is equal to 2 plus 3, and we go

35
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:38,550
all the way until N minus
1 and then plus N.

36
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:45,770
So this is the Sigma notation
for the arithmetic series.

37
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,110
Before I move on, I think this
is a good time just to like

38
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,730
learn a little bit more about
the arithmetic series.

39
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:54,010
We'll actually focus on this
one and the geometric series

40
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,560
because those are the two
that you'll see most often.

41
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,010
And then once you learn
calculus, I'll show you the

42
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,040
power and Taylor series, which
is exact-- the Taylor series is

43
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,250
a specific version
of a power series.

44
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,690
But let's play around with this
arith-- I keep wanting to say

45
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,175
arith-MET-ic, but a-RITH-metic,
either way-- series.

46
00:02:11,175 --> 00:02:14,770
   

47
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,170
So let's call the sum S.

48
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:23,360
Let's say that this is equal to
the sum from k is equal to 1 to

49
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:30,880
N of k, which is equal to, just
like we said, 1 plus 2 plus 3.

50
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,800
And we'll just keep adding
them, dot, dot, dot, to a bunch

51
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,200
of numbers, to big N minus
1 plus big N, right?

52
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,140
Fair enough.

53
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,940
Now, bear with me a second.

54
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,430
I'm just going to write that
same exact sum again, but

55
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,640
I'm just going to write
it in reverse order.

56
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,520
And I think it's intuitive to
you that it doesn't matter what

57
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,170
order I add up numbers in.

58
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,580
They'll add up to
the same number.

59
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,290
2 plus 1 is the same thing
as 1 plus 2, right?

60
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,892
So let me write this exact
same sum, but I'll write

61
00:03:00,892 --> 00:03:01,800
it in reverse order.

62
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:09,040
So that's the same thing as N
plus N minus 1, plus N minus

63
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,320
2, plus-- and the pluses
keep going-- plus 2 plus 1.

64
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,190
This is the exact sum, just
in the reverse order.

65
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,960
And I did that for a reason
because now I'm going to add

66
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,250
both sides of this equation.

67
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,430
I'm going to take-- S plus S.

68
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,450
Well, that's just 2S.

69
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:30,870
And that's going to equal
this sum plus this sum.

70
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,340
I wrote this so that
the sum becomes clean.

71
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,490
And why do I say that?

72
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:38,000
Well, let's add up
corresponding terms.

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,600
We could have added up any
terms, but-- so since they all

74
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,345
have to add up, let's just add
the 1 plus the N, then we'll

75
00:03:43,345 --> 00:03:47,000
add the 2 plus the N minus 1,
then we'll add the 3 plus the

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,820
N minus 2, and so forth.

77
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,560
And I think you'll see in a
second, or maybe you already

78
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,790
realize why I'm doing this.

79
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:56,490
One plus the N, the 2 plus the
N minus 1, the 3 and the N

80
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:00,160
minus 2, all the way to the N
minus 1 and the 2,

81
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,310
the N and the 1.

82
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,830
What's 1 plus N?

83
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,500
Well, that's just
N plus 1, right?

84
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,410
What's 2 plus N minus 1?

85
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,060
Well, that's also
N plus 1, right?

86
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,670
What's 3 plus N minus 2?

87
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,705
I think you could guess.

88
00:04:17,705 --> 00:04:19,910
It's N minus 1.

89
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,140
And we just keep doing that.

90
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,890
And what's N minus 2 plus 2?

91
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,600
Sorry, this is a plus.

92
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,780
N plus 1.

93
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,350
And what's N plus 1?

94
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,310
Well, that's just N
plus 1, of course.

95
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,190
So my question to you
is how many of these

96
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,020
N plus 1's are there?

97
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,410
Well, there are N
of them, right?

98
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,550
Each N plus 1 corresponds
to each of these terms,

99
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,530
so there are N of these.

100
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:45,000
So instead of just adding N
plus 1 N times, we could say

101
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,580
that this is just
N times N plus 1.

102
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,485
So we have 2 times the sum is
equal to N times N plus 1, and

103
00:04:55,485 --> 00:04:58,310
we could divide both sides by
2, and we get the sum is equal

104
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:04,570
to N times N plus 1 over 2.

105
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,800
Now, why is this neat, or
why is this cool at all?

106
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,210
Well, first of all, we found
out a way to sum this

107
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,330
Sigma notation up.

108
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:16,670
We got kind of a
well-defined formula.

109
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,350
And what makes this especially
cool is you can use this

110
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:23,650
for low-end parlor tricks.

111
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,530
What do I mean by that?

112
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:28,760
Well, you can go up to someone
and you can say, well, how

113
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,490
quickly do you think I can add
up the numbers between 1 and--

114
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,000
what am I doing-- oh,
between 1 and 100?

115
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,480
And, you know, people will say,
oh, it will take you a little

116
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,780
time: 1 plus 2 plus 3.

117
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,720
And you say, well, it takes
me no time at all because

118
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,630
this is what I can do.

119
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:47,340
So the sum-- and I just want
to show you that you can use

120
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,470
different variables from B
equals 1, we're taking the

121
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:55,100
variable B, to 100, right?

122
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,720
That's the sum from 1 to 100.

123
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,160
And we figured out
what that formula is.

124
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:07,230
It's going to be 100
times 101 over 2.

125
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,340
Well, what's 100 times 101?

126
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,250
It's just going to be 101
with two zeroes, right?

127
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:20,030
10,100 over 2, and
that equals 5,050.

128
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:20,730
That's pretty neat.

129
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:24,400
Instead of having to say 1 plus
2 plus 3 plus blah, blah, blah,

130
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,395
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
plus 98 plus 99 plus 100, this

131
00:06:29,395 --> 00:06:31,590
would take you some time, and
there's a very good chance you

132
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,860
would make a careless mistake.

133
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,290
We could just plug into this
formula, which we proved and

134
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:39,680
hopefully you understood,
and say that equals 5,050.

135
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,560
You could do even something
more impressive: the

136
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,940
sum from 1 to 1,000.

137
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,150
What's the sum from 1 to 1,000?

138
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,900
Well, our formula, remember,
was N times N plus 1 over 2.

139
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,715
So if N is equal to 1,000,
then what's our sum?

140
00:06:53,715 --> 00:07:02,225
It's 1,000 times 1,001 over 2,
which is equal to-- well, we'll

141
00:07:02,225 --> 00:07:09,290
just add three zeroes to
this: 1,001, one, two, three.

142
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,390
Sorry, I think that was
my first burp ever on

143
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,030
one of these videos.

144
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:17,300
I should re-record it, but
I'm going to move forward.

145
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,280
That kind of disconcerted
me a little bit.

146
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,620
I'd eaten too much.

147
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,820
Anyway, divided by 2,
and what is that?

148
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,810
Let's see, it'll be 500--
let's see, this is a million.

149
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:32,830
Half of a million is 500,000.

150
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:37,510
500,500.

151
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:41,190
And that would have taken
you forever to do manually.

152
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,810
But based on this formula we
just got, you know how to

153
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,450
do it very, very quickly.

154
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,620
So that's the
arithmetic series.

155
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,620
But let's do another one.

156
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,520
This is another typical
series that you might see.

157
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,910
Actually, this one you'll see a
lot in your life, especially if

158
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:03,730
you go into finance or really a
whole series of scientific--

159
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,890
this shows up a lot, and this
is called the geometric series.

160
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:10,530
And the geometric series is--
essentially you take x.

161
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:14,440
And I'll do it generally where
I just take a variable x,

162
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,880
and I say-- well, no, no.

163
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,740
Let me just not take an x.

164
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,020
Let me just take some number.

165
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:29,300
So let's say some number a to
the k from-- I don't know.

166
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,940
Let's say from k is equal
to 0 to k is equal to N.

167
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,660
What does that mean?

168
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:40,950
Well, that means a to the 0,
right, k is 0, plus a 1 plus a

169
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:45,780
squared plus a to the third
plus-- and you could keep

170
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:53,570
going-- plus a to the N minus
1 plus a to the N minus 2.

171
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,560
This is called the
geometric series.

172
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,210
And it might not be obvious to
you, but this type of growth,

173
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,460
where you keep increasing the
exponent, this is called

174
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,392
geometric growth.

175
00:09:02,392 --> 00:09:04,360
So how do you take
the sum of this?

176
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,300
Well, let's see if we can do a
similar trick, although this

177
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,010
trick will involve
one more step.

178
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:13,640
So let's call the sum S.

179
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:23,060
Let's call it the sum from k
equals 0 to N, a to the k.

180
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,950
And that, of course, is
equal to what I just wrote.

181
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:27,570
I probably didn't have
to do it like this.

182
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:32,310
a squared plus bup, bup, bup,
bup, plus a to the N minus

183
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:37,250
1, plus a to the N minus 2.

184
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:42,040
Now let's define another sum,
and I'm going to call that aS.

185
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,580
   

186
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,120
Actually, I'm about to run out
of time, so I'll continue

187
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,430
this in the next video.
