1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,624
Entering into World War 1, the British had

2
00:00:03,624 --> 00:00:04,966
the world's dominant navy.

3
00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:06,875
And they used it immediately to their advantage.

4
00:00:06,875 --> 00:00:09,059
You might remember from previous videos

5
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:11,500
Britain declared war on Germany

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,432
because of their invasion into Belgium

7
00:00:13,432 --> 00:00:15,620
in early august of 1914.

8
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,377
And it was in november of 1914

9
00:00:18,377 --> 00:00:23,780
that the British declare

10
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,619
the entire north sea area a war zone.

11
00:00:31,343 --> 00:00:33,770
which essentially is telling any ship:

12
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,436
'come here at your own risk.'

13
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:36,504
'you might be destroyed.'

14
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:37,967
And especially 'you are not allowed...'

15
00:00:37,967 --> 00:00:39,300
...'to carry any contraband.'

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,566
But they included food as a contraband

17
00:00:41,566 --> 00:00:43,567
So this essentially began the blockade

18
00:00:43,567 --> 00:00:45,606
of Germany and Austria-Hungary.

19
00:00:45,606 --> 00:00:47,440
So this is the blockade

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,703
of the Central Powers.

21
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,335
This had major implications for the war.

22
00:00:56,335 --> 00:00:59,010
Continued throughout the entire war,

23
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,417
it essentially caused the Central Powers

24
00:01:02,417 --> 00:01:05,200
but especially the Germans and the Austrians

25
00:01:05,216 --> 00:01:06,504
to have to ration food.

26
00:01:06,504 --> 00:01:08,550
We are talking about 1,000 calories a day;

27
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,460
you can look at the number of calories in your Big Mac

28
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,027
and think about how little food that was.

29
00:01:14,027 --> 00:01:15,860
and there's many estimates of what that caused.

30
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,888
It obviously made it very hard

31
00:01:17,888 --> 00:01:19,990
for the Central Powers to get munitions and things like that

32
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,810
but it also made it very difficult for them to get food.

33
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,376
And there are estimates that this rationing,

34
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,579
this inability to get food,

35
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:30,880
led to malnutrition, even led to starvation

36
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,950
and there's estimates that this might have led to

37
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:36,694
in excess of 400,000 civilian deaths

38
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,764
either directly or indirectly

39
00:01:40,764 --> 00:01:45,471
due to malnutrition or starvation

40
00:01:45,471 --> 00:01:48,488
amongst the Central Powers.

41
00:01:48,488 --> 00:01:50,849
So this was a pretty serious tactic

42
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:52,932
that was undertaken.

43
00:01:52,932 --> 00:01:56,833
Now, the Germans did not have as dominant a navy.

44
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,319
Most of their navy was actually

45
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,229
focussed right off the coast of Germany,

46
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:02,340
right around there in the North Sea,

47
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,697
but they also wanted to disrupt trade with the British.

48
00:02:05,697 --> 00:02:08,250
They recognized the British Isles were islands,

49
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,149
they're dependent on trade for food and supplies.

50
00:02:12,149 --> 00:02:16,233
So in 1915, in February,

51
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:20,742
the Germans declared the seas around the British Isles

52
00:02:20,742 --> 00:02:22,355
- this whole area -

53
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:23,799
a war zone.

54
00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:25,379
So [he reads as he writes]

55
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,129
seas... around..

56
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:29,560
the British Isles...

57
00:02:32,744 --> 00:02:34,962
similarily they declared that...

58
00:02:34,962 --> 00:02:36,681
a war zone...

59
00:02:36,681 --> 00:02:38,293
as well.

60
00:02:38,293 --> 00:02:40,423
And because their surface fleet

61
00:02:40,423 --> 00:02:41,680
was concentrated right over here,

62
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,116
the way that they would enforce that,

63
00:02:43,116 --> 00:02:45,020
that they would try to keep people

64
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,561
from trading with the British Isles

65
00:02:48,561 --> 00:02:50,894
is through submarine warfare.

66
00:02:50,894 --> 00:02:52,474
And World War 1 is the first time

67
00:02:52,474 --> 00:02:55,160
that submarine warfare becomes a significant factor.

68
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,118
We are talking about very primitive submarines,

69
00:02:57,118 --> 00:02:59,627
vessels that could go under water and

70
00:02:59,627 --> 00:03:03,062
send torpedoes into boats.

71
00:03:03,062 --> 00:03:06,452
Now, thinking about that as a backdrop,

72
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:10,060
we now forward to May 1915.

73
00:03:12,013 --> 00:03:14,548
In May of 1915,

74
00:03:14,548 --> 00:03:18,571
you have the passenger liner R.M.S. Lusitania.

75
00:03:18,571 --> 00:03:21,260
R.M.S. stands for Royal Mail Ship,

76
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,349
because it carried some mail. It is a big ship.

77
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:25,013
If you've ever seen the movie 'Titanic',

78
00:03:25,013 --> 00:03:26,965
think of a ship like that.

79
00:03:26,965 --> 00:03:29,347
It was setting sail from New York

80
00:03:29,347 --> 00:03:32,359
to Liverpool in England.

81
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:34,979
It was apparently a passenger ship

82
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:37,299
but it was also carrying cargo.

83
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:40,096
The germans said 'Look, this could be...'

84
00:03:40,096 --> 00:03:41,730
...'fair game for us, especially if it's carrying...'

85
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,079
...'munitions, especially if it's a British ship'.

86
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:47,694
And in the advertisement that was in New York

87
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,099
for the Lusitania, that was going to leave

88
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:53,124
on May 1st, 1915,

89
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:02,441
the German embassy actually placed an advertisement

90
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:03,828
- and this is worth reading -

91
00:04:03,828 --> 00:04:05,037
they wrote: "NOTICE!"...

92
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:07,484
"Travelers intending to embark..."

93
00:04:07,484 --> 00:04:09,749
"on the Atlantic voyage are reminded that..."

94
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:13,056
"a state of war exists between Germany and her allies..."

95
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:15,945
..."and Great Britain and her allies."...

96
00:04:15,945 --> 00:04:20,032
..."That the zone of war includes the water adjacent to the British Isles..."

97
00:04:20,032 --> 00:04:25,490
..."That in accordance with the formal notice given by the Imperial German government..."

98
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,930
..."vessels flying the flag of Great Britain or any of her allies..."

99
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,623
..."are liable to destruction in those waters...

100
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:39,210
..."and that travelers sailing in the war zone
on ships of Great Britain or her allies..."

101
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:44,950
..."do so at their own risk." From the Imperial German Embassy.

102
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,742
This is dated April, 1915.

103
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,320
So that's the backdrop.

104
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,215
The Lusitania set sail May 1, 1915.

105
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,490
On May 7, 1915

106
00:05:05,403 --> 00:05:09,378
it's almost reached its destination of Liverpool

107
00:05:09,378 --> 00:05:12,428
- that's Liverpool right over here -

108
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:17,410
it's around 10 or 15 miles off the coast of Ireland

109
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,939
and right there, it encounters a German U-boat.

110
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:24,531
This right over here is a German U-boat.

111
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:29,560
And that German U-boat sends a torpedo into the Lusitania.

112
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,480
The torpedo rams into the ship

113
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,568
and then shortly after the torpedo hits

114
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:36,433
you have this huge explosion.

115
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:37,630
And this huge explosion is actually

116
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,519
one of those question marks of history.

117
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:42,540
Now the ship goes down

118
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,991
taking down with it most of its passengers.

119
00:05:45,991 --> 00:05:51,398
There were 1,959 total passengers and crew

120
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:59,345
and 1,195 of them actually died.

121
00:05:59,353 --> 00:06:02,642
There are other ships that went down

122
00:06:02,642 --> 00:06:04,349
due to Germen U-boats,

123
00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:05,539
but what was famous about this one

124
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:08,520
- at least from an American History point of view -

125
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,269
is that there were 128 Americans

126
00:06:13,138 --> 00:06:15,199
who also died on board.

127
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,529
And so you can imagine

128
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:19,841
this lead to a lot of, er...

129
00:06:19,841 --> 00:06:21,716
A lot of people were concerned

130
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:23,017
on the American side.

131
00:06:23,017 --> 00:06:24,270
Why did this happen?

132
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,035
These were American civilians

133
00:06:26,035 --> 00:06:28,412
and it essentially led to a a harsh reprimand

134
00:06:28,412 --> 00:06:30,249
from Woodrow Wilson.

135
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:32,073
Just as a little bit of context:

136
00:06:32,073 --> 00:06:33,746
once war broke out,

137
00:06:33,746 --> 00:06:35,417
- and war had broken out not even a year

138
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:37,510
before the sinking of the Lusitania -

139
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,546
the American's position was to be neutral.

140
00:06:40,546 --> 00:06:43,499
They did not want to enter into this European conflict.

141
00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:44,599
With that said,

142
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:47,505
the Americans were disproportionally

143
00:06:47,505 --> 00:06:50,530
trading with the Allies (not the Central Power).

144
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:55,662
They were providing supplies

145
00:06:55,662 --> 00:06:58,782
and they were providing monetary support,

146
00:06:58,782 --> 00:07:01,229
they were providing loans to the Allies

147
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:03,317
disproportional to the Central Powers.

148
00:07:03,317 --> 00:07:05,138
So even though there was this

149
00:07:05,138 --> 00:07:09,009
strong... no, formal neutrality

150
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:11,869
there was a more implicit connection

151
00:07:11,869 --> 00:07:13,349
to the Allies.

152
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,541
So Woodrow Wilson still wants

153
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:19,040
to keep America out of the war at this point.

154
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,680
We are talking about May 1915.

155
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,275
And so he essentially just sends

156
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,930
a stern warning to the German Empire.

157
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,754
It says: "you must apologize, ..."

158
00:07:27,754 --> 00:07:29,612
..."you must take action to prevent..."

159
00:07:29,612 --> 00:07:32,546
..."this type of thing happening in the future."

160
00:07:32,546 --> 00:07:34,679
And the German Empire actually complies.

161
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:36,399
On September 9 --

162
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:41,527
Let me write this on the timeline

163
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:44,155
So in May, you have 'Lusitania sunk'

164
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:46,819
[he reads as he writes]

165
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,430
And then in September

166
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:54,672
the Germans agree

167
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:57,989
to not attack passenger ships.

168
00:08:08,885 --> 00:08:09,804
And so,

169
00:08:09,804 --> 00:08:11,444
even though the sinking of the Lusitania

170
00:08:11,444 --> 00:08:13,644
especially in American History classes

171
00:08:13,644 --> 00:08:15,229
is often given as a trigger

172
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:17,389
for America's entrance into war,

173
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:20,840
America stayed neutral throughout

174
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,963
this entire period.

175
00:08:21,963 --> 00:08:23,825
America wouldn't actually enter the war

176
00:08:23,825 --> 00:08:26,891
until April 1917.

177
00:08:26,891 --> 00:08:28,158
So the Lusitania was just

178
00:08:28,158 --> 00:08:29,691
one of many things that happened

179
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:32,300
in the years running up to the war.

180
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,758
If we fast-forward a bit:

181
00:08:33,758 --> 00:08:36,225
in the 1916 presidential election

182
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:38,425
where Wilson won re-election

183
00:08:38,425 --> 00:08:39,900
he ran on a platform of

184
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,980
he kept us out of war.

185
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,829
So the sinking of Lusitania was a significant event.

186
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:54,567
One could argue because the Germans

187
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,360
did not want the US to enter

188
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,754
on the side of the Allies

189
00:08:57,754 --> 00:08:59,149
it was why the Germans agreed

190
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:01,440
to loosen up - at least for couple of years -

191
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,425
on their U-boat campaigns.

192
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:05,625
As we will see, once we get to 1917,

193
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,292
the Germans out of desperation

194
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:08,960
start to become more aggressive

195
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,446
on their U-boat attacks again,

196
00:09:10,446 --> 00:09:13,179
which -is- one of the catalyst that drive the US

197
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:16,303
or that the US -claim- drove them

198
00:09:16,303 --> 00:09:18,387
into World War 1.

199
00:09:18,387 --> 00:09:19,350
But with that said,

200
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,988
- just as a bit of context -

201
00:09:20,988 --> 00:09:22,985
oftentimes when we look at back history,

202
00:09:22,985 --> 00:09:25,424
it seems very cut-and-dried,

203
00:09:25,424 --> 00:09:26,764
it seems obvious: "oh yes you know..."

204
00:09:26,764 --> 00:09:30,068
"...we had to go to war" et cetera, et cetera.

205
00:09:30,068 --> 00:09:31,452
I have a few quotes here

206
00:09:31,452 --> 00:09:34,471
from William Jennings Bryan

207
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:36,887
who was Woodrow Wilson's Secretary of State.

208
00:09:36,887 --> 00:09:40,299
A few of these are pretty telling.

209
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:42,700
This first one is from September 1914.

210
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,178
This is before any of the stuff happened

211
00:09:44,178 --> 00:09:46,034
with Lusitania, but war had broken out

212
00:09:46,034 --> 00:09:49,366
in Europe and he had this message

213
00:09:49,366 --> 00:09:50,879
that he wrote to Woodrow Wilson

214
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:52,184
to advocate why

215
00:09:52,184 --> 00:09:53,400
we should stay out of the war

216
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,601
and why there should be some type of mediation

217
00:09:55,601 --> 00:09:57,274
to try to end the war

218
00:09:57,274 --> 00:09:59,178
as opposed to just letting it run its course.

219
00:09:59,178 --> 00:10:00,571
He wrote to Wilson:

220
00:10:00,571 --> 00:10:02,952
"It is not likely that either side will win..."

221
00:10:02,952 --> 00:10:04,240
"...so complete a victory..."

222
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,284
"...as to be able to dictate terms, ..."

223
00:10:06,284 --> 00:10:09,275
"...and if either side does win..."

224
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,020
(and this is strangely foreshadowing)

225
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:17,088
"...such a victory, it will probably mean..."

226
00:10:17,088 --> 00:10:19,265
"...preparation for another war."...

227
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:22,362
...'it would seem better to look for ..."

228
00:10:22,362 --> 00:10:25,969
"...a more rational basis for peace."

229
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,428
The other quotes here,

230
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,800
this is kind of that question mark

231
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,783
on that second explosion.

232
00:10:32,783 --> 00:10:34,361
William Jennings Bryan wrote:

233
00:10:34,361 --> 00:10:35,695
"Ships carrying contraband..."

234
00:10:35,695 --> 00:10:37,894
"...should be prohibited from carrying passengers..."

235
00:10:37,894 --> 00:10:39,735
"... it would be like putting women and children..."

236
00:10:39,735 --> 00:10:41,010
"... in front of an army."

237
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,880
This is one of those Big Questions Of History:

238
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,740
it was know that the Lusitania

239
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,420
was carrying light ammunition.

240
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,428
Now the Germans claimed it was actually

241
00:10:56,428 --> 00:10:58,227
carrying heavy munitions. And to some degree

242
00:10:58,227 --> 00:11:00,069
that second explosion tends

243
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:00,827
to back that up.

244
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,294
There are all sorts of shady things about it.

245
00:11:03,294 --> 00:11:05,450
A lot of the cargo that the Lusitania was carrying

246
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,209
even though they claim it was perishable goods

247
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,961
it was not being stored

248
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,094
in a refrigerated part of the ship.

249
00:11:12,094 --> 00:11:14,294
And so there was reason to believe

250
00:11:14,294 --> 00:11:17,227
that is was actually carrying heavy munitions.

251
00:11:17,227 --> 00:11:19,920
And that second explosion seems to point

252
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,268
in that direction as well.

253
00:11:22,268 --> 00:11:25,194
Even after World War 1 the British navy

254
00:11:25,194 --> 00:11:27,534
actually spent multiple times

255
00:11:27,534 --> 00:11:29,939
trying to destroy the wreck of the Lusitania

256
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:30,620
some people say

257
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:34,027
in order to maybe get rid of some evidence

258
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,740
that it was actually carrying far more munitions

259
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,710
and maybe was

260
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,627
from the German's point-of-view

261
00:11:38,627 --> 00:11:42,985
a fairer target than was actually made out.

262
00:11:42,985 --> 00:11:46,091
So regardless, it's a very interesting incident

263
00:11:46,091 --> 00:11:48,227
Not necessarily directly tied to

264
00:11:48,227 --> 00:11:51,920
America's entrance into World War 1,

265
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,550
but it is one of many events

266
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:56,076
and this whole idea of blockades

267
00:11:56,076 --> 00:11:58,161
and German U-boats against civilians

268
00:11:58,161 --> 00:12:00,761
this was something that was a cause

269
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,833
of repeated concern for the Americans.
