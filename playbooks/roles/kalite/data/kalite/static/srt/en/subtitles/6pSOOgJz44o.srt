1
00:00:00,821 --> 00:00:10,906
(lively music)

2
00:00:10,906 --> 00:00:12,991
Voiceover: We're in the Museum of Modern Art on the fourth floor,

3
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:17,076
and we're standing in front of a little case that encloses

4
00:00:17,076 --> 00:00:23,616
Alberto Giacometti, the Swiss sculptor's, "City Square," from 1948.

5
00:00:23,616 --> 00:00:29,986
Voiceover: Strikingly odd in its materials, which are bronze,

6
00:00:29,986 --> 00:00:33,489
and sort of heroic in its association

7
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:40,441
of the very small, and meager, and sad-looking figures.

8
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:41,618
Voiceover: Right.

9
00:00:41,618 --> 00:00:43,319
Downstairs, when you walk into the museum,

10
00:00:43,319 --> 00:00:47,339
you're confronted with a grand figure of Balzac by Rodin ...

11
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:49,151
Voiceover: In bronze.

12
00:00:49,151 --> 00:00:51,157
Voiceover: And it's this gigantic bronze that,

13
00:00:51,157 --> 00:00:53,756
as it's set up on the Boulevard Raspail in Paris,

14
00:00:53,756 --> 00:00:55,785
it's something that you look up at,

15
00:00:55,785 --> 00:00:57,266
and it's heroic in the extreme.

16
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:59,776
Voiceover: Then, there's the whole tradition of equestrian sculptures.

17
00:00:59,776 --> 00:01:02,426
Voiceover: But here, we have these tiny little figures.

18
00:01:02,426 --> 00:01:03,868
Voiceover: They're very [unintelligible].

19
00:01:03,868 --> 00:01:05,760
Voiceover: There's such a great story behind this,

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,281
because what's happening here is that Giacometti,

21
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:11,410
who had been one of these dissident surrealists

22
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,950
before the Second World War, had fled -

23
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,783
gone to visit his mother, supposedly, in Switzerland,

24
00:01:16,783 --> 00:01:19,114
with some friends - when the Nazis were threatening,

25
00:01:19,114 --> 00:01:21,969
and stayed there for the duration of the war.

26
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:24,934
When he was there, he worked on his sculptures.

27
00:01:24,934 --> 00:01:27,036
At the end of the war, he brought them all back,

28
00:01:27,036 --> 00:01:30,612
and he brought them back in tiny little matchboxes.

29
00:01:30,612 --> 00:01:34,327
Tiny little matchboxes contained his entire output

30
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:36,408
for the period of the war, and these are figures

31
00:01:36,408 --> 00:01:38,949
that are even smaller than the ones that are in front of us here.

32
00:01:38,949 --> 00:01:42,903
They're these figures that are so minuscule, so tiny,

33
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:45,947
that they seem like we could never get close to them.

34
00:01:45,947 --> 00:01:50,742
Voiceover: What's funny is that, although they are so small

35
00:01:50,742 --> 00:01:55,263
and so devoid of information, really, about who they are

36
00:01:55,263 --> 00:01:58,572
and what they are in terms of their bodies,

37
00:01:58,572 --> 00:02:03,284
but I'm noticing that I can still see that there's a female figure ...

38
00:02:03,284 --> 00:02:04,864
Voiceover: And she's distinct.

39
00:02:04,864 --> 00:02:06,580
Voiceover: And four male figures, and she is distinct.

40
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,536
But, I think it's interesting he so reduced them,

41
00:02:10,536 --> 00:02:13,452
but that gender distinction is still there.

42
00:02:13,452 --> 00:02:16,376
Voiceover: He does it through the hips, and through the breasts ...

43
00:02:16,376 --> 00:02:17,772
Voiceover: And the clothing.

44
00:02:17,772 --> 00:02:21,101
Voiceover: And the hair, but also - and if you're familiar

45
00:02:21,101 --> 00:02:23,695
with Giacometti's post-war work - you'll notice

46
00:02:23,695 --> 00:02:25,779
that his male figures are often walking.

47
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:27,569
Voiceover: And the female figure is standing still.

48
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:28,430
I noticed that, too.

49
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,932
Voiceover: And her legs - she's almost

50
00:02:29,932 --> 00:02:34,130
like a [Kroisos} that is from an ancient Greek figure

51
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,687
where the legs are locked together,

52
00:02:35,687 --> 00:02:38,933
and the arms are also sort of plastered ...

53
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:40,268
Voiceover: An archaic Greek sculpture.

54
00:02:40,268 --> 00:02:41,446
Voiceover: That's right, plastered to the side,

55
00:02:41,446 --> 00:02:42,921
whereas the men are mobile.

56
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:46,168
There this very serious distinction that he makes

57
00:02:46,168 --> 00:02:48,171
in the representation of the genders.

58
00:02:48,171 --> 00:02:49,338
Voiceover: It bothers me.

59
00:02:49,338 --> 00:02:51,828
Voiceover: It bothers me, too.

60
00:02:51,828 --> 00:02:54,272
Voiceover: It makes me wonder what it means ...

61
00:02:54,272 --> 00:02:55,037
Voiceover: Well, she seems bound.

62
00:02:55,037 --> 00:02:56,320
Voiceover: And I worry that he means something

63
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,984
that is not going to make me happy.

64
00:02:57,984 --> 00:02:59,080
(laughs quietly)

65
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,814
Voiceover: No, I suspect that that's exactly right, in fact.

66
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:02,820
She seems bound.

67
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:08,085
Voiceover: Right, there's a sense of men's mobility in the city,

68
00:03:08,085 --> 00:03:11,320
and her lack of mobility in the city.

69
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,981
It's hard to say that, because all of the figures are alienated.

70
00:03:13,981 --> 00:03:15,606
Voiceover: They are.

71
00:03:15,606 --> 00:03:18,087
Voiceover: And alone and isolated,

72
00:03:18,087 --> 00:03:21,823
and she is, too, but she's moreso.

73
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,669
Voiceover: Well, think about his earlier

74
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:24,947
representations of women.

75
00:03:24,947 --> 00:03:26,477
I'm thinking most famously, of course,

76
00:03:26,477 --> 00:03:27,736
of "Woman with her Throat Cut,"

77
00:03:27,736 --> 00:03:29,485
where we have this figure that seems

78
00:03:29,485 --> 00:03:31,818
as if she had been raped and then murdered,

79
00:03:31,818 --> 00:03:35,570
splayed, her limbs akimbo on the floor,

80
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:39,031
Even then, there's an even greater violence

81
00:03:39,073 --> 00:03:41,735
because she's not only been attacked, clearly,

82
00:03:41,766 --> 00:03:44,094
but she's also half insect,

83
00:03:44,094 --> 00:03:47,422
more specifically, praying mantis-like.

84
00:03:47,422 --> 00:03:50,406
Voiceover: Ah, someone who would kill her mate, right?

85
00:03:50,406 --> 00:03:53,506
Voiceover: One of the ideas that was of particular interest to the surrealists.

86
00:03:53,506 --> 00:03:55,584
Voiceover: Yeah, she looks like she's standing still

87
00:03:55,584 --> 00:04:00,596
and sort of, therefore, a waiting victim, somehow,

88
00:04:00,596 --> 00:04:03,595
to these men who walk by her, to men.

89
00:04:03,595 --> 00:04:05,407
Voiceover: You wonder whether or not these figures

90
00:04:05,407 --> 00:04:08,814
will come into contact with each other or,

91
00:04:08,814 --> 00:04:11,095
if this was somehow animated,

92
00:04:11,095 --> 00:04:14,140
if they would pass across each other's paths

93
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:18,428
so that they don't actually ever bump, but intersect only.

94
00:04:18,428 --> 00:04:21,930
It's an interesting community of isolation, isn't it?

95
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,094
Voiceover: You know what it really reminds me of?

96
00:04:24,094 --> 00:04:25,650
It really reminds me of Seurat.

97
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,431
Voiceover: Ah, I think that that's right.

98
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:30,476
Voiceover: Because the figures are reduced to their bare essentials,

99
00:04:30,476 --> 00:04:33,396
and yet you can still tell some things about them,

100
00:04:33,396 --> 00:04:38,961
and they're very isolated in their performance in the outside space.

101
00:04:38,961 --> 00:04:41,312
Voiceover: The French philosopher Sartre wrote the introduction

102
00:04:41,312 --> 00:04:44,812
to Giacometti's first major post-war exhibition.

103
00:04:44,812 --> 00:04:48,413
One of the things that Sartre wrote about was the way

104
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,744
in which Giacometti's figures represented distance

105
00:04:51,744 --> 00:04:55,114
and the reclaiming of the isolation of the figure

106
00:04:55,114 --> 00:04:58,451
in the wake of the concentration camps,

107
00:04:58,451 --> 00:05:02,169
in the wake of the camp that actually Sartre himself ,

108
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:07,105
apparently, was in briefly, where figures were constantly against each other,

109
00:05:07,105 --> 00:05:12,790
and that all personal space or isolation was removed.

110
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,285
Voiceover: That's right, and the body became something that was - bodies were very [unintelligible],

111
00:05:16,285 --> 00:05:18,102
[unintelligible] each other in a way.

112
00:05:18,102 --> 00:05:19,251
Voiceover: That's right.

113
00:05:19,251 --> 00:05:21,092
He said that for weeks on end, you always had

114
00:05:21,092 --> 00:05:22,436
somebody's thigh or arm against you,

115
00:05:22,436 --> 00:05:25,669
and that Giacometti's reclaiming that distance and,

116
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:28,618
therefore, the autonomy and possibility of action in the space.

117
00:05:28,618 --> 00:05:31,450
But, of course, that has an especially potent meaning

118
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,566
if the female figure doesn't have that ability to act.

119
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:37,977
Voiceover: That reminded me of the description in Mautz,

120
00:05:37,977 --> 00:05:41,565
of his father when he has to go

121
00:05:41,565 --> 00:05:42,777
to the toilet in the middle of the night -

122
00:05:42,777 --> 00:05:45,743
and I think he's in Dachau - and in order to go to the toilet,

123
00:05:45,743 --> 00:05:48,606
he has to step over bodies.

124
00:05:48,606 --> 00:05:51,593
Voiceover: Now, Sartre was not in a concentration camp in Germany,

125
00:05:51,593 --> 00:05:54,620
but he was apparently in prison, briefly at least, for his ...

126
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,034
Voiceover: It's funny because this looks

127
00:05:55,034 --> 00:05:55,034
like such a dystopic view of humanity,

128
00:05:55,034 --> 00:05:55,034
but seen in that context, it's more Utopia.

129
00:05:55,034 --> 00:05:55,034
Voiceover: I'm not sure that there's necessarily

130
00:05:55,034 --> 00:05:55,034
that much positive light here, but I think

131
00:05:55,034 --> 00:05:55,034
a sort of complexity of different kinds of negative.

132
00:05:55,034 --> 00:05:55,034
Voiceover: Fair enough.

133
00:05:55,034 --> 00:06:05,495
(lively music)
