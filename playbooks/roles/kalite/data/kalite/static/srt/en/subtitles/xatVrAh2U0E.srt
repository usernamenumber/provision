1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800
   

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,720
A couple of videos ago we
figured out how to go from the

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:12,770
empirical formula to the
mass composition.

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,710
And all I mean by that, mass
composition, is that you could

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,480
start with the empirical formula
H2O, which is also its

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,670
molecular formula.

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,600
And then we were able to figure
out what percentage of

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,750
this was water and what

9
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,170
percentage of this was hydrogen.

10
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:32,299
The way we did it is we said,
OK, oxygen's mass is 16 atomic

11
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:32,930
mass units.

12
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,630
Hydrogen is one.

13
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,840
The mass of the entire molecule
is 2 times hydrogen.

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,520
2 times 1.

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,910
Plus 16 for that one
oxygen, so it's 18.

16
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,490
And then we said, the
composition of

17
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:47,600
oxygen is just 16/18.

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,720
So oxygen is 16/18.

19
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,610
I don't have my calculator
anymore.

20
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,710
I think the number was something
on the order of 88%

21
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:03,030
or 88.9% oxygen.

22
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,550
So now let's see if we
can go the other way.

23
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:10,710
Let's see if we could start
with mass composition, the

24
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,170
percent composition of the
different elements, and then

25
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,520
go to empirical formula.

26
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,140
And I think the first
video I made, I

27
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,860
spelled empirical wrong.

28
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,740
Which is good reason for me
not to do spelling videos.

29
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,790
I think I spelled this with
an e right here, because I

30
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,080
pronounce it empricial.

31
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,680
But it's spelled with an i.

32
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,920
Empirical formula.

33
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,605
So back to the empirical
formula.

34
00:01:31,605 --> 00:01:35,620
So let's do some exercises
here to see

35
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,260
if we can get someplace.

36
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,180
So let's say that I start off
with-- I need space, my

37
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,370
periodic table is right
down there.

38
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:47,940
Let's say I am told that
I have a bag of stuff.

39
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:58,030
And 75% of that bag, let's
say it is mercury.

40
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,420
Hg.

41
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,500
And say that the other 25%
of the bag is chlorine.

42
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,040
   

43
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,810
So the question that I'm asked
is, what is the empirical

44
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,280
formula of the stuff that I have
here, assuming that it's

45
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,400
all one molecule or one
type of molecule?

46
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,265
So what is the empirical
formula?

47
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:25,810
   

48
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,430
So the way to think about this
is, let's assume that you have

49
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,400
100 grams of this stuff.

50
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:33,740
Right?

51
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,680
And the reason why I'm picking
100 is because 100 is a useful

52
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,570
number to deal with.

53
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,930
So if I have 100 grams of
the stuff, all right.

54
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:51,560
So let's say I assume that you
have 100 grams. If you have

55
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,230
100 grams, how many grams
of mercury do you have?

56
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,840
Well that means that 75% of
that, that means you have 75

57
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,790
grams of mercury, Hg.

58
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:11,880
And that means you have
25 grams of chlorine.

59
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,890
You might be saying, where did
get these numbers from?

60
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,750
Well, I got the numbers because
I assumed 100 grams. I

61
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,490
could have assumed 112 grams
or 7 grams, but those would

62
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,180
have been harder numbers
to work with.

63
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,610
So I'm just assuming 100 grams.
So the question is, in

64
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:29,930
75 grams of mercury, how many
moles of mercury do I have?

65
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,830
So I need to convert from
grams to moles.

66
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:34,590
Let's go the other way.

67
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,670
One mole of mercury-- this is at
least how my brain thinks--

68
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:46,990
let me pick a suitable color--
so one mole of mercury so 6.02

69
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:51,360
times 10 to the 23
mercury atoms.

70
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,400
What's the mass of that?

71
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,810
Well it's equal to whatever
mercury's mass number is in

72
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:01,220
grams. So let's go look up
mercury's mass number.

73
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,910
So mercury is a transition
metal.

74
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,980
It's one of the few metals
that are liquid at room

75
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,740
temperature.

76
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,780
Right there we have mercury.

77
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,596
Its mass number, let's
pick the 200.

78
00:04:14,596 --> 00:04:17,490
It has a mass number of 200.

79
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,700
Obviously, there's some mercury
out there that has a

80
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,950
mass of 201.

81
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:27,710
But for simplicity, let's
say it's 200.

82
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:34,450
So 1 mole of mercury is 200
grams. How did I get that?

83
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,530
Mercury's mass number.

84
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:41,160
One atom of mercury has a mass
of 200 atomic mass units.

85
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,690
So one mole of mercury-- 6.02
times 10 to the 23 mercury

86
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:50,130
atoms-- has that many
grams of mass.

87
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:54,010
So instead of 200 atomic mass
units per atom, we have 200

88
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,980
grams per mole of that atom.

89
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,870
It's an easy calculation.

90
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,910
You just look up it atomic mass
number and say it's that

91
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,640
many grams. You have a mole
of the substance.

92
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,490
Fair enough.

93
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:11,130
And what about one
mole of chlorine?

94
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,100
We do the same exercise.

95
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,170
We go down to our
periodic table.

96
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:20,190
Chlorine has a mass number
of, let's say, 35.

97
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,360
It has various isotopes
on this planet.

98
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,710
But let's say the mass
number is 35.

99
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:28,040
So one chlorine atom weighs--
well now, we shouldn't say

100
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,140
weighs, we have to
be very careful.

101
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:33,700
One chlorine atom has a mass
of 35 atomic mass units.

102
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:40,740
So 6.02 times 10 to the 23
chlorine atoms, or one mole of

103
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:46,480
chlorine atoms will
have a mass of 35.

104
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,840
35 grams.

105
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:54,950
So how many moles of
mercury do I have?

106
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,950
Let me get my calculator
going.

107
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,740
So I have 75 grams of mercury.

108
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,320
One mole of mercury would have
a mass of 200 grams. So I

109
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,210
could just take 75 divided by
200 and it tells me how many

110
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:18,360
moles I have. 75 divided
by 200 is equal to

111
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:27,910
0.375 moles of mercury.

112
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:28,640
How did I figure that?

113
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,690
One mole of mercury would be
200 grams. I only have 75

114
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,710
grams of mercury, so I have a
small fraction of it, roughly

115
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,980
0.375 moles of mercury.

116
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,140
I've just expressed the number
of atoms of mercury I have.

117
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:47,200
Moles tells me it's 6.02 times
10 to the 23 atoms of mercury.

118
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:52,430
So I have 0.375 times Avogadro's
number of mercury

119
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,530
atoms. Fair enough.

120
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,750
Now let's do the chlorine.

121
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,790
I have 25 grams of chlorine.

122
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:01,310
One mole of chlorine
is 35 grams. So I

123
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:04,980
have 25 over 35 moles.

124
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,850
So what's that?

125
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:29,830
So 25 divided by 35 is equal
to 0.714 moles of chlorine.

126
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,625
Now these numbers, they're
not exact.

127
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:35,260
Because if you take twice this
number up here, you don't get

128
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,270
twice this number right here.

129
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,940
If you get twice this,
you don't get this.

130
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:46,340
But this is roughly twice as
many moles of chlorine as I do

131
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,140
of mercury.

132
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,550
So that tells me that for every
mercury atom-- remember,

133
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,970
moles is just a number-- for
every mercury atom I have, I

134
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:59,320
have two chlorine atoms. So the
empirical formula here is

135
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:04,680
for every mercury I have
two chlorines.

136
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,250
I have two chlorines,
right there.

137
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,040
And the numbers didn't work
out almost exactly right.

138
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,890
   

139
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:15,930
Especially in the real world,
when you're actually trying to

140
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,310
figure out things empirically,
your numbers seldom will.

141
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:21,030
And maybe there's some random
other things running out there

142
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,510
in terms of other things that
are contributing to the mass.

143
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:27,280
But this is close enough to know
that the ratio of mercury

144
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,110
to chlorine is roughly 1:2.

145
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,539
Right?

146
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:33,230
This is a number.

147
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,990
For every one chlorine atom,
you have roughly two.

148
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,179
You have twice as many.

149
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:38,600
I guess the other way of
thinking about it is you have

150
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,440
twice as many chlorine
atoms in the

151
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,460
bag as you have mercury.

152
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:42,909
Roughly.

153
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:44,030
Although this is a
little bit more.

154
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,830
This is close to 0.75.

155
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,770
But it's close enough for you
to know that you're dealing

156
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:50,160
with mercury chloride.

157
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,980
Right there.

158
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,670
Let's do another one of these.

159
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,960
Let's see how the numbers
turn out for this one.

160
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:02,500
Let's say you have another
bag that is 9% magnesium.

161
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,450
   

162
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:15,740
And let's say the remainder of
the bag, 91%, is iodine.

163
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,990
91% is iodine.

164
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,090
So the way to do all of these
is, you do the same thing.

165
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:23,290
Assume you have 100 grams. So
if you have 100 grams, of

166
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:27,860
which you have 9 grams
of magnesium.

167
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,470
And you have 91 grams
of iodine.

168
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,840
And then figure out how much a
mole of magnesium-- what would

169
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,020
be the mass of a mole
of magnesium and

170
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:37,710
then a mole of iodine.

171
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,100
So let me write here.

172
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,760
One mole of magnesium.

173
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,670
And we want to figure out
one mole of iodine.

174
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:49,880
   

175
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,760
Let's figure those out.

176
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:56,200
So magnesium's mass number is,
let's just go with 24.

177
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,520
Let's say we have the
isotope that's 24.

178
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,990
Magnesium is 24 and since
we're already down here,

179
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,280
what's iodine.

180
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,590
127.

181
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,270
It's 127.

182
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:11,510
Iodine is one of the halogens.

183
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:11,810
So let's see.

184
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,160
You have 127 and you have 24.

185
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,360
Let me write those down.

186
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:28,180
So you have 127 and
you have 24.

187
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:36,710
So one atom of iodine has a mass
of 127 atomic mass units.

188
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:41,000
So a whole mole all of it, 6.02
times 10 to the 23 iodine

189
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,850
atoms will have a mass of 127
grams. You just take the

190
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:51,890
atomic weight, or the atomic
mass, and the mass will be

191
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,600
that many grams when you have
this many of the atom.

192
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,380
So then one mole of magnesium
will be 24 grams.

193
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,620
So now we just figure out how
many moles of each of these we

194
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,860
have. We have 9 grams
of magnesium.

195
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,650
So what fraction of
a mole is that?

196
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,870
A mole is 24 grams. So
this is equal to

197
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:15,842
9/24 moles of magnesium.

198
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:19,540
And what is 9 over 24?

199
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:25,410
9 divided by 24 is
equal to 0.375.

200
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:30,870
So this is equal to 0.375, which
is similar to what we

201
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,610
had in the last problem when
that 0.375 showed up.

202
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,670
And 91 grams of iodine
is what?

203
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,320
91 grams of iodine.

204
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,400
Well, in a whole mole of iodine
you're going to have

205
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:49,800
127 grams. So we have 91/127
moles of iodine.

206
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,730
And what's 91 over 127?

207
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,920
I have a feeling we're going to
have very similar numbers.

208
00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:00,280
121 divided by 127 is
equal to 0.716.

209
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,100
I should do another problem with
better ratios than this.

210
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:08,700
These have the same ratios as
the last problem, 0.72,

211
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,460
roughly, moles of iodine.

212
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,890
And this is moles
of magnesium.

213
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:19,920
So we have roughly twice the
number of iodine atoms as we

214
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,030
do of magnesium atoms. Right?

215
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:26,700
For every one magnesium atom
we have roughly two iodine

216
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,360
atoms. I know this isn't
exactly 1:2,

217
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,110
but it's pretty close.

218
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:37,000
So the formula here is
magnesium iodide.

219
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,540
Right there.

220
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,660
And that's the empirical
formula.

221
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:42,060
We don't know, maybe in every
atom maybe you had two

222
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,790
magnesiums and four iodines.

223
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:44,910
We don't know.

224
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,220
All we know is that the
ratio of magnesium to

225
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,360
iodine here is 1:2.

226
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,940
In the next video, I'm going to
try to look for ones that

227
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,070
have more interesting ratios,
because I don't want to do two

228
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,740
problems that both have
the same ratio.

229
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,150
But hopefully you found this
a little bit helpful.

230
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:57,320
