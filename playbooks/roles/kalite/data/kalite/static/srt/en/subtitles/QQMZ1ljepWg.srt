1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
   

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,050
Let's do a few more examples of
seeing if either an atom or

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,990
an entire molecule is chiral.

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,640
So here I have a molecule.

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,810
Let's see if we can identify
any chiral centers, or any

6
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:15,060
chiral atoms, or asymmetric
carbons, all words for the

7
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,640
same thing, although I guess you
could have chiral centers

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,960
that aren't necessarily carbon,
but it tends to be

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,660
carbon most of the time,
especially in Organic

10
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,010
Chemistry class.

11
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:27,160
So if we look here, the one that
kind of jumps out, this

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,460
carbon right here is
bonded to three

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,400
hydrogens and another carbon.

14
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,590
So this is obviously not going
to be a chiral center.

15
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,710
It's bonded to three
of the same group.

16
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,680
These three guys are all bonded
to two hydrogens each,

17
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,830
so they're all bonded to two
of the same group, so they

18
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,740
can't be chiral centers.

19
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,620
This carbon right here is bonded
to three hydrogens,

20
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,500
once again, three of the same
group, not going to be a

21
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,500
chiral center.

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,670
This one looks interesting.

23
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,430
It looks like it could be a good
candidate it for a chiral

24
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,330
center, or a chiral carbon,
or an asymmetric carbon.

25
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:01,430
Over here on the left, it's
bonded to a methyl group, so

26
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:06,200
this is a methyl group, and here
on the right, it's bonded

27
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,590
to a butyl group.

28
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:16,390
   

29
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,130
Over here, it's bonded to an OH,
and then over here, it's

30
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:25,090
bonded to an H, so this is
definitely a chiral carbon.

31
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,530
We could put a little
asterisk here.

32
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,930
That's how they often denote
that this is a chiral carbon.

33
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,510
And if this doesn't make sense
to you, because you might say,

34
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:35,200
hey, Sal, look, this carbon is
bonded to two other carbons.

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,880
Isn't that the same thing?

36
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,780
But the point here is that
we're not looking at what

37
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,690
atoms it's directly bonded to.

38
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,670
We're looking at the groups
that it's bonded to.

39
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,720
In this case, this hydrogen
is a group and an atom.

40
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,220
Over here, it's an
entire group.

41
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,670
It's an entire butyl group.

42
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,160
We have four carbons here.

43
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,410
We only have one over here.

44
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:56,680
Another way to think about it,
we could have drawn this

45
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,100
molecule like this.

46
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,590
We could have had a carbon in
the center, and maybe this

47
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,075
methyl group is popping
out like this.

48
00:02:05,075 --> 00:02:08,970
   

49
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,550
You have your CH3, and then you
would have this hydrogen

50
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,740
coming out maybe in the plane,
and then behind it, you would

51
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,930
have the butyl group.

52
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,520
So kind of the back leg of the
tripod, you'd have a butyl,

53
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:22,810
and what is that?

54
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,670
That's C4H9, right?

55
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:32,550
That's six plus-- C4H9, so it's
C4H9 in the back, and

56
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,480
then above it, you
have your OH.

57
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,480
Above it, in a different color,
you have your OH.

58
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,500
And when you look at it like
this, it looks just like the

59
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,100
other chiral carbons that we had
identified in actually the

60
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,640
last video.

61
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,720
It looks very similar to
something like this.

62
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,500
And when you take its
mirror image,

63
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,500
this is the same molecule.

64
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,100
Here, I kind of made it a
little bit more three

65
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,100
dimensional, but if you take
the mirror image of either

66
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,160
one, you're going to find that
no matter how you try to

67
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,375
rotate it or shift it, you won't
be able to superimpose

68
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:06,600
it on its mirror image
for the same reasons

69
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,060
as the other ones.

70
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,710
And I challenge you
to, if you can.

71
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,690
So this is a chiral carbon.

72
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:22,300
This is a chiral center,
we could say.

73
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,800
Or we could even call it
an asymmetric carbon.

74
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,150
It could be considered
a stereocenter or

75
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,360
a stereogenic center.

76
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,070
All of those are valid
things to call this

77
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,760
carbon right there.

78
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,770
And this is also a
chiral molecule.

79
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:45,630
   

80
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,030
Now let's look at this blue
example right here.

81
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,280
And if we wanted to name it,
just so we get a little bit of

82
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,860
review, we could start at this
fluorine right there: one,

83
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,350
two, three, four, five.

84
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,140
This is what?

85
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,600
This is 1,
3-difluorocyclopentane.

86
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:12,440
   

87
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,550
So that was a nice
review of naming.

88
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,839
But let's think about whether
we have any chiral centers

89
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,370
here and whether the molecule
as a whole is chiral.

90
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,930
So the immediate ones that we
can kind of dismiss-- and

91
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,940
actually let me get rid of this
numbering because I don't

92
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,850
want you think that there are
somehow three hydrogens there.

93
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,370
That was the number three
hydrogen, number three carbon,

94
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,390
number two carbon, and so on so
forth, But let me get rid

95
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,065
of them now that we've
named the molecule.

96
00:04:40,065 --> 00:04:42,800
I don't want to confuse how many
hydrogens we have at any

97
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,520
of these points.

98
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,930
So let's look at the carbons.

99
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,720
Well, we could immediately
dismiss that carbon, that

100
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,700
carbon, and that carbon, because
each of those are

101
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,990
bonded to two hydrogens.

102
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,100
If we wanted to break it out,
they would look like this.

103
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,330
So they're bonded to carbons,
carbons, and then they're

104
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,750
bonded to hydrogens.

105
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,300
Now, these might be
different groups.

106
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,310
These might be different types
of alkane groups that it's

107
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,610
bonded to, so that doesn't
necessarily throw it out of

108
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,210
the running.

109
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,970
But these two, the two hydrogens
that it's bonded to,

110
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,410
are definitely the same
atom, the same group.

111
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:18,760
We have an axis of symmetry
through that atom, so it

112
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,010
cannot be a stereogenic
center.

113
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,220
It cannot be an asymmetric
carbon.

114
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,730
It cannot be a chiral center
or a chiral atom, so we can

115
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,180
knock those guys out
of the running.

116
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,530
But this guy and that guy
seem pretty interesting.

117
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,960
Because if we were to break it
out a little bit, you could

118
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,400
break it out like that and break
it out like, so writing

119
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,380
a CH and actually show the
bond to the hydrogen.

120
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,860
And this guy is bonded to one
hydrogen, one fluorine.

121
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,010
And then if we were to work our
way around the cycle, and

122
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:55,580
these cyclic molecules are a
little bit-- it's sometimes a

123
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,350
little tricky to identify
whether you're bonded to the

124
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,360
same group or different
groups.

125
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,310
But actually, let me not make
it too messy while we try to

126
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,340
figure this out.

127
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,820
To figure out whether it's
bonded to the same group,

128
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,750
let's kind of take a walk around
the cycle, around the

129
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,630
cyclopentane ring.

130
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,960
If we go this way, if we go on
a counter-- we'll do it in

131
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,170
different color.

132
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:19,960
If we go in a counterclockwise
direction from the carbon in

133
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,610
question, we're going
to hit a CH2.

134
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,020
Then we're going to hit a CH.

135
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,080
So we're going to hit a CH2,
then we're going to hit a CH.

136
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,163
If we go this way, we're going
to hit a CH2 and then we're

137
00:06:30,163 --> 00:06:31,610
going to hit another CH2.

138
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,980
So this guy is fundamentally--
this bond is bonded to a

139
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,760
different group than that
bond up there is.

140
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,230
It's also bonded to a hydrogen,

141
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,160
also bonded to a fluorine.

142
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,600
So this is bonded to four
different groups, so this is a

143
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,980
chiral carbon, so that
is a chiral center.

144
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,520
   

145
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,870
Now, the exact same argument
can be made for this carbon

146
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,300
right here.

147
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,610
You can make that exact same
argument, that, look, if you

148
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:03,890
were to walk counterclockwise
from this, you'd hit a CH2,

149
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,050
then a CH2.

150
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,800
If you were to go clockwise,
you'd have CH2, then a CH,

151
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,830
which happens to be connected
to a fluorine.

152
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,730
So you're actually going to
see something different,

153
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:16,190
depending whether you're going
down into that group or into

154
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:16,970
that group.

155
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,250
And then it's also bonded to a
hydrogen and a fluorine, four

156
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,180
different groups.

157
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,440
This is also a chiral center.

158
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,510
Another way to think about it,
and it's actually interesting

159
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:30,110
to compare it to this molecule
up here, which was not chiral

160
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,350
and did not have a chiral
center, this molecule up

161
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,830
here-- let me draw it a little
different to make it a little

162
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,080
bit more clear.

163
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,940
   

164
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,400
So this one, I could
draw it like this.

165
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,970
   

166
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,930
If you have the chlorine like
that, over here, we thought

167
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,290
about this as a potential chiral
center, and it's kind

168
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:59,050
of playing the same role as in
that example down here, but

169
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,110
you see over here, this is not
a chiral center because

170
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:05,050
there's actually an axis of
symmetry for this molecule

171
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,260
that goes through that carbon.

172
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,980
So you can actually just draw an
axis of symmetry that goes

173
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:14,910
exactly through that carbon.

174
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,600
The way I drew it, it's not
completely neat, but you can

175
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,920
see that that is the reflection
of that, if I were

176
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,020
to draw the bonds actually a
little bit more symmetric.

177
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:26,050
Over here, if we try to do the
exact same thing, if we try to

178
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:29,170
draw an axis of symmetry over
here, if we try to draw an

179
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,370
axis of symmetry, we can make
that bond to the fluorine go

180
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:34,080
through our axis of symmetry,,
we'll see that that still is

181
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,212
not the reflection of
this because we have

182
00:08:36,212 --> 00:08:37,330
a fluorine up here.

183
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,320
We don't have a fluorine
over here.

184
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,039
Now, we can do the same
thing with this end.

185
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,230
If you try to do an axis of
symmetry, fluorine up there,

186
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,980
no fluorine over here.

187
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,790
So each of these are definitely
chiral centers,

188
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:53,700
while this carbon up here
was not a chiral center.

189
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,940
Now, the next question is, well,
this thing's got two

190
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,880
chiral centers, two
chiral carbons.

191
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,510
It's probably a chiral
molecule.

192
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,440
Everything else we've seen so
far, if you had a chiral

193
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,130
center, you had a
chiral molecule.

194
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,920
But let's take its
mirror image.

195
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,560
To take its mirror image, let me
clear out some real estate

196
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,760
over here, So let me
clear out this.

197
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,170
Let me clear it out.

198
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,660
So what's the mirror image
going to look like?

199
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,000
Let me draw first the mirror.

200
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,650
   

201
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:24,800
So the mirror image, you're
going to have a

202
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,620
fluorine over there.

203
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,920
Then you're going to bond to a
carbon, which is also bonded

204
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,030
to a hydrogen.

205
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,520
That's going to bond to a CH2.

206
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,670
That's going to bond to a CH.

207
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,390
That's the mirror
image of that,

208
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,800
which bonds to a fluorine.

209
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,530
That's the mirror
image of that.

210
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:41,910
And then you go down.

211
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:45,050
This is the mirror image
of CH2 here.

212
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,320
This is the mirror
image of this.

213
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,640
You connect them.

214
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,080
Now, these are mirror images
of each other.

215
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,020
But they are also the
exact same molecule.

216
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:56,720
I could just literally move this
guy over to the right,

217
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,650
and it would be superimposed.

218
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,600
They are exactly the same.

219
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,190
So even though we have two
chiral atoms, two chiral

220
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:07,770
carbons, the molecule as
a whole is not chiral.

221
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:12,120
   

222
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,990
It is a non-chiral molecule.

223
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,200
