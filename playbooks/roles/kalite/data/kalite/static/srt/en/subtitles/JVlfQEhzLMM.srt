1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,810
   

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,770
Make a table and solve.

3
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:06,060
A biologist is researching the
impact of three different

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,690
water-based sugar drinks on bees
ability to make honey.

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:15,540
He takes 2 liters of Drink A,
which contains 40% sugar.

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,490
So let me write this down.

7
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,900
Let me make our table and
then we can solve it.

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:27,560
So let's take amount of drink.

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,190
And then we'll say
percent sugar.

10
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,479
   

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,760
And then we can say sugar
quantity, so the actual

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,170
physical quantity of sugar.

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,180
   

14
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,490
Maybe I should say sugar amount,
or amount of sugar.

15
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:47,920
   

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,800
Now this first drink, Drink A,
it says he takes 2 liters of

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,110
Drink A, which contains
40% sugar.

18
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,390
The first column will be which
drink we're talking about, so

19
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,160
Drink A, he takes
2 liters of it.

20
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,730
   

21
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:12,040
It's 40% sugar.

22
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,750
So if we want the actual amount
of sugar in liters, we

23
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:21,220
just multiply 2 liters times
40%, or times 0.4.

24
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,080
Let me write times with a dot so
you don't think it's an x.

25
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:31,610
2 times 0.4, which is equal
to 0.8 liters of sugar.

26
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,580
So you have 0.8 liters
of sugar.

27
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,810
1.2 liters of I guess the other
stuff in there is water.

28
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,350
But it's 0.8 of the 2 liters
is sugar, which is 40%.

29
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:45,240
Now,, he adds 1.2 liters
of Drink B.

30
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:55,070
   

31
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,860
He finds that bees prefer this
new solution, Drink C.

32
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,150
So when you add these two
together, you end

33
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,400
up with Drink C.

34
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,730
   

35
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,350
And we end up with how
much of Drink C?

36
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:12,770
2 plus 1.2 is 3.2 liters
of Drink C, which

37
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,420
has 25% sugar content.

38
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:22,110
So this is 25% sugar, which also
says we know the amount

39
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,170
of sugar in it.

40
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:27,600
Because if we have 3.2 liters
of it and it's 25% sugar, or

41
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,970
it's 1/4 sugar, that means that
we have 0.8 liters of

42
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:32,670
sugar here.

43
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:39,380
So this is 0.8 liters
of sugar.

44
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,060
Well, that I already wrote
in the column name.

45
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,090
That's the amount of sugar.

46
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,550
It's 25% sugar.

47
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,350
We have 3.2 liters of it.

48
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,760
Now, they want to know what
is the percentage of

49
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,580
sugar in Drink B?

50
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,990
So let's just call that x.

51
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:56,030
   

52
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,690
So that's right over here.

53
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:03,030
Now, if it's x percent sugar
here, or this is the decimal

54
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,970
equivalent, that's x, how
much sugar do we have?

55
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,770
We have 1.2 liters times the
decimal equivalent of sugar,

56
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,660
so this is going to
be 1.2 times x.

57
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,720
   

58
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,790
Now let's think about it.

59
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:22,560
We have 0.8 liters of sugar in
Drink A, and when you add this

60
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,550
amount to it, you still have
0.8 liters of actual

61
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,080
sugar in Drink C.

62
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,980
So this thing has to
be equal to zero.

63
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,250
We could set up an
equation here.

64
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:42,770
We could write 0.8 plus
1.2x is equal to 0.8.

65
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,930
You subtract 0.8 from
both sides.

66
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:50,000
You get 1.2x is equal to 0. x
has got to be equal to 0.

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,570
So this thing right here
has got to be zero.

68
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,280
There's no sugar in Drink B.

69
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,250
It's just got to be
like 1.2 liters.

70
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,170
I guess the solution is water.

71
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,420
So it's 1.2 liters of water.

72
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,670
There's no sugar in Drink B.

73
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,080
It is 0% sugar.

74
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,333
