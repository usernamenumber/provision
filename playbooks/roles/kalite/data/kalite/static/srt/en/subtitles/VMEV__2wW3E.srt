1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760
   

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,390
So they tell us that Hiram
solved the equation, 5 plus

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:08,930
the square root of x plus 14
is equal to x plus 7, using

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:09,800
the following steps.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,950
Let's see what he did.

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,830
He subtracted 5 from
both sides.

7
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:13,860
Yeah, that's reasonable
enough.

8
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,030
That got that 5 out
of the way.

9
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,120
And then 7 minus 5 is 2.

10
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,850
And then he squared
both sides.

11
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:22,690
The square root of x plus 14
squared is just x plus 14.

12
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,310
That makes sense.

13
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,700
And x plus 2 squared is
x plus 2 squared.

14
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,040
And then he uses the pattern for
square binomials to expand

15
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:31,690
the right-hand side.

16
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:35,220
OK, so he just multiplied out
x plus 2, times x plus 2, to

17
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,650
get x squared plus 4x, plus 4.

18
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,975
Then he subtracted x plus 14
from both sides, so he gets a

19
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:41,830
0 on the left-hand side.

20
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:44,260
So when you take x from
4x, you get 3x.

21
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:48,650
When you take 14 from 4
you get negative 10.

22
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:49,840
So that all makes sense.

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,450
Then he factored the
right-hand side.

24
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,580
Let's see, 5 times negative
2 is negative 10.

25
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,540
5 plus negative 2 is 3.

26
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,320
That makes sense.

27
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,480
Then he uses a 0 product
property

28
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,280
to solve the equation.

29
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,330
That's just this property--
look, if you have two things

30
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,950
and you take their product and
it equals 0, one or both of

31
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,610
them must be equal to 0.

32
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,920
So that means x plus 5 is equal
to 0, or x minus 2 is

33
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,950
equal to 0.

34
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,660
And so if x plus 5 is equal
to 0, that's x is equal to

35
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,710
negative 5.

36
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,190
x is equal to 2 of 0, that's
x is equal to 2.

37
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,550
Let me just write
that down here.

38
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,070
So all he did in this step
is he says, x plus

39
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,700
5 is equal to 0.

40
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,210
Or x minus 2 is equal to 0.

41
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,320
From this you get this right
over here, because you

42
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,670
subtract 5 from both sides.

43
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,620
And then from this you get
that right over there.

44
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,820
Then he checked both answers.

45
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,200
He substituted negative 5 into
the original equation.

46
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,762
So he substituted negative
5 in there.

47
00:01:41,762 --> 00:01:43,230
It shows up twice.

48
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,610
5 plus the square root of
negative 5, plus 14 is equal

49
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,370
to negative 5 plus 7.

50
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,410
Let's see what else he did.

51
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,405
Then this becomes square
root of 9.

52
00:01:50,405 --> 00:01:51,420
This becomes 2.

53
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,070
Then you get 5 plus 3 is equal
to 2, which is false.

54
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,280
This is not true.

55
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,790
And he wrote that down.

56
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,430
And then he tried out 2.

57
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,740
His other solution.

58
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,950
When you substitute 2 you get
2 plus 14, which is 16.

59
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,960
2 plus 7 is 9.

60
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,340
Square root of 16 is 4.

61
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,410
And this is the principal root
of 16 we're talking about, so

62
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,940
we're taking the positive
square root.

63
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,150
And then 5 plus 4
is equal to 9.

64
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,900
So this works out.

65
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,785
And then he says that
the answer is x

66
00:02:14,785 --> 00:02:16,590
equals 2, which is right.

67
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,810
Now this whole exercise, all
they want us to know is, is

68
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,900
this an example of deductive
reasoning?

69
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,210
Explain.

70
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,760
And it is an example of
deductive reasoning.

71
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,540
He started off with a known
statement, with a known-- we

72
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,160
could call that a known
fact-- if we assume

73
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,070
that that's a fact.

74
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,460
He started off with that.

75
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,440
And just doing logical
operations, he was able to

76
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,370
deduce, step by step,
he was able to

77
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,860
manipulate other truths.

78
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,020
He started with a fact and using
logical operations he

79
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,050
was able to come up
with other facts.

80
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,580
And go all the way down here
and then check his answers,

81
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,680
and eventually come up with
the notion that if this is

82
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,930
true, then this must
also be true.

83
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,420
So that is deductive
reasoning.

84
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,020
You start with facts, use
logical steps or operations,

85
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,030
or logical reasoning to come
up with other facts.

86
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,200
He's not estimating.

87
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
He's not generalizing.

88
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,350
He's not assuming some
trend will continue.

89
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,310
He started with something he
knows is true and gets to

90
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,990
something else he
knows is true.

91
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,010
And this is a bit of a review.

92
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,520
You're probably wondering
why the

93
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,480
negative 5 wasn't a solution.

94
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,780
And as a little bit of a hint
here-- and I'll let you think

95
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,050
about why it didn't end up as a
solution-- when we took the

96
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,460
square root of 9 here, we took
the positive square root.

97
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,110
And when anyone just says a
square root like that, that

98
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,710
means the positive
square root, the

99
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,330
principal square root.

100
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,670
But if we were to take the
negative square root here,

101
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,640
this equation would
have held up.

102
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,200
Because 5 plus negative
3 is equal to 2.

103
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,780
So I'll let you think about at
what step of this equation

104
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,530
would a negative number
have worked?

105
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,810
And it has something
to do with when

106
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,200
we square both sides.

107
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,890
But that has nothing to do with
the actual question at

108
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,190
hand, so I'll leave you there.

109
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,360
We explained it before,
in the past. So this

110
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,480
was deductive reasoning.

111
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:56,666
