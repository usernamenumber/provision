1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,910
   

2
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:03,860
I've been wanting to make a
video on a couple of terms

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,050
that people have really thrown
around for a while now.

4
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,190
And I think it really hits the
core of some of the issues

5
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,230
we're dealing with now with the
credit debacle but it's

6
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,550
kind of at a deeper level.

7
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:20,970
So the things I want to go over
are the ideas of savings,

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:28,150
consumption, and investment.

9
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,460
And you hear these a lot.

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,980
Everyone obviously says, I've
invested in the stock market

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,440
or I've invested in a house and
I really want to give you

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,740
a framework for how I think
about these ideas.

13
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:44,180
And frankly, I haven't seen them
depicted this way in any

14
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,210
economics book, although they've
kind of touched on

15
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,320
this, but I think this is really
how you should think

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,690
about these things.

17
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,680
So if you save money, and I
think we all know what that

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,950
means, that's money that you
didn't spend, there's a couple

19
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,370
of things that you
can do with it.

20
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,800
You can either consume
your money or you

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,130
could invest your money.

22
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,530
So, let's just think about a
bunch of different situations

23
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:07,110
and think about whether those
things are consumption or

24
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,720
investment.

25
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:15,066
So let's say, I have $100,000
that I'm dealing with.

26
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:17,350
So let's say, I take
that $100,000

27
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,415
and I build a factory.

28
00:01:19,415 --> 00:01:23,100
   

29
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,080
And I think that that factory
is going to be able to

30
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,662
produce-- I'll make up some
product-- it'll be able to

31
00:01:29,662 --> 00:01:33,640
produce cars more efficiently
and cheaper than any other car

32
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,130
factory out there.

33
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,060
Well, I think we'd all agree
that this is an investment.

34
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,390
And why is it an investment?

35
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,550
Because I'm taking this $100,000
and I'm putting it to

36
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:50,110
some use that is creating,
hopefully, more value than my

37
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,110
original $100,000.

38
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,220
In fact, I'm expecting some
type of a return on this

39
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:55,690
investment.

40
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,180
And I've made a bunch of videos
on what a return on

41
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,430
investment is, and you can
usually quantify it.

42
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,610
If I take a $100,000 and I build
this factory and this

43
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:08,710
factory spits out $50,000 a
year, it's probably creating

44
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,130
at least $50,000 a year value,
assuming that nothing corrupt

45
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,490
is happening in our system.

46
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:16,020
In fact, it's normally creating
more than $50,000 a

47
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,490
year of value.

48
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:20,930
It may be creating a $100,000 a
year of value and $50,000 of

49
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,910
that may be going to the
person who's doing the

50
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,150
production and then the other
half of the value is actually

51
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,740
going to the consumer
of whatever

52
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,730
this factory is making.

53
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,550
And you have to think about
it, because if all of the

54
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,150
value went to the person who
produced the factory then

55
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,380
there's not a huge incentive
for someone to use his

56
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,340
products anymore.

57
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,560
But anyway, that's not the
topic of discussion.

58
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,370
We're just trying to get at
a mental framework on what

59
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,640
consumption is versus
investment.

60
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,710
So I think we all agree that if
I were to build a factory

61
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,680
that this is-- let's say I'll
do everything in green as

62
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,320
investment.

63
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,180
So building a factory
is an investment.

64
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:00,460
Now let's say that I'm homeless

65
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,960
and I have this $100,000.

66
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,340
And because I'm homeless, I
don't have a place to go and

67
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,180
eat dinner and rest and relax.

68
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,360
Because I don't have that, I
can't get a job and I can't

69
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,340
become a productive
member of society.

70
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,830
So maybe, I'm going to use this
$100,000 to buy a simple

71
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,560
house that meets all
of my needs.

72
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,400
Let's say build a simple house,
and I'll do that in a

73
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,650
neutral color.

74
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:31,590
   

75
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,260
This is my other use of this
$100,000, instead of building

76
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,730
a factory, I'm going to
build a simple house.

77
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,830
And this house, it provides
shelter for me and my family,

78
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:43,160
it allows us that security that
now my kids can go to

79
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,640
school and they can
themselves become

80
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,720
more productive citizens.

81
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,410
I now have an address.

82
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,440
I have a place to take a shower,
that allows me to go

83
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,750
get a job and I can now create
value for society as a whole,

84
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,710
instead of being on the
corner and begging

85
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,220
for money from people.

86
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,880
I would argue that this
is also an investment.

87
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,340
Why is it?

88
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,460
Because I'm taking this
$100,000, that maybe I had or

89
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,150
someone gave to me, and it's
generating a return.

90
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,690
And what is that return?

91
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:12,940
Well, with a factory,
it's maybe a

92
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,770
little easier to quantify.

93
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:17,089
But at minimum, it's this work
that I'm able to do because I

94
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:17,970
now have a house.

95
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,670
Because I have the security,
I have the address.

96
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,399
I have the shelter.

97
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,880
I'm able to relax.

98
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,360
It's that security and it's also
the return that probably

99
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,420
my kids are going to be able to
now contribute to society.

100
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,150
Maybe if they grew up homeless,
they would have

101
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,500
never been able to contribute.

102
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,120
And now that they have a roof
over their head, and are able

103
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,670
to go to school, et cetera, they
are going to be able to

104
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,130
give some economic value
back to society.

105
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,920
It's hard to value, maybe I
didn't have any job before and

106
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,970
now I have a job and
I can contribute

107
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,480
$30,000 a year to society.

108
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,670
Maybe I'm working at
someone's factory.

109
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,130
Maybe I'm providing
some other-- maybe

110
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,260
I'm a farmer now.

111
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,330
Whatever, I'm providing
some source of value.

112
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,390
And maybe my kids-- if they
never got an education, they

113
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:59,300
would have maybe added $10,000
of value per year to people

114
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,120
and now they can add
$20,000 of value.

115
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,520
So that difference would also be
some of the return on this

116
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,280
investment.

117
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,880
So I also consider this
to be an investment.

118
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,730
Now, my question to you is,
let's say that I already had a

119
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,570
house-- so this is
an investment.

120
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,900
Let's say I already had a house
and my family is happy

121
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,020
and we have everything
we need.

122
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,820
We have food on the table and
my kids go to school and I'm

123
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,360
able to get a job and
all of that exists.

124
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,960
But let's say, I still have
a $100,000 and I use that

125
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:40,350
$100,000-- I'll do it in
yellow-- to put in some

126
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,650
granite counter tops.

127
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,940
   

128
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,960
I have some money left over,
let's say, I'm going to add a

129
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:55,360
bathroom to my house and I will
put the latest hardwood

130
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,990
floors, so that my family
will be impressed.

131
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:01,660
You can imagine.

132
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,410
And maybe I add 2,000
square feet.

133
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,620
You normally can't get all
that for a $100,000 but I

134
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,990
think you'll bear with me.

135
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,750
So I'm essentially doing some
major home improvements.

136
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,160
So my question to you is-- is
this an investment or is this

137
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,620
consumption?

138
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,480
Now, in our everyday world, with
most people we deal with,

139
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,280
they will call this investment
in my house.

140
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,080
And why are they saying that?

141
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,990
Because they say, by spending
a $100,000 in the house in

142
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,050
this way, that maybe-- if you
watch the Home and Garden

143
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,210
channel, they're doing this
all the time-- that if you

144
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:36,150
pour this a $100,000 into your
house, that maybe the value of

145
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,170
your house is going to
increase by $150,000.

146
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,990
Or someone else, all of a
sudden, is going to perceive

147
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,690
the value of your house
as being $150,000.

148
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:48,390
They'll say, well, you got a
$50,000 return on investment.

149
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,440
I'd argue that that
is not investment.

150
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,070
That it's speculation.

151
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:56,000
You are, essentially, piling
money into this stuff-- and

152
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,930
I'll do this in red,
consumption is red.

153
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:02,500
   

154
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,080
What's happening here
truly economically?

155
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,220
When you add granite, or you
add an extra bathroom or

156
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,080
hardwood floors or this extra
2,000 square feet, is it

157
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,260
making anyone who's living in
that house more productive?

158
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,670
Is it making you harder working;
is it making you more

159
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:20,680
likely to invent the cure for
cancer, or more likely to

160
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:26,120
invent a way of getting
cheap energy, or

161
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,390
produce more widgets?

162
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:31,900
No, it's just, if anything,
providing more things for you

163
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,220
to have to take care of, that
you're not going to be able to

164
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,480
focus as much on your work.

165
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,790
Or more energy is going to
have to be extended to

166
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,060
maintain this type of place,
to heat and cool a 2,000

167
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,020
square foot house.

168
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,100
So if anything, by actually
pouring the $100,000 here,

169
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,920
you're actually creating
something that is going to

170
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,420
suck more out of society.

171
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,440
In fact, in no way is this going
to contribute to the

172
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,870
collective wealth of society.

173
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,770
The last two examples I gave
contribute to the collective

174
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,530
wealth society, some of which
you share, and that is your

175
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,710
return on the investment.

176
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,950
But as a whole, this is an
investment into society.

177
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:07,360
And it's going to make
the pie bigger.

178
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,750
This right here, does not
make the pie bigger.

179
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,130
It might make you a little bit
happier, make your ego feel a

180
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,880
little bit better, let your
pride grow, and your self

181
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,210
righteousness grow, and show
other people that you've

182
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:21,490
arrived, but it's not
going to increase

183
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,890
the wealth of society.

184
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,980
And when you say that you've
invested, you are really just

185
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,720
saying I've speculated.

186
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,340
What you're saying is-- by
paying this $100,000, you're

187
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:33,260
going to find, essentially,
a greater fool out there.

188
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,830
They could have done the same
thing, they could have bought

189
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:38,210
your house, spent $100,000 and
done this, if this is what

190
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,640
would have made them happy.

191
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,169
But what you're saying is,
essentially, that you're going

192
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:45,730
to find somebody out there who's
willing to pay $150,000

193
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,060
extra for something that should

194
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,970
have only cost $100,000.

195
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,800
And in fact, if anything, if you
use this at all, the value

196
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,850
of this is going to go down.

197
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,060
So you're just somehow assuming
that the granite

198
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,110
counter tops that you choose are
going to be the taste that

199
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,080
someone else would like or that
the hardwood floors are

200
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,680
going to be the taste someone
else would like.

201
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,280
I would actually argue that when
you customize your house

202
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,820
in this way, you are creating
$100,000 of consumption to

203
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,710
your taste.

204
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,660
And I'd be surprised if someone
else, truly, is

205
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,820
willing to pay more than
$100,000 unless they're being,

206
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,360
in some way, irrational or they
can finance this because

207
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,150
it's part of the mortgage.

208
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:27,700
Anyway, this is, I think, just
the big picture: investment

209
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,400
adds value to society.

210
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,480
A simple house adds
value to society.

211
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,230
Consumption is something where
people might call it an

212
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,460
investment because it's
kind of speculation.

213
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,840
One might find some other guy
willing to emotionally pay

214
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,710
more for something.

215
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:46,820
But it's money that's burned;
it's not creating more value

216
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,970
for society.

217
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,220
I continue this in
the next video.

218
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,400
