1
00:00:00,766 --> 00:00:02,766
Find the absolute value of x

2
00:00:02,766 --> 00:00:09,336
when x=5, x= -10 and x=-12

3
00:00:09,336 --> 00:00:11,032
So the absolute value,

4
00:00:11,032 --> 00:00:14,382
the way of writing it is almost

5
00:00:14,382 --> 00:00:16,499
more complicated than what it acutally is.

6
00:00:16,499 --> 00:00:21,516
The absolute value is really just the distance of x from 0.

7
00:00:21,516 --> 00:00:25,632
distance from 0

8
00:00:25,632 --> 00:00:28,581
So let me just draw a fast number line over here.

9
00:00:28,581 --> 00:00:31,988
So let's just put zero right over here,

10
00:00:31,988 --> 00:00:34,982
since we are taking the distance from 0.

11
00:00:34,982 --> 00:00:39,785
So, let's just think about absolute value of x, when x=5.

12
00:00:39,785 --> 00:00:43,164
That's equivalent to the absolute value for 5.

13
00:00:43,164 --> 00:00:45,351
We just substitue 5 for x.

14
00:00:45,351 --> 00:00:48,816
The absolute value of 5 is the distance of 5 from 0.

15
00:00:48,816 --> 00:00:51,967
So you go 1,2,3,4,5,

16
00:00:51,967 --> 00:00:55,448
5 is exactly 5 to the right of 0.

17
00:00:55,448 --> 00:00:59,849
So the absolute value of 5 is just 5.

18
00:00:59,849 --> 00:01:01,581
Now, i think you already get to see,

19
00:01:01,581 --> 00:01:02,765
this is a pretty straight forward concept.

20
00:01:02,765 --> 00:01:04,140
Now, let's just do something a little more interesting,

21
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,325
Absolute value of -10.

22
00:01:07,325 --> 00:01:10,484
or the absolute value of x, when x= -10.

23
00:01:10,484 --> 00:01:12,781
Let's just put in -10 in for x.

24
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:16,420
This is the distance -10 is from 0.

25
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:24,039
So let's just go: -1,-2,-3,-4,-5,-6,-7,-8,-9,-10.

26
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:26,349
I should extend the number line more.

27
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:28,500
So this right here is -10.

28
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,053
So how far is it away from 0?

29
00:01:32,053 --> 00:01:34,700
Well, it is 10 to the left of 0,

30
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,949
so, you put a 10 here.

31
00:01:36,949 --> 00:01:40,672
So in general absolute value will always be a positive quantity.

32
00:01:40,672 --> 00:01:45,087
If we are thinking abot absolute value of just numbers,

33
00:01:45,087 --> 00:01:48,533
it is just going to be really the positive version of that number.

34
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:49,949
Let's do one more.

35
00:01:49,949 --> 00:01:51,448
Well they tell us to do one more.

36
00:01:51,448 --> 00:01:54,915
The absolute value of x, when x=-12.

37
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:58,233
So we have the absolute value of -12.

38
00:01:58,233 --> 00:01:59,577
We don't even have to look at the number line,

39
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:02,649
is just going to be the positive version of -12,

40
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:05,149
is just going to be equal to 12.

41
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:09,333
and this is saying that -12 is 12 away from 0.

42
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,798
We can draw it over here.

43
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,742
This is -11,-12 is right over here,

44
00:02:12,742 --> 99:59:59,999
it is 1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7.8,9,10,11,12 away from 0.
