1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,610
   

2
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:05,310
In the last video, we came up
with a 95% confidence interval

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,610
for the mean weight loss between
the low-fat group and

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,950
the control group.

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,280
In this video, I actually want
to do a hypothesis test,

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,220
really to test if this data
makes us believe that the

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,590
low-fat diet actually does
anything at all.

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,980
And to do that let's set up
our null and alternative

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,380
hypotheses.

10
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:29,610
So our null hypothesis
should be that this

11
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,560
low-fat diet does nothing.

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,280
And if the low-fat diet does
nothing, that means that the

13
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:41,330
population mean on our low-fat
diet minus the population mean

14
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,690
on our control should
be equal to zero.

15
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:49,810
And this is a completely
equivalent statement to saying

16
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:55,760
that the mean of the sampling
distribution of our low-fat

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,150
diet minus the mean of the
sampling distribution of our

18
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,780
control should be
equal to zero.

19
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,970
And that's because we've seen
this multiple times.

20
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,570
The mean of your sampling
distribution is going to be

21
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,700
the same thing as your
population mean.

22
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,470
So this is the same
thing is that.

23
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,940
That is the same
thing is that.

24
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:18,580
Or, another way of saying it is,
if we think about the mean

25
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,870
of the distribution of the
difference of the sample

26
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,420
means, and we focused on this
in the last video, that that

27
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,580
should be equal to zero.

28
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:31,480
Because this thing right over
here is the same thing as that

29
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,400
right over there.

30
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,380
So that is our null
hypothesis.

31
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,530
And our alternative hypothesis,

32
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,420
I'll write over here.

33
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,295
It's just that it actually
does do something.

34
00:01:44,295 --> 00:01:49,310
   

35
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,960
And let's say that it actually
has an improvement.

36
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,270
So that would mean that we
have more weight loss.

37
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,390
So if we have the mean of Group
One, the population mean

38
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,570
of Group One minus the
population mean of Group Two

39
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,350
should be greater then zero.

40
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:07,050
So this is going to be a one
tailed distribution.

41
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:13,460
Or another way we can view it,
is that the mean of the

42
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:17,470
difference of the distributions,
x1 minus x2 is

43
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,270
going to be greater then zero.

44
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,360
These are equivalent
statements.

45
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,160
Because we know that this is the
same thing as this, which

46
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,920
is the same thing as this,
which is what I

47
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,380
wrote right over here.

48
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,200
Now, to do any type of
hypothesis test, we have to

49
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,825
decide on a level
of significance.

50
00:02:31,825 --> 00:02:35,420
   

51
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,580
What we're going to do is, we're
going to assume that our

52
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,390
null hypothesis is correct.

53
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,200
And then with that assumption
that the null hypothesis is

54
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,110
correct, we're going to see
what is the probability of

55
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,330
getting this sample data
right over here.

56
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:54,570
And if that probability is below
some threshold, we will

57
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,090
reject the null hypothesis in
favor of the alternative

58
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,050
hypothesis.

59
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,150
Now, that probability threshold,
and we've seen this

60
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,390
before, is called the
significance level, sometimes

61
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,560
called alpha.

62
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,340
And here, we're going to decide
for a significance

63
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,960
level of 95%.

64
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,150
Or another way to think about
it, assuming that the null

65
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,770
hypothesis is correct, we want
there to be no more than a 5%

66
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,410
chance of getting this
result here.

67
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:26,240
Or no more than a 5% chance of
incorrectly rejecting the null

68
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,170
hypothesis when it
is actually true.

69
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,470
Or that would be a
type one error.

70
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:36,290
So if there's less than a 5%
probability of this happening,

71
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,450
we're going to reject
the null hypothesis.

72
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,130
Less than a 5% probability given
the null hypothesis is

73
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,480
true, then we're going to reject
the null hypothesis in

74
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,630
favor of the alternative.

75
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,990
So let's think about this.

76
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,960
So we have the null
hypothesis.

77
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,330
Let me draw a distribution
over here.

78
00:03:52,330 --> 00:04:01,180
The null hypothesis says that
the mean of the differences of

79
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,470
the sampling distributions
should be equal to zero.

80
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:10,550
Now, in that situation, what
is going to be our critical

81
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,510
region here?

82
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,110
Well, we need a result, so
we're going to need some

83
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:20,959
critical value here.

84
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:28,010
Because this isn't a
normalized normal

85
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,180
distribution.

86
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,070
But there's some critical
value here.

87
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:35,340
   

88
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,880
The hardest thing is statistics
is getting the

89
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,760
wording right.

90
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,440
There's some critical value here
that the probability of

91
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,750
getting a sample from this
distribution above that value

92
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,000
is only 5%.

93
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,280
   

94
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,940
So we just need to figure out
what this critical value is.

95
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,490
And if our value is larger than
that critical value, then

96
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,300
we can reject the
null hypothesis.

97
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,050
Because that means the
probability of getting this is

98
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,460
less than 5%.

99
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,550
We could reject the null
hypothesis and go with the

100
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,860
alternative hypothesis.

101
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,760
Remember, once again, we can
use Z-scores, and we can

102
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,510
assume this is a normal
distribution because our

103
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,280
sample size is large for either
of those samples.

104
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,700
We have a sample size of 100.

105
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:25,660
And to figure that out, the
first step, if we just look at

106
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:33,240
a normalized normal distribution
like this, what

107
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,650
is your critical Z value?

108
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:39,000
   

109
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,340
We're getting a result
above that Z value,

110
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,960
only has a 5% chance.

111
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,080
So this is actually
cumulative.

112
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,280
So this whole area right
over here is

113
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,310
going to be 95% chance.

114
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,760
We can just look
at the Z table.

115
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,660
We're looking for 95% percent.

116
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,390
We're looking at the
one tailed case.

117
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,150
So let's look for 95%.

118
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,550
This is the closest thing.

119
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:04,090
We want to err on the side of
being a little bit maybe to

120
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,210
the right of this.

121
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,040
So let's say 95.05
is pretty good.

122
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,150
So that's 1.65.

123
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:15,100
So this critical Z value
is equal to 1.65.

124
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,940
Or another way to view it is,
this distance right here is

125
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,490
going to be 1.65 standard
deviations.

126
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:26,510
   

127
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,530
I know my writing
is really small.

128
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,160
I'm just saying the standard
deviation of that

129
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,220
distribution.

130
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,290
So what is the standard
deviation of that

131
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:32,750
distribution?

132
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,750
We actually calculated it in
the last video, and I'll

133
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,080
recalculate it here.

134
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:42,340
The standard deviation of our
distribution of the difference

135
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:47,330
of the sample means is going to
be equal to the square root

136
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,320
of the variance of our
first population.

137
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,820
Now, the variance of our first
population, we don't know it.

138
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,500
But we could estimate it with
our sample standard deviation.

139
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,540
If you take your sample standard
deviation, 4.67 and

140
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,940
you square it, you get
your sample variance.

141
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,320
And so this is the variance.

142
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:10,430
This is our best estimate
of the variance of the

143
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,330
population.

144
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,510
And we want to divide that
by the sample size.

145
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:20,310
And then plus our best estimate
of the variance of

146
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:25,560
the population of group two,
which is 4.04 squared.

147
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,410
The sample standard deviation
of group two squared.

148
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,670
That gives us variance
divided by 100.

149
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:34,440
I did before in the last. Maybe
it's still sitting on my

150
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,190
calculator.

151
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,610
Yes, it's still sitting
on the calculator.

152
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,930
It's this quantity
right up here.

153
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:43,300
4.67 squared divided
by 100 plus 4.04

154
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,150
squared divided by 100.

155
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,510
So it's 0.617.

156
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:58,060
So this right here is
going to be 0.617.

157
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:02,410
So this distance right
here, is going to

158
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:05,750
be 1.65 times 0.617.

159
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,550
So let's figure out
what that is.

160
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:17,090
So let's take 0.617
times 1.65.

161
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:23,470
So it's 1.02.

162
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:28,300
This distance right
here is 1.02.

163
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:35,990
So what this tells us is, if
we assume that the diet

164
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:42,630
actually does nothing, there's a
only a 5% chance of having a

165
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:48,130
difference between the means of
these two samples to have a

166
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,360
difference of more than 1.02.

167
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,330
There's only a 5%
chance of that.

168
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:58,540
Well, the mean that we
actually got is 1.91.

169
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,580
So that's sitting out
here someplace.

170
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,860
So it definitely falls in
this critical region.

171
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:07,540
The probability of getting this,
assuming that the null

172
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,890
hypothesis is correct,
is less than 5%.

173
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:17,400
So it's smaller probability than
our significance level.

174
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,650
Actually, let me
be very clear.

175
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,860
The significance level,
this alpha right

176
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,890
here, needs to be 5%.

177
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,760
Not the 95%.

178
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,870
I think I might have
said here.

179
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,330
But I wrote down the
wrong number there.

180
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,670
I subtracted it from
one by accident.

181
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,650
Probably in my head.

182
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,740
But anyway, the significance
level is 5%.

183
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:40,270
The probability given that the
null hypothesis is true, the

184
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:44,070
probability of getting the
result that we got, the

185
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,950
probability of getting that
difference, is less than our

186
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,030
significance level.

187
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,080
It is less than 5%.

188
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,730
So based on the rules that we
set out for ourselves of

189
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:58,140
having a significance level of
5%, we will reject the null

190
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,830
hypothesis in favor of the
alternative that the diet

191
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:05,380
actually does make you
lose more weight.

192
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:05,799
