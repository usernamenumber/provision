00:00:05,064 --> 00:00:10,445
In so much 19th century paiting, figures and act of narrative are kind of a story before us,

2
00:00:10,445 --> 00:00:13,464
and we watch them as if we were an audience looking into the space.

3
00:00:13,464 --> 00:00:18,798
But with the work of Caspar David Friedrich , so often he gives us a small lone figure.

4
00:00:18,798 --> 00:00:23,127
And instead of looking towards that figure we instantly become that figure.

5
00:00:23,127 --> 00:00:26,084
We begin to see what the figure sees.

6
00:00:26,084 --> 00:00:29,894
And that is excatly what we have here in the "Monk by the sea",

7
00:00:29,894 --> 00:00:35,276
which is in so many ways a really radically modern pared down image.

8
00:00:35,276 --> 00:00:39,682
We have this vast sky and it takes up the preponderance of the canvas.

9
00:00:39,682 --> 00:00:42,712
It looks cold and it is clear at the top.

10
00:00:42,712 --> 00:00:48,431
These whisps of the clouds, but then it becomes much darker, and much more menacing.

11
00:00:48,431 --> 00:00:51,483
The ocean below looks freezing cold, it is almost black.

12
00:00:51,483 --> 00:00:54,723
We could just make out large swells of the waves

13
00:00:54,723 --> 00:01:00,818
and then below that the cold winter dunes presumably near Greifswald in northern Germany.

14
00:01:00,818 --> 00:01:05,240
This is the Baltic coast and we see that monk below the sea's horizon line.

15
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,957
And because the figure that we are looking at is a monk

16
00:01:08,957 --> 00:01:13,666
we associate that figure we questions of the spiritual.

17
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:17,979
And so we immdediately turn our thoughts in that direction.

18
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:22,366
He is caught in those narrow bands of the earthways.

19
00:01:22,366 --> 00:01:25,328
He is below the horizon line, but he is aware,

20
00:01:25,328 --> 00:01:30,529
and we then become aware of the vastness of the spiritual room of the sky above,

21
00:01:30,529 --> 00:01:34,814
but also the threatening nature of the world, which we inhabit.

22
00:01:34,814 --> 00:01:40,437
Those whitecaps are just picking up the tops of the really substantial waves

23
00:01:40,437 --> 00:01:43,432
and we can feel the power of nature, the power of that ocean.

24
00:01:43,432 --> 00:01:50,382
I think that notion of the sublime was a very important idea at the end of the 18th and in the 19th century.

25
00:01:50,382 --> 00:01:56,062
This is an ancient idea that was revived probably most famously by Edmund Burke, England.

26
00:01:56,062 --> 00:02:04,205
The idea was that there is a kind of beauty that is actually all inspiring through its power and its terror.

27
00:02:04,205 --> 00:02:10,819
And that was a way of directly confronting God's presence in our world.

28
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:19,036
It is both the vastness of nature and smallness of man and powerlessness of man.

29
00:02:19,036 --> 00:02:21,382
And this figure, it seems to look towards the right.

30
00:02:21,382 --> 00:02:26,349
We know originally that Fredricio painted a ship on the horizon,

31
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:30,350
which certainly would have made the scene much more moundane.

32
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:34,579
You know, the idea of the 19th century is, the time most associated with the man's control over nature.

33
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:38,281
And this is a kind of antidote to that.

34
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:41,897
This is saying no in fact, nature is far greater than us.

35
00:02:41,897 --> 00:02:47,548
Our technological advances are allowing us to feel as if we have conquered nature.

36
00:02:47,548 --> 00:02:52,311
Here is a humble reminder that the opposite is really true.

37
00:02:52,311 --> 00:02:56,131
It is right around this time that Mary Shelly is writing Frankeinstein,

38
00:02:56,131 --> 00:03:00,264
where man has the ultimate power of creating life like God

39
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:07,085
and doctor Frankeinstein is punished for the pride that makes him think he can rival God.

40
00:03:07,085 --> 00:03:12,830
So I think it is really true that at this moment, at the beginning of the industrial revolution,

41
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:19,113
we have the sense of our own power, and at the same time we question that power.

42
00:03:19,113 --> 00:03:22,013
You know the 19th century, I think one of the key questions is

43
00:03:22,013 --> 00:03:32,100
how can the grand power of God of spirituality be represented in our more scientific, more industrialised culture.

44
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,616
So the "Monk by the sea" is meant to be seen with a pendant.

45
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:42,230
In fact it is currently hung in the Museum just to the left of the Abbey in the Oakwood.

46
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:46,070
It is a wonderful pair of paintings, because they are both deep winter

47
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:49,386
the monk that is so contemplative and the monk by the sea

48
00:03:49,386 --> 00:03:56,255
is thought to have been the figure that has been carried in the coffin in the Abbey in the Oakwood.
