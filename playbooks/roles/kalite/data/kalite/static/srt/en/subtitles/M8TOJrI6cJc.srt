1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,960
So we're at problem 76.

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,270
Which of the following ratios is most nearly equal to

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:13,350
the ratio of 1 plus the square root of 5 to 2.

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,950
And then they give us a bunch of integer choices,

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,930
so this is really just a problem of approximating

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,660
what the square root of 5 is.

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,470
So let's think about this a little bit.

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,900
So 2 is equal to the square root of 4,

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,980
or 2 squared is equal to 4.

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,540
3 is equal to the square root of 9.

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,520
So the square root of 5 is going to be a lot closer to 2.

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:44,890
What's 2.1 squared? 2.1 times 2.1 you get 21.

13
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,870
0,2 times 21 is 42.

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:57,280
So then you get,4.41 So 2.1 is equal to square root of 4.41.

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:11,540
2.2 times 2.2,2 is 44,0,44,this gets pretty close to 5. 8,4.

16
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,640
So 2.2 is I think about as close as we're going to get.

17
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,310
If we approximate the square root of 5 is 2.2,

18
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,440
and this is just an approximation,we just have to figure out

19
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:30,730
which choice is closest,1 plus 2.2 over 2,that's equal to 3.2

20
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:35,070
over 2,and that's not one of the choices,

21
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,380
because this really isn't an integer choice.

22
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,210
But let's see if I can just express this,

23
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:46,330
this is equal to 1.6. It'd give you 1.6:1.

24
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,660
So we just have to find which of the choices

25
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,480
are roughly equal to 1.6:1.

26
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:57,410
So choice A,8:5.

27
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:04,970
Well what is that? That's 1 and 3/5. Well that's exactly 1.6.

28
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,650
So that's the choice I'm going to go with.

29
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,450
Let me look at the other ones.

30
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:14,640
6:5 is going to be a lot closer to 1,6:5 is 1.2,5:4

31
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,880
is 1.25,2:1 is 2. So choice A is the best choice.

32
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:26,810
Next question. Problem 77. Let me scroll down a little bit.

33
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:38,140
7 over 1/5 plus 5 over 1/7 is equal to--

34
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,080
7 divided by 1/5 is equal to 7 times 5,

35
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,990
plus 5 divided by 1/7 is equal to 5 times 7.

36
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,630
When you divide by a fraction,

37
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,520
it's the same thing as multiplying by its reciprocal.

38
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,300
So 5 times 7. So this is equal to 35 plus 35,

39
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:03,860
which is equal to 70, and that's choice D. 78.

40
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:11,040
From January 1,1991,to January 1,1993,the number of

41
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,160
people enrolled in health maintenance organizations

42
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,750
increased by 15%.

43
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:26,240
The enrollment on January 1,1993 was 45 million.

44
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,950
How many million people,to the nearest million,

45
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,000
were rolled in health maintenance organizations

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,400
on January 1,1991? OK,so let's just call this x.

47
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,030
That's what they want to know,they want to know

48
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,350
how many million people were enrolled in 1991.

49
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:45,010
So when x increased by 15%,you got to 45 million.

50
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,980
So remember,not 15% of x is 45 million,x increases by 15%.

51
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,910
So let me write an extra step that I normally don't do.

52
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:59,350
So you could view it as x plus 15% x,right?

53
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:03,300
This is x,and then you're increasing it by 15% of x,

54
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,690
is going to be equal to 45 million.

55
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:09,210
And then this is 1x plus 0.15x,

56
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:14,340
so that's 1.15x is equal to 45 million.

57
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,120
And you could also just go straight to this step.

58
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,700
In fact,you usually can once you get used to it.

59
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,360
You can say,15% increase,

60
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,330
that's the same thing as multiplying by 1.15.

61
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:32,200
So x is equal to 45 divided by 1.15,and we're going to

62
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,360
have to do a little bit of division to figure this out.

63
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:44,040
115 divided by 45,add a couple of 0's So it's 1.15

64
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,610
divide by 45,so that's the same thing as 115,

65
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,680
take the decimal place,go 2 to the right,going to 4,500.

66
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:59,150
115 goes into 450 how many times? Does it go into it 4 times?

67
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,960
No,that'd be 460,so it goes into it 3 times.

68
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:15,570
3 times 115 is 345. This difference is 105,bring down a 0.

69
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,470
115 goes into 1,050 how many times?

70
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:28,860
If I did 8,800,I think it's 8 times,because 9 would be--

71
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,280
actually 900 plus 90 plus 45,actually it would be 9 times.

72
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:43,400
9 times 5 is 45. 9 times 1 is 9 plus 4 is 13.

73
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:49,490
9<i>9 is 1-- I'm sorry,9</i>1 is 9,plus 1 is 10.

74
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,970
You have a remainder 15,bring down the 0,that goes 1 time.

75
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,710
So we already have the decimal point.

76
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,850
And all their choices are in integers.

77
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,910
So this is closest to B,39.

78
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,450
And I wanted to get that last decimal point,

79
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,170
because maybe that was 39.9,

80
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,770
in which case 40 would be the closest choice.

81
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:17,160
Sometimes they get tricky like that. Next question. 79.

82
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,010
R is the set of positive odd integers less than 50.

83
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:42,480
And S is equal to squares of R,

84
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,920
squares of the numbers in that set.

85
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:50,340
How many elements does the intersection of R and S contain?

86
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:56,340
OK,so we have to say,positive odd editors less than 50.

87
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,390
So we have to think,how many positive odd integers

88
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:04,280
less than 50 are squares of other positive odd integers

89
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,590
less than 50. It doesn't take a long time to figure out

90
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,620
all of the squares between 1 and 50.

91
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:25,150
It's 1,2,4,9,16,25,they start increasing pretty fast,36,49.

92
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,630
Now we know that they have to be positive,

93
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,240
these are all positive. We know they have to be odd,

94
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,620
because we're looking for things that are both squares

95
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,570
and they're in set R. They're squares,

96
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,450
and they're squares of other things in set R.

97
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,860
So let's take out all the even numbers.

98
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:47,300
Can't be 36,can't be 2,can't be 4,can't be 16.

99
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,870
1 is 1 squared.

100
00:07:53,870 --> 00:08:00,880
So 1 is in set R,it's a positive odd integer less than 50,

101
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,080
and it is a square of another positive odd integer

102
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,850
less than 50,a square of itself. So 1 counts. 9 is 3 squared.

103
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:15,450
9 itself is a positive odd integer less than 50,

104
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,650
and it's also the square of 3,

105
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:20,180
which is another positive odd integer less than 50.

106
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,390
So 9 counts. 25,same logic.

107
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:26,260
It's a positive odd integer less than 50,it's the square of 5,

108
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,890
which is the same. And 49,same thing. Square of 7,

109
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:33,760
both 49 and 7 are positive odd integers less than 50.

110
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,610
So I found four. So that's C.

111
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:49,430
Question 80. A retail appliance store priced a video recorder

112
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:54,140
at 20% above the wholesale cost of $200.

113
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,930
We could just go,20% above 200,

114
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,900
that's going to be 1.2 times 200.

115
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,720
If a store employee applied the 10% employee discount to

116
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,930
the retail price to buy the recorder,

117
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,110
how much did the employee pay for the recorder?

118
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:12,230
So this is the retail price. This was the wholesale price,

119
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,370
that's what the store bought it for,

120
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:17,790
this is what a non-employee would have to pay,1.2 times 200.

121
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,420
And then the employee got a 10% discount.

122
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:25,910
So essentially the employee paid the retail price times 0.9.

123
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:40,230
So what's 1.2 times 200? 200 times 1.2. Let's just do it out.

124
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:48,260
2 times 200 is 400. Add a zero. 1 times 200 is 200.

125
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,270
And we have one point behind the decimal--

126
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,220
well let's add them up,you get 2400.

127
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,270
We have one digit behind the decimal,so it's 240.

128
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,850
So the retail price is 240,and we have to multiply that

129
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,670
times 0.9 to figure out what the employee paid.

130
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,170
They got a 10% discount,which is another way of saying

131
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:10,600
they payed 90% of the retail price. So 240 times 0.9.

132
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:18,030
9 times 0 is zero,9 times 4 is 36,9 times 2 is 18 plus 3,21.

133
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,140
We have one number behind the decimal point,

134
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:24,650
so the employee paid $216,which is choice B.

135
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:28,120
Now I'm out of time,I'll continue this in the next video.
