1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,730
   

2
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,290
In the last video, I introduced
you to the notion of-- well,

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,773
really we started with
the random variable.

4
00:00:05,773 --> 00:00:09,040
And then we moved on to the two
types of random variables.

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,950
You had discrete, that took on
a finite number of values.

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,480
And the these, I was going
to say that they tend to be

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,420
integers, but they don't
always have to be integers.

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,880
You have discrete, so finite
meaning you can't have an

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,800
infinite number of values for
a discrete random variable.

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,540
And then we have the
continuous, which can take

11
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,330
on an infinite number.

12
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,370
And the example I gave
for continuous is, let's

13
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,635
say random variable x.

14
00:00:37,635 --> 00:00:40,410
And people do tend to use-- let
me change it a little bit, just

15
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,340
so you can see it can be
something other than an x.

16
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,250
Let's have the random
variable capital Y.

17
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,180
They do tend to be
capital letters.

18
00:00:48,180 --> 00:01:01,700
Is equal to the exact
amount of rain tomorrow.

19
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,320
And I say rain because I'm
in northern California.

20
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,960
It's actually raining
quite hard right now.

21
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,070
We're short right now,
so that's a positive.

22
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,720
We've been having a drought,
so that's a good thing.

23
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,150
But the exact amount
of rain tomorrow.

24
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,370
And let's say I don't know
what the actual probability

25
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,480
distribution function for this
is, but I'll draw one and

26
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,270
then we'll interpret it.

27
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:29,210
Just so you can kind of think
about how you can think about

28
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,460
continuous random variables.

29
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,465
So let me draw a probability
distribution, or they call

30
00:01:33,465 --> 00:01:37,520
it its probability
density function.

31
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,940
And we draw like this.

32
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:49,273
And let's say that there is--
it looks something like this.

33
00:01:49,273 --> 00:01:53,750
   

34
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,740
Like that.

35
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,170
All right, and then I don't
know what this height is.

36
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,680
So the x-axis here is
the amount of rain.

37
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,740
Where this is 0 inches, this
is 1 inch, this is 2 inches,

38
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,400
this is 3 inches, 4 inches.

39
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,800
And then this is some height.

40
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,665
Let's say it peaks out
here at, I don't know,

41
00:02:18,665 --> 00:02:22,540
let's say this 0.5.

42
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:25,690
   

43
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,000
So the way to think about it,
if you were to look at this and

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,650
I were to ask you, what is the
probability that Y-- because

45
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:40,090
that's our random variable--
that Y is exactly

46
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,040
equal to 2 inches?

47
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,130
That Y is exactly
equal to two inches.

48
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,810
What's the probability
of that happening?

49
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,920
Well, based on how we thought
about the probability

50
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,870
distribution functions for the
discrete random variable,

51
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,150
you'd say OK, let's see.

52
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,030
2 inches, that's the case
we care about right now.

53
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,390
Let me go up here.

54
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,920
You'd say it looks
like it's about 0.5.

55
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,070
And you'd say, I don't
know, is it a 0.5 chance?

56
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,650
And I would say no, it
is not a 0.5 chance.

57
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,800
And before we even think about
how we would interpret it

58
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,320
visually, let's just think
about it logically.

59
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,070
What is the probability that
tomorrow we have exactly

60
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,450
2 inches of rain?

61
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:23,660
Not 2.01 inches of rain,
not 1.99 inches of rain.

62
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:32,910
Not 1.99999 inches of rain,
not 2.000001 inches of rain.

63
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,870
Exactly 2 inches of rain.

64
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:40,740
I mean, there's not a single
extra atom, water molecule

65
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,240
above the 2 inch mark.

66
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,990
And not as single water
molecule below the 2 inch mark.

67
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,180
It's essentially 0, right?

68
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,310
It might not be obvious to you,
because you've probably heard,

69
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,210
oh, we had 2 inches
of rain last night.

70
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,810
But think about it,
exactly 2 inches, right?

71
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,300
Normally if it's 2.01
people will say that's 2.

72
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,780
But we're saying no,
this does not count.

73
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,700
It can't be 2 inches.

74
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,660
We want exactly 2.

75
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,660
1.99 does not count.

76
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,580
Normally our measurements, we
don't even have tools that

77
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,920
can tell us whether it
is exactly 2 inches.

78
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,700
No ruler you can even say
is exactly 2 inches long.

79
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,690
At some point, just the way we
manufacture things, there's

80
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,250
going to be an extra atom
on it here or there.

81
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,970
So the odds of actually
anything being exactly a

82
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,810
certain measurement to the
exact infinite decimal

83
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,180
point is actually 0.

84
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,060
The way you would think about a
continuous random variable,

85
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:39,350
you could say what is the
probability that Y is almost 2?

86
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:46,600
So if we said that the absolute
value of Y minus is 2 is

87
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,280
less than some tolerance?

88
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,425
Is less than 0.1.

89
00:04:50,425 --> 00:04:53,620
   

90
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,540
And if that doesn't make sense
to you, this is essentially

91
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,720
just saying what is the
probability that Y is greater

92
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:07,600
than 1.9 and less than 2.1?

93
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,550
These two statements
are equivalent.

94
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,240
I'll let you think
about it a little bit.

95
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,930
But now this starts to make
a little bit of sense.

96
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,580
Now we have an interval here.

97
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,030
So we want all Y's
between 1.9 and 2.1.

98
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:24,260
So we are now talking
about this whole area.

99
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,520
And area is key.

100
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,760
So if you want to know the
probability of this occurring,

101
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:33,100
you actually want the area
under this curve from this

102
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,860
point to this point.

103
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,030
And for those of you who have
studied your calculus, that

104
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,840
would essentially be the
definite integral of this

105
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,840
probability density function
from this point to this point.

106
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,470
So from-- let me see, I've
run out of space down here.

107
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,620
So let's say if this
graph-- let me draw it

108
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,480
in a different color.

109
00:05:52,480 --> 00:06:00,650
If this line was defined
by, I'll call it f of x.

110
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,690
I could call it p
of x or something.

111
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:07,320
The probability of this
happening would be equal to the

112
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,100
integral, for those of you
who've studied calculus, from

113
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:15,490
1.9 to 2.1 of f of x dx.

114
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:18,400
Assuming this is the x-axis.

115
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,220
So it's a very important
thing to realize.

116
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,650
Because when a random variable
can take on an infinite number

117
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,820
of values, or it can take on
any value between an interval,

118
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:34,500
to get an exact value, to
get exactly 1.999, the

119
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,950
probability is actually 0.

120
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,370
It's like asking you what
is the area under a

121
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,820
curve on just this line.

122
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,820
Or even more specifically,
it's like asking you

123
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,890
what's the area of a line?

124
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,445
An area of a line, if you
were to just draw a line,

125
00:06:48,445 --> 00:06:50,960
you'd say well, area
is height times base.

126
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,440
Well the height has some
dimension, but the base,

127
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,950
what's the width the a line?

128
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,190
As far as the way we've defined
a line, a line has no with,

129
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,620
and therefore no area.

130
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,460
And it should make
intuitive sense.

131
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,850
That the probability of a very
super-exact thing happening

132
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,720
is pretty much 0.

133
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,360
That you really have to say,
OK what's the probably

134
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,020
that we'll get close to 2?

135
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,070
And then you can
define an area.

136
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,260
And if you said oh, what's
the probability that we get

137
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,450
someplace between 1 and 3
inches of rain, then of course

138
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,355
the probability is much higher.

139
00:07:20,355 --> 00:07:21,940
The probability is much higher.

140
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,620
It would be all of
this kind of stuff.

141
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,710
You could also say what's
the probability we have

142
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,400
less than 0.1 of rain?

143
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,670
Then you would go here and
if this was 0.1, you would

144
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,170
calculate this area.

145
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,590
And you could say what's the
probability that we have more

146
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,730
than 4 inches of rain tomorrow?

147
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,450
Then you would start here and
you'd calculate the area in the

148
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:46,125
curve all the way to infinity,
if the curve has area all

149
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:46,870
the way to infinity.

150
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,590
And hopefully that's not an
infinite number, right?

151
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,530
Then your probability
won't make any sense.

152
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,020
But hopefully if you take this
sum it comes to some number.

153
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:58,930
And we'll say there's only a
10% chance that you have more

154
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,200
than 4 inches tomorrow.

155
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,365
And all of this should
immediately lead to one light

156
00:08:04,365 --> 00:08:07,080
bulb in your head, is that the
probability of all of the

157
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,750
events that might occur
can't be more than 100%.

158
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,050
Right?

159
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:15,230
All the events combined--
there's a probability of 1 that

160
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,290
one of these events will occur.

161
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:20,910
So essentially, the whole
area under this curve

162
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,800
has to be equal to 1.

163
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,620
So if we took the integral of f
of x from 0 to infinity, this

164
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,600
thing, at least as I've drawn
it, dx should be equal to 1.

165
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,890
For those of you who've
studied calculus.

166
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,570
For those of you who haven't,
an integral is just the

167
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:36,490
area under a curve.

168
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:39,080
And you can watch the calculus
videos if you want to learn a

169
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,850
little bit more about
how to do them.

170
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:46,160
And this also applies to
the discrete probability

171
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,291
distributions.

172
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,670
Let me draw one.

173
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,070
The sum of all of the
probabilities have

174
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,590
to be equal to 1.

175
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,820
And that example with the
dice-- or let's say, since it's

176
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,800
faster to draw, the coin-- the
two probabilities have

177
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,850
to be equal to 1.

178
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:11,060
So this is 1, 0, where x is
equal to 1 if we're heads

179
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,400
or 0 if we're tails.

180
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,610
Each of these have to be 0.5.

181
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,885
Or they don't have to be 0.5,
but if one was 0.6, the

182
00:09:17,885 --> 00:09:19,090
other would have to be 0.4.

183
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,790
They have to add to 1.

184
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:24,190
If one of these was-- you can't
have a 60% probability of

185
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,470
getting a heads and then a 60%
probability of getting

186
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,280
a tails as well.

187
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,080
Because then you would have
essentially 120% probability

188
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,600
of either of the outcomes
happening, which makes

189
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,060
no sense at all.

190
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,330
So it's important to realize
that a probability distribution

191
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:42,790
function, in this case for a
discrete random variable, they

192
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,160
all have to add up to 1.

193
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,480
So 0.5 plus 0.5.

194
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,990
And in this case the area
under the probability

195
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,500
density function also
has to be equal to 1.

196
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,200
Anyway, I'm all
the time for now.

197
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,520
In the next video I'll
introduce you to the idea

198
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,785
of an expected value.

199
00:09:58,785 --> 00:10:00,420
See you soon.

200
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,000
