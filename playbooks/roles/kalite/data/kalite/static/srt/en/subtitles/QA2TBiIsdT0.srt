1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,670
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:02,713
I now want to play a little
bit of

3
00:00:02,713 --> 00:00:04,082
devil's advocate with myself.

4
00:00:04,082 --> 00:00:06,813
I made this argument where
I show that for the exact

5
00:00:06,813 --> 00:00:08,590
identical house, if these are
the numbers -- I mean you'd

6
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,430
have to work it out based on
your market, and what the

7
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,530
numbers are at the time.

8
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,600
But if this is the comparable
rent for a $1 million house, I

9
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,220
showed you that for the $1
million house you're burning

10
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,070
$40,000 a year.

11
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,110
This is not money that is
going to build equity.

12
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,400
This not money that's going to
the principal of your house.

13
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,390
This is money that just going
out of your pocket, you'll

14
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,320
never see again.

15
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,130
In a way, and actually not in
a way, in reality, you can

16
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,390
view this $40,000 as rent on the
money that you borrowed.

17
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,460
Interest is nothing but rent.

18
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,150
So when you have an asset, if
the asset is cash, the rent on

19
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,390
it is interest. If the asset is
a house, the rent on it is

20
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,120
your monthly rent payment.

21
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,880
So when you think of it this
way, when people say home

22
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,010
ownership, they really aren't
homeowners yet.

23
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:51,000
You're not a homeowner until
you don't have debt.

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,870
You are a money renter.

25
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,950
So your choice is either to be
a money renter here, or to be

26
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,220
a house renter here.

27
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,200
And I show that you are burning

28
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,590
almost double the money.

29
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,530
But then there's the argument of
well, there are advantages,

30
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:07,830
still, to buying this house.

31
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,090
And what are they?

32
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,200
Well one example is, in this
situation, if I did get a

33
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,200
fixed-rate mortgage -- and we
learned, when you look at all

34
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,146
those adjustable-rate mortgages,
we know that a lot

35
00:01:16,146 --> 00:01:17,040
of people didn't.

36
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,550
But if I have a fixed-rate
mortgage, I know what my

37
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:22,920
payment is for the foreseeable
future, for the next 30 years.

38
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,470
While my landlord, in this
case, they could

39
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:27,960
keep raising my rent.

40
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,260
So this might look good right
now, but what if my landlord

41
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,590
raised the rent to, I don't
know, $3,500 a month.

42
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:44,300
Well then, out of your pocket,
0.5 times 12, you'd be

43
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,210
spending $42,000 a year.

44
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,270
And then of course you get the
interest from the money that

45
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,050
you put in the bank.

46
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,050
Plus 10.

47
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:56,410
Oh, minus 10 actually, sorry.

48
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,280
So in that case, if the rent
goes up, then out of your

49
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,250
pocket is $32,000 every year.

50
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:00,910
Right?

51
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,060
Or what if the interest that
you get on your cash in the

52
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:03,950
bank goes down?

53
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,870
Then this $10,000 thousand
will become lower.

54
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,720
But as we can see, the rent
would have to go up a lot to

55
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,650
make up for $41,000, to make
this a break-even situation.

56
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,840
Let's figure out how much
it would have to go up.

57
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,130
So in this first scenario, in
order for your net outflow to

58
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:25,940
be $41,500, assuming you're
getting $10,000 from the money

59
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:31,560
in the bank, your rent would
have to be $51,500.

60
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:31,675
Right?

61
00:02:31,675 --> 00:02:35,130
Because you're getting $10,000
from the bank.

62
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:45,400
And so divided by 12, your rent
would have to be $4,300

63
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,290
in this situation to make this
a break-even proposition.

64
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,180
This is another way
to view it.

65
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,540
If I were to buy the house,
and if I were to move, how

66
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,100
much would I have to rent this
house out for, in order to not

67
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,360
be losing money every month?

68
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,750
Well I would have to rent it out
for $4,300 a month, even

69
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,130
though maybe the market rents
are only at $3,000.

70
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,440
And there is another devil's
advocate argument.

71
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,390
And that's, well, housing -- and
this is something that you

72
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,300
heard a lot about
three years ago.

73
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,730
And a lot of these people aren't
talking as much now.

74
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,780
But they would say, housing has
never -- housing has done

75
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,550
nothing but gone up, and I will
build equity just from

76
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,990
housing appreciation.

77
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:27,190
So how much does my house have
to appreciate every year?

78
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:36,890
Well, to make up this
difference-- $41,500 minus

79
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:45,180
26-- so to make up that $15,500
difference every year,

80
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,960
this is $15,500 favorable.

81
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,360
My house would have to
appreciate by a comparable

82
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,570
amount, right?

83
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,530
So how much appreciation
is that on my house?

84
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,270
Well that's a $1 million
house, right?

85
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:01,590
So $15,500 appreciation
on a $1 million house.

86
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,690
I'm doing everything in
thousands, so 1,000 thousands

87
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:04,705
is a million.

88
00:04:04,705 --> 00:04:07,760
So that's only 1.5%
appreciation.

89
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,450
So if my house appreciates by
1.5%, that's it-- 1.5%.

90
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:17,440
If my house just appreciates by
1.5%, I'm going to make up

91
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,899
this $15,500.

92
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,019
And so it is worth it for me.

93
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:24,110
It is worth it for me to blow
this money by having kind of

94
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:27,900
an increased -- by renting the
money for more than I would

95
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,970
have to pay to rent the house.

96
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,330
And that might sound like a very
reasonable proposition,

97
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,780
that the house will appreciate
by 1.5%.

98
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:39,060
From 2001 to 2005, 2006, houses
were appreciating like

99
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,900
10%, 15% a year.

100
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,350
So it seemed -- and a real
estate agent would often do

101
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,260
this very math with you, and
say, well, you're definitely

102
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,470
going to get 1.5%.

103
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,410
In fact, you're probably going
to get 10% appreciation.

104
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,950
And you're going to make
much more than this.

105
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,590
But think about, in the
presentation of the balance

106
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,210
sheet and leverage, what happens
if housing prices go

107
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,290
down by 1.5%?

108
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,240
What happens if it's
minus 1.5%?

109
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,740
Well, then you're going to spend
this much to rent the

110
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,390
money, right?

111
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,870
And you're not going
to gain this much.

112
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,690
You're going to lose this
much every year.

113
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,220
And so the proposition
becomes even worse.

114
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,280
So this is a big deal.

115
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,540
Now that, I think, on a
nationwide basis, a lot of the

116
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,470
housing indices show that
housing prices have gone down,

117
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,560
I think by 6%.

118
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,280
That's what the Case-Shiller
index says.

119
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,600
6% is a lot.

120
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,980
Especially on a $1 million
house, that's $60,000 a year

121
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,130
that's just evaporating.

122
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,990
That's wealth that someone
thought they had, that's just

123
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,690
disappearing out of
their equity.

124
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:36,880
So this rationale of pay more
to rent the money for a

125
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,140
house than to rent the
house is justified if

126
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,270
housing prices go up.

127
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,610
It becomes 10 times worse when
housing prices are flat.

128
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,240
Or, God forbid, if housing
prices actually go down.

129
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,270
And now we see that housing
prices actually go down.

130
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,150
In the last couple of years
especially, in the areas

131
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,170
where, like the Bay Area, or
Florida, or California,

132
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,690
especially Southern California,

133
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,760
where this is happening.

134
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,560
And back even two or three years
ago, when people used to

135
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,020
make this argument.

136
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,460
People used to make the
argument, well you know, my

137
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,290
house just has to go up 1% or
2%, and I'm going to

138
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,500
make up the difference.

139
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,000
I'd say well, why is
your house going to

140
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,430
go up 1% or 2%?

141
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,750
I mean, there has to be some
reason why next year someone's

142
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,420
willing to pay 2% more
for that house.

143
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,880
Is it because rents are going
up 2% a year, so the income

144
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,650
stream is going to
be 2% higher?

145
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:25,150
And actually in the Bay Area,
from 2001 to roughly 2003,

146
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,440
rents were going down.

147
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,760
And there were actually
people moving out.

148
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,610
All the tech workers were
getting laid off.

149
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,640
You had a lot of programming
jobs being outsourced to India

150
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,580
and wherever else.

151
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,025
So you had this whole situation
where the population

152
00:06:35,025 --> 00:06:36,570
was actually decreasing.

153
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,500
Demand for housing
was going down.

154
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,280
But for some reason housing
prices were going up.

155
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,210
So people said well, they've
been going up for the last

156
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,260
five years, so they'll
continue.

157
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,760
And they've never gone down,
et cetera, et cetera.

158
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,450
But it didn't make an
economic argument.

159
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,960
And I'll show in a future video
that the only reason why

160
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,230
housing prices did go up is that
it just became easier and

161
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:59,300
easier and easier
to buy a house.

162
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,830
The standards that banks used
for giving out a loan became

163
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,730
lower and lower and lower.

164
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:07,430
There are actually examples in
Southern California, and in

165
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,790
San Jose and some of the
suburbs, where people who had

166
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,930
incomes of $30,000 or
$40,000 a year.

167
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,360
The bank actually gave them a
$1 million loan to buy a $1

168
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,700
million house, based
on stated income.

169
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,900
There's things called stated
income loans, where you just

170
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,600
tell the bank what you earn.

171
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,070
You don't have to prove
it to them.

172
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,540
And so every year that went by,
it just became easier and

173
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,560
easier and easier.

174
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,910
More and more people just
thought that housing always

175
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:30,480
appreciates.

176
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,610
So that's why they want to pay
more and more to essentially

177
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,380
rent the money for a house.

178
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,360
And this became a
self-fulfilling prophecy.

179
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,720
But as we see on the
way down, it works

180
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,800
completely against you.

181
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,240
So in the situation where we
are now, where nationwide

182
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,360
housing prices are actually
declining-- and actually they

183
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,530
will decline until this
rent-versus-buy equation

184
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:54,270
starts to make a little bit more
sense-- it really hurts

185
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,220
the home buyer.

186
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,100
And what's even worse, and this
is kind of adding insult

187
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:03,330
to injury, is that this guy,
if I bought this house, and

188
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,250
all of a sudden I lose my job,
and I can't pay the house

189
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,260
back, I might lose my entire
$250,000 down payment because

190
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,750
maybe I can't sell the
house, or the house

191
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,470
is selling for less.

192
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,770
Or maybe I want to move, and
there's no one out there who

193
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:19,070
can buy a house because the
banks all of a sudden got

194
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,930
smart again, and realized that
they should become more

195
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,170
serious in terms of who
they give money to.

196
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,170
And so I'm stuck holding this
house, and my flexibility in

197
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,950
terms of where I can
move is limited.

198
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,330
Actually a friend of mine was
telling me that they've

199
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,020
actually done studies.

200
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,760
And there's a correlation
between

201
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,440
unemployment and home ownership.

202
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,309
Because when you own a home, you
have less flexibility in

203
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:37,110
looking for a job.

204
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,530
If I have a house in San Jose
but there's a job in LA, I

205
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,049
might not be able to take
that job because I

206
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:42,919
can't sell my house.

207
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,910
Or I might not even want to
look for a job in LA.

208
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:49,340
While the renter, of course,
my lease ends and I leave.

209
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,870
So this is just a rough sense
of the rent versus buy.

210
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,490
And I know I get very
impassioned about this.

211
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,710
But that's just because
I explain this a lot.

212
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,850
And when I'm at parties and
I start talking about the

213
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,520
calculations, people's
eyes glaze over.

214
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,190
But I made this video now
and I'll just tell

215
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,010
people to watch it.

216
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,950
See you in the next video.
