1
00:00:05,308 --> 00:00:08,947
We're in the Bargello, in Florence, and we're looking at the so called "competition panels".

2
00:00:08,947 --> 00:00:12,950
Art historian often see these as the beginning of the Renaissance.

3
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:20,359
In 1401 the Cloth Guild of Florence decided to commission a second set of doors for the Baptistry of Florence.

4
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:24,828
There are three doorways in the Baptistry: the first set of doors

5
00:00:24,828 --> 00:00:27,530
had been made by Andrea Pisano in the 14th century and

6
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:32,575
the Cloth Guild wanted to create a second set of door. These were enormous bronze doors and

7
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:36,191
this was a huge civic undertaking and extremely expensive.

8
00:00:36,191 --> 00:00:39,716
The Baptistry is historically the most important building in Florence and

9
00:00:39,716 --> 00:00:44,715
in a effort to find the best sculptor the Cloth Guild held a competition.

10
00:00:44,715 --> 00:00:46,866
The only two that survive of the seven entries

11
00:00:46,866 --> 00:00:49,557
are by Brunelleschi and Ghiberti.

12
00:00:49,557 --> 00:00:53,444
The Cloth Guild, when they held this competition, were very specific about what they wanted.

13
00:00:53,444 --> 00:00:59,796
They allocated a certain amount of bronze, they told the sculptors, they imparted to sculpt the Old Testament subject

14
00:00:59,796 --> 00:01:03,034
of the Sacrifice of Isaac, they dictated the number of figures

15
00:01:03,034 --> 00:01:05,134
and what should be included.

16
00:01:05,134 --> 00:01:07,370
The only other thing that I remember is that the Cloth Guild actually

17
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,946
dictated was that all the panels had to bee contained within

18
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:13,947
a quatrefoil, that is this Gothic shape.

19
00:01:13,947 --> 00:01:22,419
To really fun to look at both of these panels and think about why the Guild chose the one ... and which one was better and for what reasons.

20
00:01:22,419 --> 00:01:30,961
In this story God commands Abraham to kill his only son Isaac, to sacrifice Isaac.

21
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:36,446
They have to remember that Abraham went for a very long time in his life with no children and so

22
00:01:36,446 --> 00:01:38,608
his son meant everything to him.

23
00:01:38,608 --> 00:01:40,138
His son was a miracle.

24
00:01:40,138 --> 00:01:41,639
Now God is commanding him

25
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:46,640
to murder his son and Abraham is taking God's words very seriously.

26
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,712
This is a moment of crisis, a moment of faith.

27
00:01:49,712 --> 00:01:52,857
Will he allow everything in his life to be subserving to God's will?

28
00:01:52,857 --> 00:01:56,694
So, Abraham takes Isaac to the mountain where God has told him to go

29
00:01:56,694 --> 00:02:01,333
and takes a knife to Isaac's throat, and is about to kill

30
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:05,262
his son, when an Angel appears and stops him.

31
00:02:05,262 --> 00:02:09,232
God provides a ram instead for Abraham to sacrifice

32
00:02:09,232 --> 00:02:15,873
so Isaac is spared and Abraham is spared this terrible fate of having to slay his only son.

33
00:02:15,873 --> 00:02:20,181
I'm particularly fond of the way the Angel flies in in both panels

34
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:25,055
to save the day. In the Ghiberti it's far less dramatic. We have an Angel...

35
00:02:25,055 --> 00:02:39,130
but in Brunelleschi's version the Angel is grasping Abraham's hand and literally stops him in the very moment when the knife meets Isaac's throat.

36
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:44,068
It's also a kind of intensity with Isaac's head pushed back by Abraham and

37
00:02:44,068 --> 00:02:47,858
there is also a kind of violence that seems to be in process.

38
00:02:47,858 --> 00:02:53,376
In the Ghiberti's, it's interesting, the Angel is separated, there isn't the same continuity of form.

39
00:02:53,376 --> 00:03:02,085
I think there's more complexity in Ghiberti's, emotionally: Abraham looks reluctant, this isn't something he wants to do

40
00:03:02,085 --> 00:03:06,722
pulled the knife back, is looking at Isaac

41
00:03:06,722 --> 00:03:11,461
but there is a sense of unwillingness, it's like a second of pausing

42
00:03:11,461 --> 00:03:14,324
because of this terrible thing that he has been commanded to do.

43
00:03:14,324 --> 00:03:20,834
It's interesting that the Ghiberti up shows us a form nude and presents that nude us in the most direct way,

44
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:26,946
whereas the Brunelleschi is upon one knee has a ...cloth and is twisted and

45
00:03:26,946 --> 00:03:31,247
sturded ... that we see in the Ghiberti

46
00:03:31,247 --> 00:03:36,774
the direct perform into greek and roman scultpure and it is really very beautifully done.

47
00:03:36,774 --> 00:03:43,691
This also an interesting quarrel ...in both panels... the physical relationship of the father and the son.

48
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:51,565
In the Ghiberti you have the gentle arching, whereas in the Brunelleschi you have a diagonal which is more energized and more violent, as well.

49
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,471
To me, the Brunelleschi is a little scarier.

50
00:03:54,471 --> 00:03:56,042
It is scary!

51
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:57,740
Well, apparently the Guild agreed.

52
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,144
There's no written record of why they chose what they get.

53
00:04:00,144 --> 00:04:09,219
That's right, but...automatically was the Ghiberti that got he commission all those sum accounts say that they both won, but Ghiberti actually was chosen to carry out the commission.

54
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:14,058
In the Ghiberti you have that rocky mountain that unifies he scene.

55
00:04:14,058 --> 00:04:16,892
It seems ...flood down almost like water from the a....

56
00:04:16,892 --> 00:04:20,565
There's a sense in the Brunelleschi more

57
00:04:20,565 --> 00:04:22,999
of separate parts being...

58
00:04:22,999 --> 00:04:31,574
in fact Brunelleschi cast many of the ... separately and then put them together, and the Ghiberti's is casted only from two

59
00:04:31,574 --> 00:04:33,150
pieces of bronze.

60
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:39,449
There may ben one other element that helped to sway at the decision and that is the Ghiberti used less bronze than Brunelleschi.

61
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:45,494
And remember bronze is extremely expensive, and when you multiply this to all of the panels of the door

62
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:49,442
that would have been significant in any case in the end

63
00:04:49,442 --> 00:04:52,195
Ghiberti gets the commission, produces the doors

64
00:04:52,195 --> 00:04:57,132
and they are such a triumph that he is automatically commissioned to produce a third set of doors.

65
00:04:57,132 --> 00:05:07,374
And Brunelleschi will take this opportunity to move beyond sculpture, go for Rome and study ancient Roman architecture and ancient romans sculpture

66
00:05:07,586 --> 00:05:13,562
He of course came back to Florence, triumphing ultimately with major comissions like the Dome.
