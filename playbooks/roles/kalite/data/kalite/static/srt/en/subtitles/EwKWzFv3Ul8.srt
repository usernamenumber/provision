1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
   

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,430
We're on problem 67.

3
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,690
They ask us how many terms of
the binomial expansion of x

4
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:08,000
squared plus 2y to
the third to the

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,500
twentieth power contain?

6
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,890
And so right when you see, oh
my god, to the twentieth

7
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,760
power, that will take me forever
to do, and then I'll

8
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,930
have to count the terms. But
remember, they're just asking

9
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,650
you how many terms.
They're not asking

10
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:18,890
you to find the expansion.

11
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,370
So you just have to say, oh boy,
let me just think about

12
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,390
this a little bit.

13
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:29,560
And think of it this way: x plus
y to the first power has

14
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,240
how many terms?

15
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,030
It has-- well it's
just x plus y.

16
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,910
And so it has 2 terms.
x plus y, squared.

17
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:47,510
That is equal to x squared
plus 2xy plus y squared.

18
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:52,910
So that has 3 terms. If I were
to do x plus e The third

19
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,850
power, I could do a binomial
expansion, I could do it with

20
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:56,900
Pascal's Triangle.

21
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,970
Let me do it with Pascal's
Triangle.

22
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:58,980
I have the 1 and the 1.

23
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,240
That's to the first power.

24
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,709
The second power, those
are the coefficients.

25
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:08,030
The third power, the
coefficients become 1, 3--

26
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,220
because 1 plus 2 is 3-- 3, 1.

27
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,070
And actually I don't even
have to expand it out.

28
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,590
Ill do it just for a
little practice.

29
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:24,880
It x to the third plus 3x
squared y plus 3xy squared

30
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,920
plus y to the third.

31
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,040
I just used these.

32
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,750
But when you take any binomial
and you take it to the third

33
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:36,100
power, you end up with 4 terms.
And depending on how

34
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,520
you think of it, if you think of
it with Pascal's Triangle,

35
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,450
every time we go down we're
just going to be adding

36
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,150
another term.

37
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,910
When we take the fourth power
it's going to have 5 terms. Or

38
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,450
when you think about, when we
use the binomial expansion,

39
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,620
and you might want to watch
some videos on that.

40
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,090
There you also have, if you're
taking it to the nth power,

41
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,400
you end up with n
plus 1 terms.

42
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,380
So in this example, we have a
binomial-- a binomial just

43
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,130
means a two-term polynomial.

44
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,090
And we're taking it to
the twentieth power.

45
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,900
If we were taking it to third
power, we'd have four terms.

46
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,320
If we were taking it to the
fourth power, we'd have 5

47
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,570
terms. So if we're taking it to
the twentieth power, we're

48
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,390
going to have 21 terms.
And that's choice B.

49
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,640
Next problem.

50
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,420
   

51
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,890
All right, they want us to keep
doing these and we'll do

52
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,200
it because they want us to.

53
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:32,400
   

54
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,540
All right, what are the first
four terms of the expansion of

55
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,540
1 plus 2x to the sixth power?

56
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,750
And here we'll just use the
binomial expansion because I

57
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,350
think that's what they
want us to do.

58
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,350
And that's probably the
fastest way to do it.

59
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:46,210
So let's just think of the
coefficients first. So this is

60
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,580
going to be-- well
let's just do it.

61
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,920
This is going to be equal
to 6 choose 0.

62
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,070
We're just going to do the first
four terms. Times 1 to

63
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:00,320
the 6 times 2x to the 0-- so I
don't have to write that--

64
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,965
plus 6 choose 1.

65
00:03:03,965 --> 00:03:05,880
And actually, we'll probably
just have to figure out the

66
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,330
third term because that's
the only time where

67
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,380
they start to change.

68
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:21,200
6 choose 1 times 1 to the fifth
power times 2x to the

69
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,210
first power, times 2x.

70
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:29,390
Plus 6 choose 2 times-- I mean
these 1s, it doesn't matter

71
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:37,200
what power it is-- 1 to the
fourth times 2x squared plus--

72
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,330
let's see, they want the first
so let's do the last one-- 6

73
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:47,400
choose 3 times 1 to the third--
you have to decrement

74
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,470
the 1 every time-- times
2x to the third.

75
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,180
All right, and if we look
at the choices,

76
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,740
just to save time.

77
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,560
If we look at a choices, OK, we
agree that the first term

78
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,470
is going to be 1.

79
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,220
So that, we can definitely say
is going to be 1 because all

80
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:01,910
the choices are 1.

81
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,640
The second term is definitely
going to be 12x.

82
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,050
And then we start getting
some disagreement

83
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,075
on the third term.

84
00:04:08,075 --> 00:04:09,180
So let's see what
the third term.

85
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,460
6 choose to that's equal to 6
back toward ill over to affect

86
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:21,700
or you over fix minus is too
fact or you scroll down a

87
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:27,380
little bit so that is equal to
6 factorial, which is 6 times

88
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,770
5 times 4 times 3
times 2 times 1.

89
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,730
But the 1 doesn't
change anything.

90
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,350
Divided by 2 factorial, which
is 2 times 1, or just 2.

91
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,510
Divided by 6 minus 2 factorial,
that's 4 factorial.

92
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:44,530
Royal So times 4 times
3 times 2 times 1.

93
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,420
That cancels out with that.

94
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,300
The 2 and the 6 cancel out.

95
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,030
You get 3.

96
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,830
So you end up with 3 times 5.

97
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:59,200
So the 6 choose 2 becomes 15,
3 times 5, that's 15.

98
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,300
Times 1 to the fourth, which
is 1, times 2x squared.

99
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,780
So times 4x squared.

100
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,020
And so that's 15 times 4,
that's 60x squared.

101
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,720
So the third term is going
to be 60x squared.

102
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,700
And we're done.

103
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,760
Choice D is the only one
that has 60x squared

104
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,580
as the third term.

105
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:18,930
So we're done.

106
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,120
We didn't even have to go
to the fourth term.

107
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,770
So, by carefully looking at the
choices we actually only

108
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:27,120
have to evaluate one
of the terms.

109
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,370
Next problem.

110
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,940
   

111
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,230
Let's see.

112
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:33,780
All right.

113
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,830
Problem 69.

114
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:46,750
They say-- let me copy and paste
it-- what is the sum of

115
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:51,310
the infinite geometric series,
1/2 plus 1/4 plus 1/8 all the

116
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:51,940
way up there.

117
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,990
I'll be frank.

118
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,940
I do now remember the formula.

119
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,030
But a lot of times in life you
might forget the formula.

120
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,050
And there's a trick
is to re-proving

121
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,280
the formula for yourself.

122
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,800
Just in case you forget
it when you're 32

123
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,390
years old like me.

124
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,700
So let's say that I'm trying to
find the infinite sum of a

125
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,690
geometric series.

126
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,380
So let's say that the sum-- and
I'm going to re-prove it

127
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,800
right here in the midst of this
test. And I've done this

128
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,730
in midst of tests and
it's saved me.

129
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,830
So it's nice to know
the proof.

130
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,425
And it actually impresses
people, if you know people who

131
00:06:20,425 --> 00:06:21,930
are impressed by proofs.

132
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:28,530
So let's say the sum is equal to
a to the 0-- well actually

133
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,930
let's say-- well, see
this is interesting.

134
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,370
Because they're starting
at 1/2.

135
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,910
Actually let's just do
the concrete numbers.

136
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,150
Because we want to figure
out this exact sum.

137
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:43,820
So let's say that the sum is
equal to 1/2 to the 1 1/2

138
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:49,170
squared plus 1/2 to the third--
it's the whole 1/2 to

139
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:53,360
the third-- plus-- and
you just keep going.

140
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,570
Fair enough.

141
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:57,460
Now let's take 1/2
times the sum.

142
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,310
So 1/2 times this.

143
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,810
What is this equal to?

144
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,500
Well if I took 1/2 times this
whole thing, now 1/2, I would

145
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,800
have to distribute it over each
of these terms. So 1/2

146
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,350
times this term, times this
first term, 1/2 times 1/2 to

147
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,510
the first, well that's now
going to be 1/2 squared.

148
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,190
   

149
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,570
1/2 squared.

150
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,291
All I did is I'm distributing
this 1/2 times each of the

151
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:24,590
terms. 1/2 times 1/2 to the
first. That's 1/2 squared.

152
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,820
Now 1/2 times 1/2 squared, well
that's going to be 1/2 to

153
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,450
the third power.

154
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,830
And it just keeps going.

155
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,420
It's an infinite series.

156
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,710
So let me ask you something.

157
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:37,840
If I subtracted this from
that, what do I get?

158
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,900
Let's see what I get.

159
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:45,770
So I get S minus 1/2 S-- I'm
subtracting that from that--

160
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,420
is equal to this minus this.

161
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,490
Well if I'm subtracting the
green stuff from the yellow

162
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,810
stuff, this is going to cancel
out with that, that's going to

163
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:54,820
cancel out with that.

164
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,980
And all I'm going to be
left with is this

165
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,210
first thing right here.

166
00:07:59,210 --> 00:07:59,900
That's the trick.

167
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,850
And you could prove it generally
for any base.

168
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:02,980
And I thought it was interesting
because a lot of

169
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,710
times they start with
the 0th power.

170
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,140
And this problem was interesting
because they start

171
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,775
with 1/2 to the first power.

172
00:08:08,775 --> 00:08:10,160
So anyway let's figure it out.

173
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,970
S minus 1/2 S, well
that's just 1/2 S.

174
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,810
1/2 S is equal to 1/2.

175
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:20,380
And then you have S is-- divided
both sides by 1/2 or

176
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:25,520
multiply both sides by 2 and
you get-- S is equal to 1.

177
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,540
Now, a lot of you may know
there is a formula.

178
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,309
Let me tell you what
the formula says.

179
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:35,890
The formula that you may or may
not have memorized, is if

180
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:43,840
you start at n is equal to 0 and
if you go to infinity of a

181
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,950
to the n-- in this case a is
1/2-- this is going to be

182
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:53,210
equal to 1 over 1 minus a.

183
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,950
So your natural reaction would
have been, oh OK, well that

184
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:01,640
sum that we saw, that's equal to
the sum of n is equal to 0

185
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,860
to infinity of 1/2 to the n,
which would be equal to 1 over

186
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,180
1 minus 1/2.

187
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:09,670
What's that?

188
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:13,130
1 minus 1, that's 1 over 1/2,
which would be equal to 2.

189
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:16,200
And you'd be like, my God, what
did I do wrong there?

190
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,580
And I'll show you what
you did wrong.

191
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,110
This sum that you took the sum
of-- remember n is starting at

192
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:27,600
0-- so this sum that sums up to
2 is 1/2 to 0 is 1 plus 1/2

193
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:35,030
to the 1, 1/2, plus 1/2 squared,
1/4, plus 1/8, so on

194
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,080
and so forth.

195
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,380
That is equal to 2.

196
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,300
   

197
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,780
This problem-- and that's why it
was a little tricky-- this

198
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,330
problem, they didn't want this
sum, they wanted this sum.

199
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:52,020
1/2 plus 1/4 plus 1/8 plus,
so forth and so on.

200
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,000
So they wanted everything
but this 1.

201
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,230
So if you subtracted this 1 from
both sides then you would

202
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,040
say, oh this sum must be equal
to 1, which is the answer we

203
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,400
got that way.

204
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,140
So that's why sometimes,
memorizing formulas, this

205
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,350
formula's a nice formula to
memorize, it's very simple.

206
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,430
But it sometimes becomes really
confusing when you're

207
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:11,630
like, oh boy, but this is when
n starts 0 but what happens

208
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,810
when n starts at 1.

209
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,900
And to some degree I really like
this problem because it's

210
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,940
testing you to see if you really
understand what the

211
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,450
formula's all about.

212
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,480
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.

213
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,500
