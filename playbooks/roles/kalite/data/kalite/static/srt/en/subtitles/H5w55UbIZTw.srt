1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,730
   

2
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,360
Joelle has two after-school
jobs, babysitting and working

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,990
at her parents' grocery store.

4
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,290
Working at the grocery pays
her $12 an hour, and

5
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,740
babysitting pays her
$9.50 an hour.

6
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,170
Last week she worked
19 hours in total.

7
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,800
That looks like a
statement that

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,000
could lead to an equation.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,320
Last week she worked
19 hours in total.

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,320
And she earned $56 more at the
grocery store than she did

11
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:23,850
babysitting.

12
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,390
That looks like another
statement

13
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,620
that could be an equation.

14
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:31,090
She earned $56 more at the
grocery store than she did

15
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,200
babysitting.

16
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,220
And then they ask us, how
many hours did she

17
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,440
work at each job?

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,330
So they want to know--
so let's define

19
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,410
some variables here.

20
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:48,490
Let's define time babysitting,
so t sub b, as equal to hours

21
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:49,740
babysitting.

22
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:56,110
   

23
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:00,476
And let's define t sub g as
hours at the grocery.

24
00:01:00,476 --> 00:01:07,650
   

25
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,640
So they want us to figure out
what was t sub b and t sub g,

26
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,400
what were the hours of
babysitting and what were the

27
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,700
hours at the grocery?

28
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,150
Now, they tell us that she
worked 19 hours total.

29
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,660
So that blue statement says that
the sum of these two is

30
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,310
going to be 19.

31
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,940
So the time she worked
babysitting plus the time she

32
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:31,900
worked at the grocery store is
going to be equal to 19 hours.

33
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,890
Now the other statement.

34
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,000
This by itself obviously we
can't solve for these.

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,370
We need another constraint.

36
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,770
They said that she earned $56
more at the grocery store then

37
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,480
she did babysitting.

38
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,880
So let me define two more
variables here.

39
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:52,020
So this is the pay babysitting,
her total pay

40
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,910
babysitting.

41
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:58,940
And let's say P sub g
is equal to the pay

42
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,370
at the grocery store.

43
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,220
Now, what are these terms?

44
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,570
I mean, if we just look at this
second statement right

45
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,160
there, we'll just say, OK, the
pay at babysitting, she earned

46
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,320
$56 more at the grocery than
she did babysitting.

47
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,350
So this second statement tells
us that, well, I guess the

48
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:18,960
pay-- let me write it over
here-- the pay babysitting,

49
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,260
she earned $56 more at the
grocery than she did

50
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:21,780
babysitting.

51
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,500
So if we take babysitting and
add $56, that will get us to

52
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,910
how much she earned at
the grocery store.

53
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,690
That's what that second
statement is telling us. $56

54
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,260
more at the grocery
than babysitting.

55
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,160
So if you add these two,
you get the grocery.

56
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,700
Now, this still isn't cool.

57
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,370
We have one, two, three,
four unknowns

58
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,410
and only two equations.

59
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,580
That's not going to help us.

60
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,970
But what will help us we can
express these two variables in

61
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,360
terms of these two variables,
and then we have two equations

62
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,300
with two unknowns, so we can
solve them the way we've

63
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,670
solved all systems
of equations.

64
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,340
Now the other information they
give us is the rate, how much

65
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,750
she earned per hour.

66
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,950
Working at the grocery, she
makes $12 per hour.

67
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,290
Babysitting, she makes
$9.50 per hour.

68
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,890
So what is going to be
her pay babysitting?

69
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,150
Let me write this over here.

70
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:13,320
Her pay babysitting-- I'll do
it in this color-- her pay

71
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,570
babysitting is going to
be equal to the time

72
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,370
babysitting, right?

73
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,620
The time babysitting times how
much she gets paid per hour.

74
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,090
The time babysitting is how many
hours, times how much she

75
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:25,900
gets paid per hour.

76
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,030
It tells us right there.

77
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,040
She gets paid $9.50 per
hour babysitting.

78
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,830
So times $9.50.

79
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,150
That is what her pay
babysitting is.

80
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,870
And then, same argument, what's
her pay working at the

81
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,370
grocery store?

82
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,970
Her total pay working at
the grocery store.

83
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,320
Her pay at the grocery is going
to be equal to the time

84
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,910
at the grocery times the rate
that she gets paid at the

85
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,050
grocery. $12 per hour.

86
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,630
So times $12 per hour.

87
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,320
And this hopefully
is intuitive.

88
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,430
If I'm making $12 per hour and
I work for, I don't know, 3

89
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,900
hours, I'm going to make $36.

90
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,390
I would just multiply
these two.

91
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:09,460
If I worked 2 hours at $9.50,
I'm going to make $19.

92
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,150
That's all this is.

93
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,280
A total pay.

94
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,060
So now we can take these two
expressions-- we could take

95
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,040
this expression and this
expression-- and substitute it

96
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,779
back into that equation right
there, and then we'll have an

97
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:24,190
equation that's only in terms
of the time babysitting and

98
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,400
the time at the grocery store.

99
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,510
So let's do that.

100
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:30,940
So this first term right here,
her total pay babysitting,

101
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,710
that is this expression
right there.

102
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,200
So let me write it right here.

103
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,420
So $9.50 times the
time babysitting.

104
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:41,130
So I'll just write 9.5 times
time babysitting-- that's this

105
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:48,670
term right here-- plus 56 is
equal to the pay that she got

106
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,460
at the grocery, which is 12
times the time at the grocery.

107
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,080
   

108
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,980
And now we need to solve for
both of these variables.

109
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,680
We have two equations
and two unknowns.

110
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,670
This is just straightforward
algebra at this point.

111
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,060
So let's do it.

112
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,950
So the easiest way to do this
might just be to do straight

113
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,750
up substitution cause we have
all these crazy numbers here.

114
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,870
Let's just solve for the time at
the babysitting in terms of

115
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,330
the time at the grocery.

116
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:19,140
So if you take this top
equation-- let me write it

117
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:23,210
over here-- so the time
babysitting plus the time at

118
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,800
the grocery is equal to 19.

119
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:32,250
If you subtract the time at the
grocery from both sides,

120
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,680
you get the time babysitting
is equal to-- these cancel

121
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,920
out-- 19 minus the time
at the grocery.

122
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,700
So we solved for the time
babysitting in terms of the

123
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,570
time at the grocery.

124
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:46,063
So everywhere we see the time
babysitting, we can substitute

125
00:05:46,063 --> 00:05:49,540
it with this expression
right here.

126
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,250
That's what t sub b is.

127
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,370
That is what the time
babysitting is.

128
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,290
So let's do that.

129
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:59,900
So this equation becomes 9.5
times the time babysitting,

130
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,780
which we just figured out from
this top equation is 19 minus

131
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:11,290
the time at the grocery, plus
56, is equal to 12 times the

132
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,010
time at the grocery.

133
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,890
And now we just have to solve
for the time at the grocery.

134
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:21,650
So 9.5 times 19.

135
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,770
That's a little bit of hairy.

136
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,470
Let me just do it over here, on
the right side right here.

137
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:32,430
So if I have 19 times 9.5.

138
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,320
5 times 9 is 45.

139
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,440
1 times 5 is 5, plus 4, is 9.

140
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,420
And then we have a 0 here.

141
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,410
9 times 9 is 81.

142
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:51,520
9 times 1 is 9, plus 8, is 17.

143
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,160
So 5 plus 0 is 5.

144
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,110
9 plus 1 is 10.

145
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,980
1 plus 7 is 8.

146
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,290
You just have a 1 there, and you
have one number behind the

147
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,030
decimal point.

148
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,130
So it's 180.5.

149
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:11,350
So 9.5 times 19 is 180.5 minus
9.5 times the time at the

150
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:18,830
grocery, plus 56, is
equal to 12 times

151
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,380
the time at the grocery.

152
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:24,780
Now what's 180.5 plus 56?

153
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,060
So 180 plus 50-- let's add just
those two terms-- 180.5

154
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,410
plus 56, just to simplify it.

155
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:35,300
180 plus 50 would be 230.

156
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:46,810
So this'll be 236.5 minus 9.5
times the time at the grocery,

157
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,400
is equal to 12 times the
time at the grocery.

158
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,740
Now we can add the time at the
grocery to both sides of this

159
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,270
equation, or the 9.5.

160
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,000
So let's do that.

161
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:04,800
Plus 9.5 times the time at the
grocery is equal-- or plus 9.5

162
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,820
times time at the grocery.

163
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,470
Just adding it to both sides
of that equation.

164
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,030
And we are left with-- the
left-hand side, that cancels

165
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:17,830
out-- we just have 236.5 is
equal to, 12 plus 9 is 21, so

166
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,880
this is going to be 21.5.

167
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:25,810
It's equal to 21.5 times the
time she spent at the grocery.

168
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,500
So now we can just divide both
sides of this equation by

169
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,970
21.5, and we've figured
out how long she

170
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,970
spent at the grocery.

171
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,230
Let's do that.

172
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:38,309
Divide both sides by 21.5.

173
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,460
So that cancels out.

174
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,309
The time she spent at the
grocery is going to be equal

175
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:43,940
to that thing.

176
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,440
And let's see what that is.

177
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:56,420
We get 21.5 goes into 236.5.

178
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,860
Let's multiply both of
these numbers by 10.

179
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:04,165
So this is the same thing
as 215 going into 2,365.

180
00:09:04,165 --> 00:09:06,200
The decimal goes right there.

181
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,270
215 goes into 236 one time.

182
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:13,060
1 times 215 is 215.

183
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,730
And then we can subtract-- let
me scroll down more-- this

184
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,910
problem is hairier than
I thought it would be.

185
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:21,000
So 36 minus 15 is 21.

186
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,400
So 21-- bring down the 5-- and
lucky for us that's pretty

187
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:24,890
straightforward.

188
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,290
215 goes into 215 one time.

189
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,890
1 times 215 is 215.

190
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:30,660
Subtract.

191
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,030
You get no remainder.

192
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:36,590
So the time at the grocery
store is 11, or 11 hours.

193
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,260
Now we can go and substitute
back to figure out her time

194
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,250
babysitting.

195
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,050
We know that the time
babysitting is equal to 19

196
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,510
minus the time at the grocery.

197
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:47,210
In this case, it's
19 minus 11.

198
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,500
We just figured that out.

199
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,790
19 minus 11 is 8.

200
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:55,880
So her time babysitting, she
spent 8 hours babysitting.

201
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,190
And we are done.

202
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,490
They both add up to 19, and you
could make sure that they

203
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,700
also verify.

204
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,230
That also works out for
the second equation.

205
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,933
