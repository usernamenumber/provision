1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
   

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,500
Simplify the rational
expression

3
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,160
and state the domain.

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,290
Once again, we have a trinomial
over a trinomial.

5
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:10,930
To see if we can simplify
them, we need to

6
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:11,920
factor both of them.

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,430
That's also going to help us
figure out the domain.

8
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,035
The domain is essentially
figuring out all of the valid

9
00:00:17,035 --> 00:00:20,270
x's that we can put into this
expression and not get

10
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,530
something that's undefined.

11
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,540
Let's factor the numerator
and the denominator.

12
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,590
So let's start with the
numerator there, and since we

13
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:34,200
have a 2 out front, factoring
by grouping will probably be

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,680
the best way to go, so let's
just rewrite it here.

15
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,190
I'm just working on the
numerator right now.

16
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,290
2x squared plus 13x plus 20.

17
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:46,270
We need to find two numbers,
a and b, that if I multiply

18
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,955
them, a times b, needs to be
equal to-- let me write it

19
00:00:49,955 --> 00:00:51,455
over here on the right.

20
00:00:51,455 --> 00:00:57,320
a times b needs to be equal to
2 times 20, so it has to be

21
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,220
equal to positive 40.

22
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:04,110
And then a plus b has
to be equal to 13.

23
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,990
The numbers that jump out
at me immediately

24
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,340
are 5 and 8, right?

25
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,430
5 times 8 is 40.

26
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,660
5 plus 8 is 13.

27
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:16,570
We can break this 13x into a
5x and an 8x, and so we can

28
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,790
rewrite this as 2x squared.

29
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:23,760
It'll break up the 13x into--
I'm going to write the 8x

30
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,880
first. I'm going to
write 8x plus 5x.

31
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,120
The reason why I wrote the 8x
first is because the 8 shares

32
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,810
common factors with the
2, so maybe we can

33
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,400
factor out a 2x here.

34
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,850
It'll simplify it
a little bit.

35
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,210
5 shares factors with the 20, so
let's see where this goes.

36
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,450
We finally have a plus
20 here, and now

37
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,220
we can group them.

38
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,980
That's the whole point of
factoring by grouping.

39
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,230
You group these first two
characters right here.

40
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:53,320
Let's factor out a 2x, so this
would become 2x times-- well,

41
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,400
2x squared divided by 2x
is just going to be x.

42
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,235
8x divided by 2x is going
to be plus 4.

43
00:02:00,235 --> 00:02:04,250
   

44
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,840
Let's group these
two characters.

45
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,919
And if we factor out a
5, what do we get?

46
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:15,050
We get plus 5 times x plus 4.

47
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:21,950
5x divided by 5 is x, 20
divided by 5 is 4.

48
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,900
We have an x plus 4 in
both cases, so we

49
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,590
can factor that out.

50
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,850
We have x plus 4 times two
terms. We can undistribute it.

51
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:38,430
This thing over here will be x
plus four times-- let me do it

52
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,940
in that same color--
2x plus 5.

53
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,560
   

54
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,480
And we've factored
this numerator

55
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,485
expression right there.

56
00:02:48,485 --> 00:02:50,490
Now, let's do the same thing
with the denominator

57
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:50,960
expression.

58
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,160
I'll do that in a different--
I don't want

59
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,010
to run out of colors.

60
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:58,090
So the denominator is right over
here, let's do the same

61
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,750
exercise with it.

62
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:05,550
We have 2x squared
plus 17x plus 30.

63
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,480
Let's look for an a and a b.

64
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,220
When I multiply them, I get
2 times 30, which is 60.

65
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:16,280
And an a plus a b, when
I add them, I get 17.

66
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,230
Once again, 5 and
12 seem to work.

67
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,040
So let's split this up.

68
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,540
Let's split this up
into 2x squared.

69
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:35,570
We're going to split up the 17x
into a 12x plus a 5x and

70
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,950
that adds up to 17x.

71
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:44,040
When you multiply 12 times 5,
you get 60, and then plus 30.

72
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:51,620
Then on this first group right
here, we can factor out a 2x,

73
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:57,460
so if you factor out a 2x, you
get 2x times x plus 6.

74
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:02,500
In that second group, we can
factor out a 5, so you get

75
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,750
plus 5 times x plus 6.

76
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,880
Now, we can factor out an x plus
6, and we get we get x

77
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:19,970
plus 6 times 2x plus 5.

78
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:23,600
   

79
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,470
We've now factored the numerator
and the denominator.

80
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,930
Let's rewrite both of these
expressions or write this

81
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,370
entire rational expression with
the numerator and the

82
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,770
denominator factored.

83
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,210
The numerator is going to
be equal to x plus 4

84
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,630
times 2x plus 5.

85
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,220
We figured that out
right there.

86
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:52,060
And then the denominator is
x plus 6 times 2x plus 5.

87
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,205
It might already jump out at you
that you have 2x plus 5 in

88
00:04:54,205 --> 00:04:55,390
the numerator and the
denominator, and we

89
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,570
can cancel them out.

90
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,620
We will cancel them out.

91
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,840
But before we do that, let's
work on the second part of

92
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,860
this question.

93
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,010
State the domain.

94
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,680
What are the valid x values
that we could put in here?

95
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,700
A more interesting question is
what are the x values that

96
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,290
will make this rational
expression undefined?

97
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:15,580
It's the x values that will make
the denominator equal to

98
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,470
0, and when will the denominator
equal to 0?

99
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:24,120
Well, either when x plus 6 is
equal to 0, or when 2x plus 5

100
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,540
is equal to 0.

101
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,830
We could just solve
for x here.

102
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,530
Subtract 6 from both sides,
and you get x is equal to

103
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,670
negative 6.

104
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,510
If you subtract 5 from both
sides, you get 2x is equal to

105
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,650
negative 5.

106
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,337
Divide both sides by 2.

107
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:40,520
You get x is equal
to negative 5/2.

108
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,080
We could say the domain-- let
me write this over here.

109
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:58,440
The domain is all real numbers
other than or except x is

110
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:04,580
equal to negative 6 and x is
equal to negative 5/2.

111
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,410
The reason why we have to
exclude those is those would

112
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,880
make this denominator-- either
way you're right.

113
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,150
It's going to go make the
denominator equal to 0, and it

114
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,150
would make the entire rational
expression undefined.

115
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,400
We've stated the domain.

116
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,080
Now let's just simplify the
rational expression.

117
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,490
We've already said that x cannot
be equal to negative

118
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,310
5/2 or negative 6, so let's just
divide the numerator and

119
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,990
the denominator by 2x plus 5.

120
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,580
Or just looking at the 2x plus
5, we know that 2x plus 5

121
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:32,630
won't be 0, because x won't be
equal to negative 5/2, and so

122
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,480
we can cancel those out.

123
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,380
The simplified rational
expression is just x plus 4

124
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,020
over x plus 6.

125
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,400
