1
00:00:01,646 --> 00:00:05,725
We need a numerical procedure which is easy in one direction,

2
00:00:05,725 --> 00:00:07,791
and hard in the other.

3
00:00:07,791 --> 00:00:12,689
This brings us to modular arithmetic, also known as clock arithmetic.

4
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:20,120
For example, to find 46 mod 12, we can take a rope of length 46 units,

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,510
and wrap it around a clock 12 units which is called the modulist,

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,325
and where the rope ends is the solution.

7
00:00:28,325 --> 00:00:32,877
So we say 46 mod 12 is congruent to 10.

8
00:00:32,877 --> 00:00:39,438
Easy. Now to make this work, we use a prime modulist, such as 17.

9
00:00:39,438 --> 00:00:44,194
Then we find a primitive root of 17, in this case, 3.

10
00:00:44,194 --> 00:00:48,509
Which has this important property that when raised to different exponents,

11
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:52,742
the solution distributes uniformly around the clock.

12
00:00:52,742 --> 00:01:00,102
3 is known as the generator. If we raise 3 to any exponent x,

13
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:05,510
then the solution is equally likely to be any integer between 0 and 17.

14
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,858
Now, the reverse procedure is hard.

15
00:01:08,858 --> 00:01:14,038
Say, given 12, find the exponent 3 needs to be raised to.

16
00:01:14,038 --> 00:01:17,736
This is called the Discrete Logarithm problem.

17
00:01:17,736 --> 00:01:20,424
And now we have our one way function.

18
00:01:20,424 --> 00:01:23,690
Easy to perform, but hard to reverse.

19
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:30,223
Given 12, we would have to resort to trial an error to find matching exponents.

20
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,612
How hard is this?

21
00:01:32,612 --> 00:01:39,073
Well with small numbers it's easy, but if we use a prime modulist which is hundreds of digits long,

22
00:01:39,073 --> 00:01:42,086
it becomes impractical to solve.

23
00:01:42,086 --> 00:01:47,315
Even if you had access to all computational power on earth, it could take thousands of years

24
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,751
to run through all possibilities.

25
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:53,751
So the strength of a one way function is based on the time needed to reverse it.
