1
00:00:00,147 --> 00:00:02,878
So how do we know that there is a core

2
00:00:02,878 --> 00:00:07,004
and that the core is made up of a liquid outer core and a solid inner core?

3
00:00:07,004 --> 00:00:13,445
The answer there comes from the same technique that we saw Mohorovičić used in 1909

4
00:00:13,445 --> 00:00:17,472
to essentially see how the behaviour or when you measure the siesmic waves

5
00:00:17,472 --> 00:00:19,440
or whether you can even measure the siesmic waves,

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,605
the different distances from an earthquake.

7
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:27,733
So if there is an earthquake right here and we are calling that 0 degrees,

8
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:29,873
let's remember a couple of things here.

9
00:00:29,873 --> 00:00:34,870
Let's remember that P-waves can travel through anything.

10
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,806
They can travel through solids or liquid or air for that matter.

11
00:00:37,806 --> 00:00:41,628
So they can travel through anything.

12
00:00:41,628 --> 00:00:47,612
But S-waves can only - S for secondary, these are the transverse waves -

13
00:00:47,612 --> 00:00:52,140
these can only travel through solids.

14
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,803
So it turns out that if an earthquake happens at 0 degrees

15
00:00:55,803 --> 00:01:00,204
and you have seismograph stations all over the world and these are extremely sensitive

16
00:01:00,204 --> 00:01:05,024
in order to measure earthquakes that are happening thousands of kilometres away.

17
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:10,695
It turns out that there is something called a S-wave shadow.

18
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:13,672
You can measure them here, you can measure them here.

19
00:01:13,672 --> 00:01:20,823
They can go all the way over there, they can go over there, you can measure them over here.

20
00:01:20,823 --> 00:01:22,737
You can see you can measure it in all of these points

21
00:01:22,737 --> 00:01:26,871
but then all of a sudden at 105 degrees -

22
00:01:26,871 --> 00:01:29,603
we are measuring 0 degrees here and we are going outwards like that -

23
00:01:29,603 --> 00:01:34,538
suddenly at 105 degrees and further you stop measuring S-waves.

24
00:01:34,538 --> 00:01:39,596
They don't get for some reason. You'd think that the S-waves would get over here.

25
00:01:39,596 --> 00:01:41,908
That they would get over here, maybe a little bit weaker

26
00:01:41,908 --> 00:01:44,004
but they would be able to get all the way over here.

27
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:47,600
But they just abruptly stop. No more S-waves.

28
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,583
So in this whole area right over here you get no S-waves.

29
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,654
And obviously I could flip this picture over

30
00:01:55,654 --> 00:01:59,059
and you would see a symetric thing on the other side of the globe

31
00:01:59,059 --> 00:02:04,655
all over this area over here you also would not see S-waves.

32
00:02:04,655 --> 00:02:10,390
You would only see them from 105 degrees in this direction and 105 degrees in that direction.

33
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:15,063
And the only reasonable explanation that we could give

34
00:02:15,063 --> 00:02:18,729
is that there must be some material that an S-wave cannot travel thorugh

35
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:23,255
that it would have to travel through to get to these points beyond 105 degrees.

36
00:02:23,255 --> 00:02:28,064
And we know that S-waves only travel in solids.

37
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:32,186
So the assumption there is that at some point beyond 105 degrees

38
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:34,257
it's hitting liquid.

39
00:02:34,257 --> 00:02:40,319
So that's what tells us that this right here is probably a liquid.

40
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:46,219
It's hitting some layer that is liquid. So that tells us that there is a core

41
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:51,017
and that at least the outer part of that core is liquid enough to stop S-waves.

42
00:02:51,017 --> 00:02:54,184
So the S-waves because they only travel in solids

43
00:02:54,184 --> 00:03:01,059
it leads to this S-wave shadow and this tells us that we have a core

44
00:03:01,059 --> 00:03:05,521
and that core at least the outer part is liquid.

45
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:10,022
We don't know yet whether the inner part is liquid or solid.

46
00:03:10,022 --> 00:03:13,833
Now the next point of it is how do we know that there is an inner core?

47
00:03:13,858 --> 00:03:15,963
We could use P-waves for that.

48
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:18,725
A P-wave can travel through anything.

49
00:03:18,725 --> 00:03:20,502
But remember, as you get denser material,

50
00:03:20,502 --> 00:03:23,521
in general, for the same type of material

51
00:03:23,521 --> 00:03:27,106
if you get denser material its going to move faster

52
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,721
so its going to refract outwards like we see here,

53
00:03:29,721 --> 00:03:34,588
but if it goes into a liquid in general sound waves or as I should say P-waves

54
00:03:34,588 --> 00:03:39,439
or seismic waves will move slower in liquids.

55
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,265
And so the refraction patterns that we get,

56
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:46,160
what we do measure from seismograph stations around the world,

57
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,991
is that it looks like the P-waves are kind of doing what we would expect in the mantle,

58
00:03:50,991 --> 00:03:54,787
but then they're getting refracted as if they're going into a slower medium

59
00:03:54,787 --> 00:03:57,767
as they go through the outer core,

60
00:03:57,767 --> 00:03:59,719
and we that right over here,

61
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:01,517
and then they get refracted again,

62
00:04:01,517 --> 00:04:03,794
to get to some point on the other side.

63
00:04:03,794 --> 00:04:06,457
That is just what you'd expect if it was all liquid.

64
00:04:06,457 --> 00:04:10,453
But if you go to stations as we get further out

65
00:04:10,453 --> 00:04:12,589
it looks like, if you just look at the refraction patterns,

66
00:04:12,589 --> 00:04:15,856
and you can now model that with fancy computers and get all the data points,

67
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:20,267
but you could say the only way that reality can fit the data we get,

68
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:22,121
based on when things reach here,

69
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:26,050
is if the P-waves are being first refracted to the outer core,

70
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,455
but then they're refracted away that they're going through a denser material,

71
00:04:29,455 --> 00:04:32,984
significantly denser material in the inner core,

72
00:04:32,984 --> 00:04:37,190
and then the're just continuing to refract the way you would expect.

73
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,124
So it's really the refraction pattern of the P-waves.

74
00:04:41,124 --> 00:04:45,934
And frankly the fact that there is what we call the P-wave shadow.

75
00:04:45,934 --> 00:04:48,319
The P-wave shadow by itself, all that tells you

76
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,782
is that kind of roughly crazy things are happening someplace in the core,

77
00:04:52,782 --> 00:04:56,455
but the real way we know that we have the inner core that's solid,

78
00:04:56,455 --> 00:04:58,790
as supposed the whole thing being liquid,

79
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:05,119
is the pattern when and how the P-waves reach essentially the other side of the globe,

80
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:12,650
based on modelling how waves would travel through different densities and different types of medium

81
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,526
you can say, wow, there's got to be an inner core right over here.

82
00:05:15,526 --> 00:05:18,195
And obviously it's a lot more math that I'm not going into,

83
00:05:18,195 --> 00:05:20,191
but if you'd do that math based on the shadow

84
00:05:20,191 --> 00:05:22,787
and you'd know the speed in that material and all of that things,

85
00:05:22,787 --> 00:05:28,319
that you could figure out the depth at which these transitions occure.

86
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,453
We know that we have an transition from mantle to outer core here,

87
00:05:31,453 --> 00:05:34,609
and then the transition from outer core to core there.

88
00:05:34,609 --> 00:05:37,359
So hopefully that satiates your questions

89
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:40,659
about how do we know what the composition of the Earth is

90
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:45,274
without ever having to dig down there.

91
00:05:45,274 --> 00:05:49,000
We've never even got below our crust.
