1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620
   

2
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,250
There's one more case of
partial fraction expansion

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,960
or decomposition problems
that you might see, so I

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,100
thought I would cover it.

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,960
And that's the situation where
you have a repeated factor

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,790
in the denominator.

7
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,060
So let's see, I've constructed
a little problem here.

8
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,540
It's 6x squared.

9
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,790
Let me make sure
my pen is right.

10
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:27,460
6x squared minus 19x plus 15.

11
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:33,880
All of that over x minus 1
times-- and this is the

12
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,640
thing that makes this one
especially interesting--

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,500
x minus 2 squared.

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,560
So you might say, gee, this
is a little bit different.

15
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,660
Because what do I do here?

16
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,840
I have this first degree
factor, but it shows up twice.

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,860
It doesn't make sense,
for example, it wouldn't

18
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,020
make sense to do this.

19
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:59,240
A over x minus 1 plus B over x
minus 2 plus C over x minus 2.

20
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,610
Because if you did this, the
B and the C would just add

21
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,670
together, because they have
the same denominator.

22
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,690
You could just view
them as one variable.

23
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,670
You wouldn't have to have two
separate variables here.

24
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,940
So this wouldn't make sense
as a partial fraction

25
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,160
expansion of this.

26
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,820
You might want to maybe square
this and view it as a second

27
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,420
degree term, and do it like you
did in the previous example.

28
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,540
But then you wouldn't have
fully decomposed this problem.

29
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,900
And so the answer here-- and
I'll just show you how to do

30
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,830
it, I'll maybe leave it to you
a little bit to think about why

31
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,700
it works-- is to decompose it
almost like this, but instead

32
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,180
of having C over x minus
2, you're going to have C

33
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,005
over x minus 2 squared.

34
00:01:35,005 --> 00:01:36,720
And I'll try to give
you a little intuition

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,150
about why that happens.

36
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:43,490
So the decomposition here is
going to be A over x minus 1

37
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:53,430
plus B over x minus 2 plus
C over x minus 2 squared.

38
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,890
And the intuition here is
that if you were to-- let's

39
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,270
ignore this term right here.

40
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,790
But if you were to add these
two terms right there, you

41
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:07,790
would get a rational function
that would end up having

42
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,200
something times x
plus something.

43
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,390
And so it would be consistent
with what we did in the second

44
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,960
partial fraction video, where
if you would have a second

45
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,360
degree term on the bottom, and
the numerator, when you add

46
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,300
just these two parts-- let
me clarify what I'm saying.

47
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,750
And this is just for intuition.

48
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:30,990
If you were to add just these
two parts here, you would get

49
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,680
something times x plus
something, all of that

50
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,710
over x minus 2 squared.

51
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:42,110
And that's consistent with what
we did in the previous video,

52
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,030
where we said if we have a
second degree term in the

53
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,610
denominator-- which this really
is if you were to expand this--

54
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,930
you should have a first degree
term in the numerator.

55
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:49,830
So I'll leave that there.

56
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,570
That's a little bit of a
nuance, and it's good to

57
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,570
think about why this works.

58
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,500
But with that said, let's
just solve this problem.

59
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,890
Let me erase some of this
stuff that I've written.

60
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,860
Let me erase all of that.

61
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,980
All right.

62
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,590
Ready to work on this problem.

63
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,640
So given that this is the
expansion, now we just have

64
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,630
to solve for A, B, and C.

65
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,820
So if we were to add these
three fractions, the common

66
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:27,380
denominator is x minus 1
times x minus 2 squared.

67
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,950
   

68
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:33,860
This is a factor of that, so
the least common multiple of

69
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,290
this and this is just this.

70
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,320
So it's just x minus 2 squared
there, and that's why we

71
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,200
just did this to begin with.

72
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,920
And the numerator is going
to be-- let me do it in

73
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,646
a different color-- A.

74
00:03:45,646 --> 00:03:47,460
What do we have to
multiply A by?

75
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,860
A times x minus 2
squared, right?

76
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,330
If we canceled these out,
you're just left with

77
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,440
A over x minus 1.

78
00:03:54,440 --> 00:04:02,400
Plus B times x minus
1 times x minus 2.

79
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:02,620
Right?

80
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,670
If we cancel out the x minus
1's and one of these x minus

81
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,890
2's from down here, you're just
left with B over x minus 2.

82
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:14,650
Plus C times x minus 1.

83
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,260
If that cancels with that,
we're left with C over

84
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,850
x minus 2 squared.

85
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:24,360
And all of this is going to be
equal to-- that up there in

86
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,410
blue is going to be equal to--
I have to write it smaller-- 6x

87
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:36,440
squared minus 19x plus 15,
all of that over x minus 1

88
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,390
times x minus 2 squared.

89
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,370
And like we've done in
every problem so far, the

90
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,060
denominators are the same, so
we can just set the numerators

91
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,480
equal to each other and try to
solve for A, B, and C.

92
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,450
Let me write that.

93
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,070
And I'm really just
rewriting it.

94
00:04:52,070 --> 00:05:00,550
A times x minus 2 squared plus
B times x minus 1 times x minus

95
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:07,160
2 plus C times x minus 1
is going to be equal to 6x

96
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,260
squared minus 19x plus 15.

97
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,140
There you go.

98
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,530
And now we have to
solve for them.

99
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,730
And we can do it just the way
we done the previous problems.

100
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:19,610
We can pick choices for x that
make things cancel out nicely.

101
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,660
So if we wanted to solve
for A, we want to make the

102
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,380
B and the C cancel out.

103
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,270
We just have to pick
x is equal to 1.

104
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,910
Because if x is equal
to 1, this becomes

105
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,840
0, so C disappears.

106
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,230
This becomes 0, so this whole
term disappears, and we're

107
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,360
just left with this and this.

108
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,450
So let's do that.

109
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:39,420
So when x is equal to 1, we
get-- let me pick another

110
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:47,560
color-- A times, 1 minus 2 is
minus 1, squared is just 1.

111
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,430
So it's A times 1.

112
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,920
So we can just
leave the A there.

113
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,400
This becomes 0, because
this term right here

114
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,030
will be 0 if x is 1.

115
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,540
This become 0, because
that term would be 0

116
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,710
if x is equal to 1.

117
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:05,010
So A is equal to 6 times
1-- so 6-- minus 19 times

118
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:09,200
1-- minus 19-- plus 15.

119
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:09,850
And what is that?

120
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:16,210
Minus 19 plus 15, that's minus
4, plus 6, that is equal to 2.

121
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,390
There you go.

122
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,890
Now let's try to solve for--
let's see, what can we do?

123
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,830
If we make x equal to 2,
the A will disappear.

124
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,760
This whole term will disappear,
because this would be 0.

125
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,220
So we could use that
to solve for C.

126
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:36,560
So if we say that x is equal
to 2, then we get this term

127
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,270
would be 0, because that's 0.

128
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:41,930
This whole expression is 0,
because x minus 2 would be 0.

129
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,660
And we're just left with C
times 2 minus 1, so that's

130
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:51,040
just 1-- so C is equal
to 6 times 4, right?

131
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,180
2 squared.

132
00:06:52,180 --> 00:07:00,910
So it's 24, minus 38--
19 times 2-- plus 15.

133
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:07,340
Let's see, 24 plus 15 is 39,
minus 38, that is equal to 1.

134
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,250
We're in the home stretch.

135
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,430
And now for B, there's no
obvious way to make the other

136
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,600
two cancel out without
making the B cancel out.

137
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,570
But we've solved for everything
else, so we can really just

138
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,790
pick an arbitrary value for x
that'll make things

139
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,200
easy to compute.

140
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,870
So if we just pick x is equal
to 0, that's always something

141
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,760
that can clear out a lot of
the hairiness of an algebra

142
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,980
problem. x is equal
to 0, not 3.

143
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,760
x is equal to 0.

144
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,630
Let me do that in a
different color.

145
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,690
If x is equal to 0,
then what do we have?

146
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,350
We have A, but A is 2, right?

147
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:41,570
2 times 0 minus 2 squared.

148
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:46,050
So that's minus 2 squared,
so that's 2 times 4.

149
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:50,690
Plus B-- that's what we're
trying to solve for; we already

150
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:54,200
solved for everything--
B times minus 1, right?

151
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,140
0 minus 1 is minus 1.

152
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:03,620
Times minus 2, plus C times
minus 1 is equal to-- well,

153
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:08,660
if x is 0, then this is 0,
this is 0, is equal to 15.

154
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,190
Then we just solve for B.

155
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:16,240
We get 8 plus 2B, right?

156
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,280
Minus 1 times minus
2 is plus 2.

157
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,770
Oh, and we shouldn't have
written the C here,

158
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:22,560
we know what C is.

159
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,580
C is 1.

160
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,960
So this is just a 1.

161
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,260
So 1 times minus 1 is
minus 1, is equal to 15.

162
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:36,990
And let's see, we have 2B is
equal to, lets see, 16 is

163
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:41,760
equal to 8, B is equal to 4,
dividing both sides by 2.

164
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,080
So we're done.

165
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,580
So the partial fraction
decomposition of this right

166
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:54,490
here is A, which we've
solved for, which is 2.

167
00:08:54,490 --> 00:09:03,440
So it equals 2 over x minus 1
plus B, which is 4-- plus 4

168
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:12,820
over x minus 2, plus C, which
is 1, over x minus 2 squared.

169
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,780
And what we did in this with
the repeated factor is

170
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,690
true if we went to a
higher degree term.

171
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:22,970
So if we had blah blah blah,
some polynomial there, and it

172
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:27,770
was all over x minus-- I
don't know, some number.

173
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:31,420
x minus a to the 10th power.

174
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,770
Well, to the--
well, yeah, sure.

175
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:34,980
To the 10th power.

176
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:40,300
If we wanted to decompose this
partial fraction, or expand it,

177
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,630
it would be A over x minus
a-- it's a different a.

178
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,930
I'm just showing this.

179
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:51,210
Plus B times x minus a
squared, plus, and you

180
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,220
go blah blah blah.

181
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,270
You'd have 10 terms, plus-- I
don't know what the 10th letter

182
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,150
of the alphabet is; maybe
it's H or I or something.

183
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,510
Maybe it's J.

184
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:05,160
J over x minus a to the 10th.

185
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,550
So you can use that property in
general, though you'll very

186
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,960
seldom see something like this,
because computationally

187
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,950
it would take you
forever to do it.

188
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,440
The hairiest problem that you
might see with three variables

189
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,290
on an actual exam is probably
something like I showed you in

190
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,120
the previous example, or what
I just showed you right now.

191
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,950
Anything hairier than
that, you'd probably end

192
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:23,720
up using a computer.

193
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,270
But you should know how to do
it, because if you have a

194
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,530
computer and you're solving a
real world problem that is a

195
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,490
lot more complicated than this,
you should know how to do it.

196
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:34,170
Anyway, hope you found
that a bit helpful.

197
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:34,460
