00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,345
In the last video we got as far as figuring out that the area of this Koch snowflake

2
00:00:04,345 --> 00:00:10,004
This thing that has an infinite perimeter, can be expressed as this infinite sum over here

3
00:00:10,004 --> 00:00:15,206
So our job in this video is to try to simplify this, and hopefully get a finite value

4
00:00:15,206 --> 00:00:19,721
Let's do our best to actually simplify this thing right over here

5
00:00:19,721 --> 00:00:24,355
So the easiest part of this thing to simplify is this right over here

6
00:00:24,355 --> 00:00:25,806
So let's just focus on that

7
00:00:25,806 --> 00:00:29,426
Then if we can get a value for this part that I am bracketing off

8
00:00:29,426 --> 00:00:32,731
Then we can just place that value here and simplify the rest of it

9
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:42,112
So what I've just bracketed off can be re-written as three times four ninths

10
00:00:42,112 --> 00:00:45,974
plus four ninths squared

11
00:00:45,974 --> 00:00:51,774
plus four ninths to the third power

12
00:00:51,774 --> 00:00:53,791
And you can go on and on and on

13
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:59,910
Plus four ninths to every other power, all the way through infinity!

14
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:05,810
Lucky for us, there is a way to figure out this infinite (geometric) series

15
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:11,395
There's a way to figure this out, and I've done several videos where we prove the general thing

16
00:01:11,395 --> 00:01:16,164
But I'll just do it by hand this time, just so that we don't have to resort to some magical formulas

17
00:01:16,164 --> 00:01:21,808
So let's say that we define some sum, this one over here (let's call it S)

18
00:01:21,808 --> 00:01:27,281
Let's say that S is equal to what we have in parentheses over here

19
00:01:27,281 --> 00:01:35,241
It's going to be equal to four ninths, plus four ninths squared, plus four ninths to the third

20
00:01:35,241 --> 00:01:38,748
all the way to infinity

21
00:01:38,748 --> 00:01:50,264
Now let's also say that we multiply S by four ninths

22
00:01:50,264 --> 00:01:56,299
What's four ninths S going to look like?

23
00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:00,051
So then, I'm just essentially multiplying every term here by four ninths

24
00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:03,404
So if I take this first term and multiply it by four ninths, what am I going to get?

25
00:02:03,404 --> 00:02:07,719
Well I'm going to get four ninths squared

26
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:15,323
If I take the second term and multiply it by four ninths, I'm going to get four ninths to the third power

27
00:02:15,323 --> 00:02:17,283
And we are going to go all the way to infinity

28
00:02:17,283 --> 00:02:18,650
So this is interesting

29
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:24,281
When I multiply four ninths times this I get all of the terms here except for this first four ninths

30
00:02:24,281 --> 00:02:30,633
Now, this is kind of the magic of how we can actually find the sum of an infinite geometric series

31
00:02:30,633 --> 00:02:37,173
We can subtract this term right over here (this pink line) from this green line

32
00:02:37,173 --> 00:02:41,805
If we do that, clearly this is equal to that and this is equal to that

33
00:02:41,805 --> 00:02:45,951
So if we subtract this from that its equivalent to subtracting the pink from the green

34
00:02:45,951 --> 00:02:58,715
So we get S minus four ninths S is equal to...

35
00:02:58,715 --> 00:03:04,880
Well, every other term, this guy minus this guy is going to cancel out

36
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,066
And that's going to happen all the way to infinity

37
00:03:09,066 --> 00:03:17,299
and on the right hand side you're only going to be left with this four ninths over here

38
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:25,787
Then this four ninths, we can (S is the same thing as nine over nine) write this as nine over nine S

39
00:03:25,787 --> 00:03:28,285
minus four ninths S is equal to four ninths

40
00:03:28,285 --> 00:03:32,714
So nine over nine minus four over nine of something gives us five over nine

41
00:03:32,714 --> 00:03:37,501
So this becomes five ninths S is equal to four ninths

42
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:41,881
Then to solve for S (and this is kind of magical but it's actually quite logical)

43
00:03:41,881 --> 00:03:50,182
Multiply both sides times the inverse of this, so times nine fifths on both sides

44
00:03:50,182 --> 00:03:54,867
These guys cancel out, and we get S is equal to four fifths

45
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:56,910
That's really neat!

46
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:04,796
We've just shown that this whole thing over here is equal to four fifths

47
00:04:04,796 --> 00:04:09,320
So this entire bracket that we did over here is equal to three times four fifths

48
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:19,918
This entire bracket is equal to twelve over five

49
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,453
Now let's go to our original expression, so we don't lose track of what we are doing

50
00:04:24,453 --> 00:04:29,886
We have this square root of three times S squared over sixteen

51
00:04:29,886 --> 00:04:42,870
Then we have this four here plus the entire thing in brackets (which simplified to twelve fifths)

52
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:52,913
Just to add these two together we can rewrite four as twenty fifths

53
00:04:52,913 --> 00:04:58,105
and then twenty over five plus twelve over five is thirty-two over five

54
00:04:58,105 --> 00:05:05,703
Let me write that down over here

55
00:05:05,703 --> 00:05:07,907
This is the home stretch now, this is very exciting!

56
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:13,279
We are about to find the finite area of something that has an infinite perimeter!

57
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:21,233
So it's going to be square root of three times S squared over sixteen

58
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:27,036
Times thirty-two over five

59
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:35,031
We can divide the thirty-two in the numerator by the sixteen there, which gives two

60
00:05:35,031 --> 00:05:42,562
We are left with the area of a Koch snowflake

61
00:05:42,562 --> 00:05:49,928
(where the initial equalateral triangle that we started with has each of its sides as length S)

62
00:05:49,928 --> 00:06:10,712
is, two times the square root of three times S squared all over five

63
00:06:10,712 --> 00:06:18,608
For example, if that first equalateral triangle had a side-length of one

64
00:06:18,608 --> 00:06:28,181
Then the area of this crazy thing (that has an infinite perimeter) would just be two square roots of three over five

65
00:06:28,181 --> 99:59:59,999
Anyway, I think that's kind of cool
