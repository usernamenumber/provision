1
00:00:00,841 --> 00:00:03,646
Solve for x and check your solution.

2
00:00:03,646 --> 00:00:07,935
We have x divided by 3 is equal to 14.

3
00:00:07,935 --> 00:00:09,299
So to solve for x,

4
00:00:09,299 --> 00:00:12,521
to figure out what the variable x must be equal to,

5
00:00:12,521 --> 00:00:15,804
we really just have to isolate it on the left hand side of this equation

6
00:00:15,804 --> 00:00:16,863
It's already sitting there.

7
00:00:16,863 --> 00:00:19,500
And we have x divided by 3 is equal to 14

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,911
We could also write this as 1/3 x =14.

9
00:00:24,911 --> 00:00:27,700
Obviously x*1/3 is going to be x/3.

10
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,647
These are equivalent.

11
00:00:28,647 --> 00:00:31,850
So how can we just end up with x on the left hand side

12
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,179
of either of these equations?

13
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:34,193
These are really the same thing.

14
00:00:34,193 --> 00:00:37,308
Or another way, how can we just have a 1 in front of the x

15
00:00:37,308 --> 00:00:39,488
A 1x, which is really just saying x

16
00:00:39,488 --> 00:00:40,340
over here

17
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,812
Well, I'm dividing it by 3 right now

18
00:00:42,812 --> 00:00:46,308
So if I were to multiply both sides of this equation by 3

19
00:00:46,308 --> 00:00:47,617
that would isolate the x

20
00:00:47,617 --> 00:00:49,464
And the reason that would work is

21
00:00:49,464 --> 00:00:51,313
if I multiply this by 3 over here

22
00:00:51,313 --> 00:00:53,974
I'm multiplying by 3 and dividing by 3

23
00:00:53,974 --> 00:00:55,798
that's equivalent you would just, that's equivalent

24
00:00:55,798 --> 00:00:58,091
to multiplying or dividing by 1

25
00:00:58,091 --> 00:00:59,285
these guys cancel out

26
00:00:59,285 --> 00:01:01,133
But remember, if you do it to the left hand side

27
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:03,313
you also have to do it to the right hand side

28
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,151
And actually, I'll do both of these equations

29
00:01:05,151 --> 00:01:06,028
at the same time

30
00:01:06,028 --> 00:01:08,181
Cuz they're really the exact same equation

31
00:01:08,181 --> 00:01:11,285
So what are we going to get over here on the left hand side?

32
00:01:11,285 --> 00:01:15,339
3 times anything divided by 3 is going to be that anything

33
00:01:15,339 --> 00:01:17,369
we're just going to have an x left over

34
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,819
on the left hand side

35
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:20,247
And on the right hand side

36
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:21,923
what's 14*3

37
00:01:21,923 --> 00:01:29,350
3<i>10 is 30, 3</i>4 is 12, so it's going to be 42

38
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,873
So we get x=42

39
00:01:31,873 --> 00:01:33,541
And the same thing would happen here

40
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:35,915
3*1/3 is just 1

41
00:01:35,915 --> 00:01:38,577
So you get 1x is equal to 14*3

42
00:01:38,577 --> 00:01:40,094
which is 42

43
00:01:40,094 --> 00:01:41,674
now let's just check our answer

44
00:01:41,674 --> 00:01:43,717
let's substitute 42 into our original equation

45
00:01:43,717 --> 00:01:47,333
So we have 42 in place for x

46
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:48,832
in place for x

47
00:01:48,832 --> 00:01:52,032
over 3 is equal to 14

48
00:01:52,032 --> 00:01:54,470
So what's 42 divided by 3

49
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,293
And we could do a little bit of

50
00:01:56,293 --> 00:01:58,444
I guess we'd call it medium long division

51
00:01:58,444 --> 00:01:59,630
It's not really long division.

52
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,509
3 into 4, 3 goes into 4 one time

53
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:04,223
1*3 is 3

54
00:02:04,223 --> 00:02:06,819
You subtract: 4-3 is 1

55
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:08,509
Bring down the 2

56
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:10,993
3 goes into 12 four times

57
00:02:10,993 --> 00:02:14,670
So 3 goes into 42 14 times

58
00:02:14,685 --> 00:02:19,050
So this right over here simplifies to 14

59
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,100
And it all checks out

60
00:02:21,100 --> 99:59:59,999
So we're done.
