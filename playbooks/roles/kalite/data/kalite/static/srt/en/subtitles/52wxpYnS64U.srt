1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,680
   

2
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:01,360
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,820
We just finished this problem
with the pulleys and the

4
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:04,490
inclined plane.

5
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,890
And I just wanted to do one
final thing on this problem

6
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,430
just because I think
it's interesting.

7
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,150
And then we can move onto
what seems like

8
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,810
a pretty fun problem.

9
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,780
So the last thing I want to
figure out is, we figured out

10
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,720
that this 20 kilo-- actually,
the whole system will

11
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,860
accelerate up and to
the right at 4.13

12
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,260
meters per second squared.

13
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,580
And then the second part of this
question is, what is the

14
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:28,485
tension in this rope
or this wire?

15
00:00:28,485 --> 00:00:30,990
And at first you might say,
this is complicated.

16
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,940
You know, this thing isn't
static anymore.

17
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,390
The thing is actually
accelerating.

18
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,370
How do I do it?

19
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,900
Well this is how you
think about it.

20
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,350
Just pick one part
of the system.

21
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:43,430
Let's say that all we could see
was this 20 kilogram mass.

22
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:48,340
So let's say all we could see
was this 20 kilogram mass.

23
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,760
And we know it's suspended
from a wire.

24
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,780
And we also know that this
20 kilogram mass is not

25
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,840
accelerating as fast
as it would if

26
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,980
the wire wasn't there.

27
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,210
It's accelerating only at
4.13 meters per second.

28
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,510
If the wire wasn't there, it'd
be accelerating at 9.8 meters

29
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,430
per second, the acceleration
of gravity.

30
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,140
So the wire must be exerting
some upward

31
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,520
force on the object.

32
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,306
And that is the force
of tension.

33
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:17,060
That is what's slowing-- that's
what's moderating its

34
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,090
acceleration from being 9.8
meters per second squared to

35
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,180
being 4.13 meters per
second squared.

36
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,290
So essentially, what is the
net force on this object?

37
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,550
On just this object?

38
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,310
Well the net force is-- and
you can ignore what I said

39
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,100
before about the net force
in all the other places.

40
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:42,050
But we know that the object
is accelerating downwards.

41
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,400
Well, we know it's 20 kilograms.
So that's its mass.

42
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,980
And we know that it's
accelerating downwards at 4.13

43
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,230
meters per second squared.

44
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:51,220
   

45
00:01:51,220 --> 00:02:00,460
So the net force, 20 times--
see, times 20 is 82-- let's

46
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,120
just say 83 Newtons.

47
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,400
83 Newtons down.

48
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,990
We know that the net force
is 83 Newtons down.

49
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:16,520
We also know that the tension
force plus the force of

50
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,200
gravity-- and what's the
force of gravity?

51
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,780
The force of gravity is just
the weight of the object.

52
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,680
So the force of tension, which
goes up, plus the weight of --

53
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,030
the force of gravity is equal
to the net force.

54
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,010
And the way I set this up,
tension's going to be a

55
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,270
negative number.

56
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,530
Just because I'm saying
positive numbers are

57
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,060
downwards, so a negative number
would be upwards.

58
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:46,870
So tension will be what
is 83 minus 196?

59
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:54,800
Minus 196 is equal to
minus 113 Newtons.

60
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,040
And the only reason why I got a
negative number is because I

61
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,150
used positive numbers
for downwards.

62
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,520
So minus 113 Newtons downwards,
which is the same

63
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,160
thing as 113 Newtons upwards.

64
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,530
And so that is the tension
in the rope.

65
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,970
And you could have done the same
thing on this side of the

66
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,120
problem, although it would
have been-- well, yeah.

67
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,290
You could have done the
exact same thing on

68
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,150
this side of the problem.

69
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,750
You would've said, well what
would it have accelerated

70
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,870
naturally if there wasn't some
force of tension on this rope

71
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,230
going backwards?

72
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,090
And then you're saying, oh,
well, we know it would have

73
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,350
gone in this direction at some
acceleration, but instead it's

74
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,570
going in the other direction.

75
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,090
So you use that.

76
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,460
You figure out the net force,
and then you say the tension

77
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,840
plus all of these forces have
to equal the net force.

78
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,200
And then you should solve
for the tension.

79
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,510
And it would be the
same tension.

80
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:44,760
Now we will do a fun and
somewhat simple, but maybe

81
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,780
instructive problem.

82
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,860
So I have a pie.

83
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,110
This is the pie.

84
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:54,140
   

85
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,580
This is parallel.

86
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,270
And I have my hand.

87
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:02,070
You can tell that my destiny
was really to be a great

88
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,170
artist. This is my hand.

89
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:10,100
And I'm holding a pie, and I'm
looking to smash this pie into

90
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,670
this individual's face.

91
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:19,382
   

92
00:04:19,382 --> 00:04:24,790
I actually was a, I was the
newspaper cartoonist in high

93
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:28,360
school, so I have some
minor-- but anyway.

94
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,140
Let's make it a bald man.

95
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,950
Well anyway, I shouldn't be
focusing on the drawing.

96
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,400
   

97
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,650
He has a moustache.

98
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:41,280
   

99
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,720
Anyway, I'm looking to throw
this pie into this guy's face.

100
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,090
And the problem is, I need to
figure out how fast do I need

101
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,250
to accelerate this pie for
it to not fall down?

102
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:52,490
Right?

103
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,190
Because what's happening?

104
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,290
Well there's the force of
gravity on this pie.

105
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,500
There's a force of gravity on
this pie and if I don't

106
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,220
accelerate it fast enough, it's
just going to slide down.

107
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,000
And I'll never be able
to, It'll never

108
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,200
reach the guy's face.

109
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,440
So I don't want this pie
to slide down at all.

110
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,070
How fast do I have
to push on it?

111
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,640
Well, we know that the
coefficient of friction-- you

112
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,400
don't know this, but I know
that the coefficient of

113
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,700
friction between my hand and
the pie, the coefficient of

114
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:23,170
friction is equal to 0.8.

115
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,290
So given that, how fast do
I have to accelerate it?

116
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,650
Well let's see what's
happening.

117
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,720
So we have the force of
gravity pulling down.

118
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,550
So let's say that the mass
of the pie is m.

119
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,860
m equals mass.

120
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,400
So what is the force of gravity

121
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,630
pulling down on the pie?

122
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:47,350
Well the force of gravity is
just equal to m times 9.8.

123
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,490
Right?

124
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,420
The force of gravity is
equal to m times 9.8.

125
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:55,810
In order for this pie to not
move down, what do we know

126
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,950
about the net forces
on that pie?

127
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:02,330
Well we know the net forces
on that pie have to be 0.

128
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,010
So what would be the
offsetting force?

129
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,630
Well, it would be the
force of friction.

130
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:08,106
So we would have a force of
friction acting upwards.

131
00:06:08,106 --> 00:06:08,690
Right?

132
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,140
Because the force of friction
always acts opposite to the

133
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,540
direction that the thing
would move otherwise.

134
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:20,190
So essentially, our force of
friction has to be greater

135
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,160
than, roughly, greater
than or equal to.

136
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,710
Because if it's greater than,
it's not like the pie is going

137
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,400
to move up.

138
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,410
Friction by itself will never
move something, it'll just

139
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,940
keep something from
being moved.

140
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,250
But let's just figure
out the minimum.

141
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,210
I won't do the whole
inequalities.

142
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,950
The force of friction has to
be equal similarly, to 9.8

143
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:42,390
times the mass of the pie.

144
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:46,680
So if the coefficient of
friction is 0.8, what is the

145
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,380
force that I have to apply?

146
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,830
Well, the force I have to apply
in this case is going to

147
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,970
be the normal force, right?

148
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:58,600
That's normal to the
bottom of the pie.

149
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,170
Right?

150
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,270
My hand is now like the
surface of the ramp.

151
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,830
So this is the normal force.

152
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,030
And we know that the force of
friction is equal to the

153
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,550
coefficient of friction times
the normal force.

154
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,960
I'm going to switch colors
because this is getting

155
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,300
monotonous.

156
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,120
And the force of friction,
we know has to be

157
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,030
9.8 times the mass.

158
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:23,010
So 9.8 meters per second
times the mass.

159
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,420
9.8m is the force of friction.

160
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,830
And that has to equal to
coefficient of friction times

161
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,865
the normal force.

162
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,310
And remember, the normal force
is essentially the force that

163
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,472
I'm pushing the pie with.

164
00:07:33,472 --> 00:07:38,270
And we know this is 0.8, so we
have 9.8 times the mass--

165
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:43,100
that's not meters, that's the
mass-- is equal to 0.8 times

166
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,720
the normal force.

167
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:51,960
So you have the normal force is
equal to 9.8 times the mass

168
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,500
divided by 0.8.

169
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,320
What's 9.8 divided by 0.8?

170
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:05,200
9.8 divided by 0.8 is
equal to 12.25.

171
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,580
So the normal force that
I have to apply is

172
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:12,890
12.25 times the mass.

173
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,860
So that's the force
I'm applying.

174
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,540
It's time the mass.

175
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,040
We don't know the
mass of the pie.

176
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,570
So how fast am I accelerating
the pie?

177
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:22,590
Well, force is equal to mass
times acceleration.

178
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:29,540
This is the force, 12.25m--
that's the force-- is equal to

179
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,170
the mass times the

180
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,720
acceleration of the pie, right?

181
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,799
And it's the same pie that we're
dealing with the whole

182
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,970
time, so it's still m.

183
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:39,049
And you can take out m from both
sides of the equation.

184
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:42,380
So the acceleration, the rate at
which I have to change the

185
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,450
velocity, or the acceleration
that I have to apply to the

186
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:53,860
pie is 12.25 meters per
second squared.

187
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:58,090
And so actually, I have to apply
more than 1g, right?

188
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:01,330
Because g is the force
of gravity.

189
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:05,430
And gravity accelerates
something at 9.8 seconds-- 9.8

190
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,750
meters per second squared.

191
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,870
So I have to do something at
12-- I have to push and

192
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:13,270
accelerate the pie at 12.25
meters per second squared.

193
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:16,720
So it's something a little over
1g in order for that pie

194
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,910
to not fall and in order for my
normal force to provide a

195
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,630
force of friction so that
the pie can reach

196
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,360
this bald man's face.

197
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,720
I will see you in
the next video.

198
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,000
