1
00:00:00,467 --> 00:00:07,600
We are asked to identify the percent amount and base in this problem.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,800
They ask us 150 is 25% of what number?

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:20,267
So another way to think about it is 25% times some number, so I will do 25% in yellow.

4
00:00:20,267 --> 00:00:35,400
And 25% times some number is equal to 150.

5
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:40,067
So the percent is pretty easy to spot. We have a 25% right over here.

6
00:00:40,067 --> 00:00:45,067
So, this is going to be the percent. That is the percent.

7
00:00:45,067 --> 00:00:50,400
And we are multiplying the percent times some base number. So this right over here is the base

8
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:56,933
and we have percent times the base is equal to some amount.

9
00:00:56,933 --> 00:01:05,800
And you can try to solve this in your head.

10
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:11,467
This is essentially saying 25% times some number is equal to 150.

11
00:01:11,467 --> 00:01:18,733
If it helps, we can rewrite this as 0.25 (which is the same thing as 25%)

12
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:26,667
0.25 times some number is equal to 150.

13
00:01:26,667 --> 00:01:31,667
And one interesting thing to think about is "should this number be larger or smaller than 150"?

14
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:35,200
Well, if we only take 25% of that number, if we only take 25/100 of that number

15
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:46,333
If we only take 1/4th of that number, because that's what 25% is, we get 150. So this number needs to be larger than 150.

16
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:49,667
If fact, it has to be larger than 150 by 4.

17
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:52,133
And to actually figure out what this number is

18
00:01:52,133 --> 00:01:57,067
we can actually multiply, since what is on the left hand side is equal to what is on the right

19
00:01:57,067 --> 00:02:00,800
hand side. If we want to solve this, we can multiply both sides by 4.

20
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,067
If we say, look, we have some value over here and we're going to multiply

21
00:02:05,067 --> 00:02:08,200
it by 4 in order for it to still be equal we would have to multiply 150

22
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,333
times 4.

23
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:15,667
4 times 0.25 (or 4 times 25% or times 1/4th), this is just going to be 1.

24
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:21,400
And we are going to get our number is equal to 150 times 4.

25
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,933
Or equal to 600.

26
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:27,800
And that makes sense. 25% of 600 is 150.

27
00:02:27,800 --> 99:59:59,999
1/4th of 600 is 150.
