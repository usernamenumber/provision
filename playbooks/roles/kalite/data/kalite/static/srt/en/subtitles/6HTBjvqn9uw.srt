1
00:00:05,067 --> 00:00:10,912
It's often the case that when you're travelling with a baby, it demands a lot of attention.

2
00:00:10,912 --> 00:00:17,576
And that's what's happening in this small painting by Degas called "At the Races in the Countryside."

3
00:00:17,576 --> 00:00:20,322
That infant is clearly the centre of this family's attention.

4
00:00:20,322 --> 00:00:22,587
And their dog's attention too!

5
00:00:22,587 --> 00:00:23,212
Yes, it's true.

6
00:00:23,212 --> 00:00:26,332
In fact, it only looks like the horses are perhaps not paying attention.

7
00:00:26,332 --> 00:00:28,680
So it's such an interesting composition.

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,031
It's Degas at his most playful.

9
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:37,316
We see a painting that seems as if it is uncomposed, as if it were almost a snapshot.

10
00:00:37,316 --> 00:00:39,561
And that's what Degas is so good at.

11
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:42,553
Making his paintings, which are so carefully composed,

12
00:00:42,553 --> 00:00:46,392
seem as though it would seem that he just happened to come upon.

13
00:00:46,392 --> 00:00:49,134
And I think we're used to this because of photography.

14
00:00:49,134 --> 00:00:52,704
But in the 19th century, this would've been pretty outrageous.

15
00:00:52,704 --> 00:00:54,706
I mean, look at the way he's cropped the wagon wheels.

16
00:00:54,706 --> 00:00:57,308
He's cropped the horses, they don't have the bottom of their legs.

17
00:00:57,308 --> 00:00:59,835
And then he gets even more playful.

18
00:00:59,835 --> 00:01:03,207
Not only is the family group pushed a little bit too far to the right,

19
00:01:03,207 --> 00:01:07,392
but then there's this very large spacial gap as we move into the middle ground,

20
00:01:07,392 --> 00:01:09,368
where the figures are really small.

21
00:01:09,368 --> 00:01:15,382
I'm particularly fond of the way that little horse seems to just be standing on the back of the carriage.

22
00:01:15,432 --> 00:01:21,809
Or there's another tiny figure that seems to be perched on the back of the brown horse in the foreground.

23
00:01:21,809 --> 00:01:25,894
This incongruity is what the Academy would, off course, have never allowed,

24
00:01:25,894 --> 00:01:29,071
but that Degas seems to really relish.

25
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:32,132
And in academic painting, we expect things to make sense.

26
00:01:32,132 --> 00:01:37,425
We expect all the forms to be included whole, within the frame of the painting,

27
00:01:37,425 --> 00:01:40,432
we expect to be able to read a recession into space,

28
00:01:40,432 --> 00:01:44,264
so that, for example, those figures that look so small would make sense

29
00:01:44,264 --> 00:01:48,271
and we would understand the distance between the foreground and the background.

30
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:54,714
But here Degas has painted a flat green expanse that we can't really read as depth.

31
00:01:54,714 --> 00:02:00,140
But off course, the most interesting part of this painting for me is contained within the carriage itself.

32
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,470
It's the family and their interaction.

33
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,472
It's really very sweet.

34
00:02:03,472 --> 00:02:07,563
There is all of that attention on the infant and whether it's going to eat,

35
00:02:07,563 --> 00:02:09,905
and whether it's going to stop being fussy.

36
00:02:09,905 --> 00:02:14,277
Historically, upper-class women often didn't nurse their own children.

37
00:02:14,277 --> 00:02:19,450
They would hire women who were known as wet nurses, who would nurse infants.

38
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,133
So a very intimate kind of nanny, you could say.

39
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:23,213
I think so.

40
00:02:23,213 --> 00:02:28,241
And actually, you can see her breast is exposed and all of the figures are looking down at the child,

41
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:31,606
so issues of class are very much built into this painting.

42
00:02:31,606 --> 00:02:35,627
An upper-class woman would certainly not reveal herself in this way.

43
00:02:35,627 --> 00:02:40,038
The wet nurse is, in a sense, an accoutrement of the life of the upper class,

44
00:02:40,038 --> 00:02:44,523
very much the way that little black boxer is as well, that little dog.

45
00:02:44,523 --> 00:02:49,304
The dog and the family that it belongs to appear very aristocratic to me.

46
00:02:49,304 --> 00:02:54,107
The dog apears like a very specific breed and is sitting kind of upright,

47
00:02:54,107 --> 00:03:00,181
and the man has a top hat on and is clearly very well dressed, his wife is very well dressed,

48
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:07,022
and that does contrast with the informality of the working-class wet nurse that we see.

49
00:03:07,022 --> 00:03:11,241
And off course we're in an environment which is about horse racing.

50
00:03:11,241 --> 00:03:15,366
This is at a time when horse racing was an extremely priviledged sport,

51
00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:19,341
so we are in this very genteel and very fashionable environment.

52
00:03:19,341 --> 00:03:22,499
Yet we have this moment of informality within that.

53
00:03:22,499 --> 00:03:28,350
We have a scene of modern upper-class leisure and this is a very typical Impressionist subject.

54
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,800
And it's an entirely new subject.

55
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,073
It is really the beginnings of what we consider modern art,

56
00:03:35,073 --> 00:03:42,502
a kind of embracing of the real urban world of Paris in the second half of the 19th century.
