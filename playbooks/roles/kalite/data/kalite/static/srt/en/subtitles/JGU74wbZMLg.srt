1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,340
   

2
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,360
If I were to walk up to you on
the street and say you, please

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,450
tell me what-- so I didn't want
to write that thick --please

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:11,710
tell me what sine
of pi over 4 is.

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,950
And, obviously, we're assuming
we're dealing in radians.

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,510
You either have that memorized
or you would draw the

7
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,920
unit circle right there.

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,360
That's not the best
looking unit circle,

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,080
but you get the idea.

10
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,960
You'd go to pi over 4
radians, which is the

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,760
same thing as 45 degrees.

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,840
You would draw that
unit radius out.

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,130
And the sine is defined
as a y-coordinate

14
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,250
on the unit circle.

15
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,910
So you would just want to
know this value right here.

16
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,210
And you would
immediately say OK.

17
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,630
This is a 45 degrees.

18
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,530
Let me draw the triangle
a little bit larger.

19
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,530
The triangle looks like this.

20
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,210
This is 45.

21
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,900
That's 45.

22
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,790
This is 90.

23
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,330
And you can solve a
45 45 90 triangle.

24
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,040
The hypotenuse is 1.

25
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,960
This is x.

26
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,640
This is x.

27
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,930
They're going to be
the same values.

28
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,920
This is an isosceles
triangle, right?

29
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,960
Their base angles are the same.

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,690
So you say, look. x squared
plus x squared is equal to 1

31
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,960
squared, which is just 1.

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,200
2x squared is equal to 1.

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,440
x squared is equal to 1/2.

34
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,840
x is equal to the square root
of 1/2, which is one over

35
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,780
the square root of 2.

36
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,960
I can put that in rational form
by multiplying that by the

37
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,330
square root of 2 over 2.

38
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,230
   

39
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:34,950
And I get x is equal to the
square root of 2 over 2.

40
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,770
So the height here is
square root of 2 over 2.

41
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,400
And if you wanted to know
this distance too, it would

42
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,710
also be the same thing.

43
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,090
But we just cared
about the height.

44
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,600
Because the sine value,
the sine of this, is just

45
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,920
this height right here.

46
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,180
The y-coordinate.

47
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,960
And we got that as the
square root of 2 over 2.

48
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,890
This is all review.

49
00:01:53,890 --> 00:02:00,210
We learned this in the
unit circle video.

50
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,290
But what if someone else--
Let's say on another day, I

51
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:08,850
come up to you and I say you,
please tell me what the

52
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:14,820
arcsine of the square
root of 2 over 2 is.

53
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,190
What is the arcsine?

54
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:16,970
And you're stumped.

55
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,180
You're like I know what the
sine of an angle is, but this

56
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:24,480
is some new trigonometric
function that Sal has devised.

57
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,770
And all you have to realize,
when they have this word arc in

58
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,455
front of it-- This is also
sometimes referred to

59
00:02:29,455 --> 00:02:30,810
as the inverse sine.

60
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,960
This could have just as easily
been written as: what is

61
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,420
the inverse sine of the
square root of 2 over 2?

62
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,900
All this is asking is what
angle would I have to take the

63
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:48,310
sine of in order to get the
value square root of 2 over 2.

64
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,000
This is also asking what angle
would I have to take the sine

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,610
of in order to get square
root of 2 over 2.

66
00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:00,220
I could rewrite either of
these statements as saying

67
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,260
square-- Let me do it.

68
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,890
I could rewrite either of these
statements as saying sine

69
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:11,200
of what is equal to the
square root of 2 over 2.

70
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,910
And this, I think, is a
much easier question

71
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,820
for you to answer.

72
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,400
Sine of what is square
root of 2 over 2?

73
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,950
Well I just figured out that
the sine of pi over 4 is

74
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,080
square root of 2 over 2.

75
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,560
So, in this case, I know that
the sine of pi over 4 is equal

76
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,630
to square root of 2 over 2.

77
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:35,760
So my question mark is
equal to pi over 4.

78
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:42,400
Or, I could have rewritten
this as, the arcsine-- sorry

79
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:51,940
--arcsine of the square root of
2 over 2 is equal to pi over 4.

80
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,120
Now you might say so, just as
review, I'm giving you a value

81
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,630
and I'm saying give me an angle
that gives me, when I take the

82
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,490
sine of that angle that
gives me that value.

83
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,030
But you're like hey Sal.

84
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,950
Look.

85
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,120
Let me go over here.

86
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,960
You're like, look
pi over 2 worked.

87
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,540
45 degrees worked.

88
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,560
But I could just keep adding
360 degrees or I could

89
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,130
keep just adding 2 pi.

90
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,330
And all of those would work
because those would all get

91
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,870
me to that same point of
the unit circle, right?

92
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,960
And you'd be correct.

93
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,350
And so all of those values, you
would think, would be valid

94
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,290
answers for this, right?

95
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,700
Because if you take the sine of
any of those angles-- You could

96
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,720
just keep adding 360 degrees.

97
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,740
If you take the sine of any
of them, you would get

98
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,540
square root of 2 over 2.

99
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,370
And that's a problem.

100
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,070
You can't have a function where
if I take the function-- I

101
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,340
can't have a function, f
of x, where it maps to

102
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,230
multiple values, right?

103
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:47,490
Where it maps to pi over 4, or
it maps to pi over 4 plus 2

104
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:52,280
pi or pi over 4 plus 4 pi.

105
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,320
So in order for this to be a
valid function-- In order for

106
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,450
the inverse sine function to
be valid, I have to

107
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,340
restrict its range.

108
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,660
And the way that-- We'll
just restrict its range to

109
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,710
the most natural place.

110
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,990
So let's restrict its range.

111
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,910
Actually, just as a
side note, what's its

112
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,120
domain restricted to?

113
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,160
So if I'm taking the
arcsine of something.

114
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,320
So if I'm taking the arcsine of
x, and I'm saying that that is

115
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,900
equal to theta, what's the
domain restricted to?

116
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,502
What are the valid values of x?

117
00:05:24,502 --> 00:05:27,310
x could be equal to what?

118
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,770
Well if I take the sine of
any angle, I can only get

119
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,840
values between 1 and
negative 1, right?

120
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,680
So x is going to be greater
than or equal to negative 1 and

121
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,310
then less than or equal to 1.

122
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,570
That's the domain.

123
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,930
Now, in order to make this
a valid function, I have

124
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,180
to restrict the range.

125
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,360
The possible values.

126
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,790
I have to restrict the range.

127
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,700
Now for arcsine, the convention
is to restrict it to the

128
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,630
first and fourth quadrants.

129
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:57,210
To restrict the possible angles
to this area right here

130
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,750
along the unit circle.

131
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:03,840
So theta is restricted to being
less than or equal to pi over

132
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:11,180
2 and then greater than or
equal to minus pi over 2.

133
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,150
So given that, we now
understand what arcsine is.

134
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,110
Let's do another problem.

135
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,280
Clear out some space here.

136
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,430
Let me do another arcsine.

137
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:30,450
So let's say I were to ask you
what the arcsine of minus the

138
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,390
square root of 3 over 2 is.

139
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:36,480
   

140
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,690
Now you might have
that memorized.

141
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,100
And say, I immediately know
that sine of x, or sine

142
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,420
of theta is square
root of 3 over 2.

143
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,220
And you'd be done.

144
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,730
But I don't have
that memorized.

145
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,990
So let me just draw
my unit circle.

146
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,480
And when I'm dealing with
arcsine, I just have to

147
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,550
draw the first and fourth
quadrants of my unit circle.

148
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,810
That's the y-axis.

149
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,890
That's my x-axis.

150
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,690
x and y.

151
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,300
And where am I?

152
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,360
If the sine of something is
minus square root of 3 over 2,

153
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,760
that means the y-coordinate on
the unit circle is minus

154
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,320
square root of 3 over 2.

155
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:15,020
So it means we're
right about there.

156
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,800
So this is minus the
square root of 3 over 2.

157
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,440
This is where we are.

158
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,160
Now what angle gives me that?

159
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,090
Let's think about
it a little bit.

160
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:31,600
My y-coordinate is minus
square root of 3 over 2.

161
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,460
This is the angle.

162
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,110
It's going to be a negative
angle because we're going

163
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,130
below the x-axis in the
clockwise direction.

164
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:44,240
And to figure out-- Let me just
draw a little triangle here.

165
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,520
Let me pick a better
color than that.

166
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,040
That's a triangle.

167
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,740
Let me do it in
this blue color.

168
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,680
So let me zoom up
that triangle.

169
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,230
Like that.

170
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,950
This is theta.

171
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,530
That's theta.

172
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,660
And what's this
length right here?

173
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,120
Well that's the same as
the y-height, I guess

174
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,890
we could call it.

175
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,020
Which is square
root of 3 over 2.

176
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,560
It's a minus because
we're going down.

177
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,850
But let's just figure
out this angle.

178
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,960
And we know it's a
negative angle.

179
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,540
So when you see a square root
of 3 over 2, hopefully you

180
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,870
recognize this is a
30 60 90 triangle.

181
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,980
The square root of 3 over 2.

182
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,950
This side is 1/2.

183
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,250
And then, of course,
this side is 1.

184
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,880
Because this is a unit circle.

185
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,630
So its radius is 1.

186
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,415
So in a 30 60 90 triangle, the
side opposite to the square

187
00:08:27,415 --> 00:08:30,500
root of 3 over 2 is 60 degrees.

188
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,610
This side over here
is 30 degrees.

189
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,140
So we know that our theta
is-- This is 60 degrees.

190
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,100
That's its magnitude.

191
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,325
But it's going downwards.

192
00:08:37,325 --> 00:08:39,970
So it's minus 60 degrees.

193
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:43,180
So theta is equal to
minus 60 degrees.

194
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,630
But if we're dealing
in radians, that's

195
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,210
not good enough.

196
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:52,350
So we can multiply that times
100-- sorry --pi radians

197
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,540
for every 180 degrees.

198
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,070
Degrees cancel out.

199
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,500
And we're left with
theta is equal to minus

200
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,090
pi over 3 radians.

201
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:10,630
And so we can say-- We can now
make the statements that the

202
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:16,780
arcsine of minus square root
of 3 over 2 is equal to

203
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,980
minus pi over 3 radians.

204
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,680
Or we could say the inverse
sign of minus square root

205
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:30,840
of 3 over 2 is equal to
minus pi over 3 radians.

206
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,290
And to confirm this, let's
just-- Let me get a

207
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,310
little calculator out.

208
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,200
I put this in radian
mode already.

209
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,370
You can just check that.

210
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,060
Per second mode.

211
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,040
I'm in radian mode.

212
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,490
So I know I'm going to get,
hopefully, the right answer.

213
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,840
And I want to figure
out the inverse sign.

214
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,610
So the inverse sine-- the
second and the sine button

215
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:59,790
--of the minus square
root of 3 over 2.

216
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:03,800
It equals minus 1.04.

217
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:11,040
So it's telling me that this is
equal to minus 1.04 radians.

218
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,970
So pi over 3 must
be equal to 1.04.

219
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:16,030
Let's see if I can
confirm that.

220
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:25,180
So if I were to write minus pi
divided by 3, what do I get?

221
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,670
I get the exact same value.

222
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,710
So my calculator gave me the
exact same value, but it might

223
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,240
have not been that helpful
because my calculator doesn't

224
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,520
tell me that this is
minus pi over 3.

225
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,073
