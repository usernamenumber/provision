1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,050
Jill looked at the following
sequence.

3
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:07,810
0, 3, 8, 15, 24, 35.

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,190
And it just keeps going, I
guess, with a dot, dot, dot.

5
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,410
She saw that the numbers
were each 1 less

6
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,110
than a square number.

7
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,820
0 is 1 less than 1, which
is a square number.

8
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,160
3 is 1 less than 4.

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,740
8 is 1 less than 9.

10
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,950
15 is 1 less than 16.

11
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,960
Yeah, they were all 1 less
than a square number.

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,030
And conjectured that the
nth number would be n

13
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,180
squared minus 1.

14
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,850
Now conjecture, that sounds
like a very fancy word.

15
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,600
When someone makes a conjecture,
they conjecture,

16
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,260
that just means that they're
making a statement that seems,

17
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,470
or they're making a proposition
that seems likely

18
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,130
to be true.

19
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,060
It seems like a very reasonable
thing to say.

20
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,550
But it's not definitely true.

21
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,250
So she conjectured that the
nth number would be n

22
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,300
squared minus 1.

23
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,010
The reason why this is a
conjecture as opposed to a

24
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,960
100% definitely true statement,
is we don't know

25
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,870
whether this pattern
continues.

26
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,980
She's just going off of the
pattern that she saw so far

27
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,100
and she just generalized it.

28
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,690
She just assumes that
it keeps on going.

29
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,099
But we don't know whether it
necessarily keeps going.

30
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,620
Maybe the next number, you would
expect it to be 48, but

31
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,690
maybe it's not 48.

32
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:11,880
Maybe it's something weird.

33
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,780
Maybe it's 2.

34
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,270
Maybe it's 500.

35
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,870
And so the conjecture wouldn't
hold up if you were to see

36
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,020
that, but based on the evidence
you see so far it

37
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,600
seems completely reasonable
that this

38
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,030
pattern would continue.

39
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,690
And so she conjectured that
the nth number would be n

40
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,230
squared minus 1.

41
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,510
Completely reasonable.

42
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,195
Now did Jill use inductive
reasoning?

43
00:01:31,195 --> 00:01:34,070
   

44
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,860
Yes, she used inductive
reasoning.

45
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,200
That's what inductive
reasoning is.

46
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,640
You see a pattern.

47
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:46,160
In this case, every term in this
sequence so far was-- if

48
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,990
it's the third term, it
was 3 squared minus 1.

49
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,810
The fourth term is 4
squared minus 1.

50
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,370
The fifth term is 5
squared minus 1.

51
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,980
So she saw the pattern and she
just generalized it to say,

52
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,730
well, I think or I've
conjectured that the nth

53
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,770
number will be n squared
minus 1.

54
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,160
That's what inductive reasoning
is all about.

55
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,160
You're not always going to be
100%, or you definitely won't

56
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,660
be 100% sure that you're right,
that the nth number

57
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,160
will be n squared minus 1.

58
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,200
But based on the pattern you've
seen so far, it's a

59
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,160
completely reasonable thing
to-- I guess you

60
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,410
could say-- to induce.

61
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,066
