1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,640
   

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's say I have a linear
transformation T that's a

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,490
mapping between Rn and Rm.

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,640
We know that we can represent
this linear transformation as

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,870
a matrix product.

6
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,920
So we can say that T of x, so
the transformation T-- let me

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,360
write it a little higher to save
space-- so we can write

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,500
that the transformation T
applied to some vector x is

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,440
equal to some matrix times x.

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,640
And this matrix, since it's a
mapping from Rn to Rm, this is

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,470
going to be a m by n matrix.

12
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,270
Because each of these entries
are going have n components,

13
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,790
they're going to be members of
Rn, so this guy has to have n

14
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,870
columns in order to be able
to have this matrix vector

15
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:52,910
product well defined.

16
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,260
So we can go back to what we've
been talking about now.

17
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,130
In the last couple of videos,
we've have been talking about

18
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,130
invertibility of functions,
and we can just as easily

19
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,850
apply it to this transformation,
because

20
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,190
transformations are
just functions.

21
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,060
We just use the word
transformations when we start

22
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:11,120
talking about maps between the
vector spaces or between sets

23
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,220
of vectors, but they are
essentially the same thing.

24
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,630
Everything we've done
the last two videos

25
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,530
have been very general.

26
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:19,660
I never told you what the set
of our domain and the set of

27
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,540
our co-domains were
made up of.

28
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,240
Now we're dealing with vectors,
so we can apply the

29
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,640
same ideas.

30
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:32,220
So T is a mapping right
here from Rn to Rm.

31
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,830
   

32
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:40,470
So if you take some vector here,
x, T will map it to some

33
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,870
other vector in Rm.

34
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,940
Call that Ax.

35
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,550
If we take this matrix vector
product right there and this

36
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,450
is the mapping T right there.

37
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,840
So let's ask the same questions
about T that we've

38
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,000
been asking in general
about functions.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,250
Is T invertible?

40
00:01:55,250 --> 00:02:03,830
   

41
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,390
And we learned in the last
video that there's two

42
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,320
conditions for invertibility.

43
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:16,430
T has to be onto, or the other
way, the other word was

44
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,680
surjective.

45
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,710
   

46
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,720
That's one condition
for invertibility.

47
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,950
And then T also has
to be 1 to 1.

48
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:31,340
   

49
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:38,390
And the fancy word for that was
injective, right there.

50
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,850
So in this video, I'm going to
just focus on this first one.

51
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,400
So I'm not going to prove to you
whether T is invertibile.

52
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,820
We will at least be able to try
to figure out whether T is

53
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,480
onto, or whether it's
surjective.

54
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,590
So just as a reminder, what does
onto or surjective mean?

55
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,840
It means that you take any
element in Rm, you take any

56
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,420
element in your co-domain, so
you give me any element in

57
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,870
your co-domain-- let's call that
element b; it's going to

58
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:10,930
be a vector-- the fact, if T is
surjective or if T is onto,

59
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,710
that means that any b that you
pick in our co-domain, there's

60
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:18,510
always going to be some vector,
at least one vector,

61
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,570
in our domain.

62
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,410
That if you apply the
transformation to it you're

63
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,700
going to get b.

64
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:27,070
Or another way to think about
it is the image of our

65
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,610
transformation is all of Rm.

66
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,040
All of these guys
can be reached.

67
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,230
So let's think about
what that means.

68
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,820
So we know that the
transformation is Ax.

69
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,820
It's some matrix A.

70
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,410
So the transformation of x--
I'll just rewrite it-- is

71
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,970
equal to some matrix A-- that's
an m by n matrix--

72
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,660
times the vector x.

73
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:59,530
Now, if T has to be onto, that
means that Ax, this matrix

74
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:06,680
vector product, has to be equal
to any member of our

75
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,140
co-domain can be reached by
multiplying our matrix A by

76
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,270
some member of our domain.

77
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,760
So what's another way of
thinking about it?

78
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,920
Another way of thinking about
it is for any b, so onto,

79
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:27,930
implies that for any vector b
that is a member of Rm-- so

80
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:40,372
any b here-- there exists at
least one solution to a times

81
00:04:40,372 --> 00:04:43,490
x is equal to b.

82
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:52,600
Where, of course, x is, the
vector x is, a member of Rn.

83
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,820
It's just another way of saying
exactly what I've been

84
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,540
saying in the first part
of this video.

85
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:01,160
You give me any b in this set,
and then there has to be, if

86
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,130
we assume that T is onto, or for
T to be onto, there has to

87
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:09,570
be at least one solution
to Ax is equal to b.

88
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,430
There has to be at least one x
out here, that if I multiply

89
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,720
it by A, I get to my b.

90
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,290
And this has to be true for
every, maybe I should write,

91
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,300
for every instead of any.

92
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,170
But they are the same idea.

93
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:23,290
But, for every b in Rm, we have
to be able to find at

94
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,900
least one x that makes
this true.

95
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,890
So what does that mean?

96
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:37,680
That means that A times x has
to be equal to-- you can

97
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:45,670
construct any member of Rm by
taking a product of A and x,

98
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:49,640
where x is a member of Rn,
where x is a member here.

99
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,520
Now what is this?

100
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,310
If x is an arbitrary member of
Rn, Let me write like this.

101
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,190
We know that matrix A would
look like this.

102
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,970
It'll be a bunch of
column vectors.

103
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:03,300
a1, a2 and it has n columns,
so it looks like that.

104
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,950
That's what our matrix
A looks like.

105
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,000
So we're saying if you take this
product, you have to be

106
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,360
able to reach any guy,
any member of Rm.

107
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,710
Well, what does this product
look like if where taking this

108
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,280
product instead of writing
an x there, I could

109
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,070
write x like this.

110
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:23,480
x1, x2, all the way to xn.

111
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,770
So this product is going to be
x1 times the first column

112
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:38,710
vector of A, plus x2 times the
second column vector of A, all

113
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:44,340
the way to plus xn times the
nth column vector of A.

114
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,900
That's what this product is.

115
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,320
And in order for T to be onto,
this combination has to be

116
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,040
equal to any vector in Rm.

117
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,130
Well, what does this mean?

118
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,430
These are just linear
combinations of the column

119
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,680
vectors of A.

120
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,200
   

121
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:08,730
So another way to say that is
for T to be onto, So for T to

122
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:16,410
be surjective or onto, the
column vectors of A have to

123
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:22,120
span Rm, have to span
our co-domain.

124
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,940
They have to span
this right here.

125
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,550
You have to be able to get any
vector here with a linear

126
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,800
combination of these guys.

127
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,420
Right?

128
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,780
And the linear combination is
set up because the weights are

129
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:35,230
just arbitrary members
of the real numbers.

130
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,070
This vector is just a bunch
of arbitrary real numbers.

131
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:53,390
So for T to be onto, the span of
a1, a2, all the way to an,

132
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:59,270
has to be equal to Rm, has to
be equal to your co-domain.

133
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,100
That just means that you can
achieve any vector in your

134
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,190
co-domain with the linear
combinations of the column

135
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,270
vectors of this.

136
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,590
What's the span of a matrices'
column vectors?

137
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:12,450
By definition that is the
matrices' column space.

138
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,910
So we could say, that means that
the span of these guys

139
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,725
have to be Rn, or another way
is that the column space of

140
00:08:18,725 --> 00:08:24,950
A-- let me switch colors-- the
column space of A has to be

141
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:30,330
equal to Rm.

142
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,220
So how do we know if
a vector's column

143
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:37,059
space is equal to Rm?

144
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:42,340
So here, maybe it might be
instructive to think about,

145
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:46,090
when can we not find solutions
to the equation

146
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:49,960
Ax is equal to b?

147
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,710
So whenever you're faced
with this type of an

148
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,270
equation, what do we do?

149
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:57,680
We can set up an augmented
matrix that looks like this,

150
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,340
where you put A on this side,
and then you put the vector b

151
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,770
on the right-hand side.

152
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:05,340
And then you, essentially,
perform a bunch of row

153
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:05,870
operations.

154
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:09,780
You have to perform the entire
rows in both cases, on both

155
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,800
sides, and we've done
this multiple times.

156
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,610
Your goal is to get the
left-hand side into reduced

157
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,850
row echelon form.

158
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:20,330
So what you want to do is,
eventually, get your augmented

159
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,240
matrix to look like this.

160
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,190
Where the left-handed side is--
let me define R, capital

161
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,460
R, to be the reduced row
echelon form of A.

162
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,820
And we've done many
videos on that.

163
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:36,160
That's just, you have a matrix
where you have your pivots and

164
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,680
the pivot will be the only
non-zero entry in its column.

165
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,310
But not every column has
to have a pivot in it.

166
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:48,140
Maybe, you have a free column
or non-pivot column and then

167
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,570
they could have a
bunch of 0's.

168
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:50,650
And maybe this has a pivot.

169
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:53,000
This would have to be 0 if
there is a pivot there.

170
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
These would have to be 0,
and so on and so forth.

171
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,910
And maybe the next pivot
is right there.

172
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,440
These would have to be 0,
and you get the idea.

173
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,230
You could have some columns
the don't have pivots, but

174
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,880
whenever you do have a pivot,
they have to be the only

175
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,600
non-zero entry in
their column.

176
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,776
This is reduced row
echelon form.

177
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,630
   

178
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,900
So, what we do with any matrix
is we keep performing those

179
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,100
row operations so that we
eventually get it into a

180
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,160
reduced row echelon form.

181
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,090
And as we do that we are
performing those same

182
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,680
operations on the
right-hand side.

183
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,415
We're performing on
the entire row of

184
00:10:26,415 --> 00:10:28,340
these augmented matrices.

185
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,020
So this vector b right here, I
guess I could write it as a

186
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,910
vector, it's eventually going
to be some other vector c

187
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,680
right here.

188
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,030
You know, if this is 1, 2, 3,
maybe I will perform a bunch

189
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,260
of operations and this
will be 3, 2, 1, or

190
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,630
something of that nature.

191
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:52,316
Now, when does this not
have a solution?

192
00:10:52,316 --> 00:10:55,840
   

193
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,290
We reviewed this early on.

194
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:00,070
The only time where you don't
have a solution, remember,

195
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:05,950
there are three cases, where
you have many solutions.

196
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:09,040
   

197
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,160
and that's the situation where
you have three variables.

198
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,990
We've talked about
that before.

199
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:20,030
You have the case where you have
only one unique solution,

200
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:20,770
that's the other case.

201
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,000
And then you have
the final case

202
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,250
where you have no solutions.

203
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,660
   

204
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,680
And when do you have
no solutions?

205
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,360
What has to happen to
have no solution?

206
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,010
To have no solutions, when you
perform these row operations,

207
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,220
you have to eventually get to
a point where your matrix

208
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,680
looks something like this.

209
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,360
I don't know what all this stuff
looks like maybe there's

210
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,670
a 1 here, a bunch of stuff.

211
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,390
There is a 1 here and a 0.

212
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,610
But if you have a whole row, at
least one whole row of 0's,

213
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:51,130
you just have a bunch
of 0's like that.

214
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,080
And over here you have something
that is non-zero.

215
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:58,590
   

216
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:03,860
This is the only time that
you have no solution.

217
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,810
So let's remember what
we're even talking

218
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,700
about this stuff for.

219
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:12,880
We are saying that our
transformation is onto, if its

220
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,750
column vectors or if its column
space is Rm, if its

221
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,160
column vectors span Rm.

222
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,110
And what I'm trying to figure
out is how do I know

223
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,080
that it spans Rm?

224
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,270
So, essentially, for it to span
Rm, you can give me any b

225
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:30,850
here, any b that's a member of
Rm, and I should be able to

226
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,970
get a solution.

227
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,820
So we asked ourselves the
question, when do

228
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,070
we not get a solution?

229
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,070
   

230
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,690
Well, we definitely don't get a
solution if we have a bunch

231
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:41,980
of 0's in a row.

232
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,560
And then we have something
non-zero here.

233
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,300
That's definitely not going
to be a solution.

234
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:51,300
Now there's the other case where
we have a bunch of 0's.

235
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,200
So there's the other case
where we do have some

236
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,920
solutions, where it's only
valid for certain b's.

237
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,140
So that's the case-- let
me draw it like this.

238
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,250
Let me start it like this.

239
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:10,010
So let's say I have my matrix
A, and I have my b1, b2, let

240
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,620
me write it all the way,
and then you have bm.

241
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,960
Remember, this is
a member of Rm.

242
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,050
And we do our reduced row
echelon form with this

243
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,460
augmented matrix, and
A goes to its

244
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,850
reduced row echelon form.

245
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,950
Let's say it's reduced row
echelon form has a row of 0's

246
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,600
at the end of it.

247
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,530
So it just has a row
of 0's right there.

248
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,420
Everything else looks
like your standard

249
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,050
stuff, 1's and 0's.

250
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,885
But the last row, let's say
it's a bunch of 0's.

251
00:13:36,885 --> 00:13:40,000
And when we perform the row
operations here on this

252
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,600
generalized member of Rm, this
last row has some function.

253
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:53,010
Maybe it just looks like 2b1
plus 3b2-- I'm just writing a

254
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:56,770
particular case, it won't always
be this-- minus b3.

255
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,090
And it will essentially
be some function

256
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,660
of all of the b's.

257
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,180
So let me write it this way.

258
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,150
I'm writing a particular case
in here, maybe I shouldn't

259
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,050
have written a particular
case.

260
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:14,500
This will be some function of
b1, b2, all the way to bm.

261
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,090
Now, clearly if this
is non-zero, we

262
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,630
don't have a solution.

263
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:23,170
And so if we don't have a
solution for some cases of b,

264
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:26,410
then we are definitely
not spanning Rm.

265
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,810
So, let me write that down.

266
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:45,110
If we don't have a solution for
some cases of b, then we

267
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:52,180
don't span Rm.

268
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,840
I don't know if I'm overstating
something that is

269
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,600
maybe obvious to you, but I
really want to make sure you

270
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,950
understand this.

271
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:01,680
Anytime you just want to solve
the equation Ax is equal to

272
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,350
b-- and remember, we want to
make sure that this can be

273
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,440
true for any b we chose-- what
we could do is we just set up

274
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,510
this augmented matrix like this,
and we perform a bunch

275
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:13,120
of row operations until we get
A, we get this matrix A to

276
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,770
reduced row echelon form.

277
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,460
As we do this, the right-hand
side is going to be a bunch of

278
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,380
functions of b.

279
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,310
So maybe the first
row is b1 minus

280
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,600
b2, plus b4, or something.

281
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,850
And then the next row will
be something like that.

282
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:29,770
We've seen examples of this in
the past. And if you end up by

283
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:33,670
doing the reduced row echelon
form with a row of 0's here,

284
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,640
the only way that you're going
to have a solution is if your

285
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:41,080
vector b, if its entries satisfy
this function here on

286
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,800
the right, so that this
thing equals 0.

287
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,160
So it's only going to be
true for certain b's.

288
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,680
And if this only has a solution
for the certain b's

289
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,280
that make this equal to 0, then
we definitely are not

290
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,010
spanning all of Rm.

291
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,660
Let me do it visually.

292
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:06,030
So if that is Rm, and if we
put-- if this is only 0 for a

293
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:10,870
couple of b's, for, let's say
for some handful of b's, then

294
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:14,250
these are the only guys that we
can reach by multiplying A

295
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,030
times some vector in Rm.

296
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,840
And we definitely won't
be spanning all of Rm.

297
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,650
In order to span all of Rm, when
we put this in a reduced

298
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:25,550
row echelon form, we have to
always find a solution.

299
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:28,180
And the only way we are always
going be finding a solution is

300
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,430
if we don't run into this
condition where we

301
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:31,780
have a row of 0's.

302
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,460
Because when you have a row 0's,
then you have to put the

303
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,190
constraint that this right-hand
side has to be 0.

304
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:39,070
So what's the only reduced row
echelon form where you don't

305
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,020
have a row of 0's at the end?

306
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,560
Well, any row in reduced row
echelon form either has to

307
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,590
have all 0's or it has to have
a pivot entry in every row.

308
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:58,450
So the only way that you span--
so T is onto, if and

309
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:06,170
only if, it's the column space
of its transformation vector

310
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,800
is equal to Rm.

311
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,859
Its column vectors
span all of Rm.

312
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:13,930
And the only way that that's
happening is if the reduced

313
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:33,970
row echelon form of A has a
pivot entry in every row.

314
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,330
And how many rows
does it have?

315
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,830
This is an m by n matrix.

316
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:40,730
It has m rows and n columns.

317
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,710
So it has a pivot entry
in every row.

318
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:52,500
That means that it has to have
m pivot entries, right there.

319
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,640
Now, what's another way of
thinking about that?

320
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,240
Remember, earlier on, several
videos ago, we thought about

321
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,270
how do you figure out-- and this
might confuse things a

322
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:07,020
little bit-- how do you
figure out the basis

323
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,480
for your column space?

324
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:18,550
So the basis for the column
space of a matrix, and this is

325
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,330
a bit of review.

326
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:23,450
What we did is we say, look, you
take your matrix, and you

327
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:30,980
put it in reduced row echelon
form of your matrix, and then,

328
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,390
essentially-- let me draw it a
little bit different heree--

329
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,160
well, you put it in reduced
row echelon form.

330
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,360
So let's say that's just reduced
row echelon form.

331
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:43,100
And you look at which columns
have pivot entries.

332
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,360
And the corresponding columns in
your original matrices, in

333
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,620
your original matrix,
forms the basis

334
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,560
for your column space.

335
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,640
So let me draw that out.

336
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,400
So, I'll do a particular
instance.

337
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,240
So, let's say that it has its
column vectors a1, a2,

338
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,020
all the way to an.

339
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,480
That's what A looks like.

340
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,510
And when you put it in reduced
row echelon form, let's say

341
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:09,370
that this column right here
has a pivot entry.

342
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,370
That column has a pivot entry.

343
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:11,420
Let's say that this
one doesn't.

344
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,110
Let's say this is a 2 there.

345
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,030
I'm just picking particular
numbers.

346
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:19,880
   

347
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,300
Let's say there's a 3.

348
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,990
Let's say all of these are
non-pivot entries, and then

349
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,800
our last entry n is
a pivot entry.

350
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,180
So it just has a bunch of 0's,
and then a 1 like that.

351
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,590
How do you determine what are
the basis vectors for the

352
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,800
column space?

353
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,000
Well, obviously, the column
space is everything that's

354
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,290
spanned by all these guys.

355
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,840
But, what's the minimum
set you need to

356
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,280
have that same span?

357
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,610
Well, you look at which one
has a corresponding pivot

358
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,230
entries or pivot columns.

359
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:47,430
And you say, I have a pivot
column here, and I have a

360
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,890
pivot column there.

361
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,700
So the basis for my column space
must be this column in

362
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,240
my original matrix, and that
column in my original matrix.

363
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:01,380
And then we said, well, how do
you define the dimension of

364
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,220
it's column space?

365
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,510
And you just essentially count
the number of vectors you need

366
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:10,340
for your basis, and we call
that the rank of A.

367
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,180
This is all review.

368
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:17,510
The rank of A was equal to the
dimension of the column space

369
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:27,400
of A, which is equal to number
of basis vectors for the

370
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,140
column space.

371
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,330
And this is how you
determine it.

372
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,340
You essentially figure out how
many pivot columns you have,

373
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,290
the number of pivot columns
you have is the number of

374
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,510
basis vectors you have,
and so that's going to

375
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,840
be the rank of A.

376
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,870
Now, the whole reason why I
talked about this is we just

377
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:49,070
said that our transformation T
is onto, if and only if, its

378
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:52,850
column space is Rm, which is
the case if it has a pivot

379
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:55,690
entry in every row in its
reduced row echelon form.

380
00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:01,490
Or, since it has m rows, it has
to have m pivot entries.

381
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:05,100
So for every row, you have a
pivot entry, but every pivot

382
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,050
entry corresponds to
a pivot column.

383
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:11,030
   

384
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:15,360
So if you have m pivot entries,
you also have m pivot

385
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,960
columns, which means that if you
were to do this exercise

386
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,240
right here, you would have m
basis vectors for your column

387
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,540
space, or that you would
have a rank of m.

388
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,820
   

389
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,780
So this whole video was
just a big long way of

390
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,150
saying that T is onto.

391
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:39,976
   

392
00:21:39,976 --> 00:21:45,940
And another way of saying that
is that if you have your

393
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:50,030
domain here, which was Rm, and
you have your co-domain here,

394
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:56,930
that is Rm, that every member
of Rm can be reached by T by

395
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:59,720
some member of Rn.

396
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,650
Any guy here, there's always at
least one guy here, that if

397
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,400
you apply T to it, you
get right there.

398
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,800
There might be more than one.

399
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,560
We're not even talking
about 1 to 1 yet.

400
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:20,840
So we say that T is onto, if and
only if, the rank of its

401
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:26,620
transformation matrix,
A, is equal to m.

402
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:31,140
So that was the big takeaway
of this video.

403
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,080
Let's just actually do an
example, because sometimes

404
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,070
when you do things really
abstract it seems a little bit

405
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:39,180
confusing, when you see
something particular.

406
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:42,960
Let me define some
transformation S.

407
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,870
Let's say the transformation S
is a mapping from R2 to R3.

408
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:52,620
And let's say that S applied to
some vector x is equal to

409
00:22:52,620 --> 00:23:00,020
the matrix 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, times the vector x.

410
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,100
So this is clearly
a 3 by 2 matrix.

411
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:10,290
Let's see if S is onto.

412
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:12,970
Well, based on what we just did,
we just have to go and

413
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,870
put this guy in reduced
row echelon form.

414
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,660
So let's do that.

415
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,150
So if you put this guy into
reduced row echelon form, so

416
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:25,760
let's keep 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

417
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,640
Now, let's keep the first row
the same, that's 1, 2.

418
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,470
Let's replace the second row
with the second row minus 3

419
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,540
times the first row.

420
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,400
Actually, let's replace it with
3 times the first row

421
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,350
minus the second row.

422
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,800
So, 3 times 1 minus 3 is 0.

423
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:44,900
3 times 2 minus 4, that's
6 minus 4, is 2.

424
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,780
Now let's replace the third
row with 5 times the first

425
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,780
row, minus the third row.

426
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:52,610
So 5 times 1 minus 5 is 0.

427
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:56,850
5 times 2 is 10, minus 6 is 4.

428
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:02,080
Now, let's see if we can
get a 1 right here.

429
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,650
So I'm going to keep my
middle row the same.

430
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:09,730
Or, actually, let's just divide
the middle row by 2, or

431
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,923
multiply it by 1/2 So, you
get 0, 1 and then you

432
00:24:11,923 --> 00:24:14,910
have a 0, 4, 1, 2.

433
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:18,170
And now let's try to make these
0, get it into reduced

434
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,020
row echelon form.

435
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,660
So I'm going to keep my middle
row the same, 0, 1.

436
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,460
And let's replace the top row
with the top row minus 2 times

437
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,250
the second row.

438
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,490
So 1 minus 2 times 0 is 1.

439
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:30,170
2 minus 2, times 1 is 0.

440
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:33,470
Now, let's replace this last row
with the last row minus 4

441
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,500
times this row.

442
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,080
So we get 0 minus 4,
times that, is 0.

443
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:44,560
4 minus 4, times 1, is 0.

444
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:49,840
So notice, we have a
row with 0's here.

445
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:58,940
We have two pivot entries or two
rows with pivot entries,

446
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:04,460
and we also have two pivot
columns right there.

447
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:14,390
So the rank of this guy right
here, of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

448
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:18,290
The rank of that is equal
to 2, which is not

449
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,090
equal to our co-domain.

450
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,875
It is not equal to R3.

451
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:33,180
It's not equal to R3, so S is
not onto, or not surjective.

452
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,250
It's one of the two conditions
for invertibility.

453
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:43,400
So, we definitely know that
S is not invertible.

454
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,400
Hopefully that's helpful.

455
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,420
Now, in the next video we're
going to focus on the second

456
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:50,830
condition for invertibility,
and that's being 1 to 1.
