1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,750
What I want to do in this video is make sure that

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:04,490
we are good at picking out what

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,620
the normal vector to a plane is

4
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,280
if we are given the equation for a plane.

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,020
So, to understand, let's start off with some plane here.

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,830
Let's start off！！

7
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,660
So, this is a plane and I have write part of it,

8
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,230
obviously it keeps going in every direction.

9
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,500
So let's say that that is our plane.

10
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,290
And let's say this is a normal vector to the plane.

11
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,840
So, that is our normal vector to the plane.

12
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:32,270
It's given by ai plus bj plus ck.

13
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,210
So, that is our normal vector to the plane.

14
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,920
And let's say that we have！！ So it's perpendicular

15
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,020
to every other vector that's on the plane.

16
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,870
Let's say we have some point on the plane.

17
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,470
We have some point.

18
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,250
It's the ponit x sub p.

19
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,980
And I will say p for plane.

20
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:54,310
So it's the point on the plane, xp, yp, zp.

21
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,870
If we pick the origin,

22
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,670
So let's say that our axes are here.

23
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,790
So let me draw, let me draw a cord in axis.

24
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,350
So let's say that our cord in axes look like that.

25
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,320
This is our z-axis. That is y-axis.

26
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,710
And let's say this is our x-axis.

27
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,730
Let's say this is our x-axis coming out like this.

28
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,040
This is our x-axis.

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,190
You can specify this as a position vector.

30
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,290
There is a position vector. Let me draw it like this.

31
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,770
Let me draw it like this.

32
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,400
And then it would be behind the plane right over there.

33
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,330
You have a position vector.

34
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:36,690
That vector would be xpi plus ypj plus zpk.

35
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,480
It specifies this coordinate right here

36
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,480
that sits on the plane.

37
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,680
Let me call that something.

38
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,950
Let me call that position vector. I don't know.

39
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:49,630
Let me call that,P, let me call that, p1.

40
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,950
This is a point on the plane.

41
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,920
So it is p1.

42
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,630
It is equal to this.

43
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,570
Now, we could take another point on the plane.

44
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,910
This is a particular for.

45
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,010
We just say any other point on the plane x, y, z.

46
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,820
But we say that x, y, z sits on the plane.

47
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:11,760
So let's say we take this point right over here, x, y, z.

48
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,410
That clearly saying logic can be specified

49
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,730
by another position vector.

50
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,690
We could have a position vector that looks like this,

51
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,250
In dotted line,

52
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,720
It's going under the plane right over here.

53
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,310
And this position vector.

54
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,560
I don't know. Let me just call it.

55
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,020
Let me just call it p, instead of that particular p1.

56
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,850
This would just be xi plus yj plus zk.

57
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,100
That the whole reason why I did this setup is

58
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,910
because I want to find, given some particular point

59
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,300
that I know on the plane and any other xyz

60
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,670
that is on the plane,

61
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,690
I can find, I can construct a vector

62
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,230
that is definitely on the plane.

63
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,790
And we have learned this before.

64
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,080
We try to figure out what the equations for a plane are.

65
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,570
That the vector that is definitely on the plane

66
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,310
is going to be the difference of this two vectors.

67
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,700
So, I will do that in blue.

68
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,970
So if you take the yellow vector, minus the green vector.

69
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,280
We will take this position.

70
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,270
You will get the vector.

71
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,000
If you view it that way,

72
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,100
that connects this point to that point.

73
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,670
Although you can shift the vector.

74
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,740
But you will get a vector

75
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,380
that definitely lies along the plane.

76
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,610
Even if you！！

77
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,800
If you start with one of these points.

78
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,340
It will definitely lie along the plane.

79
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,310
So, the vector will look like this.

80
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,900
And it would be lying along our plane.

81
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,310
So this vector lies along our plane.

82
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,680
That vector is p minus p1.

83
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,950
This is the vector p minus p1.

84
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,040
It is this position vector minus

85
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,390
that position vector gives you this one.

86
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,870
Another way to view this is this green position vector

87
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,100
plus that blue position vector

88
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,110
that sits on the plane

89
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,690
will clearly equal this yellow vector.

90
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,530
Right! Heads to tails, clearly equals it.

91
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,250
And the whole reason why that I did that is

92
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,430
now we can take the dot product

93
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,280
between this blue thing and this magenta thing.

94
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,360
And we have done this before.

95
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,080
And they have to be equal to zero,

96
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,400
because this lies on the plane.

97
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,850
This is perpendicular to everything that sits the plane.

98
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,230
And it equals to zero,

99
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,660
and we will get the equation for the plane.

100
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,100
But before I do that,

101
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,300
let me make sure that we know

102
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,330
what the components of the blue vector are.

103
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,020
So p minus p1, that's the blue vector.

104
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,260
You are just going to subtract each of the components.

105
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,350
So it's going to be

106
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:29,760
x minus xpi, plus y, minus ypj, plus z, minus zpk.

107
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,020
And we just said, this is in the plane.

108
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,770
And this right, the normal vector,

109
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,730
is normal to the plane.

110
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,690
You take their dot product.

111
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,460
is going to be equal to zero.

112
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:44,820
So n dot, this vector,

113
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,050
is going to be equal to zero.

114
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,960
But it is also equal to this a times this expression.

115
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,680
I will do it right over here.

116
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,400
So this. I will find some good colors.

117
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,170
So, a times that.

118
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:06,070
Which is ax minus axp, plus b times that.

119
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:11,030
So, that is plus by, minus byp.

120
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,920
And then, I have to make sure that I have enough colors.

121
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,060
And then it's going to be plus that times that.

122
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:23,730
So that's plus cz minus czp.

123
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,340
And all of these is equal to zero.

124
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:31,120
Now, what I am going to is: I am going to rewrite this,

125
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,940
so we have all of these terms

126
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,110
that I am looking for right color.

127
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,060
We have all the x terms ax.

128
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,650
Remember, this is any x that sits on the plane

129
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:40,830
that will satisfy this.

130
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,210
So ax, by, and cz.

131
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,970
Let me leave that one the right hand side.

132
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,860
So we have ax plus by plus cz is equal to！！

133
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,080
And what I want to do is:

134
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,280
I am going to subtract each of these from both sides.

135
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,150
Another way is:

136
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,900
I am going to move them all over to the, let me do it.

137
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,050
Not doing too many things.

138
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,320
I'm going to move them over

139
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,350
to the left hand side. .

140
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:06,030
So I'm going to add positive axp to both sides

141
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,440
as equivalent to subtracting negative axp.

142
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,700
So, this is going to be positive axp, and then,

143
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,590
we are going to have positive byp, plus,

144
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,720
we are going to do that in the same green.

145
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,030
Plus byp and then finally plus czp,

146
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:27,680
plus czp is going to be equal to that.

147
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,040
Now, the whole reason that why I do this！！

148
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,280
I have done this in previous video

149
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,590
where we were trying to find the formula

150
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,310
or we were trying to find the equations of the plane.

151
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,070
And now you said that hey!

152
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,140
If you have a normal vector,

153
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,710
and you are given a point on the plane.

154
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,740
We say xp yp zp.

155
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,930
We now have a very quick way to figure out the equation.

156
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,900
But I want to go the other way.

157
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,520
I want you to be able to！！

158
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,650
If I were to give you.

159
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,590
If I were to give you.

160
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:55,260
If I were to give you an equation for a plane.

161
00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:02,660
Where I would to say ax plus by plus cz, is equal to D

162
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,810
So, this is a general equation for the plane.

163
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,230
If I want to give you this.

164
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,520
I want you to be able to figure out

165
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,810
the normal vector very quickly.

166
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,800
So, how could you do that?

167
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,580
Well, this ax plus by plus cz is completely

168
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,780
analogous to this part right up over here.

169
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,690
Let me rewrite this over here.

170
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,510
so that this part becomes clear.

171
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:23,820
This part is ax plus by plus cz is equal

172
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,630
to all of these stuff on the right hand side.

173
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,340
Sorry, on the left hand side.

174
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,700
So, let me copy and paste it.

175
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,150
Copy and paste it.

176
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,920
So I just essentially flip this expression.

177
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,970
But now you see, this all of this.

178
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,460
This a has to be this A, this b has to be this B

179
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,030
and this c has to be this thing.

180
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,490
And D is going to be all this.

181
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,810
And this is just going to be a number.

182
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,620
This is just going to be a number.

183
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,530
assuming you mean that you knew

184
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,620
what the normal vector is.

185
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,600
What you a,b,and cs are.

186
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,890
You know the particular values.

187
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,640
So, this is what, this is what D is.

188
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,880
So, this is how you can get the equation for a plane.

189
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,260
Now, what if I were to give you the equation for a plane.

190
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,510
What is a normal vector?

191
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,700
Well. We just saw.

192
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,560
The normal vector, this a corresponds that A.

193
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,930
This b corresponds to that B.

194
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,190
That c corresponds to that C.

195
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,250
The normal vector to this plane we started off with is,

196
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,390
and has the components of a, b, and c.

197
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,650
So, if you are given an equation for a plane here.

198
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,390
The normal vector.

199
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,890
The normal vector to this plane right over here,

200
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:28,150
is going to be Ai plus Bj plus Ck.

201
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,110
So it's very easy thing to do

202
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,840
if I were to give you an equation of a plane.

203
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,860
Let me give you a particular example.

204
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,110
If I were to tell you

205
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,140
that I have some plane, in three dimensions.

206
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:41,070
Let's say it's negative 3.

207
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,440
although we could work for more dimensions.

208
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,430
Let's say I have negative 3x,

209
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:51,440
plus the square root of 2, y, minus,

210
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,280
So it's crazy, I mean it's not crazy.

211
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,750
It should be the plane in three dimensions.

212
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,870
And what's the normal vector to this plane?

213
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,080
You literally,

214
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,120
literally can just pick out these coefficients.

215
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,490
You say a normal vector to this plane

216
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:18,020
is negative 3i plus square root of 2 j plus 7 k,

217
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,820
and you can ignore the D part there.

218
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,530
And the reason why you can just ignore that

219
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,150
is that can just shift the plane.

220
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,370
but won't fundamentally change how the plane is tilted.

221
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:29,900
So, this normal vector will also normal

222
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,780
if this was e, if this was a hundred.

223
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,450
It will be normal to all of those planes

224
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,880
because all of those planes are shifted

225
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,910
but they all have the same inclinations.

226
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,720
So it would all come to point at the same directions.

227
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,730
So, it would have normal vectors would point

228
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,030
in the same direction.

229
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,720
So, hopefully you found that vaguely useful.

230
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,880
So now build on this,

231
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,670
define the distance between any point

232
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,580
in three dimensions and some plane,

233
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,460
the shortest distance we can get to that plane.
