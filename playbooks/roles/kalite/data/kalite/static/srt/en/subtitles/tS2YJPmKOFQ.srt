1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,087
Sal: We know that if we leave
water to its own devices-- so

3
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:08,000
you have some H2O-- that it's
an equilibrium with the

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,024
autoionized version of itself.

5
00:00:10,024 --> 00:00:13,084
So a little bit of it will turn
into some hydrogen ions,

6
00:00:13,084 --> 00:00:16,000
and we know that this really
takes the form hydronium.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,039
That these attach themselves
to other water molecules.

8
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:21,057
And it could be H3O, but
we'll just write it

9
00:00:21,057 --> 00:00:23,064
as a hydrogen ion.

10
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:26,023
Which is really just a
free-floating proton.

11
00:00:26,023 --> 00:00:29,087
Plus hydroxide ion.

12
00:00:29,087 --> 00:00:34,047
And we also know that in kind of
an equilibrium state at 25

13
00:00:34,047 --> 00:00:36,085
degrees Celsius.

14
00:00:36,085 --> 00:00:39,042
And remember, equilibrium
constants and equilibrium

15
00:00:39,042 --> 00:00:42,003
reactions are only dependent
on the temperature.

16
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:43,078
Nothing else.

17
00:00:43,078 --> 00:00:46,047
For a given molecule,
of course.

18
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:48,090
So 25 degrees Celsius.

19
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,064
And we also know, we did this
two videos ago, that the

20
00:00:51,064 --> 00:00:54,040
equilibrium constant-- as
a review, that's the

21
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:01,099
concentration of the products
divided by the concentration

22
00:01:01,099 --> 00:01:03,022
of the reactants.

23
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:05,027
But the reactant in this
case is just water.

24
00:01:05,027 --> 00:01:06,059
It's the actual solvent.

25
00:01:06,059 --> 00:01:09,065
And if the reactant is what
you're-- it's everywhere.

26
00:01:09,065 --> 00:01:11,078
So if you just go back to that
intuition example, the

27
00:01:11,078 --> 00:01:13,087
probability of finding
it is 1.

28
00:01:13,087 --> 00:01:17,029
So it's just always there,
so you don't included it.

29
00:01:17,029 --> 00:01:19,067
So you can just say divided by
1 or whatever, and this is

30
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:23,065
equal to the equilibrium
constant of water.

31
00:01:23,065 --> 00:01:27,034
We learned that that's
10 to the minus 14.

32
00:01:27,034 --> 00:01:32,051
Because water by itself will
have a hydrogen concentration

33
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:37,062
of 10 to the minus 7 and a
hydroxide concentration of 10

34
00:01:37,062 --> 00:01:38,087
to the minus 7.

35
00:01:38,087 --> 00:01:41,098
And if you take a log of
everything-- so if you take

36
00:01:41,098 --> 00:01:46,028
the pKw--

37
00:01:46,028 --> 00:01:47,021
What was that?

38
00:01:47,021 --> 00:01:49,018
If you put a p in front of
something, that means you're

39
00:01:49,018 --> 00:01:51,001
taking the negative log of it.

40
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:54,046
So the negative log of 10 to the
minus 14-- the log base 10

41
00:01:54,046 --> 00:01:57,004
up to the minus 14
is minus 14.

42
00:01:57,004 --> 00:01:59,040
So the negative log
is just 14.

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:07,076
So pKw is 14 and that is equal
to-- if I take the negative

44
00:02:07,076 --> 00:02:10,096
log of this side right here--
let me do that.

45
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:12,052
This is just a logarithm
property.

46
00:02:12,052 --> 00:02:15,087
This is more math
than chemistry.

47
00:02:15,087 --> 00:02:23,065
So the log of H plus times OH
times our hydroxide ion.

48
00:02:23,065 --> 00:02:25,071
That's the same thing, just
the logarithm properties.

49
00:02:25,071 --> 00:02:32,018
It's the same thing as minus
log of H plus minus, or you

50
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:40,015
could say plus the minus
log of OH minus.

51
00:02:40,015 --> 00:02:41,072
And what is this?

52
00:02:41,072 --> 00:02:48,053
well this is just the
pH, which is equal

53
00:02:48,053 --> 00:02:49,090
to the minus log.

54
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,083
This is 10 to the
minus 7, right?

55
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,025
10 to the minus 7.

56
00:02:54,025 --> 00:02:55,086
The log of that is minus 7.

57
00:02:55,086 --> 00:02:56,065
You have the minus in front.

58
00:02:56,065 --> 00:02:59,056
So its pH is equal to 7.

59
00:02:59,056 --> 00:03:01,036
And what is this?

60
00:03:01,036 --> 00:03:02,013
This over here.

61
00:03:02,013 --> 00:03:05,090
This is our pOH.

62
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:08,071
The minus log of the hydroxide
concentration.

63
00:03:08,071 --> 00:03:12,041
And of course, that was also
10 to the minus 7.

64
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:16,059
And so our pOH is equal to
log of that is minus 7.

65
00:03:16,059 --> 00:03:17,058
You have a minus in front.

66
00:03:17,058 --> 00:03:19,000
It's equal to 7.

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,005
So you get right there that
little formula that the pKw,

68
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:28,052
or the negative log of the
equilibrium constant of water,

69
00:03:28,052 --> 00:03:41,024
pKw is equal to the pH of water
plus the pOH of water.

70
00:03:41,024 --> 00:03:43,078
And this, at 25 degrees Celsius,
this is the thing

71
00:03:43,078 --> 00:03:45,055
that's going to stay constant
because we're going to start

72
00:03:45,055 --> 00:03:47,072
messing with these things
by throwing acid and

73
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,009
base into the water.

74
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:55,062
This thing is always going to
be 14 at 25 degrees Celsius.

75
00:03:55,062 --> 00:03:57,081
Remember, as long as you keep
temperature constant and

76
00:03:57,081 --> 00:04:01,022
you're not messing too much with
the molecule itself, your

77
00:04:01,022 --> 00:04:03,019
equilibrium constant
stays constant.

78
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:04,093
That's why it's called
a constant.

79
00:04:04,093 --> 00:04:08,071
So with all of that out of the
way, let's think about what

80
00:04:08,071 --> 00:04:13,096
happens if I throw some acid
into a-- let's say I have some

81
00:04:13,096 --> 00:04:15,021
hydrochloric acid.

82
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:18,099
   

83
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:21,025
I'll use colors more
creatively.

84
00:04:21,025 --> 00:04:23,026
So I have some hydrochloric
acid.

85
00:04:23,026 --> 00:04:26,069
It's in an aqueous solution.

86
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:32,089
We know that it disassociates
completely, which means that

87
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:39,039
we're just left with the
hydrogen ion, on which of

88
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:42,073
course really attaches itself to
another water molecule and

89
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,075
becomes hydronium.

90
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:51,056
Plus the chlorine anion,
or negative ion.

91
00:04:51,056 --> 00:04:53,085
Right there.

92
00:04:53,085 --> 00:05:09,007
And let's say that I do this
with 1 molar-- or, you know,

93
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:12,027
this is also sometimes written
as 1 capital M-- of

94
00:05:12,027 --> 00:05:13,076
hydrochloric acid.

95
00:05:13,076 --> 00:05:15,060
So essentially what
am I doing?

96
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,061
I am taking 1 molar of
hydrochloric acid, literally

97
00:05:18,061 --> 00:05:26,098
means that I am taking 1
mole of HCl per liter

98
00:05:26,098 --> 00:05:28,004
of our whole solution.

99
00:05:28,004 --> 00:05:29,016
Which is mainly water.

100
00:05:29,016 --> 00:05:30,075
It's an aqueous solution.

101
00:05:30,075 --> 00:05:33,000
Per liter of water, right?

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,075
So what's my concentration going
to be of these things

103
00:05:36,075 --> 00:05:37,037
right here?

104
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,012
Or in particular, what's
the concentration of

105
00:05:39,012 --> 00:05:41,047
the H going to be?

106
00:05:41,047 --> 00:05:46,025
Well, if this disassociated
completely, right?

107
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:49,033
So all of this stuff-- this is
not an equilibrium reaction.

108
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:49,093
Remember.

109
00:05:49,093 --> 00:05:52,023
I only drew a one way
arrow to the right.

110
00:05:52,023 --> 00:05:54,018
There's no even small
leftwards arrow.

111
00:05:54,018 --> 00:05:57,025
This is a strong hydrochloric
acid.

112
00:05:57,025 --> 00:06:01,050
So if you really put one molar
of this in an aqueous

113
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,038
solution, you're not going
to see any of this.

114
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:04,064
You're going to just see this.

115
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:11,029
So you're going to have the
hydrogen concentration here in

116
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:16,008
the aqueous solution is going
to be equal to 1 molar.

117
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:19,076
And there's also going to be 1
molar of chlorine anions, but

118
00:06:19,076 --> 00:06:22,054
we don't care about that.

119
00:06:22,054 --> 00:06:24,091
If I haven't said already, it
would be nice to figure out

120
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:27,032
what the pH of this
solution is.

121
00:06:27,032 --> 00:06:29,082
Now that I've thrown
hydrochloric acid in it.

122
00:06:29,082 --> 00:06:32,005
Well the pH is just the hydrogen
concentration.

123
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:36,093
   

124
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:38,063
We already have the hydrogen
concentration.

125
00:06:38,063 --> 00:06:42,019
That's 1 molar, or 1 mole
per liter of solution.

126
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:53,044
So the pH is going to be equal
to the minus log base 10 of

127
00:06:53,044 --> 00:06:54,076
our hydrogen concentration.

128
00:06:54,076 --> 00:06:56,089
Of 1.

129
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:59,014
10 to the what power
is equal to 1?

130
00:06:59,014 --> 00:07:01,097
Well, anything to the 0
of power is equal to

131
00:07:01,097 --> 00:07:02,093
1, including 10.

132
00:07:02,093 --> 00:07:05,098
So this is equal to 0
minus 0 is just 0.

133
00:07:05,098 --> 00:07:07,038
So your pH is 0.

134
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:15,019
So if you have 1 molar of
hydrochloric acid, and you

135
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:19,005
throw it into an aqueous
solution.

136
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,094
And, well, I guess I'm saying
you're putting it into a

137
00:07:21,094 --> 00:07:23,043
solution when I tell
you it's 1 molar.

138
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:26,075
So if you have a concentration
of 1 mole per liter of

139
00:07:26,075 --> 00:07:31,019
solution, where the solvent
is water, you will end up

140
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:33,093
with a pH of 0.

141
00:07:33,093 --> 00:07:35,018
The pH of 0.

142
00:07:35,018 --> 00:07:38,004
   

143
00:07:38,004 --> 00:07:43,075
So pH of water without
any acid in it, that

144
00:07:43,075 --> 00:07:44,067
was equal to 7.

145
00:07:44,067 --> 00:07:49,037
And this is considered
a neutral pH.

146
00:07:49,037 --> 00:07:54,000
Now we know that if you were
to have an aqueous solution

147
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,001
with 1 molar of hydrochloric
acid, we can say-- I'll do it

148
00:07:59,001 --> 00:08:07,092
in red because-- pH of HCl
in water is equal to 0.

149
00:08:07,092 --> 00:08:11,043
So obviously a low pH
is more acidic.

150
00:08:11,043 --> 00:08:14,061
And we went over that
in previous videos.

151
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:18,041
And let's figure out what the
pOH of hydrochloric acid is.

152
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:24,086
pOH of hydrochloric acid
in an aqueous solution.

153
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:28,049
Well, this all goes back to Le
Chatelier's Principle, right?

154
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,092
If you go back to what
we said before.

155
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:32,061
   

156
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:34,037
This is just pure water
right here.

157
00:08:34,037 --> 00:08:37,054
If we may have put 1 molar of
hydrochloric acid in here,

158
00:08:37,054 --> 00:08:46,007
we're essentially just throwing
a ton of hydrogen

159
00:08:46,007 --> 00:08:46,095
protons in there.

160
00:08:46,095 --> 00:08:50,026
We're substantially increasing
the concentration of this.

161
00:08:50,026 --> 00:08:52,090
And Le Chatelier's Principle
says oh, well that means that

162
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:55,064
a lot of this is going to be
consumed and the reaction will

163
00:08:55,064 --> 00:08:56,087
go and this direction.

164
00:08:56,087 --> 00:08:59,015
The equilibrium reaction will
go in that direction.

165
00:08:59,015 --> 00:09:00,012
But remember.

166
00:09:00,012 --> 00:09:03,040
Water by itself only had a 10 to
the minus 7 concentration.

167
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:10,086
We're throwing in a million--
I mean it was one ten

168
00:09:10,086 --> 00:09:13,022
millionth of a mole per liter.

169
00:09:13,022 --> 00:09:17,011
Now we're throwing in--
what is that?

170
00:09:17,011 --> 00:09:17,075
10 to the 7th.

171
00:09:17,075 --> 00:09:22,035
We're throwing in 10 million
times as much hydrogen ions

172
00:09:22,035 --> 00:09:23,048
into that water.

173
00:09:23,048 --> 00:09:25,029
So all of this stuff
just gets consumed.

174
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:26,037
Maybe it goes there.

175
00:09:26,037 --> 00:09:30,048
And so the concentration of this
gets thrown down really

176
00:09:30,048 --> 00:09:32,061
far because we're
dumping so much.

177
00:09:32,061 --> 00:09:34,095
And the concentration of this
goes up because it can only

178
00:09:34,095 --> 00:09:37,001
consume so much of these guys.

179
00:09:37,001 --> 00:09:38,042
There's not that much of this.

180
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:40,088
There's only 10 to the minus
7th molar of this.

181
00:09:40,088 --> 00:09:43,017
So this ends up being 1 molar.

182
00:09:43,017 --> 00:09:46,011
And if this ends up being 1
molar-- because 10 to the

183
00:09:46,011 --> 00:09:48,041
minus 7th molar, essentially,
you can kind of view it as it

184
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,059
all gets consumed with
the stuff over here.

185
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:53,067
What ends up being the
concentration of the OH?

186
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:58,084
Well, we already know that the
pKw is 14 of water at 25

187
00:09:58,084 --> 00:10:03,032
degrees, and the pKw of water
is equal to the pH of your

188
00:10:03,032 --> 00:10:05,025
solution plus your pOH.

189
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:12,033
So if your pH for hydrochloric
acid is 0, right?

190
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:14,027
We have 1 molar of hydrochloric
acid.

191
00:10:14,027 --> 00:10:19,059
Then your pOH of 1 molar of
hydrochloric acid is 14.

192
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:24,007
So right here, our pOH
is equal to 14.

193
00:10:24,007 --> 00:10:26,015
Now let's do the same thing
with a base and figure out

194
00:10:26,015 --> 00:10:26,097
what its pH is.

195
00:10:26,097 --> 00:10:28,048
A strong base.

196
00:10:28,048 --> 00:10:30,063
And I think you'll see that
it's the opposite.

197
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:35,070
So let's say I had potassium
hydroxide.

198
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,050
It's a strong base.

199
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:43,062
So it completely disassociates
in water to potassium cations.

200
00:10:43,062 --> 00:10:46,022
Positively charged ions.

201
00:10:46,022 --> 00:10:50,012
Plus hydroxide anions.

202
00:10:50,012 --> 00:10:51,041
It completed disassociates.

203
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,064
So if I put anything in an
aqueous solution-- I should

204
00:10:53,064 --> 00:10:54,089
write that down.

205
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:59,019
   

206
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:02,046
Aqueous solution just means we
are in water, of course.

207
00:11:02,046 --> 00:11:05,094
And if we essentially put
1 molar-- remember the

208
00:11:05,094 --> 00:11:07,008
concentration matters.

209
00:11:07,008 --> 00:11:07,095
You can't just say,
oh, hydrochloric

210
00:11:07,095 --> 00:11:09,032
acid has a pH of 0.

211
00:11:09,032 --> 00:11:09,041
No.

212
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,032
You have to say 1 molar
of hydrochloric

213
00:11:11,032 --> 00:11:13,070
acid has a pH of 0.

214
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,004
And actually I didn't
write that.

215
00:11:15,004 --> 00:11:15,065
Let me write that.

216
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:16,090
1 molar.

217
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:19,028
   

218
00:11:19,028 --> 00:11:22,037
And I'll leave you to figure out
what the pH or the pOH of

219
00:11:22,037 --> 00:11:24,030
2 molars of hydrochloric
acid is.

220
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,095
Or a 10 molar of hydrochloric
acid.

221
00:11:26,095 --> 00:11:29,070
And figure out what
those pH's are.

222
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:36,009
But if we have 1 molar, of
potassium hydroxide.

223
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:39,009
   

224
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:41,016
We have 1 molar of this.

225
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:42,094
And it completely disassociates

226
00:11:42,094 --> 00:11:43,061
when it's in water.

227
00:11:43,061 --> 00:11:47,061
So you have none of
this left over.

228
00:11:47,061 --> 00:11:50,048
What's your concentration
of OH?

229
00:11:50,048 --> 00:11:55,086
When your OH concentration
is going to be 1 molar.

230
00:11:55,086 --> 00:11:56,007
Right?

231
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,029
If you had 1 mole per liter of
this, you're going to 1 mole

232
00:11:58,029 --> 00:11:58,084
per liter of this.

233
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:01,016
Because all of this just
disappears in the water.

234
00:12:01,016 --> 00:12:02,044
So what is your pOH?

235
00:12:02,044 --> 00:12:05,035
   

236
00:12:05,035 --> 00:12:08,025
POH is just the negative
log of this.

237
00:12:08,025 --> 00:12:10,045
The log of 1 is 0.

238
00:12:10,045 --> 00:12:12,070
The negative of 0 is 0.

239
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:19,012
And then your pH in this
circumstance-- well, you could

240
00:12:19,012 --> 00:12:20,070
say, oh, it was the hydrogen
concentration.

241
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,054
You don't know what the hydrogen
concentration is, but

242
00:12:22,054 --> 00:12:24,032
you know that when you throw
a bunch of this stuff, it's

243
00:12:24,032 --> 00:12:26,016
going to sop up a bunch of
hydrogen and the hydrogen is

244
00:12:26,016 --> 00:12:27,011
going to go down a lot.

245
00:12:27,011 --> 00:12:28,048
But you're like, well,
how do I measure it?

246
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,064
Well, you remember it.

247
00:12:29,064 --> 00:12:32,029
25 degrees Celsius.

248
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:34,092
The equilibrium constant
of water is equal to

249
00:12:34,092 --> 00:12:37,013
the pH plus the pOH.

250
00:12:37,013 --> 00:12:38,062
We showed that at the beginning
of the video.

251
00:12:38,062 --> 00:12:43,025
So 14 is equal to
your pH plus 0.

252
00:12:43,025 --> 00:12:45,042
That's our pOH in this case.

253
00:12:45,042 --> 00:12:49,017
So our pH is 14.

254
00:12:49,017 --> 00:12:52,072
So if you have 1 molar-- I used
potassium hydroxide in

255
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:55,082
this case-- but if you have 1
molar of a strong base-- let

256
00:12:55,082 --> 00:12:57,030
me write that down.

257
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:05,044
1 molar of strong base.

258
00:13:05,044 --> 00:13:08,021
Remember, strong is kind of an
official term in chemistry.

259
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:11,012
It means complete
disassociation.

260
00:13:11,012 --> 00:13:17,098
You have a pH of 14 and
you have a pOH of 0.

261
00:13:17,098 --> 00:13:22,044
If you have 1 molar
of strong acid.

262
00:13:22,044 --> 00:13:25,067
If someone says that they have
something with a pH of 0 that

263
00:13:25,067 --> 00:13:31,051
they would like to maybe throw
at you, you should decline.

264
00:13:31,051 --> 00:13:34,063
Because it'll probably
hurt your

265
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:37,025
chances of-- well, anyway.

266
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,036
So let's say you have 1
molar of strong acid.

267
00:13:39,036 --> 00:13:47,087
It's a pH of 0 and
a pOH of 14.

268
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:50,042
Anyway, maybe in the next video
I'll actually show you--

269
00:13:50,042 --> 00:13:52,058
This might give you the
impression that this is an

270
00:13:52,058 --> 00:13:53,080
absolute scale.

271
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,049
That 0 is as acidic as you can
get, and 14 is as basic as you

272
00:13:57,049 --> 00:13:59,028
can get when you get the
pH, but that's not

273
00:13:59,028 --> 00:14:00,000
that's not the case.

274
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,062
You can actually get
above this or you

275
00:14:01,062 --> 00:14:02,045
can get below this.

276
00:14:02,045 --> 00:14:07,021
This was this when you had one
1 molar of a strong acid.

277
00:14:07,021 --> 00:14:10,024
If you had 2 molars of a strong
acid-- actually if you

278
00:14:10,024 --> 00:14:11,061
had 10 molars.

279
00:14:11,061 --> 00:14:11,084
Right?

280
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:12,083
Let's say you get your hydrogen

281
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:19,090
concentration to 10 molar.

282
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:23,014
So if you had 10 molar of a
strong acid, you apply that in

283
00:14:23,014 --> 00:14:24,008
an aqueous solution.

284
00:14:24,008 --> 00:14:27,009
It is, when I say it's a
molar by definition.

285
00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:28,075
What's your pH going to be?

286
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:33,001
Your pH is going to be the
minus log base 10 of 10.

287
00:14:33,001 --> 00:14:34,041
The log, base 10 of 10, is 1.

288
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,026
10 to the first power is one.

289
00:14:36,026 --> 00:14:37,083
So this is equal to minus 1.

290
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:40,076
So minus 1 pH would-- if
you had 10 molar of say

291
00:14:40,076 --> 00:14:45,013
hydrochloric acid or nitric acid
or anything like that.

292
00:14:45,013 --> 00:14:47,005
Anyway, that's all
for this video.

293
00:14:47,005 --> 00:14:49,007
I'll see you in the next one.
