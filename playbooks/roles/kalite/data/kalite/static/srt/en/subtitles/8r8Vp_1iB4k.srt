00:00:01,611 --> 00:00:03,270
So, let's review the idea of slope which you might

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
remember from your Algebra classes.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The slope is just a rate of change of a line

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or the rate of change of y

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with respect to x as we go long a line

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you could also view it

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
as a measure of the inclination of a line.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, the more inclined the line is,

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the more positive of a slope would have.
