1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,981
What I want to do in this video is revisit some ideas that you've probably taken for granted

2
00:00:04,981 --> 00:00:10,638
since the time that you were, like, three or four years old, but hopefully you'll kind of view it in a new light

3
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:14,402
that will help inform us when we think about other types of number systems. So, we have ten digits in our number systems.

4
00:00:14,402 --> 00:00:22,804
Let me just start counting. So if I have nothing I use the symbol 0. Then if I have one object

5
00:00:22,813 --> 00:00:27,669
I use the symbol 1. Actually, let me draw this out. So nothing, then if I have one thing, I use the symbol 1.

6
00:00:27,669 --> 00:00:34,387
If I have two things, I use the the symbol 2. If I have three things, I use the symbol 3. Let me scroll

7
00:00:34,387 --> 00:00:40,566
down a little bit so you can see that. If I have four things, I use this symbol right over here. If I

8
00:00:40,597 --> 00:00:50,922
have five things, I use this symbol. If I have six things... let's draw it like that... if I have I six things, I use that symbol.

9
00:00:50,922 --> 00:00:57,740
If I have seven things, I use that symbol. I know this might be getting a little bit tedious, but this

10
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:04,676
all has a point. If I have eight things, eight things, I use this symbol. And if I have nine things I

11
00:01:04,676 --> 00:01:23,314
use this symbol. And then if I have ten things... what symbol do I use? I've already used up my ten digits, we only have ten digits in a base ten

12
00:01:27,037 --> 00:01:30,698
system, so we start reusing them. So what we do is we reintroduce this idea of number places. You said

13
00:01:30,698 --> 00:01:38,654
that I have one ten and zero ones. So you say you have one ten and zero ones.

14
00:01:38,654 --> 00:01:45,898
...and then zero ones. We call this one, we say it's in the ten's place. This is literally saying one,

15
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:55,837
this is saying one tens, this is one tens plus zero ones. So that's what this is saying.

16
00:01:55,837 --> 00:01:59,629
But we didn't have to reuse it. We could have had maybe more symbols.

17
00:01:59,629 --> 00:02:02,974
Maybe this was a symbol, or instead of, or maybe we would've created a new symbol.

18
00:02:03,035 --> 00:02:06,982
Instead of, you know, all of these had their own symbol, so instead of having to reuse the old ones

19
00:02:06,982 --> 00:02:13,231
maybe we could've made... the symbol star for ten. And then when you go to eleven we would

20
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:17,021
have had another symbol for that... let me go to eleven, just to hit the point home.

21
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:21,946
So... two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.

22
00:02:21,946 --> 00:02:26,619
So, eleven in our number system, we say that this is one ten... we say this one ten

23
00:02:26,619 --> 00:02:35,071
... let me write it this way... one ten. And then this is also, it's one ten, and then one one.

24
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:43,001
... and then one one. So, it's one ten, plus one one. I know this is kind of strange to see

25
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:49,121
this way, but it represents this number of objects. If we had a base eleven, or I guess we could

26
00:02:49,151 --> 00:02:51,813
say base twelve number system, maybe we would have a symbol for this

27
00:02:51,813 --> 00:02:55,544
instead of reusing our old digits. Maybe a symbol could have been something wacky

28
00:02:55,544 --> 00:02:59,464
... maybe it would've been a smiley face. Who knows what it would've been. And I'll introduce

29
00:02:59,464 --> 00:03:05,206
higher number base systems in, kind of, future videos where we see, kind of, the symbols

30
00:03:05,206 --> 00:03:09,115
that are actually used. But, what I want to do in this video is think about

31
00:03:09,115 --> 00:03:12,270
how would we count, or what symbols would we use

32
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:16,152
if we had fewer digits, and in particular, how would we

33
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:19,530
count things if we only had two digits - if we only had

34
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,973
zero and one. Essentially, what we're going to do is think about

35
00:03:23,973 --> 00:03:27,457
how we would represent numbers in base two.

36
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,695
Our traditional number system is a base ten number system.

37
00:03:30,695 --> 00:03:33,523
We have ten digits - zero through nine.

38
00:03:33,523 --> 00:03:35,877
How would we count in base two?

39
00:03:35,877 --> 00:03:38,531
So, if you have zero things, you'd still probably say

40
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:41,295
"hey, I have zero. I can use the digit zero."

41
00:03:41,295 --> 00:03:43,540
If I have one thing, I can still say

42
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,800
"hey, I have one thing"... because, we

43
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,874
have the digits of zero and one. So, let me make it clear.

44
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:54,809
The digits here, the digits in base two, can be zero or one.

45
00:03:54,809 --> 00:03:58,477
So, if I have one thing, I can still use the number one.

46
00:03:58,492 --> 00:04:02,115
But, now all of a sudden I have these two objects here,

47
00:04:02,123 --> 00:04:07,153
and I'm saying that I'm limited... to only these two digits over here.

48
00:04:07,184 --> 00:04:09,844
So, how can I represent it. Well, instead of

49
00:04:09,844 --> 00:04:13,415
having a ten's place, I could create a two's place.

50
00:04:13,415 --> 00:04:16,218
...and I know it might sound a little bit counter-intuitive but I think you'll

51
00:04:16,218 --> 00:04:22,718
get used to it a little bit. So, over here in base ten, we said we had one ten and zero ones.

52
00:04:22,718 --> 00:04:25,722
So in base two, why can't we that we have

53
00:04:25,722 --> 00:04:30,041
one two - one two - and zero ones.

54
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:33,383
Let me make that clear. So, this right here is saying

55
00:04:33,383 --> 00:04:39,159
one two and zero ones.

56
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:42,595
I want to make sure you understand the analogy here.

57
00:04:42,595 --> 00:04:45,149
In base ten... let me write a larger number in base ten...

58
00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:49,266
...and so if I write the number 256 in base ten...

59
00:04:49,266 --> 00:04:53,833
so, this is base ten over here, what does this say?

60
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:58,777
This is saying two hundreds, so, two times a hundred...

61
00:04:58,777 --> 00:05:03,337
or, maybe I should write down the word so I don't confuse the symbols...

62
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:09,391
two hundreds plus five times... or maybe I should I say two hundreds

63
00:05:09,391 --> 00:05:19,917
plus five tens... two hundreds, plus five tens, plus six ones.

64
00:05:19,917 --> 00:05:22,133
That's what I represent here, and the way we know that

65
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:25,578
is that we know that if we go two places to the left, this is the hundreds

66
00:05:25,578 --> 00:05:31,469
place, this is the tens place, and this is the ones place.

67
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:36,290
And if you know from your exponents, this is equal to ten times ten.

68
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:39,964
This right here is equal to ten times itself only once

69
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,473
and this is equal to ten times itself, I guess

70
00:05:42,473 --> 00:05:43,958
you could call it, zero times.

71
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,650
Or, if you know your exponents, this is

72
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,900
ten to the second power, this is ten to the first power place,

73
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,209
and this is ten to the zeroth power place.

74
00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:53,355
And if you added another digit here, that

75
00:05:53,355 --> 00:05:55,055
would be the thousandths place, which would be

76
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:56,848
ten times ten times ten.

77
00:05:56,848 --> 00:05:58,871
We're going to do the exact same thing in base two

78
00:05:58,871 --> 00:06:00,755
but, instead of using ten, we're going to

79
00:06:00,755 --> 00:06:03,407
use two. So, now this is the two's place.

80
00:06:03,407 --> 00:06:06,580
This is the two's place over here. This is the one's place.

81
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,507
If we add more digits... let me make it clear...

82
00:06:09,507 --> 00:06:13,733
So in base two... let me write a number in base two...

83
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:17,356
remember, in base two I can only use zeros and ones.

84
00:06:17,356 --> 00:06:22,315
So, in base two, maybe I have the number 1010.

85
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:25,608
So, when you think about it this way, if this was base ten

86
00:06:25,608 --> 00:06:29,167
you would call this the ten's place, the hundred's place, and the thousandth's place.

87
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:32,262
But, this is base two now. So let me be very clear.

88
00:06:32,262 --> 00:06:35,435
We are only using two digits. So, in base two

89
00:06:35,435 --> 00:06:37,928
this right here is still the one's place

90
00:06:37,928 --> 00:06:40,731
now this is going to be the two's place

91
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:42,815
remember, in base ten this was the ten's place, now

92
00:06:42,815 --> 00:06:44,346
this is the two's place.

93
00:06:44,346 --> 00:06:47,577
Now this would be, and you can take a guess here

94
00:06:47,577 --> 00:06:49,615
hundreds was ten times ten.

95
00:06:49,615 --> 00:06:53,252
When we go two spaces to the left in base two

96
00:06:53,252 --> 00:06:55,760
this should be the two times two's place.

97
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:03,695
Or this is the four's place. This over here is going to be the eight's place.

98
00:07:03,695 --> 00:07:06,662
So, if you wanted to kind of think about this in terms

99
00:07:06,662 --> 00:07:12,564
of base two, this is one, one eight, plus zero fours,

100
00:07:12,564 --> 00:07:22,613
plus one twos, plus zero ones. Plus zero ones.

101
00:07:22,613 --> 00:07:25,336
So, if you wanted to represent this exact same number

102
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:30,134
in base ten, it's one eight, plus one two.

103
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:34,562
So, in base ten this would be... let me write it over here...

104
00:07:34,562 --> 00:07:39,173
in base ten this would be an eight plus a two, which is just a ten

105
00:07:39,173 --> 00:07:43,941
So, this is in base ten. This is how you'd represent

106
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:47,517
what we know as this many things - as ten things.

107
00:07:47,517 --> 00:07:50,152
This is how you'd represent it in base two.

108
00:07:50,152 --> 00:07:53,763
This is how we know we would represent it in base ten.

109
00:07:53,763 --> 00:07:56,334
Now let's continue here, just to make sure we understand things.

110
00:07:56,334 --> 00:08:01,256
So, this many objects, well, in base two we have one...

111
00:08:01,256 --> 00:08:04,708
if you just have two objects - that's one two and zero ones...

112
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:08,795
now three objects would be one two plus one ones.

113
00:08:08,795 --> 00:08:11,469
So, let me do it over here, so this would be one two

114
00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:13,031
plus one ones.

115
00:08:13,031 --> 00:08:18,085
So, this is three objects in base two.

116
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:23,967
Now when you go to this, so over here we have one four...

117
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:25,855
zero twos and zero ones.

118
00:08:25,871 --> 00:08:27,924
So, now we're going to go to the four place.

119
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,948
Because we've essentially maxed out everything.

120
00:08:29,948 --> 00:08:32,402
If we increment more, we have to go to one more place

121
00:08:32,402 --> 00:08:34,333
just like we did in base ten, but now we can only use

122
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,971
the digits zero and one.

123
00:08:35,971 --> 00:08:41,008
So, now we'll have one four, zero twos, zero ones.

124
00:08:41,008 --> 00:08:44,069
Now when we add one more, we're going to add one more one

125
00:08:44,069 --> 00:08:49,915
so, now we have one four, zero twos, and one one.

126
00:08:49,915 --> 00:08:53,215
and just to be clear, this is this many things.

127
00:08:53,215 --> 00:08:57,767
This is this many things in base two, this is the four place

128
00:08:57,767 --> 00:09:00,006
one four and one one. If you wanted to convert

129
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,263
this into base ten, you'd say look

130
00:09:02,263 --> 00:09:08,146
"this is one four, zero twos, and one one."

131
00:09:08,146 --> 00:09:11,444
So, if you have a four and a one, we would represent

132
00:09:11,444 --> 00:09:14,082
that with a symbol 5 in base ten, but

133
00:09:14,082 --> 00:09:16,992
we don't have that symbol to us in base two.

134
00:09:16,992 --> 00:09:19,602
Let's go to this. So, now we're going to increment one more.

135
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:21,590
So, how can we represent that in base two?

136
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,367
This is definitely, we're going to have one four...

137
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:27,163
and then we're going to have one two... and then

138
00:09:27,163 --> 00:09:29,257
we're going to have zero ones.

139
00:09:29,257 --> 00:09:32,248
And if you keep it... it's kind of fun counting

140
00:09:32,248 --> 00:09:34,133
in base two, you'll start to get the hang of it.

141
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:36,587
So, here we'll have to add one one to this so we

142
00:09:36,587 --> 00:09:38,610
get one, one, one.

143
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,125
And now when we get to eight, there's no

144
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,025
way to kind of increment any of these any

145
00:09:42,025 --> 00:09:44,518
higher, so we have to get a new place... we have to go to

146
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:46,761
the eight's place. So, we have one eight...

147
00:09:46,761 --> 00:09:50,723
zero fours, zero twos, and zero ones.

148
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,983
This right here, it might look like a thousand to you

149
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:55,475
but it would be a thousand if we were in base ten.

150
00:09:55,475 --> 00:10:02,023
In base two, this is this many objects. This is eight objects in base two.

151
00:10:02,023 --> 00:10:04,237
When you go... when you increment at one, we'll

152
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:07,064
have this many, we'll have one eight, and then we'll have one one.

153
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:10,181
So, it'll be 1001.

154
00:10:10,181 --> 00:10:15,026
And then, I'll stop here, at what we consider to be ten objects....

155
00:10:15,026 --> 00:10:20,485
in base two, you would say you have one eight, and you would need one two...

156
00:10:20,485 --> 00:10:23,648
so zero fours, one two, and zero ones.

157
00:10:23,648 --> 00:10:28,029
So, this right here is ten in base two.

158
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:30,537
This is ten in base ten.

159
00:10:30,583 --> 99:59:59,999
Hopefully that doesn't confuse you too much.
