1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,590
I had dinner between the
last video and this one.

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,300
So I might have forgotten
what I just did.

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,740
I think I was about to-- if
what I see on my board makes

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,010
sense-- I was about to use the
Taylor series, or in this

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,990
specific example the Maclaurin
series approximation, to figure

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,410
out a polynomial version, a sum
of polynomial terms to

7
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,480
approximate e to the x.

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,200
And remember let me write
here what the definition of

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,380
the Maclaurin series was.

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:42,560
That we said that f of x is
equal to the sum from n equals

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:49,890
0 to infinite of the nth
derivative of f evaluated at

12
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,460
0-- I don't know if I
remembered to put it evaluated

13
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,840
at 0 last time I wrote this
down-- times x to the

14
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,990
n over n factorial.

15
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,430
And hopefully that
makes sense to you.

16
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,920
This might seem really
confusing and strange.

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,930
But now that we're going to
apply it to e to the x, this

18
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,780
should maybe be a little
bit more concrete.

19
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,650
And I think at the end of the
last video I said that if f of

20
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:15,140
x is e to the x, f of 0 is
e to the 0, which is 1.

21
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:21,180
And f prime of x, any
derivative of e to the x

22
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,810
is equal to e to the x.

23
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:30,090
So you take any derivative of
at 0, and it equals 1 for e to

24
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,490
the x for this particular
case of f of x.

25
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,200
And that's really neat.

26
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,770
That means that the rate of
change of y with respect to x

27
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,300
is for every 1 you move in x,
you move 1 in y at e to the 0.

28
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,610
But that also means that
the rate of change of the

29
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:47,710
rate of change is also 1.

30
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,060
At the rate of change at
the rate of change at the

31
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,030
rate of change is also 1.

32
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:57,470
So at either the 0 or x equals
0 of e to the x, the slope of

33
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,470
the slope of the slope of the
slope of the slope of the slope

34
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,710
of the slope, they're all 1.

35
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:05,420
Which to me tells me something
mysterious is happening.

36
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,040
It's another reason why you
should just sit and ponder e.

37
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,240
But anyway, back to what
we were trying to do.

38
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,370
So how would we do this?

39
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,805
How would be write
the approximation?

40
00:02:12,805 --> 00:02:16,660
   

41
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,680
Let me write the approximate.

42
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,800
I'll call that p of x.

43
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,620
Because it's going
to be a polynomial.

44
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,740
   

45
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:30,040
Well in this particular case,
what's the derivative of any

46
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,590
derivative evaluated at f of 0?

47
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,490
Well that term is 1.

48
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,290
We wrote that down right here.

49
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,890
f of 0 is 1.

50
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,490
The first derivative at 0 is 1.

51
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,830
The second derivative
at 0 is 1.

52
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,010
Right?

53
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,410
That's what's special
about e to the x.

54
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:48,680
So all of these terms
are going to equal 1.

55
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:56,740
So this polynomial simplifies
to the sum from n equals 0 to

56
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:02,470
infinite of x to the
n over n factorial.

57
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,920
That to me is very neat.

58
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,010
Remember these are
all 1 in every term.

59
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,960
So that's why I took it out.

60
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,810
So what does that mean?

61
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,960
Well that tells us that e to
the x can be approximated.

62
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,630
And actually, I don't
prove it here.

63
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,660
But it actually turns out that
we take the infinite sum that

64
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,030
the Maclaurin series not only
approximates e to the

65
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,245
x at x equals 0.

66
00:03:21,245 --> 00:03:23,620
When you take the infinite
series, it actually

67
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,460
equals e to the x.

68
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:30,490
So when you take a Maclaurin
series at 0, and the resulting

69
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,670
function, the resulting
polynomial actually converges--

70
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,560
and that's something we'll
learn a little bit more

71
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:43,340
rigorously hopefully later when
we start doing analysis-- but

72
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,090
it can actually converge to the
function at all points.

73
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,490
And it actually is the
case with e to the x.

74
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,240
So we can actually say
that e to the x is equal.

75
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,050
I didn't prove this.

76
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,330
But you can take
my word for it.

77
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,100
And you can even test it
out with some numbers.

78
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,340
It equals this sum.

79
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,060
Well what is this sum?

80
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:08,020
It's x to the 0 over 0
factorial plus x to the 1 over

81
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:12,660
1 factorial plus x-squared
over 2 factorial.

82
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,780
And you keep going.

83
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,780
Of course that's equal.

84
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,950
So e to x is equal
to-- x to the 0 is 1.

85
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,870
0 factorial, I said in
the last video is 1.

86
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:26,740
So it's 1 plus this is just x,
plus x-squared over 2 factorial

87
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:32,610
plus x to the third over
3 factorial plus x to the

88
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,810
fourth over 4 factorial.

89
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,790
And you just keep
going on forever.

90
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,480
And that's e to the x.

91
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,490
And to me that is amazing.

92
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:44,810
Because this strange number e,
this 2.7 whatever, whatever,

93
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,130
that we got from compound
interest, it can be written as

94
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:51,600
an infinite polynomial, this
polynomial series or this

95
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,730
Maclaurin series, that actually
has a certain beauty to it.

96
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,870
This number is kind of ugly
when you write it out,

97
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,380
2.7 whatever, whatever.

98
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,560
But when you write it to an
exponent power as an infinite

99
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,960
sum, it kind of has
a nice rhythm to it.

100
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,680
It's very patterned.

101
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,540
Who would have guessed that
you could have written it

102
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,390
in such a simple form.

103
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:15,460
And even more, what happens
when x is equal to 1.

104
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:15,770
Right?

105
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:16,770
So what's e to the 1?

106
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,125
Well then we set x equal
to 1 on both sides.

107
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:25,820
And I think I have space to
do it here, e to the 1,

108
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,350
which is equal to e.

109
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,810
We just set all the x's to 1.

110
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:35,570
So we get that's equal to 1
plus 1 plus 1 over 2 factorial

111
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:40,340
plus 1 over 3 factorial plus 1
over 4 factorial plus

112
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,070
1 over 5 factorial.

113
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,950
That to me, once
again, is amazing.

114
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,170
That the number e, and we've
just stumbled on another

115
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:56,400
definition of e, e is equal to
the sum from n equals 0 to

116
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:03,490
infinite of 1 over n factorial.

117
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,270
That is amazing.

118
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,790
So now we have two
definitions for e.

119
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,520
We have this one that we
stumbled on, and of course we

120
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,320
had the ones from compound
interest that I will

121
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,750
do in magenta.

122
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:17,150
The limit as n approaches
infinite, 1 plus 1

123
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,690
over n to the n.

124
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,510
That also is equal to e.

125
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:25,280
This is starting to
give me chills.

126
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,660
Because this very strange,
bizarre number is popping out.

127
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,210
This might not seem
so natural to you.

128
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,340
But it's neat.

129
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,520
And it comes out in compound
interest, and continuously

130
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,920
compounding interest.

131
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,170
But this is even simpler.

132
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,550
I just keep picking one over
the factorial of numbers and

133
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,420
I add them all together.

134
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,010
And if I take every number
really in existence, and I

135
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:48,320
sum them all up, I get e.

136
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,170
That to me is amazing.

137
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,890
1 over n factorial of
essentially every integer

138
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,200
from 0 to infinite.

139
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,860
If I sum them up, I
get the number e.

140
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,740
You hopefully are getting
chills right now.

141
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,170
Well anyway, let's do the
Maclaurin series for a

142
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:05,990
couple more functions.

143
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,090
And then we'll get to something
that is even more mind-blowing.

144
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,140
I'll see you in the next video.
