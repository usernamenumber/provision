1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,480
   

2
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,280
We're asked to simplify the cube
route of 8a squared b to

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,780
the fifth c to the
third power.

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,720
Now the easiest way to simplify
a cubic radical like

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,660
this, where you have to find
the cube root, is to factor

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,270
this expression inside the
radical into things that are

7
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,190
perfect cubes and things
that aren't.

8
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,530
And the things that are perfect
cubes, we can just

9
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,260
take the cube roots of those and
then kind of take them out

10
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:25,970
of the radical.

11
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,070
And everything else we
can leave under it.

12
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,110
So first let's just focus on the
8, figure out if it can be

13
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,280
factored into a perfect cube, or
if it maybe it's a perfect

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,470
cube itself.

15
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,880
8 is 2 times 4.

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,020
4 is 2 times 2.

17
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,270
So 8 is 2 times 2 times 2.

18
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,170
Or it's 2 to the third.

19
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,250
2 to the third is equal to 8.

20
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,140
   

21
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:52,570
Or we could say that the cube
root of 8 is equal to 2.

22
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,040
So 8 is already a nice,
perfect cube.

23
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,600
So let's worry about this
other stuff over here.

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,890
So let me rewrite the radical.

25
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,790
Let me rewrite the radical
over here.

26
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:05,459
I'll leave the 8 the way it is
because it's a nice, perfect

27
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:06,800
cube already.

28
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,730
I'll leave the 8
the way it is.

29
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:12,110
And then, let me focus-- well,
a squared, I'm not going to

30
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,740
really be able to factor that
into kind of a to the third

31
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,630
times something else.

32
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,670
I mean I could if I wanted to
be really tricky, but I'll

33
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,130
just leave it as a
squared for now.

34
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,750
Let me do that in a
different color.

35
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,230
So that's a squared.

36
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,750
Put a squared.

37
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,650
b to the fifth, I can write that
as b to the third power

38
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,470
times b squared.

39
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,870
And that way I have a perfect
cube here and then I have

40
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:35,620
something that's not.

41
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,950
But this, at least, I could
take the cube root of.

42
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,000
And then, c to the third.

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,820
That's already a perfect cube.

44
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,540
c to the third, the cube
root of that is c, so

45
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,500
times c to the third.

46
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,750
And so we can rewrite this
expression here, just

47
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,400
reordering things
a little bit.

48
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,010
This is the same thing as the
cube root of 8-- that's the

49
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:06,640
first term right there-- times
the cube root of b cubed times

50
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,190
the cube root of c cubed.

51
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,410
So, so far I've taken care
of that term, that

52
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,680
term, and that term.

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,180
And these are all of the ones
that I can actually take the

54
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,700
cube root of.

55
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,320
And I can leave the other two
under this larger cube root.

56
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:29,910
So times the cube root of-- we
have our a squared here and

57
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,280
then our b squared.

58
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,000
Our a squared and then we have
a b squared right here.

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,830
Now, the cube root of 8 is 2.

60
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:42,050
The cube root of b to
the third is b.

61
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,000
Let me do it in the same colors,
makes it more visually

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,950
compelling.

63
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:48,890
Cube root of c to
the third is c.

64
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,890
And then this, you can't really
simplify anymore.

65
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,770
I mean you could kind of play
around with it, but this is

66
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,865
about as simplified as you can
get for this cubic radical, or

67
00:02:56,865 --> 00:02:59,715
this cube root radical, or this
third root, depending on

68
00:02:59,715 --> 00:03:00,440
how you view it.

69
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:07,350
So, times the cube root of
a squared b squared.

70
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,910
And we're done.
