[music playing]

2
00:00:04,402 --> 00:00:09,236
We're in the Prado in Madrid, and we're looking
at the great canvas by Velázquez, "Las Meninas."

3
00:00:09,236 --> 00:00:14,156
Did you mean "great" in terms of size? Because
it is a very large painting.

4
00:00:14,156 --> 00:00:18,770
Actually, it's a painting with a very large
painting inside it . . .

5
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,980
That's the same size as the painting it is.

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,663
In fact, some art historians have suggested
that the painting that Velázquez -

7
00:00:25,663 --> 00:00:28,883
- because notice there is a self-portrait 
of Velázquez in the act of painting -

8
00:00:28,883 --> 00:00:32,062
is in fact painting the painting that
we're looking at.

9
00:00:32,062 --> 00:00:33,162
Did you follow that?

10
00:00:33,162 --> 00:00:35,667
I did. It is very complicated.

11
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:40,777
So what we're seeing here is, in the center, the princess attended by the maidens of honor,

12
00:00:40,777 --> 00:00:44,029
a dwarf, her governess, and some
other attendants.

13
00:00:44,029 --> 00:00:46,495
And on the back wall a mirror,

14
00:00:46,495 --> 00:00:49,378
which is the sort of puzzle in a way
of the painting.

15
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:53,817
We know it's a mirror because unlike the
canvases on the back wall,

16
00:00:53,817 --> 00:00:55,879
this is a much more reflective surface.

17
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:58,096
We can see the beveled edge 
of the glass,

18
00:00:58,096 --> 00:01:03,043
and of course in that frame, we see
a reflection of the King and Queen of Spain,

19
00:01:03,043 --> 00:01:04,570
Philip IV and his wife.

20
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:10,431
And some art historians have suggested
that we must be them looking into the mirror

21
00:01:10,431 --> 00:01:11,783
and seeing our own reflection.

22
00:01:11,783 --> 00:01:15,603
Others have suggested that in fact,
the mirror is reflecting the image

23
00:01:15,603 --> 00:01:18,636
that is being depicted on the
canvas by Velázquez,

24
00:01:18,636 --> 00:01:24,187
and then even other art historians
have suggested, yes, the mirror is reflecting

25
00:01:24,187 --> 00:01:27,937
what's on the canvas, but the king
and queen are still standing before us.

26
00:01:27,937 --> 00:01:30,022
Which is why the princess is
looking out at us,

27
00:01:30,022 --> 00:01:32,495
and even the dog is, in a sense,
taking notice.

28
00:01:32,495 --> 00:01:36,001
And why there is just sort of 
general attention being very much focused

29
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:39,052
on where we are in front
of the painting.

30
00:01:39,052 --> 00:01:41,280
Perhaps we're in the space
of the king and queen,

31
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,935
and this painting was meant for
the study of the king,

32
00:01:44,935 --> 00:01:47,235
who would have been the
person looking at it.

33
00:01:47,235 --> 00:01:49,835
So it's very much meant for
his gaze.

34
00:01:49,835 --> 00:01:55,580
That issue of looking, of gaze, is I think
for me really one of the central keys

35
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,568
to this painting.

36
00:01:56,568 --> 00:01:58,719
It seems to me to be a 
conversation of glances,

37
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,617
a conversation of people reacting to
each other's glances, of looking itself,

38
00:02:03,617 --> 00:02:06,201
a kind of essay on the way
in which we see.

39
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:08,784
To me it's more of paying attention.

40
00:02:08,784 --> 00:02:11,430
I think that's exactly right, and
that would make sense.

41
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,284
This is the king and queen of Spain, one of
the most powerful countries on the face of the Earth

42
00:02:15,284 --> 00:02:16,020
at this moment.

43
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,320
Yeah, you would have to pay attention to them
if they walked in the room.

44
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,135
You would ignore them at your own peril.

45
00:02:20,135 --> 00:02:22,093
Exactly.

46
00:02:22,093 --> 00:02:25,800
And we can see it when we see the
artist, Velázquez, who is first painter to the king

47
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,598
looking out to the royal couple.

48
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:32,087
He would have had, of course, the best
job that an artist could have in Spain at this moment.

49
00:02:32,087 --> 00:02:38,634
I'm interested, though, in the sort of sense
of naturalism, the sense of spontaneity,

50
00:02:38,634 --> 00:02:43,002
the sense of informality, which is so unexpected
in a royal portrait.

51
00:02:43,002 --> 00:02:47,133
That's the amazing thing about this
painting, I think, that makes it so hard

52
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:53,030
to say what it is and makes it so compelling
is that it's not a "portrait."

53
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,784
Because we know what portraits
look like.

54
00:02:54,784 --> 00:02:56,065
They're on the walls all around us.

55
00:02:56,065 --> 00:03:00,416
And they're very formal portraits
of the royal family kind of posing

56
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:04,321
and looking powerful, and that's
not what this is.

57
00:03:04,321 --> 00:03:08,106
So there is a kind of informality,
like a genre painting,

58
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:11,544
like we're looking at something like
a day in the life of the painter's studio,

59
00:03:11,544 --> 00:03:14,657
but that's not what it is, either,
because it is also a portrait.

60
00:03:14,657 --> 00:03:18,671
So it sort of straddles this
weird line of being both those things.

61
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:20,339
It's like an intimate portrait.

62
00:03:20,339 --> 00:03:23,355
It's a portrait that gives you a
kind of access to, in a sense,

63
00:03:23,355 --> 00:03:26,669
the real moment, the real life
within this palace.

64
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:31,135
In fact, some art historians have
suggested that the painting is in part

65
00:03:31,135 --> 00:03:36,014
a way for the artist to promote
himself and to show his importance

66
00:03:36,014 --> 00:03:37,748
and in a sense his value
to the court.

67
00:03:37,748 --> 00:03:41,358
The idea that as a painter, he's not
just a craftsman,

68
00:03:41,358 --> 00:03:43,753
but an intellectual.

69
00:03:43,753 --> 00:03:45,092
So here's the irony.

70
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:49,576
If Velázquez is in a sense trying
to support this notion

71
00:03:49,576 --> 00:03:52,900
of the artist as intellectual,
and not the craftsman,

72
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,524
not the man who works with his hands,

73
00:03:54,524 --> 00:03:58,221
the painting is a bravura
example of painting.

74
00:03:58,221 --> 00:04:02,220
We can never get away from 
the fact that this is fantastic painting;

75
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,952
because although there is a tremendous
sense of naturalism amongst these figures,

76
00:04:05,952 --> 00:04:10,258
the painting is also nothing but 
a series of strokes of paint.

77
00:04:10,258 --> 00:04:15,312
And I think that's most vividly
witnessed in the sleeves of La Infanta,

78
00:04:15,312 --> 00:04:20,435
of her attendants, or especially that
lightning bolt of stroke of white

79
00:04:20,435 --> 00:04:25,371
that goes down the artist's own sleeve
and actually leads our eye to the palette.

80
00:04:25,371 --> 00:04:28,257
And here's the sort of most wonderful
conundrum.

81
00:04:28,257 --> 00:04:33,039
The palette is a representation
in space of the raw paint

82
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:37,206
which is, of course, the
very stuff that the artist is using

83
00:04:37,206 --> 00:04:40,590
to create the depiction of the
thing that it is.

84
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:46,119
What I find so interesting, though, also,
is that there is a time when the reverse happens.

85
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,350
Look at the way that his hand
holds the paintbrush.

86
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:55,242
That is raw paint that almost dissolves,
almost refuses to be fingers on a hand.

87
00:04:55,242 --> 00:04:58,756
So that he's in a sense playing
on that edge.

88
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:05,117
I can make very loose strokes of
the brush feel clarified and come together

89
00:05:05,117 --> 00:05:07,206
and feel like cloth in motion, right?

90
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:09,922
Reflective light, taffeta, what have you.

91
00:05:09,922 --> 00:05:14,926
Or I can actually dissolve forms that you expect
and allow the thing

92
00:05:14,926 --> 00:05:18,441
to become just the act of painting as well.

93
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:19,191
Just the paint.

94
00:05:19,191 --> 00:05:22,885
I think what adds to this is the fact
that we don't see what he's painting.

95
00:05:22,885 --> 00:05:26,919
There's a kind of mystery about
the alchemy of painting,

96
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:34,128
about how you take medium and solvent
and pigment and turn it into reality.

97
00:05:34,128 --> 00:05:36,304
I would say that it's not just reality
he's after.

98
00:05:36,304 --> 00:05:39,160
I think he's after a kind
of condensed reality.

99
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,609
I think he's after a kind of
heightened experience of looking,

100
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:46,941
a kind of heightened experience of the
intimacy of this family, of this moment.

101
00:05:46,941 --> 00:05:50,941
And I think that he is doing something
that is actually quite poetic and quite philosophical.
