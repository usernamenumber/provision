1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:09,050
We're on problem 49.

2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:15,000
And it says, what is the square root of 7 plus the

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,020
square root of 7, and all of that squared.

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,020
So this is really just a little bit of simplification.

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,950
So if I have two of something,in this case,

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,360
I have 2 square roots of 7, if I add them together,

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,920
I get 2 of it, so I get 2 square roots of 7,

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,630
and I'm squaring that.

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,160
And 2 square roots of 7 squared, that's equal to 2

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,300
squared times the square root of 7 squared, right?

11
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,300
That's just your exponent properties,

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,540
so that is equal to 4 times--

13
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,160
what's the square root of 7 squared?

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,010
Well, it's just 7, right?

15
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,030
So it's 4 times 7, which is equal to 28,

16
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,010
which is choice C. Next problem.

17
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,890
50. In a certain population,

18
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:02,270
there are three times as many people aged 21 or under as

19
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,410
there are people over 21.

20
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:11,810
OK, so let's say that x is equal to under 21 and y is

21
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,680
equal to over 21.

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,570
So in a certain population,

23
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:22,060
there are three times as many people aged 21 or under as

24
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:26,700
there are people over 21.

25
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,090
So this is the number of people under 21

26
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:34,000
and there are three times as many as there are over 21.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,070
The ratio of those 21 or under to the total population is?

28
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:45,230
So they want to know the ratio of x, 21 or under,

29
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:51,300
to the total population, not just to the over 21 population.

30
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,820
So what's the total population?

31
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,670
That's everyone, right? x plus y is equal to total.

32
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:05,810
So what they want is the ratio of x to x plus y.

33
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:10,660
And then we could do a little bit of substitution.

34
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,350
We know x is equal to 3y,

35
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,880
so let's substitute that into this.

36
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,710
Remember, this is the ratio they're trying to figure out:

37
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,460
the ratio of 21 or under to the total population.

38
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:24,290
So x is equal to 3y over 3y plus y.

39
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,120
And I just did that because, wow, if we do that then it

40
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,670
looks like we could be able to cancel out all the y's.

41
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,400
So we get 3y over what?

42
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,020
What's 3y plus another y? Well, it's 4y. The y's cancel out.

43
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,820
You get 3/4. And that is choice E, 3:4.

44
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:49,090
Next question. 51.

45
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,030
And actually, you know, you didn't even have to do it

46
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,000
algebraically.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,960
If you just think about question 50,

48
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,050
you could have just played with numbers.

49
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,960
You can say, OK, there are three times

50
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,010
as many people aged 21 or under as there are people over 21.

51
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,030
So you just say, OK, if there's one person over 21,

52
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,480
there'd be three people under 21,

53
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,320
and there'd be a total of four people, so it would be 3:4.

54
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,160
But anyway, either way it didn't take us too long.

55
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,390
So they've drawn a figure here.

56
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:15,050
Let me draw it as well.

57
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:19,040
So they have two lines that intersect something like that.

58
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,060
And they say that this angle right here is 3x degrees.

59
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,650
This angle is y plus 30 degrees,

60
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:33,010
and they say this angle is 2x degrees.

61
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:37,000
And they say, in the figure above, the value of y is what?

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Well, there's a bunch of ways you can do it.

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,020
The way this pops out to me is we could figure out x because

64
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,710
we know that this angle plus this angle is equal to

65
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:48,050
180 degrees, because they are supplementary.

66
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:51,000
They go all the way halfway around a circle.

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,040
So we know that if we add 3x plus 2x, that should equal

68
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,030
180 degrees, or 5x is equal to 180.

69
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,030
Or that x is equal to what?

70
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,750
Let's see, 30 times 5 is 150, then you have 30 left over,

71
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,010
so it's 36 degrees, right?

72
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,000
36 times 5 is, yep, 180.

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,060
And now we know if x is 36 degrees, what is this angle?

74
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,010
Well, this angle is going to be 72 degrees.

75
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,090
It's 2 times x.

76
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,090
72 degrees.

77
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:28,000
And then this angle and this angle are opposite angles.

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,050
And you could do the angle game module on Khan Academy,

79
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,200
if that doesn't ring a bell,

80
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,040
but that should ring a bell from geometry.

81
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,020
And there's another way you could do it.

82
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,000
You could say that this angle plus this angle have to equal

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,090
180, either way.

84
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,050
You could do it either way.

85
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,470
But the easiest way is to say

86
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,460
that this angle and this angle are equal,

87
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,060
because they're opposite angles.

88
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:50,600
So we know that y plus 30 has to equal

89
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,010
this angle, equals 72.

90
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,310
Subtract 30 from both sides, you get y is equal to

91
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,110
42 degrees, which is choice E.

92
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:09,040
Next problem. Let me make it a different color now. 52.

93
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,050
Kelly and Chris packed several boxes with books.

94
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:27,550
If Chris packed 60% of the total number of boxes,

95
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,350
what was the ratio of the number of boxes

96
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:35,170
Kelly packed to the number of boxes Chris packed?

97
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:39,210
So they want to know the ratio of Kelly to Chris, right?

98
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,100
Well, if Chris packed 60% of the total, we could say,

99
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,330
let C be the number that Chris packed,

100
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,910
so that'll be equal to 0.6 of the total.

101
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,320
Well, then that means that

102
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,680
Kelly packed the rest of them, right?

103
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,610
So, I'm assuming it's a she,

104
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,980
Kelly would have packed the remainder,

105
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,490
which is 40% of the total.

106
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,140
So the ratio of the number that Chris--

107
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,800
what do they want to know?

108
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,880
What was the ratio of the number of boxes

109
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,480
Kelly packed to the number of boxes Chris packed.

110
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,030
So the want to know the ratio of K to C.

111
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:15,670
Well, K is 0.4T and C is 0.6T.

112
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,340
T's cancel out.

113
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,020
You get, essentially, 4/6, which is 2/3, right?

114
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,500
If you multiply the top and the bottom by 10,

115
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:29,850
it becomes 4/6, so you get 2:3, and that is choice E.

116
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:34,220
Problem 53.

117
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:40,930
Of the following, which is the closest approximation of

118
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:49,580
50.2 times 0.49 over 199.8?

119
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,860
So I haven't looked at the choices yet,

120
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,790
but if I had to approximate what this is,

121
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:56,830
I would say, well, that's close to 50, right?

122
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,550
50.2 is really close to 50 times--

123
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:05,100
0.49 is really close to 0.5, all of that over--

124
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,920
199.8 is really close to 200, right?

125
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,840
So you could view this as being equal to

126
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,100
-- let's see, 25/200.

127
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:22,830
And 25/200, you could divide the top and the bottom by 25.

128
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:26,270
You get 1 over-- 25 goes into 100 four times,

129
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,660
goes into 200-- eight times.

130
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,410
And that is one of our choices, so I'll go with that.

131
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:45,360
B. 1/8. Problem 54. The average of 10, 30, and 50.

132
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:53,740
So the average is going to be 10 plus 30 plus 50.

133
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:59,350
So the average of those three is that, divided by 3.

134
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,700
First of all, what is that?

135
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,070
Well, it looks like it should be 30, right?

136
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,780
Because you get 60 plus 30/3, so that's 90.

137
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:14,920
So the average of 10, 30, and 50 is 5 more than the average

138
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:25,230
of 20, 40, and one of the choices, and x.

139
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,110
So to write this,

140
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,920
we say, OK, we figured out that the average--

141
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,020
oh, sorry, the average here isn't-- sorry,

142
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,710
let me redo this for you.

143
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,070
So they say the average of 10, 30, and 50,

144
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,800
and we already figured out 10 plus 30 plus 50.

145
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:45,630
If you average that, divided by 3, you get 90 divided by 3

146
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,530
is equal to 30.

147
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,290
And you actually didn't even have to do the math.

148
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,840
You could have said, oh, we'll have 30 in the middle.

149
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,710
50 is 20 more than 30. 10 is 20 less than 30.

150
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,780
So the average is going to be 30.

151
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,240
But this didn't take you much time. So the average is 30.

152
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,800
And they say that that is 5 more than the average of 20, 40,

153
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,840
and another number.

154
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:09,470
So 30 is equal to 5 plus the average of those three numbers.

155
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,810
So the average of those three numbers is

156
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:17,380
20 plus 40 plus x, over 3, right?

157
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,690
So let's just simplify this.

158
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,880
Let's subtract 5 from both sides.

159
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:28,540
You get 25 is equal to 20 plus 40 plus x, over 3.

160
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,290
So you multiply both sides by 3.

161
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:38,450
You get 75 is equal to 60 plus x.

162
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:41,650
And then you subtract 60 from both sides.

163
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:45,650
You get x is equal to 15, and that is choice A.

164
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,950
And I'm almost out of time,

165
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,190
so I'll see you in the next video.

166
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,010
See you soon.
