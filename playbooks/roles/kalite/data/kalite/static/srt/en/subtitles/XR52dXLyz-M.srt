1
00:00:00,395 --> 00:00:06,133
I wanna talk a little bit more about reflection and specular and diffuse reflection in particular

2
00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:11,067
and to start of, I wanna make a minor correction to the last video, and it's actually a pretty interesting

3
00:00:11,067 --> 00:00:13,000
correction because in this image right here

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,800
I talked about a double reflection

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,733
I talked about the light from the sun hitting this pond

6
00:00:18,733 --> 00:00:22,733
or specularly reflecting off of the surface of this pond

7
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:26,889
and than reflecting off of this paddle to get to our eye

8
00:00:26,889 --> 00:00:29,304
and when I said where the light ray was passing

9
00:00:29,304 --> 00:00:36,000
in the last video, I said "it goes from the sun to this point-to this point on the surface

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,733
cause that's where we saw the reflection

11
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:40,472
and I said, "than from that point to this point of the paddle

12
00:00:40,472 --> 00:00:42,733
than to our eye that the correction here

13
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:45,558
--and someone pointed this out on the message board and it's a very good catch--

14
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:50,225
is that this point is where the light if reflecting to our eye

15
00:00:50,225 --> 00:00:52,709
so that because we see it, we see the sun there

16
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:57,267
so this light ray right here is coming directly to, directly to

17
00:00:57,267 --> 00:00:59,629
someone's eye-let me draw someone's eye right there

18
00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:02,467
or our eye, our eye coming straight out of the page

19
00:01:02,467 --> 00:01:06,400
the light that got reflected here is going to be reflected

20
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,867
a little bit more shallowly

21
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:10,960
so it came from the sun, it came from the sun

22
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,722
now obviously this won't be exact, but it came from the sun

23
00:01:14,722 --> 00:01:19,134
it probably had a slightly more shallow (uh uh) angle of incidence

24
00:01:19,134 --> 00:01:22,222
or angle between the ray and the surface

25
00:01:22,222 --> 00:01:24,200
and than it would have gotten to

26
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,214
than it would have gotten to the paddle

27
00:01:27,214 --> 00:01:31,067
than it would have gotten to the paddle, than it would get to our eye

28
00:01:31,067 --> 00:01:31,742
and I wanna make clear

29
00:01:31,742 --> 00:01:34,227
we don't see the sun at the point that it is reflected

30
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:38,133
because that light that image of the sun is going to the paddle

31
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:39,933
which than goes to our eye

32
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,800
the point where we see the sun-the reflection of the sun

33
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,467
that light's going straight into our eye

34
00:01:45,467 --> 00:01:47,467
it wouldn't have to be reflected by the paddle

35
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:51,293
so that was an interesting and good catch when you think about the double reflection

36
00:01:51,293 --> 00:01:53,638
the other thing I wanna talk about

37
00:01:53,638 --> 00:01:58,724
is when you have both specular and diffuse reflection happening at the same time

38
00:01:58,724 --> 00:02:00,200
now, we see this all over the place

39
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,400
any time you see kind of a shiny object

40
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,600
something that's not a mirror, but it's a shiny object

41
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,000
and we see that right here in the apple, just to make this clear

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,067
so you can see, this-this- white part right here, which we've all seen on a nicely waxed apple

43
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:16,208
this is, it's like a reflection of the actually light source

44
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:19,867
while everywhere else, it's just kind of the color of the apple

45
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:21,270
let's think about what's happening here

46
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:26,133
so if I were to draw the surface, if I were to draw the surface of the apple

47
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:29,333
let me draw it, let me draw it in a neutral color

48
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:32,555
so let's say we have the surface of the apple right over here

49
00:02:32,555 --> 00:02:36,000
we have the surface of the apple right over there

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,800
and than maybe I'll draw it as a slight circle, just so you can appreciate that it's a circular apple

51
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,533
so the surface of the apple right over here

52
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:46,557
you have some light source, so you have some light source

53
00:02:46,557 --> 00:02:50,551
,so if you have some light source over here

54
00:02:50,551 --> 00:02:53,639
and it's, and it's emitting light

55
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:59,067
so it is emitting light in some direction, onto the surface of the apple

56
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:00,800
and what's happening on the surface of the apple, there's

57
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,067
there's a couple of things that's happening

58
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:07,667
you're having some of this light is reflecting specularly

59
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:12,215
or, another way of thinking about it is it's maintaining the image, a little of it, but not all of it

60
00:03:12,215 --> 00:03:14,800
so let me just draw it, so if you're coming in at that incident angle

61
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,972
you're going to leave at that reflected angle

62
00:03:18,972 --> 00:03:23,476
and if you came in at this incident angle, you're going to leave at that reflected angle

63
00:03:23,476 --> 00:03:27,000
and if you came in at this incident angle, going to leave at that reflected angle

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,200
and I'm doing dotted lines to show that it's not all of the light that's getting reflected that way

65
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,267
only some of the light is getting that specular reflection

66
00:03:34,267 --> 00:03:37,000
,but if someone, if this light were to be reaching your eye

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:48,467
if, let me draw a proper face, so let's say this is someone's face right here that someone's, that's there ear, or there hair

68
00:03:48,467 --> 00:03:50,133
that's there eyebrows, that's there moustacche

69
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:52,803
and, I think you get the general idea

70
00:03:52,803 --> 00:03:57,215
so this person will see a reasonably good version of the light source

71
00:03:57,215 --> 00:04:00,071
which we see right over here, but what's going on the rest of the apple

72
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:03,670
or even over here, so some of the light is reflecting specularly

73
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,400
it's kind of maintaining the image of the light source

74
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,269
although that's getting distorted a little bit

75
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:10,636
but the rest of the light, the rest of the light

76
00:04:10,636 --> 00:04:14,800
and let me be clear here- the rest of-some of it is being absorbed

77
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,067
some of it is being absorbed by the actual surface of the apple

78
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:23,000
but the rest of it reflecting red light, what we see is actually what the light, apple does not absorb

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,215
what the apple is reflecting, but that red light that mainly red

80
00:04:27,215 --> 00:04:28,887
I mean it's a bunch of different shades over here

81
00:04:28,887 --> 00:04:35,933
is reflecting diffusely, so that pure light comes in here, some of the pure light get reflected specularly

82
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:41,635
or kind of purely maintaining the image, but some of it, because the surface of the apple isn't smooth

83
00:04:41,635 --> 00:04:47,138
is going in all sorts of directions, so of it's going like that, some of it's going like that

84
00:04:47,138 --> 00:04:50,600
some of it's going like that, and that's happening at every

85
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,267
at every point on the apple, so that light source

86
00:04:53,267 --> 00:04:57,889
let me draw more of the light source, so rays coming in, and rays coming in from our light source

87
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:01,976
but every point of the apple is also having this diffuse reflection

88
00:05:01,976 --> 00:05:08,400
which is reflecting only the red part of the spectrum, it's absorbing all of the other parts of the spectrum

89
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,307
and, so what you see is, that point where you're getting the pure specular

90
00:05:13,307 --> 00:05:16,627
the pure specular reflections, that's the point that looks shiny

91
00:05:16,627 --> 00:05:18,601
where you can kind of see the light source

92
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:26,733
and from every other point on the apple, where only this guy right here's only getting the diffuse red light

93
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:33,090
and that's why, if you move the apple, or actually even better, if you move where you're looking at the apple

94
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,667
that, point of reflection's gonna look, like if I start looking at it from this direction

95
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:39,754
I'm gonna get a different point of reflection, cause I'm gonna start seeing the light

96
00:05:39,754 --> 00:05:44,166
though let's see, let's say that someone's eyeball is right, actually right over here

97
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:50,273
so that's their eyebrows, that's their eyeball, that's their nose, you get the general idea

98
00:05:50,273 --> 00:05:54,429
so let's say that this person, let's say that this person, that's their ear

99
00:05:54,429 --> 00:05:56,400
there, I don't wanna get too involved in the drawing

100
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,667
so let's say that this person is looking at this supper ginormous apple now relatively to him

101
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:03,667
he is not gonna see this white spot there

102
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:07,270
he is gonna see the white spot on the point where it looks like

103
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,800
where he's getting the right angle, where, where the rays are coming in

104
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,733
let me do it in a different color

105
00:06:11,733 --> 00:06:14,747
so let's say, let's say the light source is above us

106
00:06:14,747 --> 00:06:16,867
so the light source is coming straight down

107
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:20,333
is coming straight down to the apple and than if it's the right angle

108
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:24,933
if the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection relative to the surface of the apple

109
00:06:24,933 --> 00:06:29,200
and we can draw that out, we can draw it perpendicular to the surface of the apple

110
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,089
this is the angle of incidence, this is the angle of reflection

111
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:36,867
so those points, at that point right there he's getting a little bit

112
00:06:36,867 --> 00:06:37,804
and I should draw a dotted line

113
00:06:37,804 --> 00:06:43,200
he's getting a little bit of the, of the specular reflection, but from every other point

114
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,933
so for every other point on the apple, so over here, the specular reflection would go that way

115
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:52,133
not to his eyes, or it would go that way, not to his eyes

116
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:55,133
but from those points you also have some of the diffuse reflections

117
00:06:55,133 --> 00:06:59,467
and some of that is going to his eye in terms of red

118
00:06:59,467 --> 00:07:03,439
the red part of the frequency is getting to his eye from all of these other random directions

119
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:07,533
and that's why this guy over here, he would see this, this reflection

120
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:12,800
he would see this reflection rougly over here, and all of this other part of the apple would look red

121
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,133
and we, since we're on this side of the apple, we see the reflection point

122
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:19,600
the light is coming straight down from our light source bouncing right here

123
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,435
than coming straight out towards our eye

124
00:07:21,435 --> 00:07:25,067
coming down, and than reflecting, coming straight out towards our eye

125
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:28,800
it's also coming down on these other points, but those other points are going straight out

126
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,439
to some place where our eye isn't, instead we're just seeing, we're just seeing the diffuse part

127
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:35,533
that is actually coming to our eye

128
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:39,933
anyway, hopefully you found that a little bit more, um, filled in a couple of the gaps of the last video
