1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,640
   

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,290
We learned in the last video
that if I have some matrix--

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:10,490
let's call it C, Let's say
it's an n by k matrix.

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,790
And all of matrix C's columns--
let's say this is

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:19,500
column 1, column 2, all the way
through column k-- if each

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,955
of these columns vectors form
an orthonormal set-- so, let

7
00:00:23,955 --> 00:00:28,850
me write this-- columns are
orthonormal set, or the set of

8
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:34,210
columns are an orthonormal set,
we showed in the last

9
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:40,040
video that if I multiply C
transpose times C, I get the

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,090
identity matrix.

11
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,440
I get the k by k identity
matrix.

12
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,870
I get the identity matrix of k,
because it's going to be k

13
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,250
by n, times n by k.

14
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,920
And we saw how everything else
cancels out, except right

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,380
along the diagonal.

16
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,840
And then we were just
multiplying the vectors times

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,040
themselves, and they're
all unit vectors.

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,680
So you get the square of their
lengths and you get 1's down

19
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,150
the diagonal.

20
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,830
We saw that in the last video.

21
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:06,840
Now what happens if
k is equal to n?

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,980
So what happens if
k is equal to n?

23
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,345
Well, then this guy is going
to be a square matrix.

24
00:01:12,345 --> 00:01:17,635
   

25
00:01:17,635 --> 00:01:19,950
And if he's a square matrix,
what else do we know about it?

26
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,470
Well, we know that these guys
form an orthonormal set.

27
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,750
We saw, I think it was two or
three videos ago, that that

28
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,910
means that the columns are
linearly independent.

29
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:32,420
So we also know that we have
linearly independent columns.

30
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,880
And we've seen this many,
many times before.

31
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,370
If we have a square matrix
with linearly independent

32
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,000
columns, it means that
C is invertible.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,030
   

34
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,450
It also means, if we have n of
these, it also means that

35
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,570
these columns, or these column
vectors, if they were in a

36
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,650
set, then that set would
be a basis for Rn.

37
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,590
So I'll just write that on the
side, just because it, you

38
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:02,950
know, it also would mean that,
you know, c1, c2, all the way

39
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:07,210
through cn, because we're saying
n is equal to k, would

40
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:12,540
be a basis for Rn.

41
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,200
But we'll leave that on
the side for now.

42
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,950
It's just worth pointing out.

43
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,230
Now if C is invertible,
what does that mean?

44
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:22,180
That means that there's some C
inverse that exists, such that

45
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:27,840
C inverse times C is equal to
the n by n identity matrix.

46
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,210
In this case k and n are equal
to the same thing, so let's

47
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,990
just replace that n,
that k with an n.

48
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,350
Now these two statements
look very similar.

49
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,850
If the columns are an
orthonormal set, and it's an n

50
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,940
by n matrix, then we learned
in the last video that C

51
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,700
transpose times C is equal to
the n by n identity matrix.

52
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,350
And we also know, since it's a
square matrix with linearly

53
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,050
independent columns, that
C is invertible.

54
00:02:53,050 --> 00:03:01,140
So, in this situation where you
have n by n matrix whose

55
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:16,260
columns form an orthonormal
set, then, well, C inverse

56
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,290
must be equal to C transpose.

57
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:21,275
I mean, you can just say, look,
something times C is

58
00:03:21,275 --> 00:03:21,920
equal to the identity matrix.

59
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,380
Something times C is the
identity matrix.

60
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,190
These somethings must
be the same thing.

61
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:30,800
Then C inverse is equal
to C transpose.

62
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,910
And that is a huge time saver.

63
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,230
If we can assume that these,
this is a square matrix with

64
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,510
an orthonormal set.

65
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,130
Because finding an inverse
of a matrix is painful,

66
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,870
especially if you get,
you know, beyond, you

67
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,100
know, n equals 3.

68
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,280
If you have to find the inverse
of a, I don't know, 10

69
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,130
by 10 matrix, that would
take you forever.

70
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,120
But to find the transpose of a
10 by 10 matrix, a lot easier.

71
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,920
You just swap the rows
and the columns.

72
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,960
So let's see if we can apply
this newly found insight to

73
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,130
simplify some problems that
we've tackled in the past.

74
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:10,790
So I have up here some
vectors, v1, v2, v3.

75
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,740
And let's say that we-- let me
copy and paste these so I can

76
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,205
use them below, because
I think that

77
00:04:15,205 --> 00:04:17,839
might be more useful.

78
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,440
Let me copy them and then let
me paste them and put them

79
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,690
right down here.

80
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,610
   

81
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,100
We have these vectors here.

82
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,900
I'll leave it for you to verify
that they all are unit

83
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,570
vectors, and that taken
together they form an

84
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,590
orthonormal set, or that
they would be an

85
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,410
orthonormal basis for R3.

86
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,260
And however you want to view it,
you could verify that on

87
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,050
your own time.

88
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,730
But what I want to do in this
video is construct an

89
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,470
interesting linear
transformation in R3.

90
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:49,560
So let's say I have the plane
formed by v1 and v2.

91
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,300
v1 and v2 are going to
be orthogonal to

92
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:51,970
each other as well.

93
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,830
This is an orthonormal set.

94
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:58,850
So v1 and v2 are orthogonal.

95
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,380
Let's say that this is v1-- and
I'm not drawing what they

96
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:01,960
actually are.

97
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,320
I'm just kind of doing a
abstract visual representation

98
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,150
of it. v1, v2, they're going
to span some plane.

99
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,090
So let me draw the plane
as best as I can.

100
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,650
So if you take all of the linear
combinations of v1 and

101
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,320
v2, it's going to be
a plane in R3.

102
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,260
So that's my plane, and we
know it goes off in every

103
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,500
direction infinitely.

104
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,900
But this is what
it looks like.

105
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,230
We're going to have the
0 vector in it.

106
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:33,125
And let me just call my plane,
this plane, let me call it,

107
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:37,020
it's going to be some subspace V
in R3, which is equal to the

108
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,590
span of v1 and v2.

109
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,220
Now v3 is orthogonal to
both of these guys.

110
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,160
So let me just draw
v3 here for fun.

111
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,870
So maybe v3 looks something
like this.

112
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,090
It's orthogonal to both of these
vectors, so it's going

113
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,350
to be orthogonal to
all of the linear

114
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,960
combinations of these guys.

115
00:05:53,960 --> 00:06:00,430
So if you view that the plane is
V, then the line spanned by

116
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:03,970
v3, if you imagine it that way,
would be the orthogonal

117
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,110
complement of your plane.

118
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:10,650
But let me just draw v3 here.
v3 would be a member of the

119
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,895
orthogonal complement, or the
orthogonal complement would be

120
00:06:12,895 --> 00:06:14,170
the line spanned by v3.

121
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,090
That's all a little
bit of review.

122
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,380
Now let's talk about the linear
transformation that I

123
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,540
want to construct
in this video.

124
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,540
I want to construct a linear
transformation in R3--

125
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,520
remember, we're dealing with
R3 right here-- that

126
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,395
essentially reflects any
vector over this plane.

127
00:06:31,395 --> 00:06:35,050
So let me draw some indicative
examples.

128
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,653
And I hope we can visualize
this well.

129
00:06:36,653 --> 00:06:39,220
So let's say I have a vector
that looks like that.

130
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,070
So let's call that vector x.

131
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,130
And let's say, you know,
let's say it looks

132
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:43,820
something like this.

133
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,710
It's above the plane.

134
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,490
It kind of jumps out.

135
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,400
It's not in my subspace.

136
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,000
But I want the transformation
of x to be the mirror image

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,610
below this.

138
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,150
So, you know, if you imagine
that this plane is somewhat

139
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,210
transluscent, it would
be down here.

140
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,000
My vector x would look
something like this.

141
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,030
This would be the transformation
of x that I

142
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,300
want to generate.

143
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,990
If I have a vector-- let me pick
a color that I haven't

144
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,770
used before-- if I have a vector
that looks like this.

145
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,400
   

146
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,700
Then its transformation is going
to go below the plane

147
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,740
and just be the mirror image.

148
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,060
This is going to be the mirror
image, just like that.

149
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,340
You get the idea.

150
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,860
Now, what would be, just to
understand our transformation

151
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,870
a little bit better,
what would be the

152
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,630
transformation of v1?

153
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,550
Well v1 is in the plane,
so its mirror image

154
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,340
isn't going to change.

155
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,920
So the transformation of v1
is just going to be v1.

156
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,270
What's the transformation
of v2?

157
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,390
Well that's also in the plane.

158
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:38,215
So the transformation of v2
is just going to be v2.

159
00:07:38,215 --> 00:07:40,100
And what's the transformation
of v3?

160
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,020
   

161
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,110
Well v3 is directly orthogonal
to the plane.

162
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,020
It kind of just pops straight
up out of the plane.

163
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,952
So if you want to get its
mirror image, you would

164
00:07:49,952 --> 00:07:53,270
literally take the
negative of v3.

165
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,845
It would be the negative
of v3.

166
00:07:54,845 --> 00:07:56,050
And I do it straight up.

167
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,190
We don't know necessarily
whether-- v3 clearly does not

168
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:58,790
go straight up.

169
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,160
I just drew it, you know this
plane, I just drew it relative

170
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,710
to this plane.

171
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,650
This plane might be more tilted
than I've drawn it.

172
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,990
But anyway, so the
transformation of v3 will be

173
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,400
equal to minus v3.

174
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,130
Now this seems like
a fairly tough

175
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,600
transformation to construct.

176
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,200
You know, we could try to apply
the transformation to

177
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,230
our standard basis vectors in
R3 like we've done in the

178
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:21,100
past. But that seems really
complicated, a lot of

179
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:21,590
trigonometry.

180
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:24,240
We would have to figure out the
inclination of this plane,

181
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,250
and what we're doing to it.

182
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,070
It would just be hard
to visualize.

183
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,150
So you probably have a sense
that maybe this transformation

184
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,210
will be much easier
to describe if

185
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,460
we change our basis.

186
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:40,330
   

187
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:43,460
Let's say this is our
standard basis.

188
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,680
And our standard basis, our
transformation, we would

189
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,660
multiply it times some matrix
x-- sorry, by some matrix A--

190
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,260
to get your transformation
of x.

191
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,480
Now, we're saying that this is
hard to find, because it's

192
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,560
hard to figure out what the
transformation is when you

193
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,350
apply to just your standard
basis vectors.

194
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:04,900
So what I'm going to do is try
to construct some basis, so

195
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:11,080
that when I represent x in that
new basis, if I multiply

196
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,440
x times the inverse of our
change of basis matrix, then

197
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,840
I'm going to get x in the
new basis coordinates.

198
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,360
And maybe it'll be easier to
find the D in this new basis,

199
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,980
and then we'll get the B
representation of the

200
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,950
transformation of x.

201
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:34,900
And then we can multiply
that times C.

202
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,310
So if we're able to figure out
D, what we can do is, look, we

203
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:45,150
know that the transformation
of x is going to be

204
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,710
able to A times x.

205
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:50,690
We saw that a long time ago,
that any linear transformation

206
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,330
could be represented as a
matrix vector product.

207
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,450
But let's say that this
is hard to find.

208
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,430
This is hard.

209
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,120
Then we can go the other
way around this.

210
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:06,160
We could say that the
transformation of x is equal

211
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,720
to you take x, first you
multiply it by C inverse to

212
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,780
get the B version of x.

213
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,990
So first you multiply
it by C inverse.

214
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,660
Then you multiply it by D, to
get the B version of the

215
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,360
transformation of x.

216
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,320
So then you multiply it by D.

217
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,390
And then you multiply that by
C to go back to our standard

218
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,780
basis for the transformation.

219
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,630
So then you go multiply
it by C.

220
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,430
And we've seen this
formula before.

221
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,910
So if we can find a nice basis
where D is easy to figure out,

222
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:37,700
then we can multiply it this
way, times the change in basis

223
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,920
matrix and its inverse,
and we'll get our A.

224
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,510
Because this thing has to be the
same thing as that thing

225
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,320
right there.

226
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:53,510
And even more, if we pick an
orthonormal basis, if B is an

227
00:10:53,510 --> 00:11:05,350
orthonormal basis, with three
vectors, right, then C will be

228
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,090
invertible.

229
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,635
Well, we already know if it's an
orthonormal basis, we know

230
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:16,710
that C transpose C is equal
to the identity matrix.

231
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:21,060
And we also know that C is
invertible, if, you know, C is

232
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,220
essentially a 3 by 3 matrix.

233
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,940
C inverse exists.

234
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,870
And in the beginning of this
video, we said, well that

235
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,210
means that C transpose is
going to be equal to C

236
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,940
Inverse, because this is
just acting like an

237
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,180
inverse right there.

238
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:37,950
And then, if C is an n by n
matrix, or in this case we're

239
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,810
dealing with a 3 by 3 matrix,
we're dealing with R3, then it

240
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:47,580
simplifies to A will be equal
to C times D, times the C

241
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:51,170
transpose, which is much easier
to find, much easier to

242
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,920
find than trying to invert
a 3 by 3 matrix.

243
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,560
So let's see if we can
do this effectively.

244
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,290
So what would be a good basis?

245
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,810
Well I think maybe a natural
one would be to use v1, v2,

246
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,910
and v3, because these basis
vectors, it's very easy to

247
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:07,040
figure out what their
transformations are.

248
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,670
So let's write that down.

249
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:14,570
So I'm going to make my basis
that I'm going to change to is

250
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:20,460
going to be v1, v2, and v3.

251
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:25,340
So just to make sure we
understand what we're doing,

252
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,080
each of these vectors,
what do they look

253
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,930
like in my new basis?

254
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:35,690
Well v1 is equal to 1 times
v1, plus 0 times v2,

255
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,720
plus 0 times v3.

256
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:45,840
So v1, in my new basis, where v1
is the first basis vector,

257
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,880
is just going to be
equal to 1, 0, 0.

258
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,750
Same argument.

259
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,090
v2, what is it going to be
equal to in my new basis?

260
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,180
I don't even have to, I think
you get the idea.

261
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,770
Let me just write
it over here.

262
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:04,220
v2 in my new basis is just
going to be 0 times v1--

263
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,770
remember, these numbers, these
coordinates are just the

264
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,240
coefficients on my basis
vectors-- it's going to be 0

265
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:16,210
times v1, plus 1 times
v2, plus 0, times v3.

266
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:24,690
And then finally, v3 in my new
basis is just going to be 0

267
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:30,080
times v1, plus 0 times v2,
plus 1 times v3, This is

268
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,840
almost trivially easy.

269
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,030
Now, what is my change of basis
matrix going to be?

270
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,700
Well I'm going to have, well,
I'll save that for later.

271
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,710
But my change of basis matrix
is just going to be a matrix

272
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,790
with these guys as
the columns.

273
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,180
And of course its inverse
is going to be the

274
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,170
transpose of that.

275
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,800
But we'll save that
for a little bit.

276
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,845
Now, how can we figure out D?

277
00:13:49,845 --> 00:13:52,920
   

278
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,840
Let's write D.

279
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,200
D is going to have
three columns.

280
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,760
So d1, d2, d3.

281
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,675
It's still a mapping from a
three-dimensional, I guess we

282
00:14:05,675 --> 00:14:07,690
could call it a
three-dimensional matrix

283
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,730
vector to a three-dimensional
vector.

284
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:12,410
Each of these are
members of R3.

285
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:19,420
So what is the transformation
of v1 represented in B

286
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,580
coordinates?

287
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:27,990
That's going to be equal to D
times the representation of v1

288
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:36,950
in B coordinates, which is equal
to d1, d2, d3 times this

289
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:37,460
guy, right?

290
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,110
This is the representation
of v1 in B coordinates.

291
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,140
So times 1, 0, 0.

292
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,930
Well that just equals d1.

293
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,120
We've seen this in the past.
So if we want to figure out

294
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,880
what d1 is, it's just the
transformation of v1 in B

295
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,070
coordinates.

296
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,680
Now we could use that exact same
argument-- let me shift

297
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,900
to the left a little bit more.

298
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,770
I was running out of
space on the right.

299
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:04,860
So the transformation of v2 in
B coordinates is equal to D,

300
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:13,680
which is d1, d2, d3 times the
B version of v2, or v2

301
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,550
represented in B coordinates.

302
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:20,370
So that is v2 represented in
B coordinates is 0, 1, 0.

303
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,690
So that's going to
be equal to d2.

304
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:26,550
And finally, let's
just complete it.

305
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:31,180
The transformation of v3,
represented in B coordinates

306
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:38,310
is going to be equal to d1, d2,
d3 times v3 represented in

307
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,280
B coordinates.

308
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,610
So times 0, 0, 1.

309
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,980
So it's going to be 0 times d1,
plus 0 times d2, plus 1

310
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,320
times d3, is equal to d3.

311
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,880
And this is kind of a re-proving
that we can find

312
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,650
the columns of D, by essentially
finding the B

313
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,910
versions of these
transformations.

314
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:00,620
So D, we can rewrite D is going
to be equal to, with the

315
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,850
first column it's just
going to be this.

316
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:08,120
So it's the transformation
of v1 in B coordinates.

317
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,470
The second column is this.

318
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,640
All right, d2 is that.

319
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:16,220
So it's the transformation
of v2 in B coordinates.

320
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:22,140
And third column is that, the
transformation of v3 in B

321
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:22,710
coordinates.

322
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,480
Just like that.

323
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,680
So let's see if we
can find these.

324
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,780
This, hopefully, shouldn't
be too difficult.

325
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,750
So we saw it up here.

326
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,650
We wrote what the transformation
of

327
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,740
v1, v2, and v3 are.

328
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,200
Now we just have to find
out what they are in B

329
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,685
coordinates.

330
00:16:35,685 --> 00:16:38,770
So let me rewrite, let me copy
and paste this down here,

331
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:43,365
because this might be
nice to look at.

332
00:16:43,365 --> 00:16:46,526
So we already found that.

333
00:16:46,526 --> 00:16:48,090
I'll paste it down here.

334
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:53,030
   

335
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,960
So we have that.

336
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,920
We've already found that.

337
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,780
So we just have to find
the B coordinate

338
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,640
representation of them.

339
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:03,290
So the B coordinate
representation of the

340
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:08,849
transformation of v1-- actually,
I think we, well

341
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:09,940
I'll write it out.

342
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,359
This becomes a little
bit tedious.

343
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,880
That's equivalent to the B
coordinate representation of

344
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:20,369
v1, which is just 1, 0, 0.

345
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:21,300
So let me write D here.

346
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:25,700
D is equal to, the first
column is 1, 0, 0.

347
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,369
Now what the second column?

348
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:33,270
Well the transformation of v2,
B representation is going to

349
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:40,520
be just v2's B representation,
or B coordinates, which is

350
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:50,060
equal to 0, 1, 0 zero, 0,
1, 0, and then one left.

351
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,130
This one's a little
interesting one.

352
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,730
The B representation of the
transformation of v3-- and

353
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:58,540
remember, v3 was the one that's
not in the plane-- that

354
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,410
is equal to-- remember, the
transformation is minus v3.

355
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,530
Flip that, because we're taking
the mirror image with

356
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,010
respect to that plane.

357
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:08,080
So it would be the B
representation of minus v3.

358
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,590
   

359
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:16,100
Well minus v3 is just 0 times
v1, plus 0 times v2,

360
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,510
minus 1 times v3.

361
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,705
Those are out basis vectors, so
our third column is going

362
00:18:20,705 --> 00:18:24,440
to be 0, 0, minus 1.

363
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,830
So we figured out our
D transformation.

364
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,810
That was pretty straightforward.

365
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:32,270
D right here is this matrix
that we just figured out.

366
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:38,000
So to figure out A, we can apply
this formula right there

367
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,080
with our change of
basis matrix.

368
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,690
Actually let me copy
all that stuff.

369
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,540
This'll be useful.

370
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,820
just let me copy all of this.

371
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:49,630
   

372
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:53,730
Copy, then we paste it down
here, now that we have our D.

373
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:56,750
   

374
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,380
All right, we have all
of this stuff here.

375
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,860
And so let's figure
out what A.

376
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,570
Is So to do that, first
we have to figure out

377
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,620
our change of basis.

378
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,510
So I'll just write it
all out like this.

379
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:11,690
Let me clear this out a little
bit, clean things up.

380
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,000
All I need is this.

381
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,870
I don't need any
of this really.

382
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,750
So let me clean all
of that up.

383
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:26,010
   

384
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,890
So let's figure out what A is.

385
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:32,230
A is equal to our change
of basis matrix.

386
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,680
Well our change of basis matrix
is just the matrix with

387
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,740
these guys as the columns.

388
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,800
Well let me just take
out the 1/3.

389
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:54,430
So C is 1/3, times 2 minus 2,
1, 2, 1 minus 2, and then we

390
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,935
have 1, 2, 2, right?

391
00:19:56,935 --> 00:20:00,680
   

392
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,480
That right there is A, and then
we're going to multiply

393
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,040
that times-- or this right here
is our change of basis

394
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,320
matrix, that is C-- and we're
going to multiply that times

395
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:17,210
D, which is 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0,
and then 0, 0, minus 1.

396
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,740
So it almost looks like the
identity matrix, but we

397
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,780
flipped our third vector,
and that's why we

398
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,120
got a minus 1 there.

399
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,000
And then we have C inverse,
but because C was a square

400
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,715
matrix with orthonormal columns,
we know that C

401
00:20:30,715 --> 00:20:32,935
inverse is the same thing
is C transpose.

402
00:20:32,935 --> 00:20:34,990
So let me write that here.

403
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,590
So let me write this here.

404
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,860
So it's just going to be the
transpose of this thing.

405
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:43,370
So I'll write another 1/3 out
here, just to simplify things.

406
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:46,800
So times 1/3, times the
transpose of this character,

407
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,810
so we have 2, 2, 1, so we're
going to have 2, 2, 1.

408
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:54,870
We have minus 2, 1, 2, so
we have minus 2, 1, 2.

409
00:20:54,870 --> 00:21:00,680
We have 1 minus 2, 2, so we
have 1 minus 2 and 2.

410
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,320
And this right here, this is C
inverse, which is equal to C

411
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,750
transpose, because C is an
invertible matrix, or a square

412
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,960
matrix, with orthonormal
columns.

413
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,380
So what's this going
to be equal to?

414
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,245
Well let's just take, I don't
know, first let's just take--

415
00:21:16,245 --> 00:21:18,850
let me write this, this was D--
so let's just take this

416
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,860
product first. We'll worry
about the 1/3's later.

417
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,270
And now I can erase this.

418
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:26,670
I can use this real estate.

419
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:29,762
Let me erase that.

420
00:21:29,762 --> 00:21:31,980
So let me turn my pen
tool back on.

421
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,360
All right.

422
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,710
So let's take this product
right there.

423
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,620
So A is equal to, let's take
the 1/3's, it's going to be

424
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:44,140
equal to 1/9 times-- now
this is going to be

425
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,720
another 3 by 3 matrix.

426
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,540
So, we're going to have
2, 2, 1, times 1, 0 0.

427
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:55,420
Or we're going to dot 2,
2, 1 with 1, 0, 0.

428
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,530
So the only term that's going
to be non-zero is

429
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,070
the 2 times the 1.

430
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,440
So that's going to be 2.

431
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,740
Then we're going to dot 2, 2, 1
with 0, 1, 0, right, for the

432
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,030
second column.

433
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,490
The only non-zero term
is going to be the

434
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:09,590
2, the middle 2.

435
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:13,470
Then you get 2, 2, 1
dot 0, 0, minus 1.

436
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,080
So that's going to be, the only
non-zero term is this

437
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,730
last one which is going
to be negated, so it's

438
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:20,340
going to be minus 1.

439
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,770
This isn't too bad.

440
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:25,440
I simplified it, but this is
almost the identity matrix.

441
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,070
Then we have this guy.

442
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:31,360
We have minus 2, 1, 2 dotted
this guy, only this guy kind

443
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,500
of survived that dot product,
minus 2, then you take this

444
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,070
guy dot this guy, only
this guy survives.

445
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,000
And then you take this
guy dot that guy.

446
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,995
This guy gets negative.

447
00:22:40,995 --> 00:22:42,530
And he's the only survivor.

448
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,050
I think you see what's
happening.

449
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,180
These rows stay the same,
but the third

450
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,560
term becomes negative.

451
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,680
Let's do it again.

452
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,210
So you take this guy.

453
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,680
You take the dot product of this
column, this row vector

454
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,390
with this column vector.

455
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,680
Only this guy survives.

456
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,640
Then this row with this column,
you have the minus 2.

457
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,880
And then this row with that
column, only the 2 survives,

458
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,440
but it's times minus 1, so
it becomes a minus 2.

459
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,030
And then we have this
vector out here.

460
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,920
Remember, we took 1/3's,
we multiplied

461
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,270
them and we got 1/9.

462
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:21,140
And then we have 2 minus
2, 1, 2, 1, minus 2,

463
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,380
and then 1, 2, 2.

464
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:26,270
And this'll be a little bit more
painful to multiply, but

465
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,550
I think we can pull it off.

466
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,190
Because this is the
home stretch.

467
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:32,860
So A, our transformation matrix
for that, you know,

468
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,220
strange transformation where
we're reflecting over the

469
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,770
plane in R3 is going to be
equal to 1/9 times-- it's

470
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:41,900
going to be a 3 by 3 matrix.

471
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:46,310
So it's going to be 2
times 2, which is 4.

472
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,370
Let me write this down.

473
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:48,640
Oh, that's going to
be too onerous.

474
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,390
So 2 times 2, which is 4, plus
2 times 2, which is 4, and

475
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,450
then plus minus 1, right?

476
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:02,040
So it's going to be 4 plus
4, minus 1, which is 7.

477
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,440
4 plus 4 minus 1 is 7.

478
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,090
So we're going to multiply this
guy times this column.

479
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:14,320
So 2 times minus 2, is minus
4, plus 2, is minus 2.

480
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,550
Minus 2 is minus 4.

481
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:22,150
Then we're going to have 2 times
1 is 2, minus 4, which

482
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:26,360
is minus 2, and then minus
2, which is minus 4.

483
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,020
   

484
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,740
Not so painful.

485
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:35,560
OK, now in the second row, we're
going to have minus 2

486
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:40,750
times minus 2, is minus 4,
plus 2, which is minus 2,

487
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:46,280
minus 2, which is minus 4.

488
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,870
Then we're going to have minus
2 times minus 2, which is 4,

489
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:52,500
plus 1, which is 5, minus 4.

490
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,350
Let me make sure I
got that right.

491
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:58,290
We're going to have minus 2
times minus 2, which is

492
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:09,070
positive 4, plus 1, times 1,
which is minus 3, plus minus 2

493
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:15,610
times minus 2, which is
which is minus 4.

494
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:19,930
And so we are going to get-- and
I'm confusing myself-- I'm

495
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:22,500
going to get-- oh no,
this thing is

496
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,670
going to get very confusing.

497
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:24,370
It's straightforward.

498
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:30,260
Minus 2 times minus 2 is 4,
plus 1 is 5, minus 4 is 1.

499
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:34,410
   

500
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:42,380
And then we get minus 2 minus 2,
which is minus 4, minus 4,

501
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:45,380
which is minus 8.

502
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,360
Home stretch.

503
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,330
This is the painful part.

504
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:54,290
OK, then you have 2 minus 4,
which is minus 2, minus 2,

505
00:25:54,290 --> 00:26:01,430
which is minus 4, minus 4-- all
right, now-- minus 2 minus

506
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:05,300
2, minus 4, and that's
minus 8.

507
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:12,205
And then finally you have 1 plus
4, minus 4, which is 1.

508
00:26:12,205 --> 00:26:14,990
And if I haven't made any
careless mistakes, we're done.

509
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,380
We now know that our
transformation that reflects--

510
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:21,320
now that did all this fancy
stuff-- our transformation

511
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,100
that reflects across this plane
that's spanned by these

512
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:29,060
characters right there, it can
be represented by this matrix.

513
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:32,730
So our transformation, applied
to x in standard coordinates,

514
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:35,635
is just equal to A times
x, where A is

515
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:36,510
equal to this matrix.

516
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,480
We can multiply the 1/9 out,
but that will just make it

517
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,100
look more confusing.

518
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,760
But this would've been really
hard to figure out on our own,

519
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,430
to figure out that we had to
put a 7 and a minus 4 or to

520
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:48,570
even apply the transformation to
the standard basis vectors,

521
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,580
which you normally do to
figure out this matrix.

522
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,970
Instead, we changed our basis
to kind of a very natural

523
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:55,390
orthonormal basis.

524
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,940
And the fact that it was
orthonormal made it very easy

525
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:01,340
to find the inverse of our
change-of-basis matrix.

526
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,670
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.

527
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:03,933
