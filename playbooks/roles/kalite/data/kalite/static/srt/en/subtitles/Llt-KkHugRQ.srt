00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,112
Welcome to the presentation on ordering numbers.

2
00:00:04,143 --> 00:00:05,930
Lets get started with some problems that I think,

3
00:00:05,945 --> 00:00:08,240
as you go through the examples hopefully,

4
00:00:08,286 --> 00:00:10,171
you'll understand how to do these problems.

5
00:00:10,217 --> 00:00:11,656
So let's see.

6
00:00:11,686 --> 00:00:14,174
The first set of numbers that we have to order

7
00:00:14,205 --> 00:00:44,141
is 35.7%,108.1%, 0.5, 13/93, and 1 and 7/68

8
00:00:44,187 --> 00:00:45,723
So let's do this problem.

9
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:48,272
The important thing to remember whenever you're

10
00:00:48,272 --> 00:00:52,033
doing this type of ordering of numbers is to realize

11
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:54,990
that these are all just different ways to represent

12
00:00:55,051 --> 00:00:58,736
these are all a precent or a decimal or a fraction or

13
00:00:58,751 --> 00:01:02,076
a mixed number--are all just different 
ways of representing numbers.

14
00:01:02,122 --> 00:01:04,872
It's very hard to compare when 
you just look at it like this,

15
00:01:04,902 --> 00:01:07,472
so what I like to do is I like to 
convert them all to decimals.

16
00:01:07,489 --> 00:01:11,668
But, you know,there could be someone who 
likes to convert them all to percentages

17
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,945
or convert them all to fractions and then compare.

18
00:01:14,014 --> 00:01:16,597
But I always find decimals to be 
the easiest way to compare.

19
00:01:16,597 --> 00:01:19,297
So let's start with this 35.7%.

20
00:01:19,297 --> 00:01:21,527
Let's turn this into a decimal.

21
00:01:21,588 --> 00:01:25,436
Well, the easiest thing to remember is
if you have a percent

22
00:01:25,436 --> 00:01:28,648
you just get rid of the precent sign 
and put it over 100.

23
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:37,556
So 35.7% is the same thing as 35.7/100.

24
00:01:37,587 --> 00:01:41,466
Like 5%, that's the same thing as 5/100

25
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:44,684
or 50% is just the same thing as 50/100.

26
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:53,509
So 35.7/100, well, that just equals 0.357.

27
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:54,891
If this got you a little confused

28
00:01:54,968 --> 00:01:59,155
another way to think about percentage points is 
if I write 35.7%,

29
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:03,024
all you have to do is get rid of the percent sign

30
00:02:03,076 --> 00:02:07,269
and move the decimal to the left two spaces

31
00:02:07,315 --> 00:02:09,616
and it becomes 0.357

32
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:11,839
Let me give you a couple of 
more examples down here.

33
00:02:11,877 --> 00:02:14,344
Let's say I had 5%.

34
00:02:14,405 --> 00:02:19,619
That is the same thing as 5/100.

35
00:02:19,665 --> 00:02:22,406
Or if you do the decimal technique, 5%,

36
00:02:22,429 --> 00:02:24,506
you could just move the decimal 
and you get rid of the percent.

37
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:28,598
And you move the decimal over 1 and 2, 
and you put a 0 here.

38
00:02:28,652 --> 00:02:29,921
It's 0.05.

39
00:02:29,968 --> 00:02:32,370
And that's the same thing as 0.05.

40
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,153
You also know that 0.05 and
5/100 are the same thing.

41
00:02:36,171 --> 00:02:37,717
So let's get back to the problem.

42
00:02:37,763 --> 00:02:40,587
I hope that distraction didn't distract you too much.

43
00:02:40,614 --> 00:02:42,514
Scratch out all this.

44
00:02:42,545 --> 00:02:47,674
So 35.7% is equal to 0.357.

45
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:51,766
Similarly, 108.1%.

46
00:02:51,794 --> 00:02:53,741
Let's to the technique where 
we just get rid of the percent

47
00:02:53,767 --> 00:02:59,139
and move the decimal space over 
1,2 spaces to the left.

48
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:05,975
So then that equals 1.081.

49
00:03:05,975 --> 00:03:10,999
See we already know that this is samller than this.

50
00:03:11,034 --> 00:03:13,963
Well the next one is easy,
it's already in decimal form.

51
00:03:14,025 --> 00:03:16,372
0.5 is just going to be equal to 0.5.

52
00:03:16,402 --> 00:03:20,942
Now 13/93.

53
00:03:20,996 --> 00:03:23,713
To convert a fraction into a decimal

54
00:03:23,744 --> 00:03:27,155
we just take the denominator 
and divide it into the numerator.

55
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:28,335
So let's do that.

56
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:33,523
93 goes into 13?

57
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:39,390
Well, we know it goes into 13 zero times. Right?

58
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:42,084
So let's add a decimal point here.

59
00:03:42,104 --> 00:03:47,181
So how many times does 93 go into 130?

60
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,838
Well, it goes into it one time.

61
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:52,069
1 times 93 is 93.

62
00:03:52,108 --> 00:03:56,044
Becomes a 10.

63
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,449
That becomes a 2.

64
00:03:58,478 --> 00:04:02,060
Then we're going to borrow, we get 37.

65
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,074
Bring down a 0.

66
00:04:05,088 --> 00:04:09,509
So 93 goes into 370?

67
00:04:09,518 --> 00:04:10,649
Let's see

68
00:04:10,664 --> 00:04:14,722
4 times 93 would be 372, so it actually goes into

69
00:04:14,738 --> 00:04:15,882
it only three times.

70
00:04:15,882 --> 00:04:21,779
3 times 3 is 9.

71
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,677
3 times 9 is 27.

72
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:30,818
So this equals?

73
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:37,427
Let's see, this equals--if we say
that this 0 becomes a 10.

74
00:04:37,446 --> 00:04:39,438
This become a 16.

75
00:04:39,469 --> 00:04:41,246
This becomes a 2.

76
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:44,093
81.

77
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,803
And then we say, how many times
does 93 go into 810?

78
00:04:47,803 --> 00:04:49,749
It goes roughly 8 times.

79
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:51,897
And we could actually keep going,

80
00:04:51,942 --> 00:04:53,966
but for the sake of comparing these numbers,

81
00:04:53,966 --> 00:04:57,512
we've already gotten to a 
pretty good level of accuracy.

82
00:04:57,558 --> 00:04:59,998
So let's just stop this problem here

83
00:04:59,998 --> 00:05:01,490
because the decimal numbers could keep going on,

84
00:05:01,536 --> 00:05:02,790
but for the sake of comparison

85
00:05:02,821 --> 00:05:04,998
I think we've already got a good 
sense of what this decimal looks like.

86
00:05:04,999 --> 00:05:09,599
It's 0.138 and then it'll just keep going.

87
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:11,592
So let's write that down.

88
00:05:11,592 --> 00:05:15,351
And then finally, we have this mixed number here.

89
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:16,550
And let me erase some of my work

90
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,652
because I don't want to confuse you.

91
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:21,034
Actually, let me keep it the way it is right now.

92
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:21,739
So these two ways

93
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,444
the easiest way to convert a 
mixed number into a decimal is

94
00:05:25,444 --> 00:05:29,532
to just say, OK, this is 1 and then some fraction

95
00:05:29,578 --> 00:05:32,598
that's less than 1.

96
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:36,407
Or we could convert it to a fraction, 
an improper fraction

97
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,793
like--oh, actually there are 
no improper fractions here.

98
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,626
Actually, let's do it that way.

99
00:05:39,657 --> 00:05:41,036
Let's convert to an improper fraction

100
00:05:41,036 --> 00:05:42,414
and then convert that into a decimal.

101
00:05:42,491 --> 00:05:45,791
Actually, I think I'm going to need more space,

102
00:05:45,806 --> 00:05:48,901
so let me clean up this a little bit.

103
00:05:48,956 --> 00:06:00,531
There we have a little more space to work with now.

104
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:08,289
So 1 and 7/68.

105
00:06:08,366 --> 00:06:12,460
So to go from a mixed number to
an improper fraction,

106
00:06:12,483 --> 00:06:16,840
what you do is you take the 68 times 1

107
00:06:16,863 --> 00:06:19,628
and add it to the numerator here.

108
00:06:19,677 --> 00:06:20,813
And why does this make sense?

109
00:06:20,874 --> 00:06:26,236
Because this is the same thing as 1 plus 7/68. Right?

110
00:06:26,282 --> 00:06:28,977
1 and 7/68 is the same thing as 1 plus 7/68.

111
00:06:29,007 --> 00:06:31,542
And that's the same thing as you know

112
00:06:31,544 --> 00:06:39,271
from the fractions module, as 68/68 plus 7/68.

113
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:47,259
And that's the same thing as 68 plus 7--75/68.

114
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:51,638
So 1 and 7/68 is equal to 75/68.

115
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:54,099
And now we convert this to a decimal

116
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:56,293
using the technique we did for 13/93.

117
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,604
So we say--let me get some space.

118
00:06:58,612 --> 00:07:04,258
We say 68 goes into 75

119
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,102
suspicion I'm going to run out of space.

120
00:07:06,117 --> 00:07:09,217
68 goes into 75 one time.

121
00:07:09,224 --> 00:07:13,078
1 times 68 is 68.

122
00:07:13,107 --> 00:07:15,683
75 minus 68 is 7.

123
00:07:15,714 --> 00:07:17,273
Bring down the 0.

124
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:19,540
Actually, you don't have to write the decimal there.

125
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:20,920
Ignore that decimal.

126
00:07:20,944 --> 00:07:23,584
68 goes into 70 one time.

127
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,113
1 times 68 is 68.

128
00:07:26,128 --> 00:07:30,419
70 minus 68 is 2, bring down another 0.

129
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:32,941
68 goes into 20 zero times.

130
00:07:32,968 --> 00:07:35,053
And the problem's going to keep going on,

131
00:07:35,053 --> 00:07:37,347
but I think we've already once again,

132
00:07:37,363 --> 00:07:39,772
gotten to enough accuracy that we can compare.

133
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:47,363
So 1 and 7/68 we've now figured out is equal to 1.10

134
00:07:47,365 --> 00:07:51,555
and if we kept dividing we'll keep 
getting more decimals of accuracy,

135
00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:53,122
but I think we're now ready to compare.

136
00:07:53,184 --> 00:07:56,119
So all of these numbers I just 
rewrote them as decimals.

137
00:07:56,151 --> 00:08:00,066
So 35.7% is 0.357.

138
00:08:00,084 --> 00:08:04,370
108.1%--ignore this for now

139
00:08:04,408 --> 00:08:05,585
because we just used that to do the work.

140
00:08:05,616 --> 00:08:09,277
It's 108.1% is equal to 1.081.

141
00:08:09,309 --> 00:08:10,759
0.5 is 0.5.

142
00:08:10,805 --> 00:08:15,126
13/93 is 0.138.

143
00:08:15,173 --> 00:08:19,915
And 1 and 7/68 is 1.10 and it'll keep going on.

144
00:08:19,943 --> 00:08:22,565
So what's the samllest?

145
00:08:22,611 --> 00:08:25,288
So the samllest is 0.

146
00:08:25,313 --> 00:08:27,351
Actually, the smallest is right here.

147
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:31,376
So I'm going to rank them from samllest to largest.

148
00:08:31,414 --> 00:08:35,537
So the samllest is 0.138.

149
00:08:35,565 --> 00:08:39,956
Then the next largest is going to be 0.357. Right?

150
00:08:40,013 --> 00:08:42,854
Then the next largest is going to be 0.5.

151
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:46,223
Then you're going to have 1.08.

152
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:51,349
And then you're going to have 1 and 7/68.

153
00:08:51,358 --> 00:08:56,500
So hopefully, actually, I'm going to 
do more examples of this,

154
00:08:56,523 --> 00:09:00,014
but for this video I think this
is the only one I have time for.

155
00:09:00,022 --> 00:09:01,830
But hopefully this gives you a 
sense of doing these problems.

156
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,106
I always find it easier to go into 
the decimal mode to compare.

157
00:09:05,136 --> 00:09:07,515
And actually, the hints on the module 
will be the same for you.

158
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:10,789
But I think you're ready at least 
now to try the problems.

159
00:09:10,827 --> 00:09:12,409
If you're not, if you want to see other examples,

160
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,026
you might just want to either re-watch this video

161
00:09:15,049 --> 00:09:19,848
and/or I might record some more videos 
with more examples right now.

162
00:09:19,862 --> 99:59:59,999
Anyway, have fun.
