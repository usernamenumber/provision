1
00:00:00,933 --> 00:00:07,175
Let's see if we can learn a thing or two about even, even functions and odd functions.

2
00:00:07,175 --> 00:00:12,190
Even functions and on the right-hand side over here, we'll talk about odd functions.

3
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:17,972
If we have time we'll talk about functions that are neither even nor odd.

4
00:00:17,972 --> 00:00:22,036
So, before I go into kind of a formal definition of even functions,

5
00:00:22,036 --> 00:00:24,336
I just want to show you what they look like visually,

6
00:00:24,336 --> 00:00:26,600
because I think that's the easiest way to recognize them

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,036
and then it'll also make a little more sense when we talk about the formal

8
00:00:31,036 --> 00:00:31,798
definition of an even function.

9
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:36,061
So, let me draw some coordinate axes here.

10
00:00:36,061 --> 00:00:40,983
X-axis and then, -let me see if I can draw that a little straighter.

11
00:00:40,983 --> 00:00:44,698
Move this right over here, and that is my y-axis

12
00:00:44,698 --> 00:00:48,971
Or I could say y is equal to f(x) axis, just like that.

13
00:00:48,971 --> 00:00:52,965
Let me draw the graph of f(x).

14
00:00:52,965 --> 00:00:58,467
f(x) is equal to x-squared, or Y is equal to x-squared, either one.

15
00:00:58,467 --> 00:01:00,442
So let me draw the first quadrant.

16
00:01:00,442 --> 00:01:02,215
It looks like this.

17
00:01:02,215 --> 00:01:06,867
And then in the second quadrant it looks like this.

18
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:11,448
It looks like- oh let me try to draw this symmetric.

19
00:01:11,448 --> 00:01:14,625
Pretty good job.

20
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:19,533
The f(x) is equal to x squared is an even function.

21
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:23,333
And the way that you recognize it is because it has this symmetry.

22
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,052
around the Y-axis.

23
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:29,062
If you take- If you take what's going on, on the right-hand side

24
00:01:29,062 --> 00:01:33,400
to the right of the y-axis and you just reflect it over the Y-axis,

25
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,836
you get the other side of the function and that's what tells you

26
00:01:36,836 --> 00:01:38,801
it is an even function.

27
00:01:38,801 --> 00:01:41,820
And I want to show you one interesting property here.

28
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,348
If you take any x-value - let's say you take a positive x-value.

29
00:01:45,348 --> 00:01:48,135
Let's say you take the value x is equal to two.

30
00:01:48,135 --> 00:01:51,107
If you find f(2) you're going to find four.

31
00:01:51,107 --> 00:01:57,518
That's going to be four for this particular function for f(x) where two squared is

32
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:58,390
four.

33
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:02,733
And if you took the negative version of two- So if you took negative two

34
00:02:02,733 --> 00:02:06,293
If you took negative two and you evaluated the function there,

35
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:11,133
you're also- you are also goint to get four, and this,

36
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:14,298
hopefully, or maybe makes complete sense to you.

37
00:02:14,298 --> 00:02:17,775
You're like, "Well Sal, obviously if I reflect this function over

38
00:02:17,775 --> 00:02:19,807
the Y-axis, that's going to be the case."

39
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:24,126
Whatever function value I get at the positive value of number,

40
00:02:24,126 --> 00:02:26,800
I'm going to get the same function value at the negative value.

41
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,200
And this is what kind of leads us to the formal definition.

42
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,458
If a function is even, or I could say a function is even

43
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:41,448
if and only if- So it's even. And don't get confused with the term even function

44
00:02:41,448 --> 00:02:42,981
and the term even number.

45
00:02:42,981 --> 00:02:46,650
They're completely different, um, kind of ideas. So there's- there's not, at

46
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,436
least not an obvious connection, that I know of, between even functions

47
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:52,315
and even numbers or odd functions and odd numbers.

48
00:02:52,315 --> 00:03:01,321
So you're an even function if and only if, f of- f(x)

49
00:03:01,321 --> 00:03:04,067
is equal to f(-x).

50
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:06,294
And the reason why I didn't introduce this from the beginning

51
00:03:06,294 --> 00:03:08,105
is because this is really the definiton of even functions.

52
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,213
Because when you look at this you are like:

53
00:03:09,213 --> 00:03:10,675
Hey, what does this mean?

54
00:03:10,675 --> 00:03:14,049
F(x) is equal to f(-x) and all it does mean is this.

55
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:18,043
It means if I would take f(2)- f(2) is 4.

56
00:03:18,043 --> 00:03:19,808
So let me show you with the particular case.

57
00:03:19,808 --> 00:03:25,148
f(2) is equal to f(-2)- f(-2).

58
00:03:25,148 --> 00:03:32,467
And this particular case for f(x)=f(x^2) they are both equal to 4.

59
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:37,780
So really, it's just another way of saying that the function can be reflected

60
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,145
or the left side of the function is the reflection of the right side of the function

61
00:03:42,145 --> 00:03:47,068
across the vertical axis, across the y-axis.

62
00:03:47,068 --> 00:03:50,365
And just to make sure we have a decent understanding here

63
00:03:50,365 --> 00:03:52,130
let me draw a few more even functions.

64
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:56,800
And i'm going to draw some fairly wacky things

65
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,467
just so you would really kinda learn to visually recognize them.

66
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:08,836
So a function like, let's say like this.

67
00:04:08,836 --> 00:04:14,933
Maybe jumps up to here and does something like that.

68
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:17,370
And then on this side it does the same thing.

69
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,599
It's the reflection, so it jumps up here.

70
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:23,918
then it goes like this and then it goes like this.

71
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:26,519
And i'm trying to draw so they are the mirror image of eachother.

72
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:29,166
This is an even function.

73
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:32,370
You take what's going on on the right hand side of this function

74
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:37,943
and you literally just reflect it over the y-axis and you get the left hand side of the function.

75
00:04:37,943 --> 00:04:39,940
And you could see that even this holds.

76
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,612
If I take some value.

77
00:04:41,612 --> 00:04:46,441
Let's say that this value right here is... I don't know -- 3.

78
00:04:46,441 --> 00:04:53,593
Let's say that the f(3) over here is equal to, let's say that is 5.

79
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,451
So this is 5.

80
00:04:55,451 --> 00:05:02,277
We see that f(-3) is also going to be equal to 5.

81
00:05:02,277 --> 00:05:05,853
And that's what our definition of even function told us.

82
00:05:05,853 --> 00:05:09,615
I can draw, let me just draw one more to really make sure.

83
00:05:09,615 --> 00:05:12,587
I'll do the axis in that same green colour.

84
00:05:12,587 --> 00:05:16,767
Let me do one more like this.

85
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:21,921
And you could have maybe some type of trigonometric looking function.

86
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,268
That looks like this.

87
00:05:23,268 --> 00:05:26,867
That looks like that.

88
00:05:26,867 --> 00:05:30,188
And it keeps going in either direction.

89
00:05:30,188 --> 00:05:32,835
So something like this would also be even.

90
00:05:32,835 --> 00:05:36,782
So all of these are even functions. Now you are probably thinking.

91
00:05:36,782 --> 00:05:38,361
What is an odd function?

92
00:05:38,361 --> 00:05:41,101
And let me draw an odd function for you.

93
00:05:41,101 --> 00:05:44,863
So let me draw the axis once again.

94
00:05:44,863 --> 00:05:51,504
X-axis, y-axis so the f of x-axis and to show you an odd function.

95
00:05:51,504 --> 00:05:55,869
I'll give you a particular odd function, maybe the most famous of odd functions.

96
00:05:55,869 --> 00:05:58,377
This is probably the most famous of the even functions.

97
00:05:58,377 --> 00:06:04,368
And it is f(x) although there are probably other contendors for the most famous odd function.

98
00:06:04,368 --> 00:06:07,400
f(x) is equal to x^3.

99
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,200
And it looks like and you might have seen the graph of it.

100
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,516
If you haven't you can graph it by trying some points.

101
00:06:13,516 --> 00:06:15,792
It looks like that.

102
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:21,267
and the way to visually recognize an odd function is you look at what's going on

103
00:06:21,267 --> 00:06:25,262
to the right of the y-axis, once again, this is y-axis, this is the x-axis.

104
00:06:25,262 --> 00:06:27,600
You have all of this business to the right of the y-axis.

105
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,535
If you reflect it over the y-axis you would get something like this.

106
00:06:31,535 --> 00:06:35,761
You would get something like this and if the left side of this graph looked like this

107
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:37,108
we would be dealing with an even function.

108
00:06:37,108 --> 00:06:38,547
Clearly it doesn't.

109
00:06:38,547 --> 00:06:42,123
To make this an odd function we reflected once over the y-axis

110
00:06:42,123 --> 00:06:46,210
and then reflected the x-axis or another way to think about it

111
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:49,533
reflected once over the y-axis and then make it negative.

112
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:52,851
Either way it will get you there. Or you could even reflect it over the x-axis

113
00:06:52,851 --> 00:06:55,933
and then the y-axis, so you are kinda doing two reflections.

114
00:06:55,933 --> 00:07:00,374
So clearly if you take this up here and then you reflect it over the x-axis.

115
00:07:00,374 --> 00:07:04,933
You get these values, you get this part of the graph right over here.

116
00:07:04,933 --> 00:07:08,037
And if you try to do it with a particular point

117
00:07:08,037 --> 00:07:11,845
I'm doing this to kinda hint that with the definition

118
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:14,600
the formal definition of an odd function this is going to be.

119
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,933
Let's try a point, let's try 2 again.

120
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:20,761
If you had the point 2, f(2) is 8.

121
00:07:20,761 --> 00:07:24,848
So f(2) is equal to 8.

122
00:07:24,848 --> 00:07:26,520
Now what happens if we take negative 2.

123
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:34,182
If we take negative 2, f(-2), -2^3 that is just going to be -8.

124
00:07:34,182 --> 00:07:38,873
So f(-2) is equal to -8.

125
00:07:38,873 --> 00:07:41,845
And in general if we take, let me just write it over here.

126
00:07:41,845 --> 00:07:47,185
f(2) so we are just taking one particular example from this particular function.

127
00:07:47,185 --> 00:07:53,037
We have, f(2) is equal to, not f(-2).

128
00:07:53,037 --> 00:07:54,848
8 does not equal -8.

129
00:07:54,848 --> 00:07:58,378
8 is equal to negative of -8.

130
00:07:58,378 --> 00:07:59,864
So that's positive 8.

131
00:07:59,864 --> 00:08:04,043
So f(2) is equal to the negative of f(-2).

132
00:08:04,043 --> 00:08:07,702
We figured out, just I want to make it clear.

133
00:08:07,702 --> 00:08:10,600
We figured out f of 2 is 8. 2^3 is 8.

134
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,839
We know that f of -2 is -8. -2^3 is -8

135
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:20,533
So you have the negative of -8, negatives cancel out and it works out.

136
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,176
So in general, you have an odd function.

137
00:08:23,176 --> 00:08:25,127
So here is the definition.

138
00:08:25,127 --> 00:08:29,446
You are dealing with an odd function if and only if

139
00:08:29,446 --> 00:08:36,800
f of x for all the x's that are defined on that function or for which that function is defined.

140
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,454
If f(x) is equal to negative of f(-x) or you'll sometimes see it the other way

141
00:08:42,454 --> 00:08:47,667
if you multiply both sides of this equation with -1 you would get

142
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:52,201
negative of f(x) is equal to f(-x)

143
00:08:52,201 --> 00:08:54,105
and sometimes you will see when it has swapped around

144
00:08:54,105 --> 00:08:59,236
and you will say f of negative x is equal to

145
00:08:59,236 --> 00:09:03,667
Let me write that, careful.

146
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:06,559
Is equal to -f(x).

147
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,600
I just swapped these two sides.

148
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,333
So let me just draw you some more odd functions.

149
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,980
Some more odd functions.

150
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,163
So I'll do these visually.

151
00:09:17,163 --> 00:09:21,250
So, I'll just draw that a little bit cleaner.

152
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,918
So if you have a...

153
00:09:24,918 --> 00:09:29,333
maybe it looks something... maybe the function does something wacky

154
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:33,400
Maybe it does something wacky like this on the right hand side,

155
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,452
If it was even you would reflect it there, but we are going to have and odd function

156
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,333
so we are going to reflect it again.

157
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,312
So the rest of the function is going to look like this.

158
00:09:41,312 --> 00:09:43,912
So what i have drawn, the non-dotted lines

159
00:09:43,912 --> 00:09:47,488
this right here is an odd function and you could even look at the definition.

160
00:09:47,488 --> 00:09:53,667
If you'd take some value, a, and then you'd take f(a) which would put you up here.

161
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:55,336
this right here would be f(a)

162
00:09:55,336 --> 00:09:58,333
if you would take the negative value of that, if you would take -a here

163
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:01,652
-a, f(-a) is gonna be down here.

164
00:10:01,652 --> 00:10:08,082
So f(-a) is going to be equal to, it's going to be the same distance

165
00:10:08,082 --> 00:10:09,241
from the horizontal axis.

166
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,400
It's not compleatly clear the way I drew it just now.

167
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,005
So it's maybe gonna be like right over here.

168
00:10:14,005 --> 00:10:17,674
So this right over here is going to be f of negative a

169
00:10:17,674 --> 00:10:22,133
which is the same distance from the origin is of f of a, it's just the negative

170
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:24,501
It's not, I didn't compleatly draw it to scale.

171
00:10:24,501 --> 00:10:27,984
Let me draw one more of these odd functions.

172
00:10:27,984 --> 00:10:29,330
I think you might get the point.

173
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,002
I shall draw a very simple odd function,

174
00:10:31,002 --> 00:10:33,649
just to show you that it doesn't always have to be something crazy.

175
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:39,965
So a very simple odd function, would be y is equal to x.

176
00:10:39,965 --> 00:10:44,331
y=x, something like this.

177
00:10:44,331 --> 00:10:45,677
Whoops.

178
00:10:45,677 --> 00:10:49,400
Y is equal going through the origin.

179
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,000
You reflect what's on the right onto to the left, you get that

180
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,244
and you reflect it down you get all of this stuff in the third quadrant.

181
00:10:55,244 --> 00:10:57,659
So this is also an odd function.

182
00:10:57,659 --> 00:11:01,333
Now I wanna leave you with a few things that are not odd functions

183
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:04,671
and at some times might be confused to be odd functions.

184
00:11:04,671 --> 00:11:12,334
So you might have something like this where you have a... maybe have a parabola,

185
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:15,585
but it doesn't, it's not symmetric around the y-axis and your temptation might be:

186
00:11:15,585 --> 00:11:18,650
Hey, there is this symmetry for this parabola, but it's not

187
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:23,733
it's not being reflected around the y-axis, you don't have a situation here

188
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:27,659
where f of x is equal to f of negative x.

189
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:30,678
So this is not, this is neither.

190
00:11:30,678 --> 00:11:32,674
Neither odd nor even.

191
00:11:32,674 --> 00:11:35,507
Similary you might see, let's say you see a shifted,

192
00:11:35,507 --> 00:11:40,667
a shifted cubic function, so let's say you have something like this.

193
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:45,910
Let's say you have x to the third plus 1.

194
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:49,300
so f(x) is equal to x^3+1.

195
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,250
So it might look something like this.

196
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,501
And once again you will be tempted to call this an odd function,

197
00:11:54,501 --> 00:11:58,309
but because it has shifted up it is no longer an odd function.

198
00:11:58,309 --> 00:11:59,563
You could look at that visually.

199
00:11:59,563 --> 00:12:03,467
So this is f of x is equal to x^3+1.

200
00:12:03,467 --> 00:12:07,829
If you take what's on the right hand side and reflect it onto to the left hand side

201
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:11,173
you would get something like that and then if you reflect that down

202
00:12:11,173 --> 00:12:12,891
you would get something like that.

203
00:12:12,891 --> 00:12:15,678
So this is not an odd function.

204
00:12:15,678 --> 00:12:20,926
You are not... this isn't the left reflection and then the top-bottom reflection

205
00:12:20,926 --> 00:12:22,922
of what's going on on the right hand side.

206
00:12:22,922 --> 00:12:24,501
This over here actually would be.
