Hi, this is Dr. Mahadev of Stanford school of Medicine

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm here with my good friend - Salman Khan

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We're following up to our ealier discussions about

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Cervical spine injuries or neck injuries

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we're going to talk about some of the things you might do

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to manage a patient who might have a circular spine injury

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in the case that you had to do something in basic;

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
like manage their airway.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Sal: Right. When we say "manage their airway" they may have something stuck

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In their airway or blocking the airway

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Dr. Mahadev: Usually the tongue falls back and blocks the airway

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but you're right - if the airway's block, you can't get air to your lungs

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And if you can't get air to your lungs, you die.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Sal: Right. And you said usually, your tongue falls back.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What is that?

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Dr. Mahadev: When you're unconcious, the muscles that control your tongue

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
relax, because when you're unconcious, your tongue falls back
