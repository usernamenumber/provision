1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,630
   

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,280
We're on problem 38.

3
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,040
Which of the following best
describes the graph of this

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,410
system of equations?

5
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,130
OK, so maybe they're
the same line.

6
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,200
Maybe they're parallel.

7
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,240
Maybe they only intersect
in one point-- two lines

8
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,930
intersecting in only
two points.

9
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,590
Well that's impossible.

10
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,170
Two lines, I mean that can
happen with curves, but that's

11
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,220
not going to happen
with lines.

12
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,460
So we can already cancel
out choice D.

13
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,690
OK, now let's look
at these two.

14
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,445
See I have a y here and
I have a 5y here.

15
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:30,610
Let's multiply this top equation
times 5 and see what

16
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,940
it looks like.

17
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,660
So if you multiply the
left-hand side

18
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,370
by 5, you get 5y.

19
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,200
I'll do it up here.

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:47,750
You get 5y is equal to-- 5 times
minus 2 is minus 10x,

21
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,980
plus 5 times 3 is 15.

22
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,310
So if you multiply the top
equation-- both sides of it--

23
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,390
by 5 and it really doesn't
fundamentally change the line,

24
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,230
the equation might look
different, but the equality

25
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,790
will still hold in the same
universe, which is

26
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,470
essentially that line.

27
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,630
So if you just multiply both
sides by 5, they become the

28
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,790
same equation.

29
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,370
5y is equal to minus
10x plus 15.

30
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,570
So they are the same lines.

31
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,010
So that's A, two identical
lines.

32
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,570
   

33
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:21,270
Problem 39.

34
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:28,960
And they want us to simplify
5x to the third over 10x to

35
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,740
the seventh.

36
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,560
So the easiest way to think of
this, or at least for me--

37
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,730
well, there's a lot of ways
you can do it and

38
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:35,550
we'll do it both ways.

39
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:42,610
This is the same thing as 5/10
times x to the third times x

40
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,010
to the minus 7.

41
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:48,640
1 over x to the 7 is the same
thing as x to the minus 7.

42
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,000
And this is equal to--
5/10 is 1/2.

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,790
And then here, we have the
same base and we're

44
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,920
multiplying, so we can
add the exponents.

45
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,640
3 plus minus 7 is minus 4.

46
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,650
So x to the minus
fourth power.

47
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:06,690
And we could write that as 1/2
times 1 over x to the fourth

48
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:10,030
or 1 over 2x to the fourth.

49
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,790
And that is choice B.

50
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:13,650
Now you could have done
it other ways.

51
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,090
You could have said,
OK, let's see.

52
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,500
Divide the numerator and
denominator by 5.

53
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,030
So this would have been 1.

54
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,960
This would have been a 2.

55
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,170
And you say, OK, let's divide
the numerator and denominator

56
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,780
by x to the third.

57
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,350
So this will become a 1.

58
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,190
And x to the seventh
divided by x to the

59
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,180
third is x to the fourth.

60
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:32,840
You could have done
it that way.

61
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,190
You had 1 over 2x
to the fourth.

62
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:36,770
Either way.

63
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,380
Or you could have even said--
you didn't have

64
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,060
to go to this step.

65
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,060
You could have said, OK, when
I'm dividing with the same

66
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,370
base, I can just subtract
the exponents.

67
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,500
So 3 minus 7 was minus 4.

68
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:47,930
Either way.

69
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,580
All of them would have valid
ways to approach this problem.

70
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,870
Problem 40.

71
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,130
This looks like a
simplification.

72
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:08,200
They write 4x squared minus 2x
plus 8, minus x squared plus

73
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,670
3x minus 2 is equal to.

74
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,650
So the key here is just to
realize that this is a minus.

75
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,650
So you could kind of view it as
a plus minus 1 times this

76
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:19,430
whole thing.

77
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,000
So we're just going to have
to distribute that out.

78
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,890
So this is equal to 4x squared
minus 2x plus 8.

79
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,090
And now we distribute this
minus over this whole

80
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:32,600
expression.

81
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,990
So minus times x squared
is minus x squared.

82
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,750
Minus times 3x, positive 3x.

83
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,250
So it's minus 3x.

84
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,290
The minus 1 times negative 2.

85
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,100
Well now they cancel out
and you get a plus 2.

86
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,610
We switch the sign on everything
here because

87
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,790
they're all being multiplied
by this negative 1.

88
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,470
OK, now we can simplify.

89
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,840
So let's take the x squared
terms first. So we have a 4x

90
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,410
squared, we have a
minus x squared.

91
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:05,400
So 4x squared minus x squared
is 3x squared.

92
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,480
4 minus 1 is 3.

93
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,920
Then let's do our x terms.
We have a minus 2x, we

94
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,490
have a minus 3x.

95
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,209
So minus 2 minus 3,
that's a minus 5x.

96
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:19,490
   

97
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,679
And then last we have
our constants.

98
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:23,080
We have 8 plus 2.

99
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,150
8 plus 2 is 10.

100
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:29,340
So 3x squared minus
5x plus 10.

101
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,850
And that is choice D.

102
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:37,450
Problem 41.

103
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,700
OK.

104
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,400
   

105
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,010
They say the sum of
two binomial-- let

106
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,420
me copy this one.

107
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,670
It's interesting.

108
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:50,510
   

109
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:54,840
The sum of two binomials
is 5x squared minus 6x.

110
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,810
So a binomial is just a
polynomial with two terms. If

111
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,660
one of the binomials is 3x
squared minus 2x, what is the

112
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,910
other binomial?

113
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,880
   

114
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,790
So this binomial is one of them,
so they're saying 3x

115
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:13,430
squared minus 2x, and when you
add that to some other

116
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:18,960
binomial-- and I don't know, let
me just write that as A.

117
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,290
I mean there is no constant
term here and there is no

118
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,940
constant term here, so I'm
assuming that my-- and it has

119
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,860
to be a binomial.

120
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,600
There's only two terms. So I'm
assuming my two terms are an x

121
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,900
squared term and x term because
that's the only terms

122
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,870
that are involved in
both of these.

123
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:38,770
So let's say my binomial
is Ax squared plus Bx.

124
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,590
This is the mystery binomial.

125
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,390
And their sum is equal
to this up here.

126
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:49,360
Is equal to 5x squared
minus 6x.

127
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,110
Now let's see what we can do.

128
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,550
Well this is a plus here,
so the parenthesis

129
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,230
really don't matter.

130
00:05:53,230 --> 00:06:03,420
We can rearrange this as 3x
squared plus Ax squared minus

131
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:11,780
2x plus Bx is equal to
5x squared minus 6x.

132
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,920
3 plus A.

133
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,400
3x squared plus Ax squared,
that's the same thing as 3

134
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,270
plus A, x squared.

135
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:25,750
And then, minus 2x plus Bx, or
we could switch them around.

136
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:30,490
That's the same thing as plus
B minus 2-- I just took the

137
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,220
coefficients and added
them together-- x.

138
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,160
I switched them, but we could
have written this in the other

139
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:41,560
order to begin with-- is equal
to 5x squared minus 6x.

140
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,480
And now you just compare.

141
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,530
OK, 3 plus A-- if you just look
at the x squared terms--

142
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,720
3 plus A has to be equal to 5.

143
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,190
Because that's the coefficient
on the x squared term.

144
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,380
So 3 plus A is equal to 5.

145
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,560
Subtract 3 from both sides.

146
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,630
You get A is equal to 2.

147
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:03,200
And then we have B minus 2 has
to be the coefficient on x

148
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,980
here, so it has to be
equal to minus 6.

149
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,640
Add 2 to both sides,
you get B.

150
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,130
Minus 6 plus 2 is 4.

151
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,600
So the other binomial, just
substituting that Ax squared

152
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:20,540
plus Bx, is 2x squared
plus Bx.

153
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:20,910
Oh, sorry.

154
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,450
This is a minus 4.

155
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,060
Minus 6 plus 2 is minus 4.

156
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,230
So plus Bx.

157
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:30,790
So minus 4-- that's B-- x.

158
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,680
And that is choice A.

159
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,930
Next problem.

160
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:41,380
   

161
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,000
OK, they say, which of the
following expressions is equal

162
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,980
to-- this is problem 42.

163
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:56,400
And they write x plus 2, plus
x minus 2, times 2x plus 1.

164
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,590
So we have to simplify this.

165
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,750
And remember, order of
operations, multiplication

166
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,720
comes first. So we have to
multiply these two expressions

167
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,410
first. So let's do that.

168
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,900
So this is-- I'll rewrite
this one over here.

169
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:12,410
x plus 2 plus-- and now
let's multiply this.

170
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,800
When you multiply these two
binomials, you're really just

171
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,860
doing the distributive
property twice.

172
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,230
And let me show that to you.

173
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:22,740
We could view this as x minus
2 times 2x plus x

174
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,970
minus 2 plus 1.

175
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,060
So I'm just distributing the x
minus 2 times each of these

176
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:40,340
terms. So I could write this as
x minus 2 times 2x, plus x

177
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,600
minus 2 times the 1.

178
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,880
All right, and now we can just
simplify that by doing the

179
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,300
distributive property again.

180
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,840
So this is x plus 2 plus-- let's
distribute the 2x times

181
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,290
each of these.

182
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:58,200
2x times x is 2x squared.

183
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,060
2x times minus 2 is minus 4x.

184
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,680
Plus, well, we're
disturbing a 1.

185
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,970
1 times anything
is just itself.

186
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,700
So plus x minus 2.

187
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,430
   

188
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,730
And let's see what we can do.

189
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,240
We only have 1x squared terms,
so let's write that down.

190
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,420
2x squared.

191
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,560
So 2x squared.

192
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,440
And then our x terms, we
have a plus x, a minus

193
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,530
4x, and a plus x.

194
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:30,430
So we have 1 minus
4 is minus 3.

195
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,130
Plus 1 is minus 2.

196
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,840
So its minus 2x.

197
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,920
And then, let's see.

198
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,480
We have a positive
2 and a minus 2.

199
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,370
They cancel out.

200
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:44,690
So we're left with 2x squared
minus 2x, and that's choice A.

201
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:49,340
   

202
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:53,050
Problem 43, I think we
can fit in here.

203
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,300
Let me copy and paste it.

204
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,290
   

205
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:02,160
OK, copy it and now
pasting it.

206
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,960
OK, it says, a volleyball
court is

207
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,490
shaped like a rectangle.

208
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:09,670
Let me draw that.

209
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,490
Well, I didn't want to draw
it filled in like

210
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,740
that, but fair enough.

211
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,870
Shaped like a rectangle.

212
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:18,970
It has a width of x meters and
a length of 2x meters.

213
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,140
So it's width is x.

214
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:25,060
Let me write, this could be
x and this would be 2x.

215
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,330
Because this is longer.

216
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,520
Which expression gives
the area of the

217
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,660
court in square meters?

218
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,680
Well the area is just the
width times the length.

219
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:40,510
So it's just x times 2x, which
is equal to 2x squared.

220
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:44,080
That's the same thing as 2
times, x times x, which is the

221
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,490
same thing as 2x squared.

222
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,720
And that's choice B.

223
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,890
Anyway, see you in
the next video.

224
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:50,400
