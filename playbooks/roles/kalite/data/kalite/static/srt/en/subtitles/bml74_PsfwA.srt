00:00:01,667 --> 00:00:06,918
Solve and eliminate any extraneous solutions. What they mean by extraneous solutions are:

2
00:00:06,918 --> 00:00:12,733
in the course of solving this rational equation right here we might get some solutions that if we actually

3
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:19,200
put it in the original problem would give us undefined expressions and so those solutions

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,867
are extraneous solutions, they actually don't apply, so you want to throw them out.

5
00:00:22,867 --> 00:00:28,400
So let's look at this equation. We have x^2 over x+2 = 4 over x + 2

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,667
So right from the get go, we don't know if this is necessarily going to be a solution to this equation

7
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:38,000
but we know just looking at this that if x is equal to -2, then this denominator

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,267
and this denominator are going to be zero and if you're dividing by zero it will be undefined.

9
00:00:42,267 --> 00:00:48,667
So right from the get go we can exclude x = -2, so x cannot be equal to -2 because that

10
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:52,400
would make either of these expressions undefined on either side of the equation.

11
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,467
So with that out of the way, let's try to solve it. So the first step, let's try to get the x out of

12
00:00:58,467 --> 00:01:02,400
the denominator so let's multiply both sides by x+2.

13
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:11,467
x+2 divided by x+2 is 1 and we can assume x+2 isn't zero, so it will be defined

14
00:01:11,467 --> 00:01:17,333
x+2 divided by x+2 is just 1 so our equation has simplified to

15
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:26,123
x^2 = 4

16
00:01:26,338 --> 00:01:31,667
So, subtract 4 from both sides. Do it in the proper quadratic equation form.

17
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:33,995
So, x^2 - 4 = 0

18
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:37,898
I just subtracted 4 from both sides over here

19
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:40,800
and so you can factor this because this is a difference of squares, so you get

20
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:50,867
(x+2) * (x-2) = 0 and if the product of two things is zero then that means that either one or

21
00:01:50,867 --> 00:01:52,867
both of them is equal to zero

22
00:01:52,867 --> 00:02:01,200
So this tells us that x+2 = 0 or x-2 = 0

23
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:08,067
If you subtract 2 from both sides of this equation right here you get x = -2 and if you add

24
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:13,867
2 to both sides of this equation here you get x = 2

25
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:18,133
and we're saying that either of these would make this last expression zero.

26
00:02:18,133 --> 00:02:26,467
Now, we know that we would exclude one of them. We know that x cannot be equal to -2. So x = -2 is an

27
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:36,133
extraneous solution. It is a solution for this, once we got rid of the natural expressions,

28
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:39,467
but it's not a solution for this original problem up here

29
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:43,400
because it would make the expressions undefined, it would cause you to divide by zero.

30
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:49,667
So, the only solution here is x=2 and you can check it yourself.

31
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:59,067
If you do 2^2 you get 4 over 2+2 is 4 and that should be equal to 4 over 2+2

32
00:02:59,067 --> 99:59:59,999
which it definitely is: 1 is equal to 1.
