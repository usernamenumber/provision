1
00:00:03,783 --> 00:00:06,782
Imagine Alice traveled
back over 50,000 years

2
00:00:06,782 --> 00:00:10,070
to find her distant ancestor, Bob.

3
00:00:15,088 --> 00:00:19,593
Now, up until this time, human
culture was relatively unsophisticated –

4
00:00:19,593 --> 00:00:21,879
utilizing the same primitive stone tools

5
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:24,614
which went unchanged for thousands of years.

6
00:00:25,852 --> 00:00:28,764
But somewhere around 50,000 years ago,

7
00:00:28,764 --> 00:00:30,778
something interesting happened.

8
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:32,580
And nobody knows, for sure, why.

9
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:38,310
There was a sudden explosion
of diverse cultural artifacts,

10
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,191
including instruments
for making music, new tools,

11
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:44,366
and other forms of creative expression.

12
00:00:48,807 --> 00:00:50,507
Humans developed the ability

13
00:00:50,507 --> 00:00:53,507
to externalize their inner thoughts.

14
00:00:53,507 --> 00:00:57,719
They began to communicate using language.

15
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,150
So, Alice begins her search
by looking for water.

16
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,682
She knows that human
and animal populations

17
00:01:03,682 --> 00:01:06,535
tend to migrate towards
and along rivers,

18
00:01:06,535 --> 00:01:09,394
which are the life blood of ecosystems.

19
00:01:09,394 --> 00:01:12,624
Eventually, she comes across
an interesting marking –

20
00:01:12,624 --> 00:01:15,214
Bob's handprint.

21
00:01:15,214 --> 00:01:17,771
This marking contains
very little information.

22
00:01:17,771 --> 00:01:21,190
Simply that he was here
and could possibly return.

23
00:01:22,636 --> 00:01:25,270
Alice knows Bob is equally intelligent.

24
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,000
He can communicate orally –

25
00:01:27,066 --> 00:01:33,280
although his culture has not yet developed
the ability to read or write in its native language.

26
00:01:33,284 --> 00:01:37,067
At the time, the universal
written language was art.

27
00:01:37,067 --> 00:01:39,617
So she finds natural materials around her,

28
00:01:39,617 --> 00:01:42,560
to paint him a picture, in case he returns.

29
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,455
She renders an animal she is tracking,

30
00:01:45,555 --> 00:01:50,133
hoping this will offer a clue about
the direction she is traveling in the future.

31
00:01:51,771 --> 00:01:54,462
Our ancestors used natural materials

32
00:01:54,463 --> 00:01:58,414
to create pictorial representations
of their reality.

33
00:01:58,415 --> 00:02:00,348
Here is an actual cave painting –

34
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:02,695
from around 30,000 years ago –

35
00:02:02,696 --> 00:02:06,904
found preserved deep inside
Chauvet cave, in France.

36
00:02:06,904 --> 00:02:11,363
Similar renderings are found
in the caves of Spain as well.

37
00:02:11,363 --> 00:02:13,790
A common theme among
these ancient paintings

38
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,937
[is] animal forms,
as well as the human hand –

39
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:21,422
perhaps as a signature,
a story, or a ritual calling.

40
00:02:22,752 --> 00:02:26,104
When Bob returns to the waterfall,
he finds her painting,

41
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,811
and proceeds towards the river,

42
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:30,958
where he thinks she might be.

43
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:34,020
When he arrives, he does not find her –

44
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,542
though he finds a sign
that she was here before.

45
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,340
He decides to paint her a picture
explaining where he is going next,

46
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,088
which is half-way up the river,
towards the setting sun.

47
00:02:46,222 --> 00:02:49,600
He has little time to paint the picture,
as night is approaching.

48
00:02:49,649 --> 00:02:53,706
Therefore, he needs a fast way
to visualise his message.

49
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,358
He thinks about it for a moment,

50
00:02:55,358 --> 00:02:57,416
and realizes his message only contains

51
00:02:57,416 --> 00:03:00,386
three distinct mental objects:

52
00:03:00,386 --> 00:03:03,779
'middle' -- 'river' -- 'west'

53
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,666
So he decides to use simplified
pictures to represent them.

54
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:12,110
For 'river,' he draws a symbol
which resembles its natural form –

55
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,470
known as a 'pictogram' –
which is a drawing

56
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:18,260
that resembles the physical
object it represents.

57
00:03:20,564 --> 00:03:24,775
Pictograms are an important step
in the evolution of writing.

58
00:03:24,888 --> 00:03:27,860
Here is a ceremonial slate palette,
found in Egypt,

59
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:30,480
dated before 3,000 BC.

60
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:34,670
The surrounding scene shows
a struggle between civilized humans

61
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:37,236
and the wild and ferocious animals.

62
00:03:39,647 --> 00:03:41,875
However, it's difficult to draw pictures

63
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:46,868
of abstract concepts – such as
'calm,' 'old,' 'dangerous' –

64
00:03:46,868 --> 00:03:49,822
or, in Bob's case, 'middle.'

65
00:03:49,822 --> 00:03:53,004
For this, he draws a line
with a box over the middle.

66
00:03:53,004 --> 00:03:55,695
It represents 'half way.'

67
00:03:55,695 --> 00:03:57,814
This is known as an 'ideogram' –

68
00:03:57,814 --> 00:04:01,270
or a conceptual picture
of an abstract idea.

69
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,428
Here is an example of the same symbol

70
00:04:03,428 --> 00:04:07,852
on an ancient Chinese bronze inscription.

71
00:04:07,911 --> 00:04:12,377
For the idea of 'west,' he decides
on a picture of the setting sun.

72
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:15,333
Now he does something interesting.

73
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:17,810
He combines these individual symbols –

74
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,916
in terms of their meaning –
to create a message.

75
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:24,461
Meaning plus meaning
equals new meaning.

76
00:04:24,461 --> 00:04:28,132
He leaves this in hope of Alice finding it.

77
00:04:28,132 --> 00:04:32,172
Some of the earliest artifacts
of this symbolic merging

78
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:36,042
are found in ancient Mesopotamia,
now modern Iraq,

79
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,181
home of the Sumerians.

80
00:04:38,181 --> 00:04:39,442
This is the birthplace

81
00:04:39,442 --> 00:04:43,265
of many of the world's
earliest civilizations.

82
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,511
Here we find clay accounting tablets,

83
00:04:45,555 --> 00:04:49,140
which are some of the oldest
written documents ever found –

84
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:52,018
some dating before 3,000 BC.

85
00:04:52,018 --> 00:04:54,872
The rectangular tablets record
the payments in cattle,

86
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,600
shipments of cattle
to shepherds for fattening,

87
00:04:57,609 --> 00:05:00,018
and gifts of cattle as an offering.

88
00:05:00,018 --> 00:05:02,994
Notice that, instead of drawing
a picture of ten sheep,

89
00:05:02,994 --> 00:05:05,084
they draw a symbol representing '10' –

90
00:05:05,084 --> 00:05:06,884
using small notches –

91
00:05:06,884 --> 00:05:09,948
and another symbol representing
'sheep' or 'donkey,'

92
00:05:09,948 --> 00:05:12,406
meaning, simply, '10 sheep.'

93
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,688
We call this 'proto-writing.'

94
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,466
Finally, Alice returns to the base
of the river, and finds Bob's message.

95
00:05:19,597 --> 00:05:22,154
She interprets the meaning correctly:

96
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:26,126
'half-way, west, down the river.'

97
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:29,188
So, she marches down river,
towards the setting sun,

98
00:05:29,188 --> 00:05:32,412
and eventually they finally meet.

99
00:05:32,511 --> 00:05:35,640
Over time, Bob learns
to speak Alice's language,

100
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:41,888
allowing them to use the same oral language
to communicate shared concepts and ideas.

101
00:05:41,931 --> 00:05:44,661
This gives them an idea –

102
00:05:44,661 --> 00:05:47,457
the root of a more
powerful written language.

103
00:05:47,457 --> 00:05:51,878
It starts with something
very simple – writing her name.

104
00:05:51,878 --> 00:05:55,296
She disassociates the sound
from the picture,

105
00:05:55,296 --> 00:05:58,150
for her name, Alice.

106
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:02,436
(Alice ... Al – ice)

107
00:06:02,436 --> 00:06:05,373
She combines the mathematical
symbol for 'all'

108
00:06:05,373 --> 00:06:07,754
and the picture of 'ice.'

109
00:06:07,754 --> 00:06:10,102
'All ice.'

110
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,111
'al-ice.'

111
00:06:12,911 --> 00:06:16,390
Notice her name has nothing to do
with the individual symbols.

112
00:06:16,397 --> 00:06:20,234
Sound plus sound equals new meaning.

113
00:06:20,234 --> 00:06:22,946
This is known as the 'Rebus principle.'

114
00:06:22,946 --> 00:06:25,265
A great example of this was found in Egypt,

115
00:06:25,265 --> 00:06:26,797
along the Nile river.

116
00:06:26,797 --> 00:06:29,881
Dated to aroung 3100 BC,
it contains some of the

117
00:06:29,881 --> 00:06:33,518
earliest hieroglyphic
inscriptions ever found.

118
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:37,105
'The Narmer Pallette' depicts
the Egyptian pharaoh, 'Narmer'.

119
00:06:37,155 --> 00:06:40,222
On the back, we see him to
the left of a kneeling prisoner,

120
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,577
who is about to be struck down by Narmer –

121
00:06:42,622 --> 00:06:46,177
who we see standing tall,
wearing a crown.

122
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,975
What we are looking for
is on the other side.

123
00:06:49,044 --> 00:06:54,000
Between the two bovine heads at the top,
we see an inscription of his name.

124
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:57,211
It's written as a fish and a chisel –

125
00:06:57,211 --> 00:07:00,689
which translates to 'Nar Mer' –

126
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,733
'Narmer.'

127
00:07:01,844 --> 00:07:05,870
Two sounds, separated from the pictures,
together, giving new meaning –

128
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,946
a key development
in the history of written language.

129
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,150
But before they could advance towards
what we know of as an 'alphabet',

130
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,960
something had to happen.

131
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,333
They needed to save time.
