00:00:00,887 --> 00:00:09,748
Simplify x to the third, and then that raised to the 4th power times x squared, and then that raised to the 5th power

2
00:00:09,748 --> 00:00:15,000
Here we'll use the power property of exponents, sometimes called the power rule.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:26,067
And that just tells us if I have x to the a and then I raise that to the bth power, this is the same as x to the a times b power.

4
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:31,268
To see why that works, let's try that with the - well I won't do that with these right here - I'll do it with a simpler example.

5
00:00:31,268 --> 00:00:36,999
let's say we are taking x squared and raising that to the third power.

6
00:00:37,014 --> 00:00:42,975
Well in that situation, that literally means multiplying x squared by itself, three times.

7
00:00:42,975 --> 00:00:52,575
So that literally means, x squared times x squared times x squared. I'm taking x squared and raising it to the third power.

8
00:00:52,621 --> 00:01:02,575
Now what does this mean over here? Well, there's a couple of ways to do it. You could just say ... like, I have the same base, I'm taking the product ... so I can just add the exponents.

9
00:01:02,575 --> 00:01:14,605
So this is going to be equal to - let me do it in that same magenta - x to the two plus two plus two power ... or essentially x to the three times two.

10
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:19,929
This right here is just 3 times 2, So we get x to the 6th power.

11
00:01:19,929 --> 00:01:23,036
So you say "hey sal, I don't see why you can add those exponents..."

12
00:01:23,036 --> 00:01:36,313
Well, this over here we can write as x times x, times x times x, -- In parentheses I'm putting each of these x squareds.-- times x times x.

13
00:01:36,313 --> 00:01:46,882
And this is just x times itself 6 times, or x to the 6th power. This is why we can add the exponents like that.

14
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:52,252
So let's use this powers of exponents property on this expression right over here.

15
00:01:52,252 --> 00:01:57,452
To start off we have x to the third raised to the fourth power.

16
00:01:57,482 --> 00:02:02,182
So that's just going to be x to the three times 4 power.

17
00:02:02,182 --> 00:02:04,252
or x to the 12th power.

18
00:02:04,252 --> 00:02:09,529
Then we muliply that by x squared raised to the fifth power

19
00:02:09,552 --> 00:02:16,967
well that's just going to be x to the 2 times 5 power, or x to the tenth power.

20
00:02:16,967 --> 00:02:22,013
And now that we have the same base, and we're taking the product, we can just add the exponents

21
00:02:22,013 --> 00:02:32,782
This is going to be equal to - this whole expression is going to be equal to x to the 12 plus 10th power, or x to the 22nd power.

22
00:02:32,782 --> 00:02:34,552
And we are done!
