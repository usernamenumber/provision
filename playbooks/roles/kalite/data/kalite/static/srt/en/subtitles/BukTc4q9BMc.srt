00:00:00,698 --> 00:00:04,099
Just realized that I typed in the wrong 
numbers at the end of the last video

2
00:00:04,099 --> 00:00:05,990
when I was trying to put them in the calculator.

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,648
We were trying to determine 
the coefficient of static friction –

4
00:00:08,648 --> 00:00:12,032
and it's 50 Newtons divided by 
49 square roots of 3 Newtons.

5
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:15,864
And in the last video, by accident, in the calculator,
instead of doing 49 square roots of 3,

6
00:00:15,864 --> 00:00:17,198
I wrote 40 square roots of three.

7
00:00:17,198 --> 00:00:24,454
So let's actually calculate it again.
50 divided by 49, times –

8
00:00:24,454 --> 00:00:25,503
(Let me write it this way,
to make sure we get it)

9
00:00:25,503 --> 00:00:34,087
– 49 times the square root of 3 –
gives us a coefficient of static friction of,

10
00:00:34,087 --> 00:00:44,490
if we round it, 0.59.
So this is equal to 0.59.

11
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,929
And so, that's it! 
I just forgot to –

12
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:50,303
I did the calculation wrong on
the calculator in the last video.
