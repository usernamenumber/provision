00:00:01,324 --> 00:00:06,757
Part C: find the average vaulue of f on the intERVAL -1 TO 1

2
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:11,076
So the average value of a function ovewr an inerval is just going to be

3
00:00:11,076 --> 00:00:13,769
lets just write "average"

4
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,739
The average value of our function is justgoing to be the integral over the interval

5
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:22,407
the integral over the interval

6
00:00:22,407 --> 00:00:23,197
-1 to 1

7
00:00:23,197 --> 00:00:25,008
of f(x) dx

8
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:26,076
divided by our change in x

9
00:00:26,076 --> 00:00:40,194
and our change in x is 1 minus -1

10
00:00:40,194 --> 00:00:43,677
so this is going to be equal to 1/2 times the

11
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:45,256
integral

12
00:00:45,256 --> 00:00:48,089
and here, f(x) is peicewise defined.

13
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:51,014
so what we can do is break up this integral into two invtervals

14
00:00:51,014 --> 00:00:52,733
we can say the integral from -1 to 0 of f(x) dx

15
00:00:52,733 --> 00:01:12,330
plus, the integral from 0 to 1 of f(x) dx.

16
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,095
and the reason why I broke it up like this is because this

17
00:01:14,095 --> 00:01:20,411
function is peicewise defined.

18
00:01:20,411 --> 00:01:23,197
it's different when we are less than or equal to 0,

19
00:01:23,197 --> 00:01:26,262
than when we are greater than zero

20
00:01:26,262 --> 00:01:31,742
so then we get, this is equal to 1/2 times,

21
00:01:31,742 --> 00:01:39,080
this first part we can right as

22
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,355
the integral from -1 to 0.

23
00:01:41,355 --> 00:01:45,070
what is the what is f(x) from -1 to 0? its 1- 2 sin (X).

24
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:55,334
dx

25
00:01:55,334 --> 00:01:59,327
plus the integral from 0 to 1,

26
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:02,439
and what is our function from zero to one?

27
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:04,529
its e to the -4 x

28
00:02:04,529 --> 00:02:08,522
dx

29
00:02:08,522 --> 00:02:11,077
and now we can do each of these integrals seperately

30
00:02:11,077 --> 00:02:13,770
so this is goin to be equal to

31
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:19,529
1/2, open brackets,

32
00:02:19,529 --> 00:02:28,770
and now lets take the anti-derivative

33
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,860
of 1-2 sin(x)

34
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,529
antiderivative of 1 with respect to x, is just x

35
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,758
-2 sin(x),

36
00:02:36,758 --> 00:02:40,659
well the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x),

37
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:44,420
so this is just going to be 2 cos(x)

38
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,092
and you can verify that,

39
00:02:46,092 --> 00:02:53,941
so we're going to evaluate that at zero,

40
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:56,077
and at -1

41
00:02:56,077 --> 00:02:58,445
and to that we are going to add,

42
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:01,418
lets do this integral over here

43
00:03:01,418 --> 00:03:04,018
the antiderivative of e to the -4x,

44
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:07,780
the antiderivative is going to be equal to,

45
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:13,260
-e to the -4x over 4

46
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,764
and the way you realize that is if you just had e to the x

47
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:20,086
the antiderivative would be e^x

48
00:03:20,086 --> 00:03:22,687
if you have an e^-4x

49
00:03:22,687 --> 99:59:59,999
then you know that whatever it's anitiderivite is is going to have
