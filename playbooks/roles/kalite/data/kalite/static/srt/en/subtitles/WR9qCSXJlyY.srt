1
00:00:00,762 --> 00:00:03,839
Let's think about how we can define "Matrix Addition."

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:06,609
And mathematicians could have chosen any

3
00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:09,406
of an arbitrary number of ways to define addition.

4
00:00:09,406 --> 00:00:11,691
But they've picked a way to define addition

5
00:00:11,691 --> 00:00:13,269
that seems – one – to make sense,

6
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:16,280
and it also has nice properties that allow us to do

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,049
interesting things with matrices later on.

8
00:00:19,049 --> 00:00:20,719
So if you were one of these mathematicians

9
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:23,409
who were first defining how matrices should be added,

10
00:00:23,409 --> 00:00:24,425
how would you define

11
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:27,543
adding this first matrix over here to the second one?

12
00:00:29,389 --> 00:00:31,418
Well, the most common-sense thing

13
00:00:31,418 --> 00:00:32,724
that might have jumped out at you –

14
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,023
especially because these two matrices

15
00:00:34,023 --> 00:00:35,152
have the same dimensions –

16
00:00:35,152 --> 00:00:36,589
(This is a 2-by-3 matrix.

17
00:00:36,589 --> 00:00:38,170
It has 2 rows and 3 columns.

18
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,840
This is also a 2-by-3 matrix.

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,275
It also has 2 rows and 3 columns.)

20
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:44,010
– is to just add the corresponding entries.

21
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,270
And if that was your intuition,

22
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,668
then you had the same intuition

23
00:00:47,668 --> 00:00:50,205
as the mathematical mainstream.

24
00:00:50,205 --> 00:00:51,835
That the addition of matrices

25
00:00:51,835 --> 00:00:53,102
should literally just be

26
00:00:53,102 --> 00:00:55,009
adding the corresponding entries.

27
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:58,384
So in this situation, we would add 1 + 5

28
00:00:58,384 --> 00:01:00,224
to get the corresponding entry in the sum –

29
00:01:00,224 --> 00:01:01,205
which is 6.

30
00:01:01,205 --> 00:01:04,941
You can add negative seven plus zero

31
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:06,836
to get negative seven.

32
00:01:06,836 --> 00:01:12,940
You can add five plus three to get eight.

33
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,088
You can add

34
00:01:15,088 --> 00:01:16,500
-and I'm running out of colours here-

35
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,921
you could add zero plus eleven

36
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:21,532
to get eleven.

37
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:25,210
You can add three to negative one

38
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,486
to get two.

39
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:30,404
And you could add -and you could add

40
00:01:30,404 --> 00:01:32,755
negative ten plus seven

41
00:01:32,755 --> 00:01:34,926
to get negative three.

42
00:01:34,926 --> 00:01:37,271
And if you see this definition of matrix addition

43
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:39,004
you see that it actually does not matter

44
00:01:39,004 --> 00:01:41,877
in what order that we actually add these matrices.

45
00:01:41,877 --> 00:01:43,538
I could've done this the other way around,

46
00:01:43,538 --> 00:01:45,404
if I did this the other way around

47
00:01:45,404 --> 00:01:46,588
-so let me copy and paste this-

48
00:01:46,588 --> 00:01:47,936
so if I were to add this matrix

49
00:01:47,936 --> 00:01:51,344
-so let me copy, let me paste it-

50
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,418
if I were to add that matrix to

51
00:01:53,418 --> 00:01:54,606
-let me copy and paste the other one-

52
00:01:54,606 --> 00:02:02,085
this matrix, copy and paste,

53
00:02:02,085 --> 00:02:04,512
you'll see that the order

54
00:02:04,512 --> 00:02:07,418
in which I'm adding the matrices does not matter

55
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,004
So this is just like adding numbers.

56
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,272
A plus B is just the same thing

57
00:02:10,272 --> 00:02:11,272
as B plus A.

58
00:02:11,272 --> 00:02:13,200
What we'll see is this won't be true

59
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,203
for every matrix operation that we study

60
00:02:15,203 --> 00:02:16,802
and in particular this will not be true

61
00:02:16,802 --> 00:02:18,355
for matrix multiplication.

62
00:02:18,355 --> 00:02:20,010
But if you add these two things,

63
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,092
using the definition we just came up with,

64
00:02:22,092 --> 00:02:23,417
adding corresponding terms,

65
00:02:23,417 --> 00:02:25,466
you'll get the exact same result.

66
00:02:25,466 --> 00:02:27,509
Up here we added one plus five and we got six

67
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:30,346
Her we'll add five plus one and we'll get six.

68
00:02:30,346 --> 00:02:31,405
We get the same result

69
00:02:31,405 --> 00:02:34,168
because one plus five is the same thing as five plus one.

70
00:02:34,168 --> 00:02:35,602
Here we have zero plus negative seven

71
00:02:35,602 --> 00:02:37,260
you get negative seven.

72
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,090
So you're going to get the exact same thing

73
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,535
as we got up here.

74
00:02:41,535 --> 00:02:43,938
So when you're adding matrices, if you were to call

75
00:02:43,938 --> 00:02:46,936
-if you were to call this matrix right over here matrix A

76
00:02:46,936 --> 00:02:49,133
which we normally denote with a capital, bolder letter,

77
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:52,670
and you call this matrix right over here Matrix B

78
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,546
Then when we take the sum of A plus B

79
00:02:55,546 --> 00:02:57,206
which is this thing right over here,

80
00:02:57,206 --> 00:02:58,675
and we see it's the exact same thing

81
00:02:58,675 --> 00:03:05,123
as B, as Matrix B plus Matrix A.

82
00:03:05,123 --> 00:03:08,542
Now let me ask you an interesting question.

83
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:10,539
What if I wanted to subtract matrices?

84
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:12,923
So let's once again think about matrices

85
00:03:12,923 --> 00:03:14,868
that have the same dimensions.

86
00:03:14,868 --> 00:03:19,425
So let's say I'm gonna do then two two-by-two matrices.

87
00:03:19,425 --> 00:03:22,810
So let's say it's zero, one, three, two,

88
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,605
and from that I want to subtract

89
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:31,270
negative one, three, zero, and five.

90
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,927
So you might say well maybe

91
00:03:32,927 --> 00:03:34,745
we just subtract corresponding entries.

92
00:03:34,745 --> 00:03:36,422
And that indeed is how you can define

93
00:03:36,422 --> 00:03:38,172
matrix subtraction.

94
00:03:38,172 --> 00:03:39,942
In fact you don't even have to define matrix subtraction,

95
00:03:39,942 --> 00:03:41,670
you can let this fall out of

96
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,179
what we did with scalar multiplication

97
00:03:44,179 --> 00:03:45,603
and matrix addition.

98
00:03:45,603 --> 00:03:47,756
We can view as the exact same thing

99
00:03:47,756 --> 00:03:48,758
-this as the exact same thing-

100
00:03:48,758 --> 00:03:50,670
as taking zero, one, three, two

101
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,761
and to that we add negative one, negative one times

102
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:58,603
negative one, three, zero, five.

103
00:03:58,603 --> 00:04:01,088
And if you work out the math you're going to get

104
00:04:01,088 --> 00:04:02,511
the exact same result as just

105
00:04:02,511 --> 00:04:04,809
subtracting the corresponding terms.

106
00:04:04,809 --> 00:04:06,337
So this is going to be

107
00:04:06,737 --> 00:04:08,761
-what is this going to be?

108
00:04:08,761 --> 00:04:11,663
Zero minus negative one is positive one,

109
00:04:11,832 --> 00:04:14,473
one minus three is negative two,

110
00:04:14,473 --> 00:04:16,799
three minus zero is three,

111
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,844
two minus five is negative three.

112
00:04:20,137 --> 00:04:21,133
And you'll see that you get

113
00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:22,347
the exact same thing here.

114
00:04:22,347 --> 00:04:24,468
When you multiply negative one times negative one

115
00:04:24,468 --> 00:04:27,273
you get positive one, positive one plus zero is one.

116
00:04:27,273 --> 00:04:32,073
Negative one times three plus one is negative two.

117
00:04:32,195 --> 00:04:33,468
Fair enough.

118
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:34,874
There might be a question

119
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:36,273
that is lingering in your brain right now.

120
00:04:36,273 --> 00:04:37,422
"Okay Sal, I understand

121
00:04:37,422 --> 00:04:39,175
when I'm adding or subtracting matrices

122
00:04:39,175 --> 00:04:40,673
with the same dimensions

123
00:04:40,673 --> 00:04:43,092
I just add or subtract the corresponding terms.

124
00:04:43,092 --> 00:04:45,070
But what happens when I have

125
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,205
matrices with different dimensions?"

126
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:49,093
So, for example, what about

127
00:04:49,093 --> 00:04:52,022
the scenario where I want to add the matrix

128
00:04:52,022 --> 00:04:58,837
one, zero, three, five, zero, one to the matrix

129
00:04:58,837 --> 00:05:01,009
-so this a three-by-two matrix-

130
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:05,424
and I wanna add it to, let's say, a two-by-two matrix.

131
00:05:05,424 --> 00:05:08,735
Five, seven, negative one, zero.

132
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:12,344
What would we define this as?

133
00:05:12,344 --> 00:05:13,542
Well it turns out that

134
00:05:13,603 --> 00:05:16,133
the mathematical mainstream does not define this.

135
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:17,857
This is undefined.

136
00:05:18,088 --> 00:05:20,604
This is undefined.

137
00:05:20,604 --> 00:05:22,601
So we do not define matrix addition,

138
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:24,091
or matrix subtraction,

139
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:27,342
when the matrices have different dimensions.

140
00:05:27,342 --> 00:05:29,341
There didn't seem to be any reasonable way to do this,

141
00:05:29,341 --> 00:05:31,090
that would actually be useful

142
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,469
and logically consistent in some nice way.
