1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,660
We're on problem 154

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,700
They ask us, is x negative?

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,410
So the question is x less than 0

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,150
Statement number 1 tells us-- let's see, they say x to the

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,770
third times 1 minus x squared is less than 0

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:21,680
Now let's simplify it

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:28,100
Let's see, x to the third minus x to the fifth is less than 0

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,590
We could add x to the fifth to both sides

9
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,390
x to the third is less than x to the fifth

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,800
Let's divide both sides by x squared

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,940
That won't change the inequality since x squared is

12
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,180
definitely going to be positive

13
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,090
Any integer squared, even if it's negative, is a positive

14
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,630
So you divide both sides by x squared

15
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:48,600
you get x is less than x to the third

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,900
Now let's see, does this answer that question?

17
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,800
Let's see what x's would satisfy this condition

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:01:02,340
So we can already say that x cannot be equal to 0, right?

19
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,010
Anything where this would have been an

20
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:04,800
inequality doesn't work

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,970
So x can't be equal 0, it can't be able to 1

22
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,560
because 1 is equal 1 to the third

23
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,350
and it can't be equal to negative 1

24
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,150
So we know that immediately

25
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,850
We know that for regular positive numbers

26
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,760
for numbers greater than 1

27
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,500
taking it to the third power is always

28
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,160
going to be greater than the number itself

29
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,360
If you took 2 to the third power, that's greater than 2

30
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,390
3 to the third power is greater than 3

31
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,760
1.5 to the third power is greater than 1.5

32
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,090
So we know that this statement right here implies

33
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,900
that x is greater than 1

34
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,790
Now let's see, is there a situation

35
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,980
where x can be negative?

36
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,350
Well, let's see

37
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:50,650
First off, x is between 0 and 1

38
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:54,320
1/2 is not less than 1/8

39
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,720
So it doesn't work between 0 and 1

40
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:04,140
But what if x were between negative 1 and 0?

41
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,550
Let's try an example

42
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:10,110
Negative 1/2 is less than negative 1/8

43
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,430
It's more negative

44
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:17,070
Negative 1/2 is less than negative 1/8, right?

45
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,200
You could try that with any fraction

46
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,800
Because when you take it to the third power

47
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,830
it becomes a smaller fraction

48
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,480
but it becomes a smaller negative fraction

49
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,840
So x will be less than it, because it's more negative

50
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,450
So this is true

51
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:35,620
If this is true, then x is either greater than 1

52
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,160
or it's between negative 1 and 0

53
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,390
Let's see, does it work if x is less than negative 1

54
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:45,340
Negative 2, is negative 2 less than negative 8?

55
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,470
Nope

56
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,100
Right

57
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,920
So these are the only ranges where it works

58
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,050
This statement implies this

59
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,120
But this still isn't enough information to tell us

60
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,120
whether x is less than 0

61
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,590
x could be greater than 1

62
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,430
which is definitely greater than 0, or x could be less than 0

63
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,530
So we don't know yet just from statement 1

64
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:12,500
Statement 2 tells us x squared minus 1 is less than 0

65
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,880
So add 1 to both sides

66
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,710
that tells us that x squared is less than 1

67
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:21,670
So when could something squared be less than 1?

68
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,350
Well, it's going to have to be between

69
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:28,320
negative 1 and 1, right?

70
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,170
It's essentially going to have be a positive

71
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,350
or a negative fraction less than 1

72
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,900
That's the only way that when you square it

73
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,610
you get a number less than 1

74
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,430
you're definitely going to get a number greater than 1

75
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,510
and it's going to be positive either way

76
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:46,000
If it's 1, it's going to be 1, and then 0 is in our range

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,590
So statement 2 tells us this

78
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,870
but it includes both positive and negative numbers

79
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,420
So it doesn't answer our question whether x is less than 0

80
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,190
But if we use both statements combined

81
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,120
what is the intersection?

82
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,690
What is the overlap of this and this?

83
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:04,130
Well, if x has to be between negative 1 and 1

84
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:08,030
and it has to be one of these

85
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:11,820
the only one that it overlaps with is this one

86
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,920
You cannot have x being greater

87
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,200
than 1 and x being in this range

88
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,370
You can have x being in this range and x being in this range

89
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,070
since this is a subset of this

90
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,640
So this is actually the more restrictive

91
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,070
And so since we go to that

92
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:30,320
that actually tells us that x has to be negative

93
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,930
So both statements combined are sufficient

94
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,130
to answer this question, but individually they're not

95
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:41,540
The last question, 155

96
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,460
Marsha's bucket can hold a maximum of

97
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,340
how many liters of water?

98
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:50,420
So we want to know the capacity of her bucket

99
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,360
Statement number 1 says

100
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,800
the bucket currently contains 9 liters of water

101
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,700
That's useless

102
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,670
We don't know how-- that could be the bucket

103
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,910
9 liters could be that

104
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,810
Or maybe 9 liters is the full capacity

105
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,630
That tells us nothing about what the capacity

106
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,860
of the bucket is

107
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,450
If I told you I had a bite of the sandwich

108
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,310
that tells you nothing as far as

109
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,980
how large of a sandwich I can eat

110
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,550
So statement 1 doesn't seem that useful

111
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:20,360
Statement 2, if 3 liters of water are added to the bucket

112
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,500
when it is 1/2 full of water

113
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,850
So 1/2 times the capacity, right?

114
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:30,420
When it's 1/2 full of water, you add 3 liters

115
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,730
So if 3 liters of water are added to the bucket

116
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,730
when it is 1/2 full of water

117
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:41,670
the amount of water in the bucket will increase by 1/3

118
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:52,280
To increase something by 1/3, that is like multiplying it

119
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,790
by 1 1/3 That's 1 1/3 times the capacity

120
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,930
That's what they're saying

121
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,850
The amount of water in the bucket will increase by 1

122
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:07,790
Sorry

123
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,560
You're going to have 1 1/3 times what you started off with

124
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,000
which was half your capacity

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,930
That make sense?

126
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,450
We say we're starting with 1/2 of our capacity

127
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:22,960
and we're adding 3 liters

128
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,480
They're saying that that will increase the amount

129
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,240
we have by 1 1/3

130
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,960
Let me write that

131
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:35,460
Let's say we start with x, and we're adding 3 liters

132
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,970
They're saying that will equal 1 1/3 or 4/3 times x, right?

133
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,780
This shows that x is increasing by 1/3

134
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,710
You could view this as 1 plus 1/3 times x

135
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,050
This is an increase of 1/3

136
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,830
They tell us that our starting point is 1/2 of capacity

137
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,090
So that's where I get the 1/2 c-- that's our starting point--

138
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:01,030
plus 3 is equal to 4/3 times the starting point

139
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,550
or where we're adding water to, 1/2 times c

140
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,330
We could easily solve for c here

141
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,450
So you get a 2, this cancels out

142
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:17,090
Then you get 1/2 c plus 3 is equal to 2/3 c

143
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:20,700
Let's see, we could subtract 1/2 c from both sides

144
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:26,450
and you get 3 is equal to 2/3 minus 1/2 c

145
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,320
Then you can just do that fraction

146
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,820
and you get c is equal to 3 over-- well, what is this?

147
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:41,380
1/2-- so if you do it over a 6, 4 minus 3, so this is 1/6

148
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,520
So this turns into 1/6

149
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,740
So c is equal to 18

150
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,520
Wait a minute

151
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,350
You didn't have to do all that

152
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,210
You should have just realized that as soon as you can write

153
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,850
this algebraic equation down

154
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,560
it's a linear equation with one unknown

155
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,000
and that one unknown is what we're trying to solve for

156
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,410
you have enough information to solve the problem

157
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:04,810
So statement 2, alone, is sufficient to solve this problem

158
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,610
We're all done with data sufficiency

159
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:09,000
See you all in the next section
