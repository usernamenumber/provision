1
00:00:00,946 --> 00:00:03,239
In order to have a respectable understanding of the Vietnam War,

2
00:00:03,239 --> 00:00:06,682
we have to rewind all the way back to the late 1800s,

3
00:00:06,682 --> 00:00:09,620
when France was colonizing Southeast Asia--

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:13,932
and in particular colonizing what is now Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia.

5
00:00:13,932 --> 00:00:16,551
They were collectively called French Indo-China.

6
00:00:16,551 --> 00:00:19,646
We can see Cambodia here, and Vietnam along the coast,

7
00:00:19,646 --> 00:00:21,692
and then Laos right over here.

8
00:00:21,692 --> 00:00:23,742
France stayed a colonizing power

9
00:00:23,742 --> 00:00:25,449
--I have a gap in my timeline here--

10
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:27,376
And they stayed a colonizing power

11
00:00:27,376 --> 00:00:33,733
all the way through WWII.

12
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,867
And so you can imagine that during WWII

13
00:00:35,867 --> 00:00:38,060
France was quickly overrun by the Germans.

14
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,993
The Vietnamese wanted their independence,

15
00:00:39,993 --> 00:00:42,926
and so you have a liberation movement that rises up,

16
00:00:42,926 --> 00:00:45,393
and it was led by the Viet Minh,

17
00:00:45,393 --> 00:00:47,993
and the Viet Minh were led by Ho Chi Minh.

18
00:00:47,993 --> 00:00:52,848
This right here is a picture of Ho Chi Minh.

19
00:00:52,848 --> 00:00:55,102
Besides being a liberation movement,

20
00:00:55,102 --> 00:00:59,864
they were also Communists,

21
00:00:59,864 --> 00:01:01,044
which you could imagine later on,

22
00:01:01,044 --> 00:01:01,933
during the Cold War,

23
00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:06,014
would kind of bias the US against them.

24
00:01:06,014 --> 00:01:09,327
But you fast-forward through WWII,

25
00:01:09,327 --> 00:01:11,594
eventually the Japanese take control

26
00:01:11,594 --> 00:01:14,925
over Indo-China, over Vietnam,

27
00:01:14,925 --> 00:01:18,668
But by the time '45 rolls around, or it's the end of '45,

28
00:01:18,668 --> 00:01:20,906
we know that the US defeats Japan,

29
00:01:20,906 --> 00:01:23,326
Now all of a sudden, the Viet Minh are able to

30
00:01:23,326 --> 00:01:26,195
declare a somewhat temporary independence.

31
00:01:26,195 --> 00:01:28,830
And it is temporary because shortly after that,

32
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,535
the region is occupied temporarily by

33
00:01:30,535 --> 00:01:32,532
the Chinese in the North

34
00:01:32,532 --> 00:01:34,704
and the British in the South

35
00:01:34,704 --> 00:01:38,466
--who were part of the Allied Forces against the Axis.

36
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:40,317
But eventually, you have the French coming back.

37
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:43,515
They want to re-assert their control

38
00:01:43,515 --> 00:01:45,061
over their former colony.

39
00:01:45,061 --> 00:01:46,812
And you have this war that develops,

40
00:01:46,812 --> 00:01:48,484
the First Indochina War,

41
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:52,000
between the French, and people sympathetic to the French,

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,667
the Vietnamese who are loyal to the French, and the North.

43
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:58,584
And the French--just to make clear how it sets up--

44
00:01:58,584 --> 00:02:01,267
when, at the end of WWII,

45
00:02:01,267 --> 00:02:03,391
when you had temporary occupiers

46
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:05,063
--the British and the Chinese--

47
00:02:05,063 --> 00:02:07,785
the Chinese obviously had more influence in the North;

48
00:02:07,785 --> 00:02:10,635
the British had more influence in the South.

49
00:02:10,635 --> 00:02:11,933
When the French come back,

50
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:14,867
they essentially are able to reinstate control over the South.

51
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:17,996
So, right when the Indochina War is beginning,

52
00:02:17,996 --> 00:02:20,411
the French already have more control over the South.

53
00:02:20,411 --> 00:02:22,129
And actually, historically the French

54
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:23,733
had more influence in the South as well.

55
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:25,566
During French colonial rule

56
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:27,888
it was the southern third of Vietnam

57
00:02:27,888 --> 00:02:30,467
where you had a lot of French influence.

58
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:31,598
And this is a current map,

59
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:34,111
and the current map doesn't have this orange boundary over here

60
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:36,026
that we'll talk about in a second--

61
00:02:36,026 --> 00:02:37,571
Vietnam is now all unified.

62
00:02:37,571 --> 00:02:39,428
But before the Vietnam War,

63
00:02:39,428 --> 00:02:44,438
this was not Ho Chi Minh City, this was Saigon.

64
00:02:44,438 --> 00:02:46,394
And Saigon was kind of

65
00:02:46,394 --> 00:02:50,388
where most of the French control was centered.

66
00:02:50,388 --> 00:02:52,733
But you fast-forward to 1954,

67
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:55,125
this ends up in a stalemate.

68
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:58,051
And so you have the Geneva Conference of 1954

69
00:02:58,051 --> 00:03:01,441
that partitions Vietnam along the 17th parallel

70
00:03:01,441 --> 00:03:04,088
between North Vietnam and South Vietnam.

71
00:03:04,088 --> 00:03:05,249
The whole point of this partition

72
00:03:05,249 --> 00:03:08,175
was really just to allow for a cooling-off period--

73
00:03:08,175 --> 00:03:10,264
a period where you can have things settling down,

74
00:03:10,264 --> 00:03:11,565
and then having elections--

75
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:14,128
it wasn't meant to be a permanent partition.

76
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:15,466
But there was a 300-day period

77
00:03:15,466 --> 00:03:17,973
where people could move across the partition.

78
00:03:17,973 --> 00:03:21,294
And during that partition, you actually had 900,000 people,

79
00:03:21,294 --> 00:03:23,587
mainly Catholics, move from the North to South.

80
00:03:23,587 --> 00:03:25,452
You also have several hundred thousand people

81
00:03:25,452 --> 00:03:27,192
moving from the South to the North,

82
00:03:27,192 --> 00:03:29,004
so it wasn't a one-way movement.

83
00:03:29,004 --> 00:03:30,802
But net-net, most of the movement

84
00:03:30,802 --> 00:03:32,502
by Roman Catholic Vietnamese

85
00:03:32,502 --> 00:03:35,748
was from the North to the South.

86
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:40,933
You fast-forward a little bit, you eventually have

87
00:03:40,933 --> 00:03:43,283
--and I'm sure I'm butchering the pronunciation--

88
00:03:43,283 --> 00:03:46,127
Ngo Dinh Diem takes control,

89
00:03:46,127 --> 00:03:47,882
He starts off as Prime Minister in ' 54,

90
00:03:47,882 --> 00:03:51,433
eventually he takes control and becomes President in '55.

91
00:03:51,433 --> 00:03:52,316
This is him right here.

92
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:54,173
He takes control of South Vietnam.

93
00:03:54,173 --> 00:03:56,309
And this guy is not a big fan of things

94
00:03:56,309 --> 00:04:00,721
like elections or non-corrupt government, and all of the rest...

95
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:02,068
and he takes control of South Vietnam,

96
00:04:02,068 --> 00:04:03,345
but you could imagine that

97
00:04:03,345 --> 00:04:05,583
the US is positively inclined to him.

98
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:09,133
One, he dresses in nice Western suits and all of that,

99
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:10,520
and nicely combed hair,

100
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,733
but he was also anti-Communist.

101
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:15,793
And in this time period, the US is starting to think

102
00:04:15,793 --> 00:04:18,067
in terms of Cold War

103
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:20,714
and in terms of how do we stop Communism,

104
00:04:20,714 --> 00:04:21,898
and how do we contain it,

105
00:04:21,898 --> 00:04:23,384
this whole theory of Containment,

106
00:04:23,384 --> 00:04:25,660
that the best way to stop the Soviet Union

107
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,129
is just to make sure that Communism cannot spread--

108
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:29,653
that it gets contained,

109
00:04:29,653 --> 00:04:32,115
that we have the Domino theory in the US,

110
00:04:32,115 --> 00:04:34,181
that if one country falls to Communism in a region,

111
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:37,200
that the rest of the countries will eventually fall--

112
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,243
and that is not good for Containment.

113
00:04:39,243 --> 00:04:41,437
So we did not want South Vietnam to fall,

114
00:04:41,437 --> 00:04:44,400
we essentially start supporting these characters over here.

115
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,977
Even from the early 50's,

116
00:04:45,977 --> 00:04:48,903
the US starts supporting the anti-Communists.

117
00:04:48,903 --> 00:04:54,849
And at first, this support is in the guise of " advisers."

118
00:04:54,849 --> 00:04:56,728
But these advisers, one, we start sending

119
00:04:56,728 --> 00:04:58,905
more and more aid, more and more advisers.

120
00:04:58,905 --> 00:05:00,445
And these advisers start getting

121
00:05:00,445 --> 00:05:03,229
more and more involved in the actual conflict.

122
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:05,359
And so after this partition, you can imagine that

123
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:07,933
you still have an ongoing conflict

124
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,798
between the North and the South,

125
00:05:09,798 --> 00:05:12,042
and on top of that you have actors

126
00:05:12,042 --> 00:05:13,702
who are sympathetic to the North,

127
00:05:13,702 --> 00:05:15,327
sympathetic to the Viet MInh,

128
00:05:15,327 --> 00:05:17,649
sympathetic to Ho Chi Minh in the South.

129
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:19,076
Some of them were in the North,

130
00:05:19,076 --> 00:05:20,361
they had come back to the South;

131
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,409
some of them were just in the South

132
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:25,567
and they did not like the Diem government,

133
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:27,024
besides just being sympathetic to Ho Chi Minh.

134
00:05:27,024 --> 00:05:31,800
Diem was a fairly corrupt autocratic ruler,

135
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,787
who wasn't a big fan of democracy.

136
00:05:33,787 --> 00:05:37,340
And so, these players in the South,

137
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:41,008
who started to rise up against President Diem,

138
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:44,538
were the Vietcong.

139
00:05:44,538 --> 00:05:48,160
So, this really sets up what the Vietnam War is all about.

140
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,386
You have the Communist, Ho Chi Minh-controlled North,

141
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:55,577
those fighting a conventional war against the South.

142
00:05:55,577 --> 00:05:58,632
You have this partition on the 17th-parallel,

143
00:05:58,632 --> 00:06:00,072
and on top of that,

144
00:06:00,072 --> 00:06:02,974
you have an unconventional fighting force

145
00:06:02,974 --> 00:06:05,854
--I guess you could call them "guerrillas,"--

146
00:06:05,854 --> 00:06:07,665
in the South of Vietnam called the Vietcong.

147
00:06:07,665 --> 00:06:11,756
So, there were two things the South had to fight against:

148
00:06:11,756 --> 00:06:12,946
The North officially,

149
00:06:12,946 --> 00:06:15,049
and also this insurrection

150
00:06:15,049 --> 00:06:17,200
that was occurring within the South.

151
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,100
So the whole time,

152
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,467
the US did not want this insurrection to succeed.

153
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:23,013
They did not want all of Vietnam to become Communist.

154
00:06:23,013 --> 00:06:25,172
We keep sending more and more advisers.

155
00:06:25,172 --> 00:06:27,100
It actually started even before Kennedy.

156
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,820
but Kennedy escalates the number of advisers that get sent.

157
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:36,585
It's still not, at this point, a formal war.

158
00:06:36,585 --> 00:06:38,315
We haven't officially declared war.

159
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:42,634
We don't have officially soldiers in battle.

160
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:44,667
You fast-forward to 1963,

161
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:47,882
Besides all of the great characteristics of Diem

162
00:06:47,882 --> 00:06:49,577
that I already mentioned,

163
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:52,502
he also was into persecuting Buddhists.

164
00:06:52,502 --> 00:06:55,846
so, to make matters worse, not only was he corrupt,

165
00:06:55,846 --> 00:06:57,200
not only did he not like elections,

166
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,515
he liked persecuting his own people.

167
00:06:59,515 --> 00:07:03,903
And by 1963 this kind of got out of hand.

168
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:06,829
His level of persecution of the Buddhists:

169
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:09,105
he started ... storming temples and all the rest,

170
00:07:09,105 --> 00:07:15,931
and so, he was assassinated, leaving a power vacuum.

171
00:07:15,931 --> 00:07:19,102
You have all these people jockeying for control.

172
00:07:19,102 --> 00:07:19,971
None of these really were

173
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:22,310
especially savory characters inside the South.

174
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,500
These two guys eventually come to power:

175
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,240
Nguyen Cao Ky and Nguyen Van Thieu

176
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,531
Wait a few years, Nguyen Van Thieu was able to

177
00:07:29,531 --> 00:07:31,400
get this guy out of the picture,

178
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,154
and by 1967--I don't have it over here--

179
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:38,269
you have Thieu,..he has now taken control.

180
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:40,312
But during that period,

181
00:07:40,312 --> 00:07:42,588
actually before Ky and Theiu take power,

182
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:48,300
in 1964 you have one of the shadiest incidents in American history.

183
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,503
As you can imagine, we in our function as advisers,

184
00:07:52,503 --> 00:07:54,834
we had sent ships into the Gulf of Tonkin,

185
00:07:54,834 --> 00:07:58,190
right off the coast of North Vietnam.

186
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,234
And, so the original story goes,

187
00:08:01,234 --> 00:08:03,800
and this is a very suspect original story,

188
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,548
in 1964, the US Maddox--and this is the original story--

189
00:08:08,548 --> 00:08:10,313
claimed that it was attacked,

190
00:08:10,313 --> 00:08:12,913
or it was claimed that the US Maddox was attacked

191
00:08:12,913 --> 00:08:15,932
by North Vietnamese patrol boats,

192
00:08:15,932 --> 00:08:18,505
and that there was little bit of a skirmish.

193
00:08:18,505 --> 00:08:19,743
There was exchange of fire.

194
00:08:19,743 --> 00:08:22,039
And it was also claimed that a few days later,

195
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:24,651
another boat in the Gulf of Tonkin, another US vessel

196
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:26,805
was attacked by a North Vietnamese boat.

197
00:08:26,805 --> 00:08:28,726
That was the original story.

198
00:08:28,726 --> 00:08:30,723
This angered Congress.

199
00:08:30,723 --> 00:08:32,302
This angered the American people, you know.

200
00:08:32,302 --> 00:08:34,467
How dare they attack ships

201
00:08:34,467 --> 00:08:37,851
war ships that are sitting off the coast?

202
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:44,632
And so this kind of gave the emotional fuel

203
00:08:44,632 --> 00:08:47,617
to pass the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution.

204
00:08:47,617 --> 00:08:50,456
So these purported incidents,

205
00:08:50,456 --> 00:08:52,596
is kind of an attack on the USS Maddox

206
00:08:52,596 --> 00:08:54,550
and this other thing that might have happened

207
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,381
--this was called the Gulf of Tonkin Incident--

208
00:08:56,381 --> 00:08:58,935
this angered Congress, angered the American people,

209
00:08:58,935 --> 00:09:02,186
So, we passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution.

210
00:09:02,186 --> 00:09:03,835
And what's relevant about it is that

211
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:07,431
it gave LBJ here, it gave him the authority

212
00:09:07,431 --> 00:09:11,667
to officially engage in a war in Vietnam,

213
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:14,260
to officially escalate to an actual war

214
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,071
that the US was involved in.

215
00:09:16,071 --> 00:09:17,800
And this whole time I've been saying that

216
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,647
it's shady because it's now been shown that,

217
00:09:19,647 --> 00:09:22,780
One, the gulf of Tonkin, well,

218
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,058
it's not clear that really anything happened.

219
00:09:25,058 --> 00:09:28,096
there might have been some firing from the USS Maddox

220
00:09:28,096 --> 00:09:31,207
they might have actually engaged

221
00:09:31,207 --> 00:09:35,308
the North Vietnamese patrol boats

222
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:38,067
The other possibility that might have happened

223
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:40,496
is that nothing happened.

224
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,671
So, but, either way you look at it,

225
00:09:42,671 --> 00:09:44,493
it's now been fairly established that

226
00:09:44,493 --> 00:09:47,326
it was not a real incident.

227
00:09:47,326 --> 00:09:52,504
It was not really North Vietnam attacking the US.

228
00:09:52,504 --> 00:09:56,289
But it was relevant because it really escalated the War.

229
00:09:56,289 --> 00:09:58,100
So now you have Johnson.

230
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,656
Did I say North Korea originally? I apologize for that.

231
00:10:00,656 --> 00:10:02,087
We are talking about North Vietnam.

232
00:10:02,087 --> 00:10:04,161
I don't remember what my brain actually said.

233
00:10:04,161 --> 00:10:05,600
Of course North Vietnam.

234
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,706
But it gave Johnson the power to escalate the war.

235
00:10:11,706 --> 00:10:14,911
So his administration is really the heart of the Vietnam War.

236
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,583
When the War was really escalated,

237
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:20,067
we eventually get to 500,000 US troops.

238
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:21,575
But the whole time this is happening,

239
00:10:21,575 --> 00:10:24,800
you can imagine that Johnson and the military leaders in Vietnam

240
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,194
and the American military leaders in Vietnam

241
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:28,402
are telling the American people,

242
00:10:28,402 --> 00:10:29,841
"Oh, we're fighting Communism."

243
00:10:29,841 --> 00:10:33,096
"We're about to win. This is a noble war."

244
00:10:33,096 --> 00:10:35,667
And you fast-forward, and you know,

245
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:37,248
especially the part "about to win,"

246
00:10:37,248 --> 00:10:39,245
You fast-forward to 1968,

247
00:10:39,245 --> 00:10:41,335
and all of a sudden you have the Vietcong,

248
00:10:41,335 --> 00:10:43,239
whom the American leaders have told

249
00:10:43,239 --> 00:10:44,911
the American people and Congress

250
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,444
they are about to be defeated.

251
00:10:46,444 --> 00:10:49,971
And then in 1968 the Vietcong orchestrate the Tet Offensive,

252
00:10:49,971 --> 00:10:53,526
which is this massive coordinated attack

253
00:10:53,526 --> 00:11:00,445
on a bunch of targets throughout South Vietnam.

254
00:11:00,445 --> 00:11:03,928
And so, even though it wasn't a completely successful militarily,

255
00:11:03,928 --> 00:11:05,815
the intent of the Tet Offensive was

256
00:11:05,815 --> 00:11:08,317
kind of to completely turn the tides of the War.

257
00:11:08,317 --> 00:11:11,208
It made the American People and Congress rightfully suspicious,

258
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,100
You, you know, Mr. Johnson,

259
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,605
you'd told us that we were about to win the War,

260
00:11:17,605 --> 00:11:19,148
and the Vietcong were almost defeated,

261
00:11:19,148 --> 00:11:20,786
and all of a sudden they orchestrate

262
00:11:20,786 --> 00:11:22,667
this sophisticated attack on us.

263
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:25,894
it rightfully made the American public suspicious.

264
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:29,800
On top of that, this probably made matters a lot worse,

265
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,303
the My Lai Massacre comes out.

266
00:11:32,303 --> 00:11:34,114
And in every war there are massacres,

267
00:11:34,114 --> 00:11:36,645
but the US at least believes that

268
00:11:36,645 --> 00:11:40,231
its soldiers can kinda take the high-road,

269
00:11:40,231 --> 00:11:43,000
that they don't engage in these types of things.

270
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,586
But the My Lai Massacre shows that

271
00:11:44,586 --> 00:11:48,162
really no soldiers are immune to massacres,

272
00:11:48,162 --> 00:11:50,298
and this is really a disgusting massacre,

273
00:11:50,298 --> 00:11:51,738
and it was documented.

274
00:11:51,738 --> 00:11:53,526
And if you really want to be disturbed,

275
00:11:53,526 --> 00:11:56,266
do a google search for images of the My Lai massacre.

276
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:59,715
It will ruin your weekend. It will depress you.

277
00:11:59,715 --> 00:12:06,506
It's US soldiers killing a village of innocent women and children.

278
00:12:06,506 --> 00:12:08,733
There's pictures of dead babies. It's horrible.

279
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:12,409
To make matters worse, or even add insult to injury,

280
00:12:12,409 --> 00:12:14,308
the soldiers who committed--

281
00:12:14,308 --> 00:12:17,001
There's actually a few who tried to defend the villagers.

282
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:19,788
When they came back,

283
00:12:19,788 --> 00:12:22,165
they were treated almost like traitors.

284
00:12:22,165 --> 00:12:25,105
But the soldiers who actually did the attack,

285
00:12:25,105 --> 00:12:26,777
only one of them got jail time.

286
00:12:26,777 --> 00:12:28,333
and it was only a couple of years of jail time--

287
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:32,628
and this is for massacring a village of women and children.

288
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:34,393
So already, you have the Tet Offensive

289
00:12:34,393 --> 00:12:36,669
makes the American public suspicious of

290
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:38,317
whether we can actually even win this war,

291
00:12:38,317 --> 00:12:39,465
and then we have the My Lai Massacre

292
00:12:39,465 --> 00:12:41,475
which disgusts the public,

293
00:12:41,475 --> 00:12:44,912
and makes people realize that we're involved in a war

294
00:12:44,912 --> 00:12:47,333
--not even clear who are the good guys anymore--

295
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,533
not even clear what the real goals are.

296
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:52,379
To make matters worse, you fast-forward to 1971,

297
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:56,452
the Pentagon papers get leaked to the NY Times,

298
00:12:56,452 --> 00:12:57,800
and these pretty much articulate

299
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,667
--it's a classified document--

300
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:02,190
that articulates that the leadership,

301
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:05,926
the military and non-military leadership of the Vietnam War

302
00:13:05,926 --> 00:13:08,666
was to some degree lying to Congress and the American people.

303
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,867
who's lying about how the War was going.

304
00:13:10,867 --> 00:13:13,305
who's lying about what activities it was doing.

305
00:13:13,305 --> 00:13:16,073
It did not tell the American people and Congress that

306
00:13:16,073 --> 00:13:19,133
it was actually engaged in war in Laos and Cambodia.

307
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:21,920
And a lot of reason why we were engaged in Laos and Cambodia

308
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,177
is because that's where the supply routes were

309
00:13:24,177 --> 00:13:25,667
between the North and the South,

310
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:28,867
They ran through Laos and Cambodia.

311
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:30,585
The most famous of them,

312
00:13:30,585 --> 00:13:31,607
and you might have heard of it,

313
00:13:31,607 --> 00:13:33,492
is the Ho Chi Minh trail.

314
00:13:33,492 --> 00:13:35,067
It wasn't just one trail.

315
00:13:35,067 --> 00:13:37,067
It was actually a network of trails.

316
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:40,477
So a lot of activity that was going on in Laos and Cambodia

317
00:13:40,477 --> 00:13:42,647
was kind of carpet bombing of

318
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:45,980
what the US thought were some of these supply routes.

319
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,720
--we never really got a good...we never--

320
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,974
--well that's a whole other debate--

321
00:13:49,974 --> 00:13:52,644
it wasn't just one trail that was easily bombed,

322
00:13:52,644 --> 00:13:54,966
it was all of these footpaths and all these other things

323
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:57,133
where arms were able to be transported

324
00:13:57,133 --> 00:13:58,867
from the North to the South.

325
00:13:58,867 --> 00:14:00,183
But the Pentagon-made papers

326
00:14:00,183 --> 00:14:04,069
rightfully made the American people even more suspicious.

327
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:06,815
And now we are entering into Nixon's administration,

328
00:14:06,815 --> 00:14:08,991
and he was still doing the carpet bombing,

329
00:14:08,991 --> 00:14:11,569
still atrocities going on,

330
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:15,980
but his whole goal was to kind of wind down the War,

331
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,929
bring the troops out on a timetable

332
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:20,299
without kind of an official defeat.

333
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:22,337
So you fast-forward to 1973,

334
00:14:22,337 --> 00:14:24,316
you have the Paris peace accords,

335
00:14:24,316 --> 00:14:26,954
where officially, there is peace

336
00:14:26,954 --> 00:14:31,173
between the North, the South, the North and the Americans,

337
00:14:31,173 --> 00:14:32,450
you can imagine from the North's point of view,

338
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,404
they were like, "Sure, we'll sign some peace accords."

339
00:14:34,404 --> 00:14:35,867
"It'll make the Americans go away."

340
00:14:35,867 --> 00:14:37,321
Once the Americans go away,

341
00:14:37,321 --> 00:14:38,713
they won't be able to come back.

342
00:14:38,713 --> 00:14:41,849
Since this was such a hugely unpopular war--

343
00:14:41,849 --> 00:14:46,211
it was such a waste for America on so many dimensions,

344
00:14:46,211 --> 00:14:49,515
especially on America's prestige as a global actor.

345
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:50,941
"We'll just wait for them to leave."

346
00:14:50,941 --> 00:14:53,400
"Then we can overrun the South after that."

347
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,245
And that's essentially what happens.

348
00:14:55,245 --> 00:14:58,914
In 1975 the North just overruns the South.

349
00:14:58,914 --> 00:15:01,700
And then, later that year,

350
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,627
you have Saigon falling to the North,

351
00:15:04,627 --> 00:15:06,919
and then it becomes Ho Chi Minh City.

352
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:08,357
In just this whole period,

353
00:15:08,357 --> 00:15:10,640
you have President Thieu who is in power.

354
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,867
Just to show where his priorities are, right near the end,

355
00:15:13,867 --> 00:15:17,267
right when the South is falling to the North Vietnam,

356
00:15:17,267 --> 00:15:18,906
and you can kinda see the writing on the wall,

357
00:15:18,906 --> 00:15:20,346
he gives a speech to the Vietnamese people,

358
00:15:20,346 --> 00:15:22,250
saying that he'll never desert them.

359
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,199
But then when it becomes clear that

360
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,267
Saigon is going to fall to the North Vietnamese.

361
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:30,865
He gets on a big US transport plane

362
00:15:30,865 --> 00:15:36,133
with literally 15 tons of luggage.

363
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:38,481
I"ll let you think about how much luggage that is.

364
00:15:38,481 --> 00:15:43,672
And 15 million dollars worth of gold--

365
00:15:43,672 --> 00:15:47,235
This is 15 million dollars worth of gold in 1975.

366
00:15:47,235 --> 00:15:48,303
So you can imagine

367
00:15:48,303 --> 00:15:51,577
how much he really cared about the Vietnamese people.

368
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:53,574
And he eventually ends up settling in Massachusetts

369
00:15:53,574 --> 00:15:57,428
and he died there about 10 years ago.

370
00:15:57,428 --> 00:15:58,311
So you can imagine that

371
00:15:58,311 --> 00:16:01,498
this was an ugly incident for the world,

372
00:16:01,498 --> 00:16:06,044
an ugly, super ugly incident for the Vietnamese people,

373
00:16:06,044 --> 00:16:08,899
a super ugly chapter in the American history.

374
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:12,484
It was the first war that, one, America lost.

375
00:16:12,484 --> 00:16:14,402
But more, it hurts prestige.

376
00:16:14,402 --> 00:16:17,943
It hurts America's ability to influence

377
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:20,880
what was going on in other parts of the world.

378
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,924
You know, you had the containment theory,

379
00:16:22,924 --> 00:16:25,246
that we had to stop Communism from spreading,

380
00:16:25,246 --> 00:16:26,800
and the Domino theory that

381
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,983
if one country would fall to Communism,

382
00:16:29,983 --> 00:16:32,165
then the other ones--that didn't happen!

383
00:16:32,165 --> 00:16:33,744
The South did fall, but we didn't have

384
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:36,717
the rest of Southeast Asia falling to Communism.

385
00:16:36,717 --> 00:16:39,340
So it kind of disproved the Domino theory,

386
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,244
especially because after the Vietnam War,

387
00:16:41,244 --> 00:16:42,638
the US would not be able

388
00:16:42,638 --> 00:16:44,913
to enter another war like it for some time,

389
00:16:44,913 --> 00:16:47,333
because the American people wouldn't let it happen.

390
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:50,277
So, to some degree, it would've been easier for Communism to spread,

391
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:52,692
because people would've known that the US couldn't engage it,

392
00:16:52,692 --> 00:16:55,650
but despite of that the Domino theory didn't happen.

393
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:59,844
But it was all around ugly, just the size of the massacres,

394
00:16:59,844 --> 00:17:02,261
the raping, the pillaging of innocents

395
00:17:02,261 --> 00:17:05,463
that happened really on all sides of this.

396
00:17:05,463 --> 00:17:09,619
You have 1 to 3 million Vietnamese

397
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:11,566
No one really knows the the actual count.

398
00:17:11,566 --> 00:17:14,635
That's a huge number. 1 to 3 million Vietnamese were killed.

399
00:17:14,635 --> 00:17:22,115
You have 58,000 American troops being killed.

400
00:17:22,115 --> 00:17:25,664
You have hundreds of thousands of Cambodians and Laotians,

401
00:17:25,664 --> 00:17:28,329
who were never really formally involved in the War,

402
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:31,701
they were killed especially due to this carpet bombing.

403
00:17:31,701 --> 00:17:36,670
These are atrocious numbers.

404
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:40,664
Really one of the worst and ugliest chapters in US history.
