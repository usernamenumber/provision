00:00:04,365 --> 00:00:08,698
Looking at a very large panel painting by Piero della Francesca

2
00:00:08,698 --> 00:00:10,982
of the Baptism of Christ

3
00:00:10,982 --> 00:00:13,466
it is a typical fabric that we see a lot

4
00:00:13,466 --> 00:00:15,000
but not a typical treatment.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,575
Piero is one of those Renaissance artists that I think the modern era has loved

6
00:00:19,575 --> 00:00:22,959
it's partly because of the...of geometry,

7
00:00:22,959 --> 00:00:25,375
and a kind of abstraction of space and form.

8
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:28,809
He really stands out as having a really unique style

9
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:30,260
in the early Renaissance.

10
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,209
It's defined by a kind of stillness of the figures,

11
00:00:34,209 --> 00:00:36,043
a kind of quiteness.

12
00:00:36,043 --> 00:00:39,325
It has all of the characteristics of an ideal moment:

13
00:00:39,325 --> 00:00:41,975
this is a moment, literally, the moment

14
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:43,908
when John allows the water

15
00:00:43,908 --> 00:00:46,426
to pour from that bowl onto Christ's head

16
00:00:46,426 --> 00:00:51,226
and would be that moment when the Holy Spirit, in the form of a dove, appears.

17
00:00:51,226 --> 00:00:57,446
John is so ever so gently and tentatively pouring that water over Christ

18
00:00:57,446 --> 00:01:02,761
because Chirst asked John to baptize him and John had first refused

19
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:07,192
and Christ insisted that John, no you should baptize me.

20
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:11,059
The angels on the left look equally concerned and there is a kind of tentativeness

21
00:01:11,059 --> 00:01:13,476
look at the focus in John's eyes.

22
00:01:13,476 --> 00:01:17,160
This tentativeness is expressed in his left hand.

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,094
Yes, oh, absolutely, and you consider then

24
00:01:19,094 --> 00:01:21,110
the hands of the angels as well.

25
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,776
There is a kind of stillness

26
00:01:22,776 --> 00:01:26,168
and sense of linearity to the figures.

27
00:01:26,168 --> 00:01:30,087
Christ occupies the exact centre of the composition,

28
00:01:30,087 --> 00:01:32,002
directly under the dove

29
00:01:32,002 --> 00:01:35,569
he stands in a lovely "contrapposto", with his hands in prayer.

30
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:39,486
There is a really strict geometry of the verticality, that you've already mentioned,

31
00:01:39,486 --> 00:01:45,734
but normally this would be symmetry of correspondence in the centre of the canvas by john

32
00:01:45,734 --> 00:01:50,820
being quite... fo the angels very... the tree... and actually all the trees.

33
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,118
And then there is a series of perfect horizontals:

34
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:58,486
look at the way that John's belt continues the movement of the man who is taking off his shirt to the right,

35
00:01:58,486 --> 00:02:02,752
moves across Christ's waist and picks off the belts of the middle angel.

36
00:02:02,752 --> 00:02:05,652
So, you have a kind of perfect horizontal that moves across,

37
00:02:05,652 --> 00:02:11,936
that's echoed by the horizontality of the dove, whose line is continued by the clouds;

38
00:02:11,936 --> 00:02:16,386
and then, there is a series of circles; the painting itself has an arch

39
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,668
but that arch that ...is picked up and continued

40
00:02:19,668 --> 00:02:25,119
by the arch of top of the cloth that covers Christ's waist

41
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:27,985
and then by John's hand and arm,

42
00:02:27,985 --> 00:02:34,036
and even by this sort of line that's created as the man pulls his shirt over his head.

43
00:02:34,036 --> 00:02:37,286
So, there you've got really this sort of continued negative arch

44
00:02:37,286 --> 00:02:39,353
or the bottom of the arch of the circle.

45
00:02:39,353 --> 00:02:42,568
And this love of geometry,

46
00:02:42,568 --> 00:02:45,569
we know that perspective was something that Piero also

47
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:48,451
was really interested in and wrote a treatise about;

48
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:53,400
he is interested in the mathematical foundations of beauty and harmony

49
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,785
as nearly we really see very broadly in the Early Renaissance.

50
00:02:56,785 --> 00:03:00,253
I think there is an additional kind of peculiarity,

51
00:03:00,253 --> 00:03:01,655
which has to do with the placement:

52
00:03:01,655 --> 00:03:04,236
clearly this is not the Middle East.

53
00:03:04,236 --> 00:03:05,353
The hill town that we see

54
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:10,418
just below Christ's elbow is clearly of Tuscany and...

55
00:03:10,418 --> 00:03:13,870
maybe ... where Piero was from, just Borgo Sansepolcro.

56
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,036
That's right, but we have a reference of the river Jordan,

57
00:03:16,036 --> 00:03:21,719
coming back of Christ which is.. peculiar, almost just

58
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:25,418
minimized and attracted into a little stream, that almost ... to stop

59
00:03:25,418 --> 00:03:29,418
as if was a little pathway actually. ... going back and reflect.. pathway

60
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:32,520
It is a kind of intentionality here,

61
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:37,217
and a kind of formality that I think it's very appealing in the XXI century.
