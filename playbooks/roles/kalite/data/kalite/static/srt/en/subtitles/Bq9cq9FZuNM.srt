1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,950
   

2
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,890
We have the function f of
x is equal to x minus

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,230
1 squared minus 2.

4
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,450
And they've constrained the
domain to x being less

5
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:10,600
than or equal to 1.

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,760
So we have the left half
of a parabola right here.

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,410
They've constrained so that
it's not a full U parabola.

8
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,470
And I'll let you think about
why that would make finding

9
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:21,320
the inverse difficult.

10
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,150
But let's try to find
the inverse here.

11
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,500
And a good place to start
-- let's just set y

12
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,830
being equal to f of x.

13
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,200
You could say y is equal to
f of x or we could just

14
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:35,430
write that y is equal to x
minus 1 squared minus 2.

15
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,260
We know it's 4.

16
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,960
x is less than or equal to 1.

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,030
But right now we have y
solved for in terms of x.

18
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,890
Or we've solved for y, to find
the inverse we're going to want

19
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,980
to solve for x in terms of y.

20
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,140
And we're going to
constrain y similarly.

21
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,280
We could look at the graph and
we could say, well, in this

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,000
graph right here, this is
defined for y being greater

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,040
than or equal to negative 2.

24
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,610
So we can maybe put in
parentheses y being greater

25
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,880
than or equal to negative 2.

26
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,480
Because this is going to be --
right now this is our range.

27
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,580
But when we swap the x's
and y's, this is going

28
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:13,350
to be our domain.

29
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,070
So let's just keep that in
parentheses right there.

30
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,150
So let's solve for x.

31
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,030
So that's all you have to
do, to find the inverse.

32
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,230
Solve for x and make sure
you keep track of the

33
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,890
domains and the ranges.

34
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:24,500
So, let's see.

35
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,520
We could add 2 to both
sides of this equation.

36
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,440
We get y plus 2 is equal
to x minus 1 squared.

37
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,640
Minus 2, plus 2, so
those cancel out.

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,020
And then, I'm just going to
switch to the y constraint.

39
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,286
Because now it's not clear
what we're -- whether x is

40
00:01:41,286 --> 00:01:42,040
the domain or the range.

41
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,790
But we know by the end
of this problem, y is

42
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:44,670
going to be the domain.

43
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,130
So let's just swap this here.

44
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:50,090
So, 4 for y is greater than
or equal to negative 2.

45
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,600
And we could also say, in
parentheses, x is less than 1.

46
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,680
This is -- we haven't solved it
explicitly for either one, so

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,050
we'll keep both of them
around right now.

48
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:02,780
Now, to solve for x, you might
be tempted to just take the

49
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,000
square root of both sides here.

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,410
And you wouldn't be
completely wrong.

51
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,850
But we have to be very,
very, very careful here.

52
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:11,000
And this might not be something
that you've ever seen before.

53
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,410
So this is an
interesting point here.

54
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:19,340
We want the right side
to just be x minus 1.

55
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,720
That's our goal here, in taking
the square root of both sides.

56
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,270
We want to just have an
x minus 1 over there.

57
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:31,090
Now, is x minus 1 a positive
or a negative number?

58
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,350
Well, we've constrained our
x's to being less than 1.

59
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,320
So we're dealing only in
a situation where x is

60
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,610
less than or equal to 1.

61
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:44,760
So if x is less than or equal
to 1, this is negative.

62
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,000
This is negative.

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,200
So we want to take the
negative square root.

64
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,390
Let me just be very clear here.

65
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:56,660
If I take negative 3 -- I take
negative 3 and I were to square

66
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,780
it, that is equal to 9.

67
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,830
Now, if we take the square root
of 9 -- if we take the square

68
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,620
root -- let's say we take
the square root of both

69
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,430
sides of this equation.

70
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,280
And our goal is to get
back to negative 3.

71
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,200
If we take the
positive square root.

72
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,260
If we just take the principle
root of both sides of that, we

73
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,410
would get 3 is equal to 3.

74
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,740
But that's not our goal.

75
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,660
We want to get back
to negative 3.

76
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:28,050
So we want to take the negative
square root of our square.

77
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,900
So because this expression is
negative and we want to get

78
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,360
back to this expression, we
want to get back to this x

79
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,420
minus 1, we need to take the
negative square root

80
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,050
of both sides.

81
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,500
You can always -- every
perfect square has a

82
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,250
positive or a negative root.

83
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,090
The principle root
is a positive root.

84
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,870
But here we want to take the
negative root because this

85
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,340
expression right here is
going to be negative.

86
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,460
And that's what we
want to solve for.

87
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,390
So let's take the negative
root of both sides.

88
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:58,870
So you get the negative square
root of y plus 2 is equal to

89
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,340
-- and I'll just write this
extra step here, just so you

90
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,240
realize what we're doing.

91
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,320
Is equal to the negative square
root, the negative square

92
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,660
root of x minus 1 squared.

93
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,310
For y is greater than or
equal to negative 2.

94
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,410
And x is less than
or equal to 1.

95
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,650
That's why the whole reason
we're going to take the

96
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,450
negative square there.

97
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,880
And then this expression
right here -- so let me

98
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,220
just write the left again.

99
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:29,470
Negative square root of y plus
2 is equal to the negative

100
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,190
square root of x minus 1
squared is just going

101
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,350
to be x minus 1.

102
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,525
It's just going to
be x minus one.

103
00:04:36,525 --> 00:04:39,060
x minus 1 squared is
some positive quantity.

104
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,730
The negative root is the
negative number that you

105
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,570
have to square to get it.

106
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,960
To get x minus 1 squared.

107
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,470
So that just becomes x minus 1.

108
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,370
Hopefully that doesn't
confuse you too much.

109
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,170
We just want to get rid
of this squared sign.

110
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,080
We want to make sure we
get the negative version.

111
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,515
We don't want the positive
version, which would

112
00:04:53,515 --> 00:04:54,810
have been 1 minus x.

113
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,020
Don't want to confuse you.

114
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,350
So here, we now just
have to solve for x.

115
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:58,910
Add 1.

116
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,920
And let me write the 4.

117
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,230
y is greater than or
equal to negative 2.

118
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,020
Add 1 to both sides.

119
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:13,470
You get negative square root of
y plus 2 plus 1 is equal to x

120
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:17,320
for y is greater than or
equal to negative 2.

121
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,120
Or, if we want to rewrite it,
we could say that x is equal to

122
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:28,231
the negative square root of y
plus 2 plus 1 for y is greater

123
00:05:28,231 --> 00:05:29,120
than or equal to negative 2.

124
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,840
Or if we want to write it in
terms, as an inverse function

125
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,140
of y, we could say -- so we
could say that f inverse of y

126
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:42,270
is equal to this, or f inverse
of y is equal to the negative

127
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:48,500
square root of y plus 2 plus
1, for y is greater than

128
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,830
or equal to negative 2.

129
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,230
And now, if we wanted
this in terms of x.

130
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,300
If we just want to rename
y as x we just replace

131
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,980
the y's with x's.

132
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:02,250
So we could write f
inverse of x -- I'm just

133
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,390
renaming the y here.

134
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:09,570
Is equal to the negative square
root of x plus 2 plus 1 for,

135
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,580
I'm just renaming the y, for
x is greater than or

136
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,930
equal to negative 2.

137
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,150
And if we were to graph
this, let's see.

138
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,670
If we started at x is equal
to negative 2, this is 0.

139
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,560
So the point negative 2, 1 is
going to be on our graph.

140
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,910
So negative 2, 1 is going
to be on our graph.

141
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:30,590
Let's see, if we go to negative
1, negative 1 this will

142
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,430
become a negative 1.

143
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,650
Negative 1 is 0 on our graph.

144
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,820
Negative 1, 0 is on our graph.

145
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,500
And then, let's see.

146
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,990
If we were to do, if we were
to put x is equal to 2 here.

147
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:46,020
So x is equal to 2 is 4.

148
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,550
4 square root,
principle root is 2.

149
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:52,170
It becomes a negative 2 So
it becomes 2, negative 1.

150
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,130
So that's on our
graph right there.

151
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,850
So the graph is going
to look something like

152
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,110
this, of f inverse.

153
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:02,340
It's going to look something
like that right there.

154
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,100
As you can see, it is a
reflection of our original

155
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,030
f of x along the line
y is equal to x.

156
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:13,070
Along the line y is equal to x.

157
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,560
Because we've essentially just
swapped the x and the y.

158
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,390
This is about as hard of
an inverse problem that

159
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,540
I expect you to see.

160
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,190
Especially in a precalculus
class because it really is

161
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,790
tricky to realize that you
have to take the negative

162
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,580
square root here.

163
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,800
Because the way our domain was
constrained, this value right

164
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,830
here is going to be negative.

165
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,330
So to solve for it, you want to
have the negative square root.
