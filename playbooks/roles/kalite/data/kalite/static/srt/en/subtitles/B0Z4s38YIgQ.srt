1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660
   

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,810
Two different hoses are being
used to fill a fish pond.

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,220
Used together, the
two hoses take 12

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,800
minutes to fill the pond.

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,510
If used alone, one hose is
able to fill the pond 10

6
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,090
minutes faster than the other.

7
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,930
So 10 minutes faster than
the other hose.

8
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:22,740
How long does each hose take
to fill the pond by itself?

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,260
So let's think about
each of the hoses.

10
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:30,480
We have a faster hose, and then
we have a slower hose.

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,220
And let's say that the faster
hose fills the pond.

12
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:40,760
Let's say it takes him
f minutes per pond.

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,840
   

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,100
Now how long is it going to
take the slower hose?

15
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,900
Well, the faster hose does
it in 10 minutes less.

16
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,590
It's 10 minutes faster.

17
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,400
So the slower hose is going
to take 10 minutes more.

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:02,570
So the slower hose is going to
take f plus 10 minutes per

19
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,019
fish pond or per pond.

20
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:07,630
Now this is in minutes per pond,
but if we want to be

21
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,880
able to add rates together, we
should really think about in

22
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,580
terms of ponds per minute.

23
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,280
So let's rewrite each
of these statements

24
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,050
as ponds per minute.

25
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:18,900
You could write this as f
minutes per 1 pond or f plus

26
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,530
10 minutes per 1 pond.

27
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,710
And if you just take the inverse
of each of these

28
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:30,250
statements, these ratios are
equivalent to saying 1 pond

29
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,000
per f minutes.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,820
So it's really not saying
anything else.

31
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,020
I'm just inverting the ratio.

32
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,905
Or you could think of it as
1/f ponds per minute.

33
00:01:38,905 --> 00:01:41,590
   

34
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,550
Same logic right here.

35
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:52,260
We could essentially rewrite
this ratio as 1 over f plus 10

36
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,910
ponds per minute.

37
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,400
So now we have the rate
of the faster hose.

38
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,840
We have the rate of
the slower hose.

39
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,710
How many pounds per minute
for the faster hose?

40
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,820
How many pounds per minute
for the slower hose?

41
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,870
If we add these two rates,
we'll know the ponds per

42
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,240
minute when they're
acting together.

43
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:15,870
So if we have 1/f ponds per
minute plus 1 over f plus 10

44
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,670
ponds per minute.

45
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,690
This is the faster hose, this
is the slower hose.

46
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,600
This'll tell us how
many ponds for

47
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,590
minute they can do together.

48
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,540
Now, we know that information.

49
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:31,450
They say the two hoses
take 12 minutes.

50
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,630
So let me write that
over here.

51
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,440
So combined.

52
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:42,100
The combined take 12
minutes per pond.

53
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,370
So what is their combined rate
in terms of ponds per minute?

54
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,660
So you could view this as
12 minutes per one pond.

55
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,500
You could take the inverse of
this or take the ratio in

56
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,170
terms of ponds per minute
instead and

57
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,380
you get 1/12 minutes.

58
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:01,140
Sorry, 1/12 ponds per minute.

59
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,790
In one minute combined, they'll
fill 1/12 of a pond.

60
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:06,880
Which makes complete sense.

61
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,190
Because it takes them
12 minutes to

62
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:08,920
fill the whole thing.

63
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,050
So in one minute they'll
only do 1/12 of it.

64
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:14,600
So this is their combined rate
in ponds per minute.

65
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,860
This is also their combined
rate in ponds per minute.

66
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,610
So this is going to
be equal to 1/12.

67
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,430
And now we just have to solve
for f and then f plus 10 is

68
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,770
going to be how long it
takes the slower hose.

69
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,020
So let's multiply.

70
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,850
Let's see what we could do.

71
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:35,320
We could multiply both sides of
this equation times f and

72
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,050
times f plus 10.

73
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,290
So let's do that.

74
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,630
So I'm going to multiply both
sides of this equation times f

75
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:46,480
and f plus 10 times both
sides of this equation.

76
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,720
So f and f plus 10.

77
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,990
Scroll down a little bit.

78
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:55,420
Scroll to the left, so we
have some real estate.

79
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,210
So let's distribute this
f times f plus 10.

80
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:02,190
So if we multiply f times f plus
10 times 1/f, that f and

81
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,690
that f will cancel out and we're
just going to be left

82
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,700
with an f plus 10.

83
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,190
That's when you multiply
that term times the f

84
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,750
times f plus 10.

85
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,735
Now, when you multiply this
term, when you multiply 1 over

86
00:04:14,735 --> 00:04:19,310
f plus 10 times f times f plus
10, this and this will cancel

87
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,310
out and you're just
left with an f.

88
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:25,650
So you have plus f is equal
to-- and you have over 12.

89
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,880
Actually, well in a second, let
me multiply all sides of

90
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,890
this equation by 12.

91
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,230
I'll do that next in a second.

92
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:34,650
So let's just say this is going
to be equal to 1/12

93
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,930
times f squared.

94
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,640
   

95
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,880
f times f is f squared.

96
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,640
Plus 10f.

97
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,230
And now let's just multiply
both sides of

98
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,280
this equation by 12.

99
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,700
I could've done it in the last
step so that we don't have any

100
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,950
fractions here.

101
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,740
   

102
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,750
And so the left-hand side
we get 12 times f.

103
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:02,770
We get 12f plus 120 plus 12f.

104
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:06,070
The right-hand side, that and
that cancels out and you are

105
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,840
left with f squared plus 10f.

106
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,060
And now we have a quadratic.

107
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,390
We just have to get it into
a form that we know how to

108
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,230
manipulate or deal with.

109
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,860
Before that, we can
simplify it.

110
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,070
We have a 12f and a 12f.

111
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:26,400
So this becomes 24f plus
120 is equal to f

112
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,420
squared plus 10f.

113
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,120
And then let's get all
of this stuff out of

114
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,900
the left-hand side.

115
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,540
They'll get all on the
right-hand side.

116
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,940
So from both sides of this
equation, let's subtract 24f

117
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,270
and a negative 120
or minus 120.

118
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:45,965
So you have minus
24f minus 120.

119
00:05:45,965 --> 00:05:48,020
The left-hand side
just becomes 0.

120
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,530
That was the whole point.

121
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:52,470
Right-hand side is f squared.

122
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:58,380
10 minus 24f is negative 14f.

123
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:02,550
Minus 120.

124
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,170
Now we could factor this.

125
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,850
Let's see, if you do 20 timea--
yeah, that looks like

126
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:07,330
it would work.

127
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:11,930
So negative 20 and 6, when you
take their product, give you

128
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,420
negative 120.

129
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:17,460
And negative 20 plus
6 is negative 14.

130
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,240
So we could factor this
right-hand side as 0 is equal

131
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,810
to f minus 20 times f plus 6.

132
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,170
When you multiply negative 20
times 6, you get negative 120.

133
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:33,180
Negative 20 plus 6
is negative 14.

134
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,830
And the only way that that's
going to be equal to 0 is if f

135
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:45,140
minus 20 is equal to 0 or
f plus 6 is equal to 0.

136
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,470
Add 20 to both sides
of this equation.

137
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,680
You get f is equal to 20.

138
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,720
Remember, f is how many minutes
does it take for the

139
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,650
fast hose to fill the pond.

140
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,130
And then, if you take
this one, you

141
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,410
subtract 6 from both sides.

142
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,670
You get f is equal
to negative 6.

143
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,730
Now, when we're talking about
how many minutes does it take

144
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:02,460
for the fast hose to fill the
pond, it doesn't make any

145
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,650
sense to say that it
takes it negative 6

146
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,040
minutes to fill the pond.

147
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,790
So we can't use this answer.

148
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,270
We need a positive answer.

149
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,810
So this is how many minutes it
takes the fast hose to fill

150
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,780
the pond. f is equal to 20.

151
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,530
So this right here, the
faster hose takes

152
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:22,000
20 minutes per pond.

153
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,080
I'll write it here.

154
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,610
20 minutes per pond
is the fast hose.

155
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,950
And then the slower hose, it
takes 10 minutes more.

156
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,860
It's f plus 10.

157
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,160
So it takes 30 minutes
per pond.

158
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,650
And we're done.

159
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,950
I don't want to confuse
you with this stuff.

160
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,570
The faster hose takes
20 minutes.

161
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:42,010
Slower hose takes 30
minutes per pond.

162
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:45,150
If they were to do it together,
it would take 12

163
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,410
minutes, which is a little
bit more than half.

164
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,930
If you had two faster hoses,
it would take 10 minutes.

165
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,780
But this guy's a little bit
slower, so it's taking you a

166
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,610
little bit more than
10 minutes.

167
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,760
So it makes sense.

168
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,940
It takes you 12 minutes when
they're working together.

169
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,333
