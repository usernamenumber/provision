1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,750
   

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:07,830
16 fluid ounces plus 3 pints
plus 4 quarts is equal to how

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,640
many gallons?

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,140
Now the one unfamiliar thing
here that we haven't seen

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,940
before is this 16
fluid ounces.

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,090
We've seen ounces before,
but not fluid ounces.

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,280
And to make things confusing,
they're actually very

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,970
different things.

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,030
Fluid ounces are a measure
of a volume.

10
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:32,420
Fluid ounces measure volume,
just like cups and pints and

11
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,570
quarts and gallons do.

12
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:40,200
While ounces measure weight.

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,250
And this might make it
kind of confusing,

14
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,690
or maybe less confusing.

15
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,310
But it also happens that a
fluid ounce of water, at

16
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,360
standard temperature and
pressure, is going to weigh a

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,680
little bit more than
an actual ounce.

18
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,820
So that's why they're
kind of close.

19
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,330
A fluid ounce of water is not
that different in weight than

20
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,880
an ounce, but they're two

21
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,100
fundamentally different things.

22
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,060
This is volume.

23
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,310
This is weight.

24
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,630
Now a fluid ounce, there's
many ways you

25
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:08,280
could think of this.

26
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,680
One is that you have 8-- let me
write it here-- you have 8

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,130
fluid ounces per cup.

28
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:24,420
Or, since there are 2 cups per
pint, you also have 16 fluid

29
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,810
ounces per pint.

30
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:29,940
You could view it either way.

31
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,960
Or you could say that you have
32 fluid ounces per quart.

32
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,340
Or you can multiply that times
4, and that's how many fluid

33
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,060
ounces you have per gallon.

34
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,230
Ounces, which is a unit
of weight, you have

35
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:44,430
16 ounces per pound.

36
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,460
And since I told you that a
fluid ounce is a little bit

37
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,850
more that an ounce, you can kind
of figure out that, hey,

38
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,780
a pint of water, at standard
temperature and pressure and

39
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,790
all of that, will weigh
a little bit more.

40
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,060
Almost a pound, or actually a
little bit more than a pound,

41
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,200
but roughly equal to a pound.

42
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,340
So that's something that
might make things

43
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,640
simpler, or more difficult.

44
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,630
Now let's actually tackle
the problem.

45
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,820
So we have 16 fluid ounces.

46
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,890
I just told you that there are
16 fluid ounces per pint.

47
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,780
So 16 fluid ounces, let
me write over here.

48
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:27,280
So 16 fluid ounces times-- now
we want the fluid ounces to

49
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,280
cancel out, so we want fluid
ounces in the denominator

50
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,100
times fluid ounces.

51
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,420
Now how many fluid ounces
are there per pint?

52
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,670
We want a pint in the numerator
so that this and

53
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,830
this cancel out.

54
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:44,810
We just saw it, there are 16
fluid ounces per pint, or that

55
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,010
1/16 of a pint per
fluid ounce.

56
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:48,910
Either way.

57
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,360
But we see this and this
will cancel out.

58
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,350
And so 16 over 16, because 16
times 1, divided by 16, 1

59
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,060
equal to 1 pint.

60
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:58,640
And we know that.

61
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,230
16 fluid ounces equal a pint.

62
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:05,340
If we have 16 fluid ounces right
over here, this is 1

63
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,150
pint right over there.

64
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,760
So we have 1 pint plus another
3 pints, so if we were to add

65
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,690
all of this part right here
together, 1 pint plus 3 pints

66
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,940
is 4 pints.

67
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,540
   

68
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,553
Now we have 4 pints, let's
convert to quarts.

69
00:03:21,553 --> 00:03:24,170
   

70
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,980
Now we know that there are
2 pints per quart.

71
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,980
Or we can view it this way, we
want the pints to cancel out,

72
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:38,550
or 1 quart is 2 pints, or
1/2 quart per pint.

73
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,700
And we wrote it this way instead
of 2 over 1 because we

74
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,015
wanted the quarts in the
numerator, and the pints in

75
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:45,780
the denominator, so that that,
and that, cancel out.

76
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,580
And it makes sense.

77
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,650
If you're converting a smaller
unit to a larger unit you're

78
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:49,700
going to have fewer of them.

79
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,680
So you're essentially
dividing by 2.

80
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:58,200
So 4 times 1/2, or 4 divided
by 2, is equal to 2 quarts.

81
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,560
So this whole piece right here,
these 4 pints, are equal

82
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,200
to 2 quarts.

83
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,060
That's 2 quarts.

84
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,750
And you could visualize it.

85
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,990
2 of these combined make 1
quart, so 4 of them is going

86
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,010
to be 2 quarts.

87
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,570
So you have 2 quarts here,
plus another 4 quarts.

88
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:18,519
So this entire quantity of 2
quarts plus this 4 quarts are

89
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:22,070
going to be 6 quarts.

90
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,080
So the entire quantity
is 6 quarts.

91
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,850
And we have to convert
that to gallons.

92
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:26,660
So let me write it right here.

93
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,970
We have 6 quarts and we want
to convert to gallons.

94
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:36,320
So we want gallons and the
numerator, and we want quarts

95
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,210
in the denominator, so that it
cancels out with this quarts

96
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,730
when we multiply them.

97
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,380
And how many quarts are
there in a gallon?

98
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,840
Or 1 gallon is 4 quarts.

99
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,400
Or 1/4 of a gallon per quart.

100
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,100
Now we can multiply.

101
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,430
The quarts cancel out.

102
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:59,190
You have 6 times 1/4, which
is 6/4 gallons.

103
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,460
And now we can simplify this.

104
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,250
We can divide the numerator
and the denominator by 2.

105
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,540
This is the same thing
as 3/2 gallons.

106
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,950
So 3/2 would be an acceptable
answer right here.

107
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,280
This would be 3/2 gallons.

108
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,620
If you want to write it as a
mixed number, 3 divided by 2

109
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,190
is 1 with the remainder 1.

110
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,360
So it's 1 and 1/2 gallons.

111
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,610
Either one would be an
acceptable answer.

112
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:22,667
