1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,600
Find the slope of the line pictured on the graph.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:11,540
So the slope of a line is defined to be rise over run.

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:22,639
Or you can also view it as change in y over change in x.

4
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:25,937
And let me show you what that means.

5
00:00:25,937 --> 00:00:28,862
So let's start as some arbitrary point on this line.

6
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,859
And they kind of highlight some of these points.

7
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:33,135
So let's start at one of these points right over here.

8
00:00:33,135 --> 00:00:38,661
So if we wanted to start at one of these points. Let's say we want to change our x in the positive direction.

9
00:00:38,661 --> 00:00:43,677
So we want to go to the right. So let's say we want to go from this point to this point over here.

10
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:46,184
How much do we have to move in x?

11
00:00:46,184 --> 00:00:49,250
So if we want to move in x, we have to go from this point to this point.

12
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,667
We are going from -3 to 0.

13
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:56,133
So we are going from -3 to 0.

14
00:00:56,133 --> 00:00:59,745
So our change in x, and this triangle, that's delta.

15
00:00:59,745 --> 00:01:04,575
That means change in. Our change in x is equal to 3.

16
00:01:04,575 --> 00:01:08,383
So our change in x over here is equal to 3.

17
00:01:08,383 --> 00:01:12,980
So what was our change in y when our change in x is equal to 3?

18
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:18,971
Well when we moved from this point to this point, our x value changed by 3.

19
00:01:18,971 --> 00:01:20,800
But what happened to our y value?

20
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,200
Well, our y value went down. It went from positive 3 to positive 2.

21
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,538
Our y value went down by 1.

22
00:01:28,538 --> 00:01:32,733
So our change in y is equal to -1.

23
00:01:32,733 --> 00:01:36,015
So we rose -1. We actually went down.

24
00:01:36,015 --> 00:01:41,355
So our rise is -1 when our run, our change in x, is 3.

25
00:01:41,355 --> 00:01:45,349
The change in y over the change in x is -1 over 3.

26
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:53,337
Or we could say that our slope is -1/3.

27
00:01:53,337 --> 00:01:55,844
It is -1/3.

28
00:01:55,844 --> 00:01:59,513
And I want to show you that we can do this with any two points on the line.

29
00:01:59,513 --> 00:02:02,300
We can even go further than 3 in the x direction.

30
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,829
Let's go the other way. Let's start at this point right over here.

31
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:10,566
And then move backwards to this point over here just to show you we will still get the same result.

32
00:02:10,566 --> 00:02:15,303
So to go from this point to that point, what is our change in x?

33
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:20,736
So our change in x is this right over here.

34
00:02:20,736 --> 00:02:22,454
Our change in x is that distance right over there.

35
00:02:22,454 --> 00:02:26,800
We started at 3 and we went to -3. We went back 6.

36
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,442
Over here, our change in x is equal to -6.

37
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:36,386
We starting at this point now. So over here our change in x is -6.

38
00:02:36,386 --> 00:02:40,984
And then when our change in x is -6, when we start at this point and we move 6 back

39
00:02:40,984 --> 00:02:43,724
What is our change of y to get to that point?

40
00:02:43,724 --> 00:02:48,043
Well, our y-value went from 1, that was our y-value at this point,

41
00:02:48,143 --> 00:02:51,804
And then we go back to this point our y-value is 3.

42
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:54,312
So now our y-value is 3. So what did we do?

43
00:02:54,312 --> 00:02:58,770
We moved up by 2. Our change in y is equal to 2.

44
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:02,467
So over here, our change in y is equal to 2.

45
00:03:02,467 --> 00:03:07,455
Slope is change in y over change in x. Or, rise over run.

46
00:03:07,455 --> 00:03:13,120
Change in y is just rise. Change in x is just run, how much you're moving in the horizontal direction.

47
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:23,848
So rise over run in this example here is going to be 2 over -6, which is the same thing as -1/3.

48
00:03:23,848 --> 00:03:25,333
And you could verify it for yourself.

49
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:30,303
Take any of these two points. Start at one of these two points and figure out what is the run to get

50
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,322
to the next point. And then what is the rise to get to the next point.

51
00:03:33,322 --> 00:03:35,667
And for any line, the slope won't change.

52
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:36,990
Let me do it again.

53
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:41,913
Over here, we had to move in the +3 direction. So that is our run.

54
00:03:41,913 --> 00:03:46,371
So this right here is +3. That's our run. But what's our rise?

55
00:03:46,371 --> 00:03:50,644
Well, we actually went down. So we have a negative rise. Our rise is -1.

56
00:03:50,644 --> 00:03:54,034
So we have -1 as our rise. We went down.

57
00:03:54,034 --> 99:59:59,999
Our run was +3. So our slope here is -1/3.
