00:00:00,517 --> 00:00:06,427
Let's see if we can write twelve point nine eight as a mixed number.

2
00:00:06,427 --> 00:00:10,096
So, the first thing you might want to realize here is that this is the exact same thing

3
00:00:10,096 --> 00:00:14,202
as twelve plus zero point nine eight.

4
00:00:14,202 --> 00:00:18,594
And this simplifies it, because then we just have to write it as twelve and some fraction that's the same

5
00:00:18,594 --> 00:00:23,721
thing as zero point nine eight. So, if we can write zero point nine eight as a fraction

6
00:00:23,721 --> 00:00:26,305
then we can, we're essentially, we're almost done!

7
00:00:26,305 --> 00:00:27,946
So let's see if we can do that.

8
00:00:27,946 --> 00:00:30,762
So, this nine right over here is in the tenths place.

9
00:00:30,762 --> 00:00:36,382
I'll just write it like that. Tenths place. And this right over here is in the hundredths place.

10
00:00:36,382 --> 00:00:40,734
It's in the hundredths place. So you can view zero point nine eight two different ways.

11
00:00:40,734 --> 00:00:43,812
You can view it as nine tenths. Nine tenths.

12
00:00:43,812 --> 00:00:53,054
That's this part over here, nine tenths plus plus eight hundredths, plus eight hundredths.

13
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:59,601
And if you want to find a common denominator that would be the same thing as ninety over one hundred

14
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:07,436
plus eight over one hundred. Plus eight over one hundred, which is equal to ninety-eight over one hundred.

15
00:01:07,436 --> 00:01:15,455
Equal to ninety-eight over one hundred. And so, zero point nine eight is ninety-eight hundredths.

16
00:01:15,455 --> 00:01:22,235
And another way you could have said that is, "Look, this space over here is in the hundredths place. And so this is ninety-eight hundreds, or ninety-eight hundredths."

17
00:01:22,235 --> 00:01:25,468
So, you could have skipped this right over here. So, if we wanted to write this as a mixed number,

18
00:01:25,468 --> 00:01:32,963
we could just write it as twelve and, instead of zero point nine eight, twelve and ninety-eight hundredths.

19
00:01:32,963 --> 00:01:37,392
Now, we haven't reduced this to lowest terms. So, let's se if we can simplify this.

20
00:01:37,392 --> 00:01:42,697
Ninety-eight is divisible by two, and so is a hundred. So, lets divide both of them

21
00:01:42,697 --> 00:01:47,064
by two. They have that common factor. So, we can divide both of them by two.

22
00:01:47,064 --> 00:01:52,020
And so, this is the same thing as twelve and ninety-eight divided by two is nine is forty-nine.

23
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,744
A hundred divided by two is fifty. And I think that's about as far as we can do.

24
00:01:57,794 --> 00:02:01,130
Forty-nine's factors, it's divisible by seven, but fifty isn't.

25
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:06,614
So we've put it in lowest terms. So, twelve point nine eight can be written as a mixed number,

26
00:02:06,614 --> 00:02:11,000
twelve and forty-nine fiftieths.
