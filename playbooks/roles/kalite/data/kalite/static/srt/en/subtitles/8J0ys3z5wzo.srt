1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,530
   

2
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,890
Let's talk a little bit more
about the comparison between

3
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:09,660
Sn1 and Sn2 reactions, and maybe
we can also talk about

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,760
what type of conditions make
one or the other more

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,110
favorable, especially
the solvent.

6
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,550
We've talked about it a little
bit, but we'll go into a

7
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:16,760
little bit more detail.

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:22,200
So just as a bit of a review,
an Sn1 reaction, you might

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,000
have some type of a-- let me
just draw it like this.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,410
So you'll have some
carbon that's

11
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,610
attached to three things.

12
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,720
I'm making these three things
just arbitrary colors.

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,549
They could be other
carbons, CH3.

14
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:33,830
It could be hydrogens.

15
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,480
It could be other things.

16
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,640
And then it's also attached
to a leaving group.

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,660
Let me do this in a color that
I haven't used yet: in pink.

18
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,280
And then you also have a
nucleophile floating around.

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,700
That'll be our nucleophile.

20
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,740
It has one excess electron.

21
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,270
It has a negative charge.

22
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:59,660
And in an Sn1 reaction, the
first step only involves one

23
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,500
of the reactants, one
of the reagents.

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,720
That's why it's called Sn1.

25
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,590
So in the very first step, the
nucleophile just waits

26
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,520
passively while the leaving
group leaves.

27
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,570
So maybe there's an electron
right there, the leaving group

28
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,850
already has an electron.

29
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,130
It swipes one, so it has to be
reasonably electronegative.

30
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,480
It swipes one from that carbon,
and so once it does

31
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,440
that, our situation will
look like this.

32
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,830
You have your substrate.

33
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,310
It now just lost an electron.

34
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:31,030
It lost that electron, so it
now has a positive charge.

35
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:34,820
Let me add that little
trace of something.

36
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,760
Let me erase this right here
so you don't think that

37
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,290
electron is still there.

38
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:41,210
So it now has a positive
charge.

39
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,540
The leaving group, which was
neutral, took an electron.

40
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,340
So it out now has a
negative charge.

41
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,180
The leaving group now took an
electron, so it now has at

42
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,180
least two valence
electrons there.

43
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,170
It has a negative charge,
probably a lot more.

44
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,050
And then in the next step, this
nucleophile-- so let me

45
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:59,110
copy and paste this.

46
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,632
That's not what I
wanted to do.

47
00:02:00,632 --> 00:02:03,460
Let me copy and paste
it again.

48
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,620
So copy and paste.

49
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,090
OK.

50
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,180
So that thing that was waiting
patiently during the

51
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,720
rate-determining steps
says, hey, there's

52
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,100
a carbocation there.

53
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,070
I'm a nucleophile.

54
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,760
I'm not a strong nucleophile in
the case of an Sn1, but I

55
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,320
still like giving away electrons
to nucleuses.

56
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,770
I love nucleases.

57
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,190
I see a positive carbocation
there.

58
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,520
Actually, a carbocation is
positive by definition, so let

59
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,090
me give my electrons to him.

60
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,150
   

61
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:39,320
And in the very last step, we
have a situation where this

62
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,360
guy-- let me copy and
paste this again.

63
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,310
Let me copy and let me paste.

64
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,230
That guy is bonded to
the nucleophile.

65
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,890
   

66
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,300
Since the nucleophile gave the
electron to this carbon, the

67
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,770
carbon doesn't have
a charge anymore.

68
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:57,840
Since the nucleophile lost that

69
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,800
electron, it's now neutral.

70
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,940
So you have it bonded to the
nucleophile, and, of course,

71
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,650
you have the leaving
group still here

72
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,000
with a negative charge.

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,690
We've hinted at this a little
bit, but in order for this

74
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:17,650
step to happen on its own with
only this reagent happening

75
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,300
spontaneously to some degree,
or for it to just happen.

76
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,690
And we won't talk
about the rates.

77
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,520
And it won't necessarily happen
fast, but in order for

78
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,940
this to happen at all, this
has to be a stable

79
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,910
carbocation.

80
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,760
And we've seen before that in
order for this to be a stable

81
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,540
carbocation, it has to be bonded
to things that are

82
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,230
willing to lend it some
electrons so it's not super

83
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,270
hungry for electrons.

84
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:43,220
And in order for that to happen,
this carbocation right

85
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,870
here has to be tertiary.

86
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,190
Tertiary is ideal.

87
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,710
Tertiary carbocation means that
these three things over

88
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,290
here are all carbons
or carbon chains.

89
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,450
So ideally, it would be tertiary
and secondary will

90
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,650
also work if at least two of
these guys are carbon.

91
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,830
That'll also work if the solvent
is favorable, if the

92
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,290
environment we're dealing with
is a favorable environment.

93
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,840
If only one of these were
carbon, so if this was a

94
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,630
primary carbocation or this was
a methyl carbocation where

95
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,890
nothing here is a carbon,
then you're unlikely

96
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,060
to have an Sn1 reaction.

97
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,709
Now, on the other side of the
picture, Sn2 reaction, this is

98
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:24,040
the one where you have a super
strong nucleophile, or at

99
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,020
least a strong nucleophile, and
the whole reaction happens

100
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,740
in one step involving both
of the reagents.

101
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:36,305
So you start here with
your leaving group.

102
00:04:36,305 --> 00:04:38,580
The way you can think about it,
Sn1, the leaving group is

103
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,750
the thing that does something
first. In Sn2, it all happens

104
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,940
at once, but the nucleophile's
kind of the aggressor.

105
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,610
   

106
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,500
It really wants to give that
electron away badly.

107
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,740
So in the very first step, it
comes in here and gives it to

108
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,035
that carbon, even though that
carbon didn't necessarily want

109
00:04:55,035 --> 00:04:56,920
it that badly.

110
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,970
It would have a partial positive
charge if this thing

111
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,400
is really electronegative and
might be hogging this electron

112
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,026
already, but that thing that it
was already hogging, now it

113
00:05:04,026 --> 00:05:05,350
could say, hey, you already
got an electron.

114
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,810
I can take it from you.

115
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,240
And so in literally one
step, we end up with

116
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,490
something like this.

117
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,530
   

118
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,970
Actually, let me just
redraw that.

119
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,680
So we have our leaving
group has left.

120
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,180
   

121
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,950
It's taken the electron
that the

122
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,600
carbon didn't need anymore.

123
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,030
So it now has this electron and
that one and maybe more,

124
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,380
and it has a negative charge.

125
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:34,370
And now this carbon is attached
to the blue thing.

126
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:38,040
I'll just draw the purple thing,
and maybe in back, it's

127
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,330
attached to the orange thing.

128
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,730
Let me draw it so you can see
what I'm talking about, so the

129
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,890
blue thing and then
the purple thing.

130
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,360
And then the nucleophile had
come from the other direction,

131
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,230
so now it's also bonded
to the nucleophile.

132
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:54,340
The nucleophile is giving an
electron, so it loses its

133
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:54,945
negative charge.

134
00:05:54,945 --> 00:05:57,400
And essentially, the negative
charge gets transferred to the

135
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,890
leaving group, which is able to
take an electron, and then

136
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,000
that carbon in the middle
stays neutral.

137
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,060
And we saw before that this
can only reasonably happen

138
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,990
with a strong nucleophile.

139
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,640
That has to be a strong
nucleophile, and there can't

140
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,420
be a lot of steric hindrance.

141
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,730
These things can't
really block this

142
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,290
nucleophile from attacking.

143
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:23,740
So this will work best if this
is a methyl or primary carbon.

144
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,150
And if the conditions are just
right and if the nucleophile

145
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:32,880
is strong enough,
maybe secondary,

146
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,680
maybe a secondary carbon.

147
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,250
Because once you have too many
carbons or big carbon chains

148
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,390
over here, then it blocks
the nucleophile.

149
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,190
It cannot attack.

150
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,060
If these are all hydrogens,
there's a lot of space for

151
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,210
this nucleophile to attack.

152
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,400
If only one of these are carbon,
still a lot of space.

153
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,490
Now, that's just kind of a
general comparison, and it

154
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,520
gives you some clues.

155
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,600
Weak nucleophile, you're
dealing with Sn1.

156
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,760
Strong nucleophile, Sn2.

157
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,550
If this is a tertiary or
secondary carbon, so if it's

158
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,830
bonded to a lot of other
carbons, Sn1

159
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,960
should be in your brain.

160
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,220
If this isn't bonded to a lot
a carbons and you have a

161
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,740
strong nucleophile, Sn2 should
be in your brain.

162
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,550
And now the last thing you
should have to think about is

163
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,970
the solvent itself.

164
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,700
What are these reagents
actually dissolved in.

165
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,210
So let's think about it.

166
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:20,670
So in either an Sn1 or an Sn2
reaction, we're dealing with

167
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,300
things that have charge.

168
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,180
And in general, if you're
dealing with ions or things

169
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:30,210
that have charge, they're going
to be more soluble in

170
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,680
polar solvents because the
charge likes to be around

171
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,670
other things with charge so that
they can mix and match.

172
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:41,050
So in both situations, you want
to have polar solvents.

173
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:44,740
   

174
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,990
And you are familiar with
polar solvents.

175
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,730
Examples of polar solvents
are, well,

176
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,170
water is a polar solvent.

177
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:55,500
H2O, and it's polar because
oxygen is so electronegative

178
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,740
it hogs electrons.

179
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,590
So you have a partial negative
charge on the oxygen side and

180
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:07,870
partial positive charges
on the hydrogen side.

181
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,890
Another example of a polar
solvent that you may have not

182
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:18,620
seen before is something
like diethyl ether.

183
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,800
So diethyl ether would
look like this.

184
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:29,350
CH2, CH3, CH2, CH3.

185
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,050
And I know we havn't
named ethers yet.

186
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:31,670
Let me write this.

187
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:37,630
This is diethyl-- let me make
sure I get that "y" right.

188
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,320
   

189
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,510
This is diethyl ether.

190
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,890
And this is a bit of a review.

191
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,410
This is probably the best
way to learn things, as

192
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,970
we learn as we go.

193
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,590
An ether is something
that has a form.

194
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,970
You have some carbon chain or
some-- you could call it a

195
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:55,920
radical-- some group attached to
a carbon chain, I guess is

196
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,120
the way my brain processes it,
to an oxygen which is attached

197
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,230
to another carbon chain.

198
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,800
It doesn't have to be
the exact same one.

199
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,760
And diethyl ether is the same.

200
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,400
And you're literally just
saying diethyl.

201
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,220
You have to ethyl groups
attached to an ether.

202
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,480
Ethyl is two carbons.

203
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,340
So two carbons, oxygen,
two more carbons.

204
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,650
Diethyl ether.

205
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:19,740
And this would also be a polar
solvent because oxygen is more

206
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,880
electronegative then carbon, so
you still have this partial

207
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,890
negative charge-- let me do this
in a different color-- on

208
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:32,640
the oxygen end and you still
have a partial positive charge

209
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,680
on your carbon end.

210
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,710
So this is also a
polar solvent.

211
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,410
Both of these are
polar solvents.

212
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,080
Now, the difference between
these, and this will probably

213
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,130
be a new term for you, is this
water and most types of

214
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,980
alcohol, something that has
hydrogen that could be knocked

215
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,050
off, this is a protic sovent.

216
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:54,040
   

217
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,940
And protic just comes
from proton.

218
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,970
And that means that if something
is dissolved in

219
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,860
this, or if you have a solution
of this, then these

220
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,750
hydrogens might be able to get
knocked off and you might have

221
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,830
free protons lying around.

222
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,620
Because let's say this
oxygen swipes this

223
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,770
electron from this hydrogen.

224
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,530
If it swipes that electron from
that hydrogen, then you

225
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:15,750
have a situation where you
have OH minus, right?

226
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,090
The oxygen now has a
negative charge.

227
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,760
And this hydrogen, all it had to
its name was that electron.

228
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,110
If you take that away, all
it is is a proton.

229
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:27,370
So when someone draws H plus,
that literally is a proton.

230
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,510
That literally is a proton.

231
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:33,440
And this can occur in water,
that you have some protons

232
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,320
floating around, so water
is fundamentally a

233
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,860
protic polar solvent.

234
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,950
Diethyl ether, on the other
hand, it doesn't have

235
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:46,480
hydrogens where oxygens can
take its hydrogens away.

236
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,200
The hydrogens here are all
bonded to carbon, which is not

237
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,300
that electronegative, so this
is an aprotic solvent.

238
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,550
Let me draw this.

239
00:10:54,550 --> 00:11:04,410
   

240
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,510
Now, let's think about whether
an Sn1 or Sn2 is better and--

241
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:12,780
well, I already said the
solvents have to be polar.

242
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,690
That's because we're dealing
with charged

243
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,700
things in both reactions.

244
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,790
But which one will be better?

245
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,760
So let me write this down.

246
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,360
So in both situations, we want
a polar solvent, so let me

247
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,790
write that down.

248
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,730
And I'll give you a hint: one
of them will be good in a

249
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,640
protic environment and one of
them will not be good in a

250
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,960
protic environment.

251
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,690
So in an Sn2, if you had-- let's
just think it through.

252
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,040
Let's just not memorize this.

253
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:42,010
If we had protons floating
around in an Sn2 situation,

254
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,680
what is likely to happen?

255
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,920
We have this strong
nucleophile.

256
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,960
We have this thing that wants
to give away electrons.

257
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,010
Now, it could give it away to a
carbon that might maybe have

258
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,450
a partial positive charge and
then the leaving group could

259
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:58,780
take it away, but what
wants electrons more?

260
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,420
A carbon that has a partial
negative charge or a proton,

261
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,770
something that has a full
positive charge?

262
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,450
Well, a proton would
want it more.

263
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:08,500
So if you had protons floating
around, the nucleophile would

264
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,730
just give its electrons to the
proton and the Sn2 reaction

265
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,670
wouldn't actually occur.

266
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,810
The protons would take
all the electrons.

267
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:18,270
So you can't have protons
floating around.

268
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,060
You cannot have protons
floating

269
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,000
around in an Sn2 reaction.

270
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,790
Then this carbon will never
get the electron.

271
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,090
The proton will take it.

272
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:33,340
So you need an aprotic
solvent.

273
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,650
So Sn2 would work well
in diethyl ether.

274
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:40,250
   

275
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,705
If this is a strong nucleophile,
it's a solution

276
00:12:42,705 --> 00:12:46,310
in diethyl ether, and these were
all hydrogens, then you'd

277
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:49,300
be just ready to go for
an Sn2 reaction.

278
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,660
Now, on the other end of the
spectrum, the key in an Sn1

279
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,250
reaction is that this
carbocation be stable.

280
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:03,320
And for a carbocation to be
stable-- or actually even more

281
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,690
important, instead of the
carbocation being stable,

282
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:09,070
that's dependent on it being a
tertiary or secondary carbon.

283
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,060
But order for the leaving group
to be stable when it's

284
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,840
negative, it actually would
be nice if there was

285
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,960
some protons available.

286
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,820
Maybe it could give electrons
to the proton.

287
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,200
Maybe it could bond
with the proton.

288
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,560
So in this situation, the
protons will actually help

289
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,270
stabilize the situation.

290
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:35,260
So in an Sn1 reaction, the
ideal is actually a polar

291
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,550
protic solvent.

292
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,580
So if you see a situation where
you have a secondary or

293
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:48,700
tertiary carbon, it is a weak
nucleophile, and you're

294
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,720
dealing with a polar protic
solvent, the most famous of

295
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,010
which is water, but an alcohol
would also work, then you

296
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,053
should be thinking Sn1.

297
00:13:57,053 --> 00:14:00,434
If you see a strong nucleophile,
there's not much

298
00:14:00,434 --> 00:14:01,400
steric hindrance.

299
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,815
There's space that
it can attack.

300
00:14:03,815 --> 00:14:06,954
This is a methyl or a primary,
maybe a secondary carbon, and

301
00:14:06,954 --> 00:14:10,650
it's happening in an aprotic
polar solvent like diethyl

302
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,390
ether, then you know you're
ready for an Sn2.

303
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,067
