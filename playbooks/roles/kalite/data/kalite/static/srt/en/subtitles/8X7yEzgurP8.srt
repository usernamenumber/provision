1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so lets say you're walking down the street

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and im going to draw you here and you decide to do a little experiment.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you take a deep breath as you're walking and you decide to blow out a cardboard tube

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
something like that

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
lets say its like a toilet paper roll

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so you blow out through it

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and here in this toilet paper roll

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the length is, lets call, l and the radius and i'll call it r

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you know a toilet paper roll is, lets say about 2 cm

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
radius. That may not be exactly right but lets just assume that.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And you do this and you find that it is so easy to do.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Very easy to take one breath of air and blow it out an blow it out of a cardboard tube
