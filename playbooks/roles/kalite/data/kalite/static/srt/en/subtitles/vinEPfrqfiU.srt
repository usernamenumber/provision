1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490
   

2
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,750
What I want to do in this video
is think about what type

3
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,690
of reaction we might have if
we have ingredients very

4
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:08,000
similar to what we saw
in the last video.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,130
But instead of our nucleophile
or our base being methoxide,

6
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,320
it's going to be something
slightly more involved.

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,860
So it's still going to have the
O minus, but it's going to

8
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,090
be bonded to a carbon, which is
then bonded to three methyl

9
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:28,220
groups: CH3, CH3, CH3,
just like that.

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,875
So we don't have methoxide
anymore.

11
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:32,580
   

12
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,090
We have this thing
right over here.

13
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,090
So just like before, we have
the exact same solvent.

14
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,520
We have dimethylformamide.

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,880
It's an aprotic solvent.

16
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,840
That by itself would put us in
the Sn2 or E2 direction.

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,410
But now we don't have
methoxide anymore.

18
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,830
Methoxide was both a strong
base, very strong base.

19
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:53,340
It's also a very small molecule,
and so it can really

20
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,010
get in there and react
with the substrate.

21
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,300
So it's also a strong
nucleophile.

22
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,240
Now, this more bulky molecule,
it is still a strong base.

23
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,950
It is still an extremely
strong base.

24
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,980
But now it's this big,
bulky molecule.

25
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,510
It would actually have trouble
getting in to react with your

26
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:15,080
substrate, so it is no longer
a good nucleophile.

27
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,730
This is not a good
nucleophile.

28
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,580
   

29
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:25,260
So by making the base more, I
guess, bulky, it's now-- or I

30
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,890
guess you could also call it the
nucleophile or the thing

31
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,080
that would act as a nucleophile,
more bulky.

32
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,810
It is no longer a strong
nucleophile, so it would no

33
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,810
longer be good for
an Sn2 reaction.

34
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,530
So just by changing the base a
little bit or the nucleophile

35
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,170
a little bit, now this
one would go

36
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,630
strictly in the E2 direction.

37
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,550
So we wouldn't see anything like
this in the last video.

38
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,850
We would only see something
like this.

39
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:53,480
And obviously, the base in this
example is no longer just

40
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,190
a methoxide.

41
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,140
It looks like this.

42
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,336
Let me clear it.

43
00:01:58,336 --> 00:02:01,130
Let me do my best to clear it.

44
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,370
Edit, clear.

45
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,130
Let me clear it over
here as well.

46
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:08,229
   

47
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,630
So now instead of just being
bonded to a methyl group, it's

48
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,950
bonded to a carbon.

49
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:17,220
It's bonded to a carbon that's
bonded to three methyl groups.

50
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:25,320
So CH3, CH3, CH3, or you could
call this a tert-butyl group;

51
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,330
this whole thing over here.

52
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:33,090
So that's a carbon bonded to
a CH3, a CH3 and a CH3.

53
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,360
So the reaction occurs just like
what we saw in the last

54
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,460
video, except this base is this
big, old, bulky thing,

55
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,960
but it can still act as a strong
base, so it still nabs

56
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,370
the hydrogen or really
just the proton.

57
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,460
The hydrogen's electron that
was bonded now goes to the

58
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,730
alpha carbon.

59
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,960
The alpha carbon will then lose
an electron to the bromo

60
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,950
group and that becomes bromide,
so the same exact

61
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,530
mechanism, different base.

62
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,730
But that base is now not a good
nucleophile, so you won't

63
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,970
see Sn2 occurring at all.

64
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,680
You will only see E2.

65
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,334
