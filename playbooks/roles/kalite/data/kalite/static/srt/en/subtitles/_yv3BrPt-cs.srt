1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,380
Problem number 1.

3
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:05,890
Which number has the greatest
absolute value?

4
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,630
Absolute value is just the
distance that the number is

5
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:13,060
from 0, or how large the number
is, regardless of its

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,890
sign or its direction.

7
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,060
So if you kind of visualize it
on a number line, the absolute

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,220
value of minus 17.

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,640
Minus 17 is 17 to
the left of 0.

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,700
So its absolute value
is just 17.

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,340
The absolute value
of minus 13?

12
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,290
Well, it's 13 to the left of
0, if you imagine it on a

13
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,360
number line.

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,490
So it's just going to be 13.

15
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,730
Absolute value of 15?

16
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,330
Well, that's just
going to be 15.

17
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,010
It's 15 to the right of
0 on the number line.

18
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,620
I think you see a
pattern here.

19
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,690
When you take the absolute
value of a number, you

20
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,530
essentially just disregard
the sign.

21
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,120
The absolute value of a negative
number is going to be

22
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,000
positive, and the absolute value
of a positive number is

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,870
going to be positive.

24
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,300
The absolute value is always
going to be positive, because

25
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,210
you're just measuring how far
you are away from 0 on the

26
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,320
number line.

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,430
And then finally, the absolute
value of 19 is going to be

28
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,470
equal to 19.

29
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,780
So the number that has the
greatest absolute value?

30
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,850
Well, the greatest absolute
value is right there, it's 19.

31
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,540
So 19 has the greatest
absolute value.

32
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,890
So it also happens to be the
largest number here.

33
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,430
Just like that.

34
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,250
Problem number 2.

35
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,160
Maybe I'll do this in gray.

36
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,740
Between which two integers
is the value of the

37
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,940
square root of 61?

38
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,940
So the way you think about this
is that you know there's

39
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,870
some number-- the square root
of 61 is going to be some

40
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,650
decimal number, I don't know
what it is-- but there's going

41
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,630
to be some number that if I
square it, is going to be a

42
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,230
little bit lower than 61.

43
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,170
And then some other integer,
if I square it, should be a

44
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,940
little bit greater than 61.

45
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,630
So let's see if we can
figure this out.

46
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:54,080
So 6 squared is going
to be 36.

47
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,310
And then 7 squared is
going to be 49.

48
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,610
That number is not
dark enough.

49
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,820
Do a darker color.

50
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,060
So this isn't going to
be the case, right?

51
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,610
Because the square of 61-- or 61
is greater than 49-- so the

52
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,360
square root of 61 is going to
be greater than the square

53
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,740
root of 49.

54
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,790
Or actually let me write
it this way.

55
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,770
I could rewrite 6 and 7 as the
square root of 36 and the

56
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,880
square root of 49.

57
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:27,010
I can rewrite 7 and 8 as the
square root of 49 and the

58
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:31,250
square root of 64, right?

59
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,850
7 squared is 49, so the square
root of 49 is 7.

60
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:40,030
8 squared is 64, so the square
root of 64 is going to be 8.

61
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:45,480
So I just rewrote 7 and 8 as the
square root of 49 and the

62
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,280
square root of 64.

63
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,650
Well, the square root of 61 is
clearly going to be between

64
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,410
these two numbers, right?

65
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,560
It's going to be between the
square root of 49 and the

66
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,460
square root of 64.

67
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,750
The 61 is between 49 and 64.

68
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,940
So our answer is B.

69
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,260
Square root of 61 is between
these two numbers, but these

70
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,670
two numbers are the same
thing as 7 and 8.

71
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,240
Next problem, number 3.

72
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,130
Use the addition problems below
to answer the question.

73
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,000
All right, so they wrote some
addition problems right there.

74
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,070
We're dealing with fractions.

75
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,560
Let's see where this goes.

76
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:26,360
Based on this pattern, what is
the sum of 1/2 plus 1/4 plus

77
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:33,590
1/8 plus 1/16, all the
way to 1/1024?

78
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:37,070
So let's see if we can discern
some type of a pattern here.

79
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:40,260
Maybe I'll do this in red just
to keep things interesting.

80
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:46,480
So when I took the first
two terms, I got 3/4.

81
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,500
When I took the next two terms,
or not the next two

82
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,180
terms. When I add another
term to it.

83
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:57,200
When I add the 1/8 term to this
over here, I got 7/8.

84
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,590
Then when I add a 1/16 to
7/8, I get a 15/16.

85
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,610
So the general pattern here is
that whenever I add it up, my

86
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:10,150
denominator and my sum-- I guess
you could call it that

87
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,390
way-- my denominator is going
to be the same denominator

88
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,670
that I have right there.

89
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,190
And then my numerator, if I
just look at all of the

90
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:23,140
pattern here, just turns out to
be 1 less than that, right?

91
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:27,270
So when I added 1/2 plus 1/4, I
got 4 in the denominator and

92
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,150
3 in the numerator.

93
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:33,690
When I had 1/2 plus 1/4 plus
1/8, 8 in the denominator and

94
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,260
1 less than that in
the numerator.

95
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:39,680
When I added it all the way
to 1/16, I got 16 in the

96
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,770
denominator and 1 less
in the numerator.

97
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,720
When I added it all the way
to 32, I got 32 in the

98
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,540
denominator and 1 less
in the numerator.

99
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,280
And this only worked when I'm
adding successive powers of, I

100
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,720
guess you could call
it 1/2, right?

101
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,980
This is 1/2, 1/2 squared,
1/2 to the

102
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,880
third, 1/2 to the fourth.

103
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,960
So based on this pattern, what
is the sum if I were to go all

104
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,910
the way to 1/1024?

105
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,410
Well, based on this pattern, my
denominator is going to be

106
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,580
1,024, and my numerator is going
to be 1 less than 1,024.

107
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,740
So it's going to be 1,023.

108
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,790
And that is choice
C right there.

109
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,040
