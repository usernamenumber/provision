1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,380
Let's review everything we've
done in the last few videos

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,710
and then take it a few
steps from there.

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:08,910
So let's say we have a reality
that right now

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,732
and this isn't the actual exchange rate,
but I'm just using these numbers

5
00:00:12,732 --> 00:00:24,643
because they're nice
simple numbers-- the current exchange rate is 10
yuan per U.S. $1.

6
00:00:24,643 --> 00:00:27,540
And now we're in a reality where
the Chinese Government,

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,037
the Chinese Central Bank,
wants to keep this pegged

8
00:00:31,037 --> 00:00:32,840
so it wants to lock this.

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,390
It wants to lock this exchange
rate right over here.

10
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:41,660
But the reality is, more is
being sold to the U.S.

11
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,368
more is being exported from China
to the U.S. than the other way around.

12
00:00:45,368 --> 00:00:48,730
And so that leads to this
weird dynamic that we've studied in the last
few videos.

13
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:58,002
So this is China right here, and
then you have the United States right over here.

14
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:03,100
And let's say at this exchange
rate right over here,

15
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:09,046
you have goods coming from China to the
U.S.

16
00:01:09,046 --> 00:01:11,577
Actually, let me do it in that same magenta color.

17
00:01:11,577 --> 00:01:24,572
So these are Chinese goods,
and then we are paying for those Chinese goods in dollars

18
00:01:24,572 --> 00:01:30,482
and those dollars are being sent to China.

19
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,240
So let's say we pay in
this time period.

20
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,110
Let's say it's a year.

21
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:52,190
Let's say that $100 sent to
China for the goods

22
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,878
and this is really just a summary
of what we saw in the last few videos.

23
00:01:54,878 --> 00:01:59,995
And let's say, on the other side
of this equation, some goods are sent from
the U.S. to China.

24
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:10,954
Some are exported, so U.S. goods
are exported to China, and then we sell them in China

25
00:02:10,954 --> 00:02:15,402
and then we get some yuan in return that go back to
the United States. And, of course,

26
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:20,135
the reality is
that the money seldom is actually sitting on a ship
going across the Pacific.

27
00:02:20,135 --> 00:02:22,175
It's all in these bank accounts
that can be wired back and forth.

28
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:26,267
The actual exchanges are
essentially happening on the internet

29
00:02:26,267 --> 00:02:30,395
not really in any
physical location, but this is a good way to visualize it.

30
00:02:30,395 --> 00:02:35,098
So the U.S. goods are being
sold in China and then the U.S. producer is going
to get yuan.

31
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:43,170
And let's say for their goods,
they get 500 yuan.

32
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,650
So if all of these people were
just convert,

33
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,400
and you actually don't know what the equilibrium
price would be,

34
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,210
because the demand changes
depending on what the price is

35
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,850
in each of the countries, but
if you really wanted to convert these $100

36
00:02:52,850 --> 00:03:01,689
that the
Chinese producer gets into yuan at 10:1, you would need--
so we're going to assume that

37
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:04,670
this PEG is what at least the
Chinese Government wants.

38
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:21,493
So you would need 1,000 yuan in
order to convert all of his $100 at 10 yuan per dollar.

39
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:32,212
Now this producer, the U.S.
producer, only has-- let me do it in a different color

40
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,738
and I
should put the quotes around needs, not around the yuan.

41
00:03:35,738 --> 00:03:46,820
Now this U.S. producer only has
500 yuan to convert into dollars

42
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,810
and we've seen
this multiple times.

43
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,090
But I really want to reinforce
it about how these currencies would fluctuate.

44
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:58,940
The demand for yuan is much
higher than the supply for yuan.

45
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,830
And we could do the exact same
argument for the dollar

46
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,698
that the demand for dollars
is much lower than the supply for dollars.

47
00:04:06,698 --> 00:04:10,070
At this exchange rate, if we
assumed a PEG

48
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:15,636
this would only be $50 that we need to convert
into, while there's $100 of actual supply.

49
00:04:15,636 --> 00:04:17,581
But let's just focus
on the yuan.

50
00:04:17,581 --> 00:04:19,649
They need 1,000 yuan at
this exchange rate.

51
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:23,900
There's only 1,000 yuan that can
be converted into dollars.

52
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,850
And if we had a floating
exchange rate

53
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:30,058
that would increase the demand for yuan,
and then this number would go down,

54
00:04:30,058 --> 00:04:35,042
or another way to view
it, either that number goes down or this number
over here goes up.

55
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:37,830
You could say the yuan would
become more expensive

56
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,605
which means maybe it's 9 yuan per
dollar or 8 yuan per dollar, or it could go the other way.

57
00:04:41,605 --> 00:04:47,607
For 10 yuan, instead of $1,
you'd get $1.10 or $1.20 or $1.30, either way.

58
00:04:47,607 --> 00:04:51,810
Now, in order for this lock and
for this PEG to occur

59
00:04:51,810 --> 00:05:00,545
we saw in the last video that
the Chinese Central Bank needs to intervene.

60
00:05:00,545 --> 00:05:04,760
Remember, where are the
excess dollars?

61
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,760
They're over here.

62
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,490
Let me make it clear.

63
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:13,574
There's $100 over here
that need to be converted into yuan.

64
00:05:13,574 --> 00:05:22,810
We have 500 yuan over here that
needs to be converted into dollars.

65
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:28,695
Now, the Chinese government
wants this $100 to be converted into 1,000 yuan.

66
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:34,085
So what he does or what they
do is they say

67
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:41,068
OK, $50 of this $100 dollars can be
essentially traded for these 500 yuan.

68
00:05:41,068 --> 00:05:48,065
Let me draw a two-way arrow
there. $50 goes to the American producer

69
00:05:48,065 --> 00:05:55,390
and then the
500 yuan go to the Chinese producer in exchange
for that $50.

70
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,570
Obviously, this isn't
coordinated.

71
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,600
It's not like matchmaking.

72
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,255
It's not like someone
said, hey, you give this money to them.

73
00:06:00,255 --> 00:06:05,400
But essentially, there will only
be $50 to convert into the yuan

74
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:21,906
and then the other
$50 will go to the Chinese Central Bank.

75
00:06:21,906 --> 00:06:31,340
Let me draw the Chinese Central
Bank,

76
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:37,530
and they will just print yuan and give
another 500 yuan.

77
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,610
And this is exactly what
happened in the last video.

78
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,040
I drew it a little
bit different.

79
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:47,080
All I'm showing is to make up
for the lack of supply of yuan,

80
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,161
they needed 1,000
yuan, there's only 500 yuan to convert.

81
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:53,290
In order to make that up, the
Chinese Central Government

82
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:57,624
prints the extra Chinese
currency and buys dollars with it.

83
00:06:57,624 --> 00:07:03,580
So it's essentially sucking up
the excess dollars, right?

84
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:10,032
This was excess dollars right
over here so that the dollar does not weaken.

85
00:07:10,032 --> 00:07:23,671
It is sucking up extra dollars
so that the supply for dollars isn't so high that it weakens

86
00:07:23,671 --> 00:07:24,926
or so that the yuan strengthens.

87
00:07:24,926 --> 00:07:29,640
And so that's the way
the Chinese can maintain the trade imbalance.

88
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:35,666
They could continue to
export more goods than they are importing.

89
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:36,340
Now, what is the effect
of this, though?

90
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,060
And we saw this.

91
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:42,115
In order to maintain this
currency PEG while there is this trade imbalance,

92
00:07:42,115 --> 00:07:48,752
the
Chinese Central Bank keeps printing yuan and they keep
accumulating dollars.

93
00:07:48,752 --> 00:07:52,540
And if they ever stop
accumulating dollars,

94
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,205
so it's not like they can just hold the
dollars they have and the PEG will hold.

95
00:07:55,216 --> 00:07:58,970
If they ever stop accumulating
dollars, then the PEG will break down.

96
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,978
They have to do this
every time period.

97
00:08:00,978 --> 00:08:03,201
They have to actively
participate in the market

98
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:05,147
printing yuan and
buying dollars.

99
00:08:05,147 --> 00:08:06,847
They are doing it every day
to maintain the PEG.

100
00:08:06,847 --> 00:08:09,670
Not every day, maybe sometimes
when it won't fluctuate on their own,

101
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:10,910
but if the yuan is
getting expensive,

102
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:15,208
they actually maintain a range, and
they will buy dollars.

103
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,910
So they're just accumulating
more and more of these dollars.

104
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,786
And now this is where
it gets interesting.

105
00:08:19,786 --> 00:08:24,190
What does the Chinese Central
Bank do with that cash?

106
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,450
Now, like anybody,
cash is useless.

107
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:29,310
You're not getting any
interest on it.

108
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,430
It's just paper.

109
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,900
It allows you to buy other
things

110
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,130
that could give you some income or could give
you some value.

111
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:41,535
So what the Chinese Central
Bank does, it doesn't hold actual dollar bills.

112
00:08:41,535 --> 00:08:46,802
It goes and tries to buy
the safest U.S.-denominated asset it can.

113
00:08:46,802 --> 00:08:54,530
And another thing, not only does
it care about safety-- so it wants to go to
a safe asset.

114
00:08:54,530 --> 00:09:00,690
It wants to go to the safe
dollar-denominated asset,

115
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,450
which means that you would buy
it in dollars,

116
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:10,222
and if it produces interest, the interest
would be in dollars.

117
00:09:10,222 --> 00:09:14,870
And it's also doing this on a
massive, massive scale, in the hundreds of billions of dollars,

118
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,924
and actually the Reserve is in the trillions
of dollars, so it's on a massive scale.

119
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:21,490
So they can't just go buy a
random company's stock, one that won't be safe,

120
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:27,455
but also
they would just drive the price up to infinity if they
used this many dollars.

121
00:09:27,455 --> 00:09:35,800
So it has to be a very liquid
asset,

122
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,660
one that has a very deep market where the people
trading in that market,

123
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,567
it really is in the tens
and hundreds of billions of dollars.

124
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:51,607
And there's really only one
asset that meets those requirements, and that's
U.S.. Treasuries

125
00:09:51,607 --> 00:09:54,773
And this isn't the only thing
they will do, but this is the great majority.

126
00:09:54,773 --> 00:09:57,140
So what the Chinese Central Bank
does with all of these excess dollars,

127
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:01,340
it essentially
buys U.S. Treasuries.

128
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,120
So it gives the dollars away.

129
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,910
Well, not gives away, it sends
the dollars to the people who are holding the U.S. Treasuries,

130
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:18,739
and then it gets U.S. Treasuries in return.

131
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:23,834
Now, as a bit of review, and
I've done a few videos on this, what are U.S.
Treasuries?

132
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:31,518
U.S. Treasury bills and bonds
are loans to the Federal Government.

133
00:10:31,518 --> 00:10:32,617
So that's maybe how you
should view it.

134
00:10:32,617 --> 00:10:44,031
These are loans to the
Federal Government.

135
00:10:44,031 --> 00:10:47,848
These bonds, these Treasury
bonds or these treasury bills that they're getting,

136
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:57,087
these
certificates, are essentially-- in fact, they
are-- IOUs from the U.S.A,

137
00:10:57,087 --> 00:11:03,492
not to get cheesy with the acronyms.
These are literally IOUs from the U.S. Government,

138
00:11:03,492 --> 00:11:06,480
and the U.S. Government will pay interest. They are
essentially--

139
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,882
so just to make it all clear of what's going
on,

140
00:11:09,882 --> 00:11:13,190
they're printing money. They're accumulating dollars.

141
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:17,839
They're using those dollars to
go out into either the open market

142
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,819
or even directly from
the Treasury, from the U.S. Treasury, and they are buying
U.S. Treasuries,

143
00:11:22,819 --> 00:11:40,172
which essentially means that they are
lending this money to the U.S. Government.

144
00:11:40,172 --> 00:11:42,110
Now, I'll leave you there in
this video,

145
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,350
and maybe you want to think about it a little
bit before you even watch the next one.

146
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,335
But in the next one, we'll talk
a little bit about what that even means.

147
00:11:47,335 --> 00:11:51,200
What happens if you have this
big holder of U.S. dollars,

148
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,110
this huge holder of U.S. dollars
going out there and

149
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,842
buying Treasuries and being
willing to lend money to the U.S. Government?

150
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,480
Think about it.

151
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,178
And in particular, think about
what would happen to interest rates

152
00:12:02,178 --> 00:12:04,240
and what those low
interest rates' impact would

153
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,270
have on the rest of
the U.S. economy and on debt in general.
