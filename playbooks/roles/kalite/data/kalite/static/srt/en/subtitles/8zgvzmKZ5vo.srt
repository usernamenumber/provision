1
00:00:00,309 --> 00:00:04,967
What I would like to do is describe an imaginary or fictitious bitcoin transaction

2
00:00:04,967 --> 00:00:09,199
and then talk about how somebody might try to game or defraud this system

3
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:11,998
and why it's mathematically hard to do

4
00:00:11,998 --> 00:00:16,861
but why there is actually an economic incentive in the Bitcoin system

5
00:00:16,861 --> 00:00:20,651
for different people to behave honestly.

6
00:00:20,651 --> 00:00:23,455
Let's suppose that there is someone out there named Dan.

7
00:00:23,455 --> 00:00:28,447
Dan wants to order a cheese pizza from Pete's Pizza Shop.

8
00:00:28,447 --> 00:00:31,507
Let's say that Pete's Pizza Shop accepts bitcoins as payment

9
00:00:31,507 --> 00:00:37,135
and that it costs 1 BTC for a pizza pie.

10
00:00:37,135 --> 00:00:42,782
Imagine that Dan previously received 5 BTC from his cousin Carol.

11
00:00:42,782 --> 00:00:49,560
So, Carol, laballed by "C", gave to Dan 5 BTC,

12
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,586
which we can label as a "B" with a circle around it.

13
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,968
He wants to use one of these 5 bitcoins to buy a pizza from Pete.

14
00:00:58,968 --> 00:01:02,772
What Dan's bitcoin client will do is it will create a transaction record

15
00:01:02,772 --> 00:01:05,743
that includes information about how Dan got these bitcoins.

16
00:01:05,743 --> 00:01:10,084
So, in this case it includes information about this transaction between Carol,

17
00:01:10,084 --> 00:01:13,672
who we've marked by "C" and Dan for 5 bitcoins.

18
00:01:13,672 --> 00:01:18,110
Then it specifies that Dan wants to give one of these bitcoins to Pete...

19
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,182
We will label Pere by "P".

20
00:01:20,182 --> 00:01:23,705
...and also that Dan is going to take the remaining 4 bitcoins

21
00:01:23,705 --> 00:01:27,033
and that will be basically change to himself.

22
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:31,542
The way that bitcoin is built is that you have to actually specify the change.

23
00:01:31,542 --> 00:01:36,036
Whatever goes into the bitcoin system has to come out at the other end.

24
00:01:36,036 --> 00:01:39,134
So, you can't have a transaction with the numbers on and up.

25
00:01:39,134 --> 00:01:41,887
Whatever is remaining is either change

26
00:01:41,887 --> 00:01:45,169
or part of it can be used a a transaction fee and so on.

27
00:01:45,169 --> 00:01:47,225
For this example, to keep things simple,

28
00:01:47,225 --> 00:01:49,715
I'll assume that there is no transaction fee in place.

29
00:01:49,715 --> 00:01:51,509
The transaction fee is just zero.

30
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:53,625
We'll focus only on the situation

31
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:58,453
in which everything is being accounted for in the transaction.

32
00:01:58,453 --> 00:02:01,166
This transaction record is going to be boradcast out

33
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:03,013
to the entire Bitcoin world.

34
00:02:03,013 --> 00:02:07,571
In particular, Pete is going to receive a copy of this transaction.

35
00:02:07,571 --> 00:02:10,411
But in addition to Pete receiving it,

36
00:02:10,411 --> 00:02:14,605
so too will the other people on the Bitcoin system.

37
00:02:14,605 --> 00:02:19,693
If you recall, there are these special nodes, these special entities or people in Bitcoin

38
00:02:19,693 --> 00:02:21,233
that are known as bitcoin miners.

39
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:24,335
These bitcoin miners are going to be responsible

40
00:02:24,335 --> 00:02:29,872
for making sure that everything checks out in the transaction from a global perspective.

41
00:02:29,872 --> 00:02:32,928
What they do is they look at the full record of transaction

42
00:02:32,928 --> 00:02:34,840
and this transaction record is public,

43
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,826
it's known as the transaction block chain...

44
00:02:36,826 --> 00:02:41,612
I'll put the description of the transaction block chain right here.

45
00:02:41,612 --> 00:02:43,840
...and this transaction block chain contains the history

46
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,374
of every single transaction that ever occured within the Bitcoin system

47
00:02:48,374 --> 00:02:49,800
from the beginning of time,

48
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,803
the time of the first block, which is known in Bitcoin as the genesis block.

49
00:02:54,803 --> 00:03:00,169
Everybody can verify the details of any transaction if they wanted

50
00:03:00,169 --> 00:03:02,077
because that information is public.

51
00:03:02,077 --> 00:03:04,786
In particular, what these bitcoin miners will look at

52
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:10,541
is whether or not Dan previously received 5 bitcoins from anybody else,...

53
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:13,069
In this particular case it was his cousin Carol.

54
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:16,538
...whether or not Dan has tried to spend those bitcoins previously,

55
00:03:16,538 --> 00:03:18,678
and so on and so forth.

56
00:03:18,678 --> 00:03:24,270
These bitcoin miners are all collectively trying to take all these recent transactions

57
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,449
that haven't yet been recorded.

58
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:29,717
That includes not only the transactions between Dan and Pete,

59
00:03:29,717 --> 00:03:31,441
but there may be other transactions floating out there

60
00:03:31,441 --> 00:03:33,279
that took place around the same time.

61
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:36,927
The bitcoin miners will look at all these different transactions at once

62
00:03:36,927 --> 00:03:44,594
and they are going to try to figure out how to form a transaction block out of these transactions

63
00:03:44,594 --> 00:03:46,764
and they'll wanna add this transaction block

64
00:03:46,764 --> 00:03:50,176
to the end of the current transaction block chain.

65
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:52,582
If you might recall from previous videos,

66
00:03:52,582 --> 00:03:57,993
that for a bitcoimn miner to add a transaction block to a transaction block chain

67
00:03:57,993 --> 00:04:01,082
they have to solve, what's known as the proof of work puzzle.

68
00:04:01,082 --> 00:04:04,855
The Bitcoin system is designed, or maybe calibrated is the better word,

69
00:04:04,855 --> 00:04:10,127
so that, on average, one miner will solve a puzzle in about ten minutes.

70
00:04:10,127 --> 00:04:13,903
It's worth stressing here that it could take a long time

71
00:04:13,903 --> 00:04:16,978
for any one individual miner to solve the puzzle...

72
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:19,438
It could even take maybe a year or even two years.

73
00:04:19,438 --> 00:04:25,034
...but because there are so many of these miners working at the same time,

74
00:04:25,034 --> 00:04:28,916
one of them is bound to get lucky and solve the puzzle quickly.

75
00:04:30,147 --> 00:04:35,193
Each of these proof of work puzzles

76
00:04:35,193 --> 00:04:38,980
that is associated with a transaction block

77
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,336
happens to have a difficulty score associated with it.

78
00:04:42,336 --> 00:04:48,636
This difficulty basically represents how hard it was to solve that proof of work puzzle.

79
00:04:48,636 --> 00:04:50,832
Imagine that there are some numbers

80
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:55,105
and we will call these numbers

81
00:04:55,105 --> 00:04:59,112
for the most recent difficulty score.

82
00:04:59,112 --> 00:05:01,713
These are just numbers that somehow represent

83
00:05:01,713 --> 00:05:04,847
how hard it was to solve this proof of work.

84
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:07,615
When you at overall chain,

85
00:05:07,615 --> 00:05:09,407
what the Bitcoin system is interested in,

86
00:05:09,407 --> 00:05:14,133
it is interested in how hard was it to construct that entire chain.

87
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:18,469
The reason it's important for someone to understand how hard the entire chain was constructed

88
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:21,501
is because this overall score for this chain,

89
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:24,171
this difficulty score for the chain

90
00:05:24,171 --> 00:05:28,364
is what's used by Pete or by other people who are receiving bitcoins

91
00:05:28,364 --> 00:05:32,542
to figure out whether or not they trust the transaction.

92
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:34,811
The more work that went into the overall chain,

93
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:38,007
the more trust they will have in that transaction.

94
00:05:38,007 --> 00:05:40,301
The reason for that is that the way Bitcoin works

95
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:44,513
is that if there was ever more than one transaction block chain out there...

96
00:05:44,513 --> 00:05:47,006
Let's say there was a bad user out there

97
00:05:47,006 --> 00:05:50,193
or maybe somebody didn't receive a particular message in time

98
00:05:50,193 --> 00:05:51,141
or whatever reason.

99
00:05:51,141 --> 00:05:54,299
If there is somehow more than one transaction block chain out there,

100
00:05:54,299 --> 00:05:58,899
according to the Bitcoin protocol, everyone is supposed to work off of the chain

101
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:00,631
that had the most work put into it.

102
00:06:00,631 --> 00:06:04,074
So, we ignore chains that have a lot less work

103
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:06,506
and only consider the chain that had the most work put into it.

104
00:06:06,506 --> 00:06:14,268
In the Bitcoin system, that particular chain is often referred to as tha longest chain.

105
00:06:14,268 --> 00:06:18,760
This is actually kind of a confusing piece of terminology

106
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,932
because by longest chain we don't mean that this chain is long in any physical sense.

107
00:06:23,932 --> 00:06:25,369
We really just mean...

108
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:28,277
And I'm gonna put equal bars to kind of say what it means.

109
00:06:28,277 --> 00:06:31,841
By the longest chain we mean tha chain that has the most work.

110
00:06:31,841 --> 00:06:38,146
The way that the work is defined is that you look at all these different difficulty scores,

111
00:06:38,146 --> 00:06:42,292
you add them up and that gives you a difficulty score for the entire chain.

112
00:06:42,292 --> 00:06:45,986
Now we are gonna be interested in the chain that had the most work put into it

113
00:06:45,986 --> 00:06:48,523
and we call that the longest chain.

114
00:06:48,523 --> 00:06:50,629
Let's imagine that Dan is dishonest

115
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:52,819
and that after he eats the pizza...

116
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:54,924
Let's say Pete is convinced,

117
00:06:54,924 --> 00:06:56,983
he gets this bitcoin from Dan, he waits a bit,

118
00:06:56,983 --> 00:07:00,508
he sees that there is a long chain out there that contains the transaction,

119
00:07:00,508 --> 00:07:02,667
he sends the pizza over to Dan,

120
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:03,795
Dan eats the pizza

121
00:07:03,795 --> 00:07:06,335
and then decides that he doesn't want to behave honestly,

122
00:07:06,335 --> 00:07:11,238
he wants to somehow cheat Pete or he wants to defraud the system.

123
00:07:11,238 --> 00:07:14,110
The way that Dan is gonna try to defraud the system

124
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,838
is by attempting to create another transaction,

125
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:22,309
in which he assigns the 5 BTC he got from Carol to somebody else.

126
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:25,800
Let's call this person Fred.

127
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,739
Fred could be Dan's alter ego, could be a friend of Dan's.

128
00:07:30,739 --> 00:07:32,214
It doesn't matter who Fred is

129
00:07:32,214 --> 00:07:35,090
because we know that Fred isn't the rightful owner of these bitcoins.

130
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:40,573
What Dan is gonna try to do is he is gonna try to take those 5 bitcoins that he got from Carol

131
00:07:40,573 --> 00:07:45,525
and he is gonna now try to take these 5 bitcoins and assign them over to Fred.

132
00:07:45,525 --> 00:07:48,318
This is something that we don't want to allow

133
00:07:48,318 --> 00:07:54,511
because that would mean that somehow Dan was able to spend these 5 bitcoins twice over,

134
00:07:54,511 --> 00:07:56,986
he's effectively double spent those bitcoins.

135
00:07:56,986 --> 00:08:00,419
Obviously, one of these transactions should be considered fraudulent.

136
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:03,724
The other one should be allowed to go through.

137
00:08:03,724 --> 00:08:07,840
It's important to keep in mind that if Dan just tried to spend the same coins again

138
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,603
without trying to cover his tracks or anything of that nature,

139
00:08:11,603 --> 00:08:14,342
everybody out there would know that Dan is up to no good

140
00:08:14,342 --> 00:08:18,706
because thay can see from the existing longest transaction block chain,

141
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,869
namely this existing chain from the beginning,

142
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:23,691
they can see that Dan already spent these coins before,

143
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:26,776
he shouldn't be allowed to spend these coins again.

144
00:08:26,776 --> 00:08:33,506
What Dan has to do is he has to create a different transaction block chain

145
00:08:33,506 --> 00:08:37,590
that contains just the second bogus transaction in it,

146
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,993
and this will be the transaction to Fred,

147
00:08:39,993 --> 00:08:43,873
and that would leave out the other transaction to Pete.

148
00:08:43,873 --> 00:08:48,940
Hopefully, everybody else will start to accept or believe this newer chain.

149
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:53,657
Since everyone in Bitcoin ultimately goes with the transaction block chain

150
00:08:53,657 --> 00:08:56,231
that contains the most work,

151
00:08:56,231 --> 00:08:58,985
namely this longest chain that we talked about,

152
00:08:58,985 --> 00:09:07,500
Dan has a chance, he has a hope potentially of being able to pull off this type of a fraudulent scheme.

153
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,668
The real question now is how likely is it for Dan to succeed.

154
00:09:12,668 --> 00:09:15,028
For Dan to be able to pull this off,

155
00:09:15,028 --> 00:09:19,989
he has to start off with the transaction block chain that existed previously

156
00:09:19,989 --> 00:09:23,926
and he has to try to add to that transaction block chain a different transaction.

157
00:09:23,926 --> 00:09:26,602
So, rather than having this previous transaction

158
00:09:26,602 --> 00:09:29,407
where he gave money to Pete,

159
00:09:29,407 --> 00:09:33,762
he is gonna try to create a new transaction and add it to the transaction block chain

160
00:09:33,762 --> 00:09:42,167
that contains this other fraudulent transaction between Dan and his friend Fred.

161
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:47,500
This is gonna be the bad transaction between Dan and Fred that will be in this new block.

162
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,541
In Bitcoin lingo this idea is known as a fork in the chain.

163
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:57,447
And what is meant by a fork is that somehow there is more than one version of histories.

164
00:09:57,447 --> 00:10:00,552
Somebody tried to rewrite their tracks or to cover their tracks

165
00:10:00,552 --> 00:10:03,478
and to revise history the way we know it.

166
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:08,553
What that really means is that there is now somehow more than one version of what happened out there.

167
00:10:08,553 --> 00:10:12,937
In this example, one branch in this fork is legitimate

168
00:10:12,937 --> 00:10:15,106
and the other branch is bogus.

169
00:10:15,106 --> 00:10:21,681
The legitimate branch was the one where Dan paid his friend Pete for pizza

170
00:10:21,681 --> 00:10:24,129
and the bogus one is this follow on transaction

171
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:28,949
where Dan attempted to pay his friend Fred with those same exact bitcoins.

172
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:33,828
Remember that any transaction block that's added to this transaction block chain

173
00:10:33,828 --> 00:10:36,921
has to contain within it a proof of work puzzle,

174
00:10:36,921 --> 00:10:39,351
or solution rather to a proof of work puzzle.

175
00:10:39,351 --> 00:10:42,112
Otherwise, noone will accept the chain.

176
00:10:42,112 --> 00:10:44,594
So, if Dan wants to cheat the system,

177
00:10:44,594 --> 00:10:50,335
he has to secretly solve a new proof of work puzzle himself.

178
00:10:50,335 --> 00:10:53,366
But the challenge for Dan is that he is starting off with a bit of a handicap,

179
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:56,276
because there is already this longer chain out there

180
00:10:56,276 --> 00:10:58,369
that people have started accepting.

181
00:10:58,369 --> 00:11:00,946
Keep in mind that because this chain is out there,

182
00:11:00,946 --> 00:11:03,712
other nodes may have started to build on top of this chain.

183
00:11:03,712 --> 00:11:08,015
Every ten minutes, somebody is adding to this chain on average.

184
00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:10,861
So, there is this longer transaction block chain out there

185
00:11:10,861 --> 00:11:13,563
and Dan wants to create his own fake chain.

186
00:11:13,563 --> 00:11:16,864
So, in order for that chain to be believable

187
00:11:16,864 --> 00:11:19,223
he has to now be the longest chain out there

188
00:11:19,223 --> 00:11:22,156
and he has to basically do all this proof of works

189
00:11:22,156 --> 00:11:25,529
to create the chain that is longer.

190
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:28,457
To come up with this longer chain on his own,

191
00:11:28,457 --> 00:11:30,871
Dan has to outrun the existing proof of work chain.

192
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:34,122
That means he has to solve not just typically one proof of work puzzle,

193
00:11:34,122 --> 00:11:36,948
but may need to solve several proof of work puzzles

194
00:11:36,948 --> 00:11:41,633
to create another chain that he hopes will be longer than the chain that's out there.

195
00:11:41,633 --> 00:11:46,154
If he can get the longest chain and he can get people to start using that chain instead,..

196
00:11:46,154 --> 00:11:48,249
and that's the chain he might want people to use

197
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,159
because it contains this fake transaction,

198
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:54,677
but it removes the previous transaction where he gave money to Pete.

199
00:11:54,677 --> 00:12:00,490
To solve a proof of work Dan has to take whatever computing power he has access to

200
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:06,262
and he has to start working on solving the proof of work puzzle.

201
00:12:06,262 --> 00:12:08,575
There are no known shortcuts for solving these puzzles.

202
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,513
If you recall from any of the proof of work videos,

203
00:12:11,513 --> 00:12:15,491
to succeed in a proof of work is kind of like winning a lottery.

204
00:12:15,491 --> 00:12:21,095
There are ways to do it, but it depends of how much computing power you have.

205
00:12:21,095 --> 00:12:23,634
The more computing power you have access to,

206
00:12:23,634 --> 00:12:25,950
the more lottery tickets you have.

207
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:29,953
If somebody has even one lottery ticket, they do have the chance to win the lottery,

208
00:12:29,953 --> 00:12:32,436
but they are far less likely to succeed

209
00:12:32,436 --> 00:12:35,585
compared to somebody ho has a lot of lottery tickets in hand.

210
00:12:35,585 --> 00:12:39,279
Even if you succeed once in winning the lottery with the small numer of tickets,

211
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:44,214
the likelihood of repeating that feat over and over again, several times in a row

212
00:12:44,214 --> 00:12:45,933
becomes much smaller.

213
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,499
That's exactly what Dan has to do.

214
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:50,027
He has to win this lottery multiple times

215
00:12:50,027 --> 00:12:52,399
until he has a bigger chain.

216
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,422
The key thing you have to look for is how much computing power Dan has

217
00:12:58,422 --> 00:13:04,777
versus how much computing power all the honest nodes in the system have together.

218
00:13:04,777 --> 00:13:07,476
If it's the case that all the honest nodes...

219
00:13:07,476 --> 00:13:12,220
Let's say we call this "the honest computing power".

220
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,204
When I say "honest computing power" I mean the total computing power

221
00:13:16,204 --> 00:13:20,689
for all the bitcoin mining nodes who are honest in a network.

222
00:13:20,689 --> 00:13:24,324
If that total computing power that they have access to

223
00:13:24,324 --> 00:13:29,225
is greater than the power that Dan has access to,

224
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:32,105
so Dan's computing power,

225
00:13:32,105 --> 00:13:33,939
the Bitcoin system will be safe

226
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:38,822
because it will be hard for Dan to be able to create this fraudulent transaction chain,

227
00:13:38,822 --> 00:13:41,785
because he won't be able to outrun the honest people.

228
00:13:41,785 --> 00:13:45,200
The honest people win the lottery more frequently and will create the longer chain

229
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,290
and Dan's attempt is gonna be very much an uphill battle.

230
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:52,727
It is still possible that Dan could have access to a lot of computing power,

231
00:13:52,727 --> 00:13:55,550
maybe he is very wealthy or he has a lot of resources,

232
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,836
but he'll really need a lot to be able to do that.

233
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:01,638
More than everyone else who is legitimate combined.

234
00:14:01,638 --> 00:14:04,797
That's one aspect of why the transaction block chain is secure,

235
00:14:04,797 --> 00:14:11,374
because it's unlikely for anyone individual to have access to just that much computing power.

236
00:14:11,374 --> 00:14:15,999
Here I should point out that there is also another aspect to the security of Bitcoin.

237
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:20,754
If Dan has access to that kind of computing power to solve these proof of work puzzles,

238
00:14:20,754 --> 00:14:26,245
rather than trying to fight this uphill battle of forking the transaction block chain

239
00:14:26,245 --> 00:14:29,400
and creating fake transaction and so on,

240
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,642
Dan is probably much better off,

241
00:14:31,642 --> 00:14:37,418
just using that computing power he has for legitimate bitcoin mining himself.

242
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:41,331
You might remember that bitcoin miners, who solve proof of work puzzles

243
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:43,490
get both a reward...

244
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,992
For succeeding they get some numer of bitcoins.

245
00:14:45,992 --> 00:14:51,438
...and they also get a transaction fee for all the transactions in the block that they validated.

246
00:14:51,438 --> 00:14:55,088
So, there is this economic incentive for Dan to behave honestly.

247
00:14:55,088 --> 00:14:57,869
Maybe I should just recap in closing the video

248
00:14:57,869 --> 00:14:59,860
that the security of bitcoin transactions

249
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,306
comes from, first of all, this mathematical barrier

250
00:15:03,306 --> 00:15:07,768
that makes it hard for Dan to fork the transaction block chain in a dishonest way,

251
00:15:07,768 --> 00:15:12,604
as well as an economic incentive for Dan to just act honestly

252
00:15:12,604 --> 00:15:14,931
and mine bitcoins for himself.
