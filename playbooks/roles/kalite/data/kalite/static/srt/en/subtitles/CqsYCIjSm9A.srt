1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
   

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,070
In the last video, we figured
out how much work or how much

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,710
energy we have to put into a
particle to move it within a

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:08,970
constant electric field.

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,250
Let's see if we can do the same
thing now with a variable

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,340
electric field, and actually,
then we could figure out the

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,070
electric potential of one
position relative to another.

8
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,220
So let's say we have
a point charge.

9
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,580
It doesn't have to be a point
charge, but let's just say

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:30,140
that there's some field being
generated by this charge that

11
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:37,320
is a positive q1 coulombs.

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,620
And if we wanted to draw field
lines-- and, of course, this

13
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,020
is different than the example
with the infinite uniformly

14
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,900
charged plate because this will
have a variable electric

15
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:46,610
field, right?

16
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,740
What is the electric field
of this charge?

17
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,512
The electric field is going
to look like this.

18
00:00:52,512 --> 00:00:54,780
It's essentially the amount of
force it will exert on any

19
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,350
particle, and it's always going
to be pointed outwards,

20
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,880
because we assume that the test
particle in question is

21
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,110
always a positive charge, so
a positive charge will be

22
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,930
repelled from this
positive charge.

23
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:11,980
That field is Coulomb's constant
times this charge q1

24
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,650
over the distance that we
are from this charge.

25
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:19,760
So if I were to draw this
electric field close up, it's

26
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,010
pretty strong.

27
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:26,640
   

28
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,340
And then as we get further, it
gets weaker a little bit.

29
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,650
It's always radially outward
from the charge.

30
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,800
This a bit review for you.

31
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:41,820
And this is a vector field that
I'm drawing, where I'm

32
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,130
just randomly picking points and
showing the vector of the

33
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,790
field at that point, that it's
pointed outward, and at any

34
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,370
given radius away from the
circle, these vectors should

35
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,090
be the same magnitude.

36
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,040
I know mine aren't exactly,
but hopefully, you get the

37
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,310
point, right?

38
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,860
And the magnitude of these
vectors decrease with the

39
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,830
square of the distance.

40
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,540
So that's what the field is
going to look like if I were

41
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,420
to draw a bunch of vector
field lines.

42
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,240
And that makes sense, just
as a review, right?

43
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,979
Because we know the force-- if
we had another test charge q2,

44
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,600
we know that the force on that
test charge is just q2 times

45
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,400
this, and that's just Coulomb's
Law, right?

46
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,450
That the force on some other
particle q2 is equal to the

47
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:30,560
electric field times q2, which
is equal to k q1 q2 over r

48
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,060
squared, right?

49
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,180
This is just Coulomb's Law, and
actually this comes from

50
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,520
Coulomb's Law.

51
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,880
So since we know that, let's
take some other positive

52
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,190
particle out here, and
let's call that q2.

53
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:47,700
   

54
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,300
I'll write it up here since I
already messed up down there.

55
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,260
q2, and let's say this is a
positive charge, so it is

56
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:59,540
going to be repelled
from this q1.

57
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:04,100
And let's figure out how much
work does it take to push in

58
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,870
this particle a certain
distance, right?

59
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,610
Because the field is
pushing it outward.

60
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,180
It takes work to
push it inward.

61
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,350
So let's say we want
to push it in.

62
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,200
Let's say it's at 10 meters.

63
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,810
Let's say that this distance
right here-- let me draw a

64
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:26,260
radial line-- let's say that
this distance right here is 10

65
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:33,720
meters, and I want to push this
particle in 5 meters, so

66
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,320
it eventually gets right here.

67
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,970
This is where I'm eventually
going to get it so then it's

68
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,260
going to be 5 meters away.

69
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,970
   

70
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,430
So how much work does it take
to move it 5 meters towards

71
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,730
this charge?

72
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,070
Well, the way you think about
it is the field keeps

73
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,230
changing, right?

74
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,880
But we can assume over a very,
very, very, very infinitely

75
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,240
small distance, and let's call
that infinitely small distance

76
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,660
dr, change in radius, and as
you can see, we're about to

77
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,500
embark on some integral and
differential calculus.

78
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,720
If you don't understand what any
of this is, you might want

79
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,250
to review or learn the calculus
in the calculus

80
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,040
playlist, but how much work does
it require to move this

81
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,019
particle a very, very
small distance?

82
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,720
Well, let's just assume over
this very, very, very small

83
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,940
distance, that the electric
field is roughly constant, and

84
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,600
so we can say that the very,
very small amount of work to

85
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,750
move over that very, very small
distance is equal to

86
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:40,820
Coulomb's constant q1 q2 over
r squared times dr.

87
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,150
Now before we move on,
let's think about

88
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,400
something for a second.

89
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,810
   

90
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:50,290
Coulomb's Law tells us that this
is the outward force that

91
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,140
this charge is exerting on
this particle or that the

92
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,570
field is exerting on
this particle.

93
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:59,330
The force that we have to apply
to move the particle

94
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,380
from here to here has to
be an inward force.

95
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,160
It has to be in the exact
opposite direction, so it has

96
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,410
to be a negative.

97
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,300
And why is that?

98
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,230
Because we have to completely
offset the force of the field.

99
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,630
Maybe if the particle was
already moving a little bit,

100
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,280
then our force will keep it
from decelerating from the

101
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,760
field, and if it wasn't already
moving, we would have

102
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,910
to nudge it just an infinitely
small amount just to get it

103
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:26,010
moving, and then our force would
completely offset the

104
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,970
force of the field, and the
particle would neither

105
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,520
accelerate nor decelerate.

106
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,890
So this is the amount of work,
and I just want to explain

107
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,660
that we want to put that
negative sign there because we

108
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,350
going in the opposite direction
of the field.

109
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,210
So how do we figure out the
total amount of work?

110
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,000
We figured out the amount of
work to get it from here to

111
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,140
here, and I even drew it much
bigger than it would be.

112
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,000
These dr's, this is
an infinitely

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,010
small change in radius.

114
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,890
If we want to figure out the
total work, then we keep

115
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:53,450
adding them up.

116
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,770
We say, OK, what's the work to
go from here to here, then the

117
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,480
work to go from there to there,
then the work to go

118
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,550
from there to there, all the way
until we get to 5 meters

119
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,190
away from this charge.

120
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,740
And what we do when we take the
sum of these, we assume

121
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,190
that it's an infinite sum of
infinitely small increments.

122
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:15,250
And as you learned, that is
nothing but the integral, and

123
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:23,790
so that is the total work is
equal to the integral.

124
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,260
That's going to be a definite
integral because we're

125
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,210
starting at this point.

126
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,900
We're summing from-- our radius
is equal to 10 meters--

127
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,800
that's our starting point--
to radius equals 5 meters.

128
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,270
That might be a little
unintuitive that we're

129
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,020
starting at the higher value and
ending at the lower value,

130
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,640
but that's what we're doing.

131
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,780
We're pushing it inwards.

132
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:50,210
And then we're taking the
integral of minus k q1 q2 over

133
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:55,550
r squared dr. All of these are
constant terms up here, right?

134
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,030
So we could take them out.

135
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:01,520
So this is the same thing--
I don't want to run out of

136
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:14,350
space-- as minus k q1 q2 times
the integral from 10 to 5 of 1

137
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:20,950
over r squared-- or to the
negative 2-- dr. And that

138
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:28,310
equals minus k-- I'm running
out of space-- q1 q2.

139
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,140
We take the antiderivative.

140
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,720
We don't have to worry about
plus here because it's a

141
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,600
definite integral.

142
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,580
r to the negative 2, what's
the antiderivative?

143
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,890
It's minus r to the
negative 1.

144
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:40,900
Well, that minus r, the minus
on the minus r will just

145
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,760
cancel with this.

146
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,340
That becomes a plus r to the
negative 1, And you evaluate

147
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,130
it at 5 and then subtract it
and evaluate it at 10.

148
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,370
And then-- let me
just go up here.

149
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,620
Actually, let me erase
some of this.

150
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,822
   

151
00:07:56,822 --> 00:07:58,885
Let me erase this up here.

152
00:07:58,885 --> 00:08:04,350
   

153
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,040
Valuable space to work on.

154
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,840
   

155
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,010
So we said that the work
is equal to-- I'll

156
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,100
just rewrite that.

157
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,040
We had the minus out here, but
then we had a minus and we

158
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,080
took the antiderivative and they
canceled out, so we have

159
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:25,990
k q1 q2 times the antiderivative
evaluated at 5,

160
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,780
so 1 over 5, right?

161
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,960
r to the negative 1, so 1 over
r minus the antiderivative

162
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,250
evaluated at 10 minus 1 over 10
is equal to-- well, 1 over

163
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:41,049
5, that's the same thing
as 2 over 10, right?

164
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:50,280
So we have the work is equal
to k q1 q2 times 2 over 10

165
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:55,360
minus 1 over 10 is 1 over
10, so that equals

166
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,740
k q1 q2 over 10.

167
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,760
That's the work to take the
particle from here to here.

168
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,740
And so similarly, we could say
that the potential energy of

169
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,120
the particle at this-- the
potential difference of the

170
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,820
particle at this point relative
to this point, that

171
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,610
the potential difference here
is this much higher.

172
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,670
It's going to be in joules
because that's the unit of

173
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,900
energy or work or potential,
because

174
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,940
potential is energy anyway.

175
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,960
So the electric potential
difference between this point

176
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,030
and this point: at this point,
it is this value higher.

177
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:38,510
Let's do another example, and
actually, you might just find

178
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,790
this interesting, just from
something to think about.

179
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,550
The big difference between--
actually, let me just continue

180
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,510
this into the next video because
I realize I'm already

181
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,195
at 10 minutes.

182
00:09:48,195 --> 00:09:49,880
I'll see you soon.

183
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:49,900
