1
00:00:00,998 --> 00:00:04,249
Let's think a little bit about what the Big Bang theory suggests.

2
00:00:04,249 --> 00:00:07,918
And then based on the theory, what we should be observing today.

3
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:12,841
So the Big Bang starts with all of the mass and space in the universe,

4
00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:16,742
an infinitely and infinitely dense singularity.

5
00:00:16,742 --> 00:00:19,714
A singularity is just something that the mass doesn't even apply to.

6
00:00:19,714 --> 00:00:21,757
We don't even know how to understand that.

7
00:00:21,757 --> 00:00:26,540
But immediately after the Big Bang, so this occurred 13.7 billion years ago

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:34,760
13.7 billion years ago. Immediately after this little tiny, infinitely small

9
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,801
singularity begins to expand and so for the first 100,000 years

10
00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:41,680
it's still pretty dense, so let me just show this right now.

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:48,181
so this starts to expand and maybe it gets to this level right over here,

12
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:53,290
and I do not know if this entire universe is infinite or finite, whether

13
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:59,095
it's a 4-dimensional sphere or whether it goes infinitely in every direction,

14
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:02,717
or if it's just slightly curved here and there, and maybe flat everywhere else,

15
00:01:02,717 --> 00:01:05,364
and all of that, but then it starts to expand

16
00:01:05,364 --> 00:01:10,751
a little bit from the singularity and it's still extremely dense.

17
00:01:10,751 --> 00:01:13,677
So dense that atoms can't even form.

18
00:01:13,677 --> 00:01:17,485
So you just have the basic fundamental building blocks of atoms

19
00:01:17,485 --> 00:01:27,888
they're just all flying around; electrons, protons, just flying around and just ultra hot- white hot, I could say.

20
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:29,559
Maybe even white-hot plasma.

21
00:01:29,559 --> 00:01:37,733
So this is- I'll call it white-hot plasma.

22
00:01:37,733 --> 00:01:40,751
And then if we fast-foward a little bit more and now this is a point

23
00:01:40,751 --> 00:01:43,398
that we think we understand well, but this number

24
00:01:43,398 --> 00:01:46,603
I actually looked at some old physics books and this number

25
00:01:46,603 --> 00:01:50,411
has changed in really the last 15 or 20 years, so maybe it'll change more.

26
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:56,959
But after 380,000 years from the beginning of the Big Bang,

27
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:07,129
380,000 years after the Big Bang, I'll call it the B.B;

28
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:08,662
and obviously this is give or take a couple of years;

29
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:13,677
the universe expands enough; the universe is now large enough

30
00:02:13,677 --> 00:02:15,256
(and obviously I'm not drawing things to scale)

31
00:02:15,256 --> 00:02:24,312
the universe is now large enough and sparse enough so that it can cool down a little bit.

32
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:26,262
You don't have as much bumping around.

33
00:02:26,262 --> 00:02:26,762
It's still a hot place, but now there's kind of

34
00:02:26,762 --> 00:02:32,764
it cools down enough so that the electrons can be captured by

35
00:02:32,764 --> 00:02:38,708
protons, and you can actually have the first hydrogen atoms that can begin to form.

36
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:42,842
They actually condense, and we estimate this temperature to be around 3,000 Kelvin.

37
00:02:42,842 --> 00:02:50,133
So we've cooled to 3,000 Kelvin but this is still a temperature

38
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:51,804
that you would not want to hang out with.

39
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:54,312
It's still extremely, extremely hot.

40
00:02:54,312 --> 00:02:55,938
Now why is this moment important?

41
00:02:55,938 --> 00:02:57,888
The first atoms forming.

42
00:02:57,888 --> 00:02:59,421
So let's think about what's happening here.

43
00:02:59,421 --> 00:03:01,185
You have all of this bumping and interaction

44
00:03:01,185 --> 00:03:04,668
and because of a bump or some energy release or because

45
00:03:04,668 --> 00:03:07,455
of the heat temperature, if a photon is released,

46
00:03:07,455 --> 00:03:09,777
it'll immediately be absorbed by something else.

47
00:03:09,777 --> 00:03:11,727
If something gets- if some energy gets released

48
00:03:11,727 --> 00:03:13,771
it'll immediately be absorbed by something else, beacuse

49
00:03:13,771 --> 00:03:17,671
the universe is so dense, especially with charged particles.

50
00:03:17,671 --> 00:03:20,411
Here, all of a sudden, it's not that dense.

51
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:23,709
So over here, things that were being emitted could not travel long distances.

52
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:26,634
They would immediately bump into something else.

53
00:03:26,634 --> 00:03:29,281
While you go over here, the universe is starting to

54
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:32,161
look like the universe we recognize.

55
00:03:32,161 --> 00:03:36,340
All of a sudden, if one of these really hot (and it's still nowhere near as hot as

56
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,173
this universe over here) but if one of these hot

57
00:03:39,173 --> 00:03:44,374
atoms emits a photon and they would, because they are at 3,000 Kelvin,

58
00:03:44,374 --> 00:03:49,204
if they emit a photon, all of a sudden there's actually space for that photon to travel.

59
00:03:49,204 --> 00:03:53,616
So for the first time in the history of the universe, 380,000 years

60
00:03:53,616 --> 00:03:56,774
after the Big Bang, you now have photons.

61
00:03:56,774 --> 00:03:58,539
You now have electromagnetic radiation.

62
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:04,111
You now have information that can travel over long, long distances.

63
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:08,291
So given that this happened (it's still roughly 13.7 billion years ago)

64
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:12,935
380,000 years is not a lot when you talk about 13.7 [billion years].

65
00:04:12,935 --> 00:04:15,071
It still wouldn't really even change the dial,

66
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:16,650
Because we're talking of the hundreds of thousands

67
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,065
or 700 million years.

68
00:04:19,065 --> 00:04:21,991
So this is actually a very small number.

69
00:04:21,991 --> 00:04:22,491
So it's still approximately 13.7 billion.

70
00:04:22,491 --> 00:04:28,307
It's really 13.7 billion minus 380,000 years;

71
00:04:28,307 --> 00:04:31,975
but given that this was the first time that information could travel,

72
00:04:31,975 --> 00:04:34,947
that photons could travel through space, without most of them

73
00:04:34,947 --> 00:04:38,709
having to bump into something, especially something that's probably charged,

74
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:41,310
the other interesting thing is that these atoms that form are now neutral.

75
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,678
What could we expect to see today?

76
00:04:43,678 --> 00:04:45,071
Well, let's think about it.

77
00:04:45,071 --> 00:04:52,548
These left- these photons were emitted 13.7 billion years ago.

78
00:04:52,548 --> 00:04:53,048
And they were emitted from every point in the universe.

79
00:04:53,048 --> 00:05:00,907
So this is every point in the universe.

80
00:05:00,907 --> 00:05:02,765
The universe was a pretty uniform place at that time.

81
00:05:02,765 --> 00:05:06,805
Very minor regularities.

82
00:05:06,805 --> 00:05:07,305
But you could see, because it was this white-hot thing

83
00:05:07,305 --> 00:05:11,542
just began to condense. It hadn't formed a lot of the structures

84
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:14,700
that we now associate with the universe. It was just kind of a fairly uniform

85
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:19,530
spread of; at that time, reasonably hot hydrogen atoms.

86
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,688
So this is every point in the universe. So let's think about what's going on here.

87
00:05:22,688 --> 00:05:23,756
Let me draw another diagram.

88
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:27,425
Let's say that- so we're talking about this point in the universe

89
00:05:27,425 --> 00:05:32,208
right over here- the universe, even 380,000 thousand years

90
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:36,666
after the Big Bang, still much much much smaller than the universe today;

91
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:44,561
But let's say that this is- let's say that this is the point in the universe

92
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:46,651
where we happen to be now.

93
00:05:46,651 --> 00:05:49,391
At that- at this point in time, there was no earth, there was no solar system,

94
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:54,917
there's no Milky Way it was just a bunch of hot hydrogen atoms.

95
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:58,214
Now if we were at this point in the universe, there must have been points

96
00:05:58,214 --> 00:06:09,174
in the universe at that exact same time-

97
00:06:09,174 --> 00:06:12,611
that were emitting this radiation.

98
00:06:12,611 --> 99:59:59,999
Actually, every point in the universe was emitting this radiation.
