1
00:00:00,126 --> 00:00:04,648
The one thing that probably causes the most pain in chemistry –

2
00:00:04,648 --> 00:00:07,294
and organic chemistry in particular –

3
00:00:07,294 --> 00:00:10,192
is just the notation and the nomenclature,

4
00:00:10,192 --> 00:00:12,059
and the naming that we use.

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:13,846
What I want to do here, in this video –

6
00:00:13,846 --> 00:00:15,622
and really the next few videos –

7
00:00:15,622 --> 00:00:17,558
is to just make sure that we have a firm grounding

8
00:00:17,558 --> 00:00:19,418
in the notation, and in the nomenclature –

9
00:00:19,418 --> 00:00:20,878
or how we name things.

10
00:00:20,878 --> 00:00:24,045
And then everything else will hopefully not be too difficult.

11
00:00:24,045 --> 00:00:28,109
So just to start off –
And this is just a review of regular chemistry.

12
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:30,576
If I just have a chain of carbons –

13
00:00:30,576 --> 00:00:33,044
(And organic chemistry is dealing with chains of carbons.)

14
00:00:33,044 --> 00:00:35,830
So let me just draw a one carbon chain.

15
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,617
(So it's really kind of ridiculous to call it a chain.)

16
00:00:38,617 --> 00:00:40,786
But say we have one carbon over here,

17
00:00:40,786 --> 00:00:42,955
and it has 4 valence electrons.

18
00:00:42,955 --> 00:00:44,757
It wants to get to eight.

19
00:00:44,757 --> 00:00:46,183
That's just the magic number,

20
00:00:46,183 --> 00:00:48,086
as we learned in regular chemistry,

21
00:00:48,086 --> 00:00:51,565
for all molecules, that's the stable valence structure,

22
00:00:51,565 --> 00:00:53,012
I guess you could say.

23
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:57,519
So a good partner to bond with is hydrogen,

24
00:00:57,519 --> 00:01:02,018
because It (carbon) has four valence electrons,

25
00:01:02,018 --> 00:01:05,471
and then hydrogen has one valence electron.

26
00:01:05,471 --> 00:01:11,141
So then they can each share an electron with each other,

27
00:01:11,141 --> 00:01:13,780
and then they both look pretty happy.

28
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,391
I said eight is the magic number

29
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:18,387
for everybody except for hydrogen and helium,

30
00:01:18,387 --> 00:01:19,594
both of them are happy

31
00:01:19,594 --> 00:01:24,127
because they are only trying to fill their 1s orbital.

32
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:26,393
So, the magic number for those two guys is 2.

33
00:01:26,393 --> 00:01:28,943
So, all of the hydrogens now feel like they have 2 electrons,

34
00:01:28,943 --> 00:01:31,494
and the carbon feels like it has 8.

35
00:01:31,494 --> 00:01:33,845
Now, there are several ways to write this,

36
00:01:33,845 --> 00:01:35,452
you could write it just like this,

37
00:01:35,452 --> 00:01:37,059
where you can see the electrons explicitly,

38
00:01:37,059 --> 00:01:39,847
or you can draw little lines here.

39
00:01:39,847 --> 00:01:44,392
So, I could also write this exact molecule which is methane,

40
00:01:44,392 --> 00:01:47,494
and we'll talk about why it is called methane later in this video.

41
00:01:47,494 --> 00:01:50,827
I can write this exact structure like this:

42
00:01:50,827 --> 00:01:56,014
a carbon bonded to four hydrogens

43
00:01:56,014 --> 00:01:58,709
and the way that I've written these bonds right here,

44
00:01:58,709 --> 00:01:59,951
you can imagine

45
00:01:59,951 --> 00:02:02,501
that each of these bonds consists of 2 electrons:

46
00:02:02,501 --> 00:02:05,210
one from the carbon, and one from the hydrogen.

47
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,976
Now, let's explore slightly larger chains.

48
00:02:07,976 --> 00:02:10,526
So let's say I have a two carbon chain -

49
00:02:10,526 --> 00:02:13,077
let me do a three carbon chain so it really looks like a chain.

50
00:02:13,077 --> 00:02:15,893
So if I were to draw everything explicitly, it might look like this:

51
00:02:15,893 --> 00:02:24,108
so I have a carbon, it has one, two, three, four electrons.

52
00:02:24,108 --> 00:02:27,966
Maybe I have another carbon here that has ..

53
00:02:27,966 --> 00:02:31,824
(let me do the carbons in slightly different shades of yellow).

54
00:02:31,843 --> 00:02:37,833
I have another carbon here that has 1, 2, 3, 4 electrons

55
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,044
and let me do the other carbon in the first yellow.

56
00:02:40,044 --> 00:02:42,256
So now we have a 3-carbon chain

57
00:02:42,256 --> 00:02:46,688
that has one, two, three, four valence electrons.

58
00:02:46,688 --> 00:02:49,921
Now these other guys are unpaired and if we don't specify it,

59
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:51,660
it's normally going to be hydrogen.

60
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,690
So, let me draw some hydrogens over here.

61
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,566
So you're going to have a hydrogen there,

62
00:02:55,566 --> 00:03:00,179
a hydrogen over there, a hydrogen over here...

63
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:04,378
a hydrogen over here, a hydrogen over there...

64
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:07,224
a hydrogen over here, almost done,

65
00:03:07,224 --> 00:03:09,606
hydrogen there and then a hydrogen there.

66
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,497
Now notice, in this molecular structure that I've drawn

67
00:03:12,497 --> 00:03:16,387
I have 3 carbons they were each able to form 4 bonds.

68
00:03:16,387 --> 00:03:19,171
This guy has bonds with 3 hydrogens and another carbon.

69
00:03:19,171 --> 00:03:22,355
This guy has a bond with two hydrogens and two carbons.

70
00:03:22,355 --> 00:03:24,046
This guy has a bond with three hydrogens,

71
00:03:24,046 --> 00:03:25,738
and then this carbon right here.

72
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:28,754
And so this is a completely valid molecular structure,

73
00:03:28,754 --> 00:03:32,770
but it was kind of a pain to draw all of these valence electrons.

74
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,795
So what we're typically going to do is - at least this structure

75
00:03:35,795 --> 00:03:37,221
we're going to see later in this video,

76
00:03:37,221 --> 00:03:38,823
there's a simpler ways to write it.

77
00:03:38,823 --> 00:03:41,329
So if we want to at least do it with these lines,

78
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:43,836
we can draw it like this.

79
00:03:43,836 --> 00:03:47,095
So you have a carbon, carbon, carbon,

80
00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:50,355
and then they are bonded to the hydrogens.

81
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,054
So you almost never see it written like this

82
00:03:52,054 --> 00:03:54,430
because this is kind of crazy.

83
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,321
Hydrogen, hydrogen, hydrogen..

84
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:59,839
At least crazy to write, it takes forever.

85
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,204
It might be messy,

86
00:04:01,204 --> 00:04:02,970
it might not be clear where these electrons belong.

87
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,020
I didn't write it clearly as I could.

88
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,437
So they have 2 electrons there, they share with these 2 guys.

89
00:04:07,437 --> 00:04:08,808
Hopefully that was reasonably clear.

90
00:04:08,808 --> 00:04:11,487
But if we were to draw with the lines, it looks just like that.

91
00:04:11,487 --> 00:04:13,782
So it is a little bit neater, faster to draw,

92
00:04:13,782 --> 00:04:16,539
same exact idea here and here.

93
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:19,862
And, in general, and we'll go in more detail on it.

94
00:04:19,862 --> 00:04:22,504
This 3 carbon chain, where everything is a single bond,

95
00:04:22,504 --> 00:04:23,854
is propane.

96
00:04:23,854 --> 00:04:26,937
Let me write these words down.

97
00:04:26,937 --> 00:04:28,082
This is methane.

98
00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:31,351
And you've going to see the rhyme...

99
00:04:31,351 --> 00:04:34,620
the reason to this naming soon enough.

100
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,103
This is methane, this is propane.

101
00:04:39,103 --> 00:04:42,702
And there is an even simpler way to write propane:

102
00:04:42,702 --> 00:04:46,302
you could write it like this...

103
00:04:46,302 --> 00:04:48,611
Instead of explicitly drawing these bonds,

104
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:50,920
you could say that this part right here -

105
00:04:50,920 --> 00:05:04,521
You could write that this is CH3: a CH3 connected to a CH2.

106
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:08,637
Which is then connected to another CH3.

107
00:05:08,637 --> 00:05:10,499
And the important thing is, no matter the notation,

108
00:05:10,499 --> 00:05:14,430
as long as you can figure out the exact molecular structure.

109
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,255
(this last CH3)

110
00:05:16,255 --> 00:05:18,137
Whether you have this, this or this.

111
00:05:18,137 --> 00:05:20,106
You know what the molecular structure is.

112
00:05:20,106 --> 00:05:23,403
You can draw any one of these given any of the others.

113
00:05:23,403 --> 00:05:25,347
Now there is an even simpler way to write this:

114
00:05:25,347 --> 00:05:27,292
you could write it just like this:

115
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:29,530
(let me do it in a different color)

116
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:34,753
You literally could write it- so we have 3 carbons, so 1, 2, 3.

117
00:05:34,753 --> 00:05:36,718
Now this seems ridiculously simple.

118
00:05:36,718 --> 00:05:40,960
How can this thing right here give you the same information

119
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,401
as all of these more complicated ways to draw it?

120
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:47,153
Well, in chemistry, and in organic chemistry in particular,

121
00:05:47,153 --> 00:05:52,152
this is called a line diagram or a line-angle diagram.

122
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:55,502
This is the simplest way, and probably the most useful way

123
00:05:55,502 --> 00:05:58,852
to show chains of carbons or to show organic molecules.

124
00:05:58,852 --> 00:06:01,420
Once they start to get really, really complicated,

125
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,519
because then it is a pain to draw all of the H's.

126
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,609
When you see something like this, you assume

127
00:06:06,609 --> 00:06:09,402
that the end points of any lines have a carbon on it.

128
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,377
So if you see something like that,

129
00:06:11,377 --> 00:06:13,353
you assume that there is a carbon at that end point

130
00:06:13,353 --> 00:06:16,186
and a carbon at that end point.

131
00:06:16,186 --> 00:06:18,612
And then you know that carbon makes 4 bonds.

132
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:21,037
There are no, kind of, charges here.

133
00:06:21,037 --> 00:06:23,902
All the carbons are going to make 4 bonds.

134
00:06:23,902 --> 00:06:26,970
And each of the carbons here - this carbon has 2 bonds

135
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,087
so the other 2 bonds are implicitly going to be with hydrogens.

136
00:06:30,087 --> 00:06:31,886
If they don't draw them, you assume

137
00:06:31,886 --> 00:06:33,686
that they are going to be with hydrogens.

138
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:38,470
This guy has 1 bond, so the other 3 must be with hydrogen.

139
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:41,553
This guy has 1 bond, so the other 3 must be hydrogens.

140
00:06:41,553 --> 00:06:45,682
So just drawing that little line-angle thing right there,

141
00:06:45,682 --> 00:06:48,686
I actually did convey the exact same information

142
00:06:48,686 --> 00:06:53,694
as this depiction, this depiction or this depiction.

143
00:06:53,694 --> 00:06:54,753
So you are going to see a lot of this.

144
00:06:54,753 --> 00:06:56,136
This really simplifies things.

145
00:06:56,136 --> 00:06:58,052
And sometimes you see things that are in between.

146
00:06:58,052 --> 00:07:00,368
You might see someone draw it like this:

147
00:07:00,368 --> 00:07:04,785
where they'll write CH3 and then they'll draw it like that.

148
00:07:04,785 --> 00:07:08,386
So that is kind of combining this way of writing the molecule

149
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,236
where you write the CH3's for the end points,

150
00:07:11,236 --> 00:07:13,902
but then you implicitly have the CH2 in the inside.

151
00:07:13,902 --> 00:07:15,552
You assume that this end point right here is a C

152
00:07:15,552 --> 00:07:18,037
and it is bonded to 2 hydrogens.

153
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:23,119
So these are all completely valid ways of... of...

154
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:25,354
drawing the molecular structures

155
00:07:25,354 --> 00:07:28,825
of these carbon chains or of these organic compounds.
