1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,218
Let's imagine ourselves in some kind of strange casino

2
00:00:03,218 --> 00:00:04,799
with very strange games

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,455
And you walk up to a table, and on that table

4
00:00:07,455 --> 00:00:09,674
there is an empty bag

5
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:14,819
and the guy who runs the table says, "Look, I've got some marbles here,

6
00:00:14,819 --> 00:00:19,400
three green marbles, two orange marbles, and I'm gonna stick them in the bag

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,469
And he literally sticks them into the empty bag

8
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:30,442
To show you that there is truly three green marbles, and two orange marbles.

9
00:00:30,442 --> 00:00:35,123
And he says, "The game that I want you to play, or if you choose to play,

10
00:00:35,123 --> 00:00:38,420
is you're going to look away, stick your hand in this bag

11
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,738
The bag is not transparent

12
00:00:39,738 --> 00:00:42,769
Feel around the marbles, all the marbles feel exactly the same

13
00:00:42,769 --> 00:00:45,974
And if you're able to pick two green marbles

14
00:00:45,974 --> 00:00:50,084
If you're able to take one marble out of the bag, it's green, you put it down on the table

15
00:00:50,084 --> 00:00:52,523
then put your hand back in the bag

16
00:00:52,523 --> 00:00:55,405
And take another marble, and if that one's also green

17
00:00:55,405 --> 00:00:58,769
Then you're going to win the prize of

18
00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:06,890
You're going to win one dollar if you get two greens.

19
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,305
Well you say, "this sounds like an interesting game,

20
00:01:08,305 --> 00:01:10,388
How much does it cost to play?"

21
00:01:10,388 --> 00:01:15,269
And the guy tells you it is 35 cents to play.

22
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:18,387
So obviously, fairly low stakes casino.

23
00:01:18,387 --> 00:01:23,071
So my question to you is, would you want to play this game?

24
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:25,286
And don't put, you know, the fun factor into it

25
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:32,350
Just economically, does it makes sense for you to actually play this game?

26
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,368
Well let's think through the probabilities a little bit.

27
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:41,219
So first of all, what's the probability that the first marble you pick is green?

28
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:47,938
What's the probability that first marble is green?

29
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:50,142
Actually, just let me write first green

30
00:01:50,142 --> 00:01:54,410
Probability first green

31
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,151
Well, the total possible outcomes

32
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:59,188
There's 5 marbles here all equally likely

33
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:01,304
So there's 5 possible outcomes

34
00:02:01,304 --> 00:02:04,522
3 of them satisfy your event that the first is green

35
00:02:04,522 --> 00:02:08,602
So there's a three-fifths probability that the first is green.

36
00:02:08,602 --> 00:02:10,437
So you have a three-fifths chance

37
00:02:10,437 --> 00:02:12,460
Three-fifths probability, I should say

38
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,891
That after that first pick you're kind of still in the game.

39
00:02:15,891 --> 00:02:20,810
Now, what we really care about is your probability of winning the game.

40
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,695
You want the first to be green, and the second green.

41
00:02:24,695 --> 00:02:27,606
Well let's think about this a little bit. What is the probability

42
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:32,111
that the first is green

43
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:32,960
I'll just write "g" for green

44
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:38,204
And the second is green.

45
00:02:38,204 --> 00:02:41,261
Now, you might be tempted to say

46
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,565
"Oh well the second being green is the same probability,

47
00:02:43,565 --> 00:02:47,608
it's three-fifths. I can just multiply three-fifths times three-fifths

48
00:02:47,608 --> 00:02:49,362
And I'll get nine over twenty-five

49
00:02:49,362 --> 00:02:52,245
Seems like a pretty straight-forward thing."

50
00:02:52,245 --> 00:02:56,177
But the realization here is what you do with that first green marble.

51
00:02:56,177 --> 00:03:00,037
You don't take that first green marble out, look at it, and put it back in the bag.

52
00:03:00,037 --> 00:03:05,560
So when you take that second pick, the number of green marbles that are in the bag

53
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,365
depends on what you got on the first pick.

54
00:03:07,365 --> 00:03:09,044
Remember, we take the marble out

55
00:03:09,044 --> 00:03:11,428
if it's a green marble or whatever marble it is

56
00:03:11,428 --> 00:03:14,175
Whatever after the first pick, we leave it on the table.

57
00:03:14,175 --> 00:03:17,413
We are not replacing it, so there's not any replacement here.

58
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:20,175
So these are not independent events.

59
00:03:20,175 --> 00:03:24,556
Let me make this clear, not independent.

60
00:03:24,556 --> 00:03:30,021
Or in particular, the second pick is dependent on the first.

61
00:03:30,021 --> 00:03:36,890
Dependent on the first pick.

62
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:41,679
If the first pick is green, then you don't have three green marbles in a bag of five

63
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:47,944
If the first pick is green, you now have two green marbles in a bag of four

64
00:03:47,944 --> 00:03:51,597
So the way that we would refer to this is the probability of both of these happening

65
00:03:51,597 --> 00:03:58,721
Yes, it's definitely equal to the probability of the first green

66
00:03:58,721 --> 00:04:07,185
times, now this is kind of the new idea, the probability of the second green

67
00:04:07,185 --> 00:04:10,057
given, this little line over here

68
00:04:10,057 --> 00:04:12,889
just this straight up, vertical line just means given

69
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:16,425
Given, this means given

70
00:04:16,425 --> 00:04:19,113
Given that the first was green.

71
00:04:19,113 --> 00:04:25,713
Now what is the probability that the second marble is green given that the first marble was green?

72
00:04:25,713 --> 00:04:28,177
Well we drew this scenario right over here

73
00:04:28,177 --> 00:04:33,262
If the first marble is green there are four possible outcomes

74
00:04:33,262 --> 00:04:34,642
not five anymore

75
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:39,180
And two of them satisfy your criteria.

76
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,507
So two of them satisfy your criteria.

77
00:04:41,507 --> 00:04:46,255
So the probability of the first marble being green and the second marble being green

78
00:04:46,255 --> 00:04:48,400
Is going to be the probability that your first is green

79
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,303
So it's going to be three-fifths

80
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:54,283
Times the probability that the second is green given the first was green.

81
00:04:54,283 --> 00:04:58,467
Now you have one less marble in the bag and we're assuming that the first pick was green

82
00:04:58,467 --> 00:05:01,887
So you only have two green marbles left.

83
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:05,171
And so what does this give us for our total probability?

84
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:07,137
Let's see. Three-fifths times two-fourths

85
00:05:07,137 --> 00:05:09,340
well two-fourths is the same thing as one half

86
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:14,202
This is going to be equal to three-fifths times one half

87
00:05:14,202 --> 00:05:16,051
Which is equal to three tenths

88
00:05:16,051 --> 00:05:20,941
Or we could write that as zero point three zero

89
00:05:20,941 --> 00:05:25,287
Or we could say that there is a 30 percent chance

90
00:05:25,287 --> 00:05:29,438
of picking two green marbles when we are not replacing.

91
00:05:29,438 --> 00:05:31,966
So, given that, let me ask you the question again

92
00:05:31,966 --> 00:05:35,054
Would you want to play this game?

93
00:05:35,054 --> 00:05:38,634
Well if you played this game many, many, many, many times

94
00:05:38,634 --> 00:05:43,871
On average, you have a 30 percent chance

95
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:47,467
of winning one dollar.

96
00:05:47,467 --> 00:05:49,021
And we haven't covered this yet,

97
00:05:49,021 --> 00:05:52,052
So your expected value is really going to be

98
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:55,690
30 percent times one dollar

99
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,754
This gives you a little bit of a preview

100
00:05:56,754 --> 00:06:01,462
Which is going to be thirty cents

101
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:03,021
Thirty percent chance of winning one dollar

102
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:04,655
You would expect, on average,

103
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,152
if you were to play this many, many, many times

104
00:06:06,152 --> 00:06:11,002
that playing the game is going to give you 30 cents.

105
00:06:11,002 --> 00:06:13,054
Now, would you want to give someone

106
00:06:13,054 --> 00:06:17,660
35 cents to get on average 30 cents?

107
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,020
No! You would not want to play this game.

108
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,635
Now, one thing I will let you think about is

109
00:06:23,635 --> 00:06:24,919
Would you want to play this game

110
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:29,292
If you could replace the green marble the first pick

111
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:31,493
After the first pick if you could replace the green marble

112
00:06:31,493 --> 00:06:36,823
Would you want to play the game in that scenario?
