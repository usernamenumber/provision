00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,202
Problem one: For zero less than or equal to [t] less than or equal to six, a particle is moving along the x-axis.

2
00:00:07,236 --> 00:00:17,986
The particle's position x(t) is NOT explicitly given; the velocity of the particle is given by v(t) is equal to all of this business right over here;

3
00:00:17,986 --> 00:00:23,086
the acceleration of the particle is given by a(t) is equal to all of this business over here. They actually

4
00:00:23,086 --> 00:00:27,236
didn't have to give us that, because is acceleration is just the derivative of the velocity.

5
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:31,318
And they also give us- they don't tell us the position function but they tell us where we start off

6
00:00:31,318 --> 00:00:35,568
x(0) is equal to 2. Fair enough. Now let's do part a):

7
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:43,586
Is the SPEED of the particle increasing or decreasing at the equals 5.5 give a reason for your answer.

8
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:46,752
It looks like they did something a little sneaky here. because they gave us the velocity

9
00:00:46,752 --> 00:00:49,653
function and they ask about the speed.

10
00:00:49,653 --> 00:00:51,286
You might say, "Wait- aren't those the same thing?"

11
00:00:51,286 --> 00:00:53,618
And I would tell you "No!" they aren't quite the same thing.

12
00:00:53,618 --> 00:00:57,485
Velocity is a magnitude and a direction- it is a vector quantity.

13
00:00:57,485 --> 00:01:00,735
Speed is just a magnitude- it is a caller quantity.

14
00:01:00,735 --> 00:01:02,918
And to see the difference, you should have a velocity-

15
00:01:02,918 --> 00:01:05,186
and this is particular to this problem-

16
00:01:05,186 --> 00:01:07,668
because they don't give us the units- but you could have a velocity

17
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:11,817
or -5 meters per second and maybe if you were talking about on

18
00:01:11,817 --> 00:01:15,418
the x-axis, this would mean we're moving leftward at 5 meters per second

19
00:01:15,418 --> 00:01:19,186
on the x-axis. So the magnitude is 5 meters per second,

20
00:01:19,186 --> 00:01:25,403
this is the magnitude, and the direction is specified by the negative number.

21
00:01:25,403 --> 00:01:31,452
and that is the direction. Your velocity could be -5 meters per second, but your speed

22
00:01:31,452 --> 00:01:38,819
would just be 5 meters per second. So, your speed is 5 meters per second whether

23
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:42,669
you're going to the left OR the right. Your velocity you actually care

24
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:46,020
whether you're going to the left or the right. So let's just keep that in mind while we try to solve this

25
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,601
problem. So the best way to figure out whether our rate of change is increasing

26
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:56,836
or decreasing is to look at the acceleration. Because acceleration is, really, just the rate of

27
00:01:56,836 --> 00:02:01,903
change of velocity. And then we can think a little but about the velocity

28
00:02:01,903 --> 00:02:07,585
vs. speed question. So what us the acceleration at time 5.5?

29
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:12,369
Get the calculator out- we can use calculator for this part of the AP exam.

30
00:02:12,369 --> 00:02:17,586
I assume they intended us to because isn't something that easy to calculate by hand.

31
00:02:17,586 --> 00:02:22,537
So the acceleration at time 5.5- we just have to put [t] which is 5.5 and evaluate this function.

32
00:02:22,537 --> 00:02:29,903
So 1/2- I'll just write 0.5- times [e] to the [t] over 5. We'll
