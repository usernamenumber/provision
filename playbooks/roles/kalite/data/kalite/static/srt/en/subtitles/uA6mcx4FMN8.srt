1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
   

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,580
We're on problem 58.

3
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,040
The graph of the equation y is
equal to x squared minus 3x

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,300
minus 4 is shown below.

5
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,270
Fair enough.

6
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:14,380
For what value or values
of x is y equal to 0?

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,350
So they're essentially
saying is, when does

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,470
this here equal 0?

9
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,030
They want to know when
does y equal 0?

10
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,590
So what values of x
does that happen?

11
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,180
And we could factor this and
solve for the roots, but they

12
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,970
drew us the graph, so let's
just inspect it.

13
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,270
So when does y equal 0?

14
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,180
So let me draw the line
of y is equal to 0.

15
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,590
So that's right here.

16
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,130
Let me draw it as a line.

17
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,160
y equals 0.

18
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,970
That's y equals 0 right there.

19
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:41,240
So what values of x
makes y equal 0?

20
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,970
If I can see this properly,
it's when x is equal to

21
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,330
negative 1 and when
x is equal to 4.

22
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,715
So x is equal to negative
1 or 4.

23
00:00:50,715 --> 00:00:53,480
And if we substitute either of
these values into this right

24
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,240
here, we should get
y is equal to 0.

25
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:57,850
And let's see.

26
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,850
The choices, do they have
negative 1 and 4?

27
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,180
Yep, sure enough.

28
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,150
Negative 1 and 4 right there.

29
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:12,450
Next question, 59.

30
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,720
Let me copy and paste it.

31
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,190
OK, I've copied it.

32
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,450
I'll paste it below.

33
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,300
I'll do it right
on top of this.

34
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:24,730
There you go.

35
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:25,280
59.

36
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,560
Let me erase this stuff
right here.

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,960
This is unrelated
to this problem.

38
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,970
So they are asking-- let me get
the pen right-- which best

39
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,060
represents the graph of
y is equal to minus x

40
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,470
squared plus 3?

41
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,020
So here, just to get an
intuition of what parabolas

42
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,205
look like, because these are all
parabolas, or the graph of

43
00:01:46,205 --> 00:01:48,010
a quadratic equation.

44
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:52,230
So if I had the graph of y is
equal to x squared, what does

45
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,010
that look like?

46
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:57,380
Let me just draw a quick and
dirty x- and y-axis.

47
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,510
And I think you're familiar
with what that looks like.

48
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,750
So if I were to just draw y is
equal to x squared, that looks

49
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,855
something like this.

50
00:02:03,855 --> 00:02:07,750
It looks something like this.

51
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,210
It will look something
like that.

52
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,930
I think you're familiar
with it.

53
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,270
Because you're taking x squared,
you always get

54
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,160
positive values.

55
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,930
Even if you have a negative
number squared that still

56
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,870
becomes a positive.

57
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:22,740
And it's symmetric around the
line x is equal to 0.

58
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,180
That's the graph of y
equals x squared.

59
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:24,910
Now let me ask you a question.

60
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:28,600
What is the graph of y is equal
to minus x squared?

61
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,370
Let me do that.

62
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,680
y is equal to minus x squared.

63
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,430
So it's essentially the same
thing as this graph, but it's

64
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,150
going to be the negative
of whatever you get.

65
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,860
So here, x squared is always
going to be positive.

66
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,510
You square any real number
and you're going to

67
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,670
get a positive number.

68
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,370
Here, you square any real
number, this part right here

69
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,070
becomes positive.

70
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,430
But then you take the
negative of it.

71
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,470
So this is always going to
be a negative number.

72
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:57,520
So x equals 0 is still going to
be there, but regardless of

73
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,667
whether you go in the positive
x direction or the negative x

74
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:01,550
direction, this is going
to be positive.

75
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,460
But then you put the
negative sign, it's

76
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,330
going to become negative.

77
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,806
So the graph is going
to look like this.

78
00:03:05,806 --> 00:03:08,580
The graph is going to
look like that.

79
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,650
I didn't draw that well, let
me give that another shot.

80
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,100
The graph is going to
look like that.

81
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,270
It's essentially like the mirror
image of this one if

82
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,210
you were to reflect
it on the x-axis.

83
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,820
This is y equals minus
x squared.

84
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,150
So now you're pointing
it down.

85
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,440
The u goes-- opens
up downward.

86
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,990
And hopefully that makes
a little bit of sense.

87
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,200
And now, what happens if
you do plus or minus 3?

88
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,650
So what is y is equal
to x squared plus 3?

89
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:37,510
   

90
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,820
Not minus x squared plus 3,
but just x squared plus 3.

91
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,410
So if you start with x squared,
now every y value for

92
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,450
every given x is just going
to be 3 higher.

93
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,390
So it's just going to shift
the graph up by 3.

94
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,910
It's going to look like that.

95
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,190
So if you go from x squared to
x squared plus 3, you're just

96
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,690
shifting up by 3.

97
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,890
Similar, if you go from minus
x squared to minus x squared

98
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,200
plus 3, which is what they gave
us in the problem, you're

99
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,375
just going to shift
the graph up by 3.

100
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,550
So I'll do that in
this brown color.

101
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,500
So it's just going to take this
graph, which is minus x

102
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,590
squared and you're going
to shift it up by 3.

103
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,840
So it's going to look
something like this.

104
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,200
It's going to look something
like that.

105
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,610
So let's see, out of all the
choices they gave us, it

106
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:19,740
should be opening downward and
it should have its y-intercept

107
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,520
at y is equal to 3.

108
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,950
If you put x is equal to
0, y is equal to 3.

109
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:25,750
So let's see.

110
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,290
It's opening downwards.

111
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,650
So these two are the only two
that are opening downwards.

112
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,620
And the y-intercept should
be at 3 because we

113
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,780
shifted it up by 3.

114
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,900
So this is the choice B.

115
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,470
Problem 60.

116
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:44,400
Which quadratic funtion, when
graphed, has x-intercepts of 4

117
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,180
and minus 3?

118
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,860
So x-intercepts of 4 and minus
3 means that when you

119
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,880
substitute x of either of
these values into the

120
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,450
equation, you get
y is equal to 0.

121
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,630
Because when y is equal to 0,
you're at the x-intercepts.

122
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,370
This is when y equals to 0.

123
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,620
So that's what they mean
by x-intercepts.

124
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,550
   

125
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,240
So how do we set up an equation
where if I put in one

126
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,170
of these numbers I'm
going to get 0?

127
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:16,090
Well, if I make it the product
of x minus the first root and

128
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,790
x minus the second root.

129
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:22,040
So x minus minus
3 is x plus 3.

130
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,720
So think about it.

131
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,790
If you put 4 here for x, you
get 4 minus 4, which is 0.

132
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,940
Times 4 plus 3 is 7.

133
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,080
So 0 times 7 is 0.

134
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,350
So that works.

135
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,880
And then, for minus 3.

136
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,780
Minus 3 minus 4 is minus 7.

137
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,960
But then minus 3
plus 3 is a 0.

138
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,880
So either of these, when you
substitute it into this

139
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,820
expression, you get 0.

140
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,185
Let's see, which
choice is that?

141
00:05:42,185 --> 00:05:49,210
x minus 4 times x plus 3.

142
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:57,590
Have the x-intercepts
of 4 and minus 3.

143
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,350
Right.

144
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,610
This should be right.

145
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,920
They're being tricky
right here.

146
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,620
So x plus 3 is there.

147
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,330
I see that in a couple
of them, right?

148
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,990
But I don't see the x
minus 4 anywhere.

149
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:11,910
But that's because we can
multiply this by any constant.

150
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,350
Because 0 times some number
times some constant is still

151
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,440
going to be 0.

152
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,270
So if you look at this one
right here, 2x minus 8.

153
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,030
We could factor out a 2.

154
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:26,460
That's the same thing as
2 times x minus 4.

155
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,720
So choice B is x plus 3,
times x minus 4, times

156
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,100
some constant 2.

157
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,740
So choice B is our answer.

158
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,560
If this is equal to 0 when x is
equal to 4 minus 3, this--

159
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:45,220
any constant, x minus 4 times x
plus 3--I that's still going

160
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,260
to be equal to 0.

161
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,915
Because when x is equal
to 4, this is going

162
00:06:47,915 --> 00:06:48,740
to be equal to 0.

163
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,450
So 0 times anything times
anything else

164
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,190
is going to be 0.

165
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,070
Same thing with x is
equal to minus 3.

166
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,710
So they just put a 2 here.

167
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:55,600
That's a good problem.

168
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,910
It made you realize that you
could put a constant in there

169
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,110
and it's a little tricky.

170
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,360
Next problem.

171
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,790
   

172
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:16,130
OK, so they want to know-- let
me copy and paste it-- how

173
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,650
many times does the graph of y
equals 2x squared minus 2x

174
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:23,170
plus 3 intersect the x-axis?

175
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,450
So the easiest thing-- because
maybe it doesn't intersect the

176
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,420
x-axis at all.

177
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,450
Maybe if you use a quadratic
equation

178
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,650
there are no real solutions.

179
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,280
So let's just apply
the quadratic.

180
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,670
So the roots or the times that--
I guess the x values

181
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:42,650
that solve this equation, 2x
squared minus 2x plus 3 is

182
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,030
equal to 0.

183
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,540
And these are the x
values where you

184
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,730
intersect the x-axis.

185
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:47,500
And why do I say that?

186
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,820
Because the x-axis is the
line y is equal to 0.

187
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,200
So I set y equal to
0 and I get this.

188
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,530
And we know from the quadratic
equation the solution to this

189
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,680
is negative b-- let me do
this in another color.

190
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,210
So negative b.

191
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,500
So minus minus 2 is 2.

192
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,370
Plus or minus the square
root of b squared.

193
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,100
Minus 2 squared is 4.

194
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:16,320
Minus 4 times a, which is 2.

195
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,220
Times c, times 3.

196
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,860
All of that over 2a.

197
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,670
2 times 2, which is 4.

198
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,840
Now they don't want
us to figure out

199
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,500
the roots or anything.

200
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,420
They just want to know,
how many times does it

201
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,570
intersect the axis?

202
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:27,750
So let's think about this.

203
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,140
What happens under this
radical sign?

204
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,350
We have 4 times 2
times 3 is 24.

205
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:37,970
So this becomes 2 plus or
minus 4 minus 24 over 4.

206
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,960
This is minus 20.

207
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,010
So you end up with minus 20
under the radical sign.

208
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,220
And we know if we're dealing
with real numbers, if we want

209
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,430
real solutions, you can't take
the square root of minus 20.

210
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,040
So this actually has no
solutions or, another way to

211
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,700
put it is, there is no x values
where y is equal to 0.

212
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,720
Or another way to put it
is, this never does

213
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,820
intersect the x-axis.

214
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,680
So it's A.

215
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,270
none.

216
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,970
What gave that away was the fact
that when you apply the

217
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:09,750
quadratic equation, you get a
negative number under the

218
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,410
radical sign.

219
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,570
So if we're dealing
with real numbers,

220
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:14,340
there's no answer there.

221
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,590
Next question.

222
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:19,740
   

223
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:27,700
62.

224
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,260
An object that is projected
straight down-- oh, this is

225
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,070
good, this is projectile
motion-- is projected straight

226
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:35,650
downward with initial velocity
v feet per second, Travels a

227
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:40,400
distance of s v times t plus
16t squared, where t equals

228
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,580
time in seconds.

229
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,520
If Ramon is standing on a
balcony 84 feet above the

230
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,170
ground and throws a penny
straight down with an initial

231
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,760
velocity of 10 feet per second,
in how many seconds

232
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,330
will it reach the ground?

233
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:58,840
OK, so he's 84 feet
above the ground.

234
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,450
Let's draw a diagram.

235
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,800
He's 84 feet.

236
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,180
This is 84 feet above
the ground.

237
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,580
It says, how many seconds will
it reach the ground?

238
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,500
So we essentially want to know
how many seconds will it take

239
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,080
it to travel? s is
distance, right?

240
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,560
So s is equal to 84 feet.

241
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,690
It has to go down 84 feet.

242
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,490
Let's see if we can
figure this out.

243
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:22,240
Now this is something that might
be a little bit-- so how

244
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,620
long does it take it to go 84
feet, I guess is the best way

245
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,540
to think about it.

246
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:31,490
So we say 84 is equal to
velocity times-- your initial

247
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,870
velocity times time.

248
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:37,090
And your initial velocity
is 10 feet per second.

249
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,710
So it's 10 feet per second.

250
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,150
Everything is in feet I think.

251
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,010
Right, everything is--
v feet per second.

252
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:45,110
Initial velocity of
v feet per second.

253
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,100
So 10 feet per second
times time.

254
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,870
I just substituted what
they gave us.

255
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,670
10 for v.

256
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,920
Plus 16t squared.

257
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,590
And now I just solve
this quadratic.

258
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,070
That is a t right there.

259
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,450
So let me put everything on the
same-- let me subtract 84

260
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,080
from both sides and I'll
rearrange a little bit.

261
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:11,700
So you get 16t squared plus 10t
minus 84 is equal to 0.

262
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,720
Well I swapped the sides.

263
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,940
I put these on the left.

264
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,730
Well, let me just show
you what I did.

265
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:17,710
I swapped the sides.

266
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:23,180
So I made this 16t squared
plus 10t equals 84.

267
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,110
I just swapped them.

268
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,910
And then I subtracted 84 from
both sides to get this.

269
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,650
And now we just have to
solve when t equals 0.

270
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:32,190
So I guess the first thing we
could do is we could simplify

271
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:32,840
this a little bit.

272
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,080
Everything here is
divisible by 2.

273
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,886
So this is 8t squared plus-- I'm
just dividing both sides

274
00:11:39,886 --> 00:11:41,150
of this equation by 2.

275
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,930
Plus 5t minus what?

276
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:48,670
Minus 42 is equal to 0.

277
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:51,200
And then we can use the
quadratic equation.

278
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,200
So what are the solutions? t
is equal to negatives b.

279
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:02,980
So minus 5 plus or minus the
square root of b squared, so

280
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:07,880
25, minus 4 times a.

281
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,360
times 8, times c.
c is minus 42.

282
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,720
So instead of times minus
42, let's put a plus

283
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,540
here and do plus 42.

284
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,610
Just a negative times a negative
is a positive.

285
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,540
All of that, over 2 times a.

286
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,652
2a is 16.

287
00:12:24,652 --> 00:12:26,150
So let's see where
that gets me.

288
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:32,030
So I t is equal to minus 5 plus
or minus the square root.

289
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:32,550
What is this?

290
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:35,330
25 plus-- let's see.

291
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:39,440
4 times 8 times 42.

292
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,580
That's 32 times 42.

293
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:46,840
32 times 42.

294
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,590
2 times 32 is 64.

295
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,340
Put a 0.

296
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,250
4 times 2 is 8.

297
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:56,970
4 times 3 is 12.

298
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:05,810
You end up with 4,
14, 3 and 1.

299
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:06,880
So this is 1,344.

300
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,530
And we're going to
add this 25 here.

301
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,200
So let me see.

302
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,620
Plus 1,344.

303
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,800
All of that over 16.

304
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:13,970
Let's see.

305
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,640
1,344 plus 25.

306
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,280
So it's minus 5 plus or
minus the square root

307
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,370
of-- what is this?

308
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:29,150
1,369 over 16.

309
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,230
And actually, I don't
know what the square

310
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,430
root of 1369 is.

311
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:34,040
Let me get the calculator.

312
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,040
Let me open it up.

313
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,060
Give me one second.

314
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:42,540
Accessories, calculator.

315
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,510
All right.

316
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:48,630
So 1,369.

317
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,410
37.

318
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,390
Look at that.

319
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:53,440
OK, so it's minus 5
plus or minus 37.

320
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,440
That's the square
root of 1,369.

321
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:01,600
So minus 5 plus or minus 37 over
16 is equal to the time.

322
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,020
Now we don't have to worry about
the minus because that's

323
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:03,950
going to give us a
negative number.

324
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,110
Minus 5 minus 37 over 16.

325
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,780
We don't want a negative time,
we want a positive time.

326
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,080
So let's just do the positive.

327
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,240
So minus 5 plus 37.

328
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:13,450
Let's see.

329
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,830
Minus 5 plus 37 over 16.

330
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:21,340
So that's 32/16, which
equals to 2 seconds.

331
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,290
And that's choice A.

332
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,590
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
