1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,639
Express 0.0000000003457 in scientific notation

2
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:17,921
So let's just remind ourselves what it means to be in scientific notation

3
00:00:17,952 --> 00:00:22,399
Scientific notation will be some number times some power of 10

4
00:00:22,415 --> 00:00:24,703
Where this number right here is going to be

5
00:00:24,703 --> 00:00:26,969
Let me write it this way

6
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:30,038
It's going to be greater than or equal to 1, and it's going to be less than 10

7
00:00:30,038 --> 00:00:34,435
So over here, what we want to put here is that leading number is going to be

8
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:37,635
And in general you're going to look for the first non-zero digit

9
00:00:37,635 --> 00:00:40,174
And this is the number that you're going to want to start off with

10
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:43,237
This is the only number you're going to want to put ahead of

11
00:00:43,237 --> 00:00:45,131
– or I guess to the left of –

12
00:00:45,131 --> 00:00:46,113
Of the decimal point

13
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:48,213
So we could write 3.457

14
00:00:48,213 --> 00:00:52,546
3.457

15
00:00:52,546 --> 00:00:56,247
And it's going to be multiplied by 10 to something

16
00:00:56,247 --> 00:00:59,048
Now let's think about what we're going to have to multiply it by

17
00:00:59,048 --> 00:01:03,381
To go from 3.457 to this very, very small number

18
00:01:03,381 --> 00:01:07,719
I mean we have had to move the decimal from 3.457 to get to this

19
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:10,045
You have to move the decimal to the left a bunch

20
00:01:10,045 --> 00:01:12,635
You have to add a bunch of 0's to the left of the 3

21
00:01:12,635 --> 00:01:16,971
You have to keep moving the decimal over to the left

22
00:01:16,971 --> 00:01:21,768
To do that, we're essentially making the number much, much, much smaller

23
00:01:21,768 --> 00:01:25,637
So we are not going to multiply it with a positive exponent of 10

24
00:01:25,637 --> 00:01:28,637
We are going to multiply it times a negative exponent of 10

25
00:01:28,637 --> 00:01:33,381
that the equivalent is you kind of dividing by a positive exponent of 10

26
00:01:33,381 --> 00:01:35,465
the best way to think about it

27
00:01:35,465 --> 00:01:39,303
When you move your exponent one to the left

28
00:01:39,303 --> 00:01:47,301
You dividing by 10 which is equivalent to multiply by 10 to the negative 1 power

29
00:01:47,301 --> 00:01:49,568
Let me give you an example here

30
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:54,303
So if I have 1 times 10 is clearly just equal to 10

31
00:01:54,303 --> 00:01:57,053
1 times 10 to the negative 1

32
00:01:57,053 --> 00:02:02,169
That's equal to 1 times 1/10 which is equal to 1/10

33
00:02:02,169 --> 00:02:09,547
1 times---which is equal to 0--I skip the step right there

34
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:12,303
Let me add 1 times 10 to the 0

35
00:02:12,303 --> 00:02:13,706
So we have something natural

36
00:02:13,706 --> 00:02:14,967
So this is 1 times to the first

37
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:19,112
1 times to the 0 is equal to 1 times 1 which is equal to 1

38
00:02:19,112 --> 00:02:28,056
1 times 10 to the negative 1 is equal to 1/10 which is equal to 0.1

39
00:02:28,056 --> 00:02:32,244
If I do 1 times 10 to the negative 2

40
00:02:32,244 --> 00:02:36,571
10 to the negative 2 is 1/10 squared or 1/100

41
00:02:36,571 --> 00:02:41,303
so this is going to be 1/100 which is 0.01

42
00:02:41,303 --> 00:02:43,057
What happened here?

43
00:02:43,057 --> 00:02:44,639
When I read it to the negative power

44
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,137
I read it to the negative 1 power

45
00:02:46,137 --> 00:02:50,303
I essentially move the decimal from the right of the one to the left of the one

46
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,389
I move from there to there

47
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:55,641
When I get to -2, I move the 2 over the left

48
00:02:55,641 --> 00:03:02,466
So how many times we are going to move it over to the left to get this number right over here

49
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:06,568
So we essentially, so let's think about how many zeros we have

50
00:03:06,568 --> 00:03:09,307
So we have to move it 1 times to get in front of the 3

51
00:03:09,307 --> 00:03:13,167
and then we have to move it that means more times to get all of the zeros

52
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:14,903
in there

53
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,501
so we have to move it 1 time to get the 3

54
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:18,903
So we start here

55
00:03:18,903 --> 00:03:27,300
We are going to move 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10..10 times

56
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:33,306
So this is going to be 3.457 times 10 to the negative 10 power

57
00:03:33,306 --> 00:03:34,300
Let me just rewrite it

58
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:39,503
So 3.457 times 10 to the negative 10 power

59
00:03:39,503 --> 00:03:43,900
So in general, what you want to do is you want to find the first non zero number here

60
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,902
Remember, you want a number here that between 1 and 10

61
00:03:46,902 --> 00:03:49,371
and it could be equal to 1 but it has to be less than 10

62
00:03:49,371 --> 00:03:53,054
3.457 definitely fits that bill

63
00:03:53,054 --> 00:03:54,900
It's between 1 and 10

64
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,810
And then you just want to count the leading zero between the decimal of that number and

65
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:05,391
and include the number because that tells you how many times you have to shift the decimal over to actually get this number

66
00:04:05,391 --> 00:04:06,058
up here

67
00:04:06,058 --> 00:04:11,300
So we have to shift this decimal 10 times to the left to get this thing up here
