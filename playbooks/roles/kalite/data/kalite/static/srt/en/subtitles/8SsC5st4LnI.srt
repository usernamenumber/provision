1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,670
   

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,870
Welcome to the video on
the Taylor Theorem and

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,330
Taylor polynomials.

4
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,190
And we've actually
already touched on this.

5
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,980
When we did the videos on
approximating functions with

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,430
polynomials, we used Maclaurin
series, which is actually a

7
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,060
special case of the Taylor
polynomial or the

8
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:16,940
Taylor Theorem.

9
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,980
And we just pick, we
approximate the function

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,630
around x equals 0 when we
did the Maclaurin series.

11
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,680
But in general, you could
approximate a function

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,890
around any value.

13
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:30,090
And if you do it around
something other than 0, it's

14
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,980
kind of the more general
case, and we're dealing

15
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,680
with the Taylor polynomial.

16
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,640
So what is that?

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,680
Let me just write the
definition down, and then we'll

18
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,110
do a couple of examples, and
then we'll graph it to

19
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,280
get the intuition.

20
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,550
So a Taylor polynomial says
that if I have a differentiable

21
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:51,860
function f of x, and I want
to approximate it with a

22
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:57,120
polynomial at c, so at some
value of x equals c, I want to

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,370
approximate this function.

24
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,070
So let me just draw a quick and
dirty one, and we'll actually

25
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,310
draw an accurate one later.

26
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:06,980
So let's say that that's
my axes, this is my

27
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,610
function f of x.

28
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,260
So I could pick some value
c, some value x is equal to

29
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,730
c, maybe it's right there.

30
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:18,970
So that's c.

31
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,540
And I would want to approximate
it, I would want to create a

32
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,280
polynomial that can approximate
the function around this point.

33
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,520
And the Taylor Theorem tells us
that the Taylor polynomial to

34
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,160
approximate this is, and then
I'll give you the intuition

35
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,950
for it in a second.

36
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,030
p of x.

37
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,420
And this looks really
complicated, but when you

38
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,510
do some examples, you'll
see it's not so bad.

39
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:57,710
p of x is equal to f of c plus
f prime of c times x minus c

40
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:04,470
plus f prime prime of c over,
they say 2 factorial, which is

41
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,080
just 2, but OK, I'll
write 2 factorial.

42
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,940
They do that so that you see
the pattern that emerges.

43
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,850
This is over 1 factorial,
really, and this is over

44
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,030
0 factorial, really.

45
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:21,240
Times x minus c squared plus,
I'm already running out of

46
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,970
space, f the third derivative,
I think at this point people

47
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:31,210
just write a 3 in parentheses,
of the function evaluated at c

48
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:37,770
over 3 factorial times x minus
c to the third, and you could

49
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,030
just keep adding terms.

50
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,570
You could go on like
this for infinity.

51
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,640
But let me give you the
intuition of what this is.

52
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,470
Let me just show you, just
to hit the point home.

53
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:52,590
Then you could plus the fourth
derivative of the function

54
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:59,190
evaluated at c times over 4
factorial times x minus

55
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,070
c to the fourth.

56
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,950
Now what's the intuition?

57
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,440
So first of all, what happens
to this polynomial at c?

58
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,110
So what's p of c?

59
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:15,700
p of c is equal to-- if p of c,
everywhere where you see an x

60
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,390
here, you have to
put a c, right?

61
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,960
So this term would be c minus
c, so that would go to

62
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,790
zero, or it would be 0.

63
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,470
This term would be c
minus c, it would be 0.

64
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,030
This term would be c minus
c, so it would be 0.

65
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,490
This term would
be c minus c, 0.

66
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,310
And all you'd be left
with is this f of c.

67
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,910
   

68
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,150
So great.

69
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,750
We already know that, at least
at the value of c, the

70
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,590
polynomial is equal
to the function.

71
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,340
So it's going to
intersect this line.

72
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:42,730
Right?

73
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,380
And actually, if we just had a
Taylor polynomial with just

74
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,800
that first term, what
would it look like?

75
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,940
Well, it would just be a
horizontal line right there.

76
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,150
So it would be a pretty
bad approximation.

77
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,260
But, what does this
second term do us?

78
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,900
Because we know that if
we just evaluated c.

79
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,830
All these other terms
just drop out.

80
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,610
So what do they do for us?

81
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:04,280
Well, the second term actually
ensures that the derivative of

82
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,030
this polynomial, evaluated at
c, is equal to the derivative

83
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,100
of this function,
evaluated at c.

84
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,235
What do I mean there?

85
00:04:11,235 --> 00:04:14,580
Well, what's p prime of x?

86
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:19,410
p prime of x is equal to, well,
this is just a constant term.

87
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,030
It might look like a function,
but it's a function evaluated

88
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,210
at c, so it's just
a constant term.

89
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,850
And so, that's 0.

90
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:26,640
And then, what is this?

91
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,590
What's the derivative of this?

92
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:32,965
Well, we could use, this is
a constant term, and the

93
00:04:32,965 --> 00:04:34,910
derivative of this is just 1.

94
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,630
So you could almost just view
this as f prime of c times x,

95
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,630
minus f prime of c times c
which is a constant, whatever.

96
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:47,390
So the derivative of this
expression is f of c, and then

97
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:50,610
plus the derivative of this
expression, and that's

98
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:51,310
equal to what?

99
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:56,010
2 times 2 divided by 2
factorial, which is just 1.

100
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:02,130
So it's f prime prime of
c, times x minus c, and

101
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,310
then plus, let's see.

102
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:07,890
3 over 3 factorial, so that's
3 over 6, we'll just have

103
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,220
a 2 in the denominator.

104
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:15,820
f prime prime prime of
c over, what was it, 2

105
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,636
times x minus c squared--

106
00:05:19,636 --> 00:05:21,520
And you don't have to
worry about all of this.

107
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,630
And then, we could
just keep going.

108
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,380
But I wanted just to
show you one thing.

109
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,560
What is t prime at c?

110
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,740
t prime at c.

111
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,580
What is the derivative
of this polynomial when

112
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,660
you evaluate it at c?

113
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,650
Well, when you put c into this
derivative function, all these

114
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,180
other terms are going to drop
off, and you're just

115
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,440
left with this one.

116
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:42,640
Right?

117
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,930
Because this x minus c--
sorry, just had some walnuts.

118
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,730
I should have some
water with it.

119
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,970
If you put the c
here, they drop out.

120
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,420
So the derivative of this
function evaluated at c,

121
00:05:54,420 --> 00:06:01,000
is equal to f prime of c.

122
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,610
So as you can see, what's neat
about this Taylor polynomial

123
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:10,540
is, it's equal to the function
at c, its derivative is equal

124
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:14,570
to the function at c, the
second derivative is equal

125
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,590
to the function at c.

126
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:19,820
And every term you add to the
Taylor polynomial actually

127
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:25,100
makes it so that that term,
derivative, of the polynomial

128
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,190
evaluated at c, is
equal to the function.

129
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,570
Hope I didn't confuse you.

130
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,440
The big picture is, the whole
thinking behind, I guess, what

131
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,470
Taylor thought of, was, wow.

132
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:41,270
If this function is infinitely
differentiable, meaning that I

133
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,960
can take the first, second,
third, fourth, you know, all

134
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,460
the way to infinity derivative
of this function, I could

135
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,550
construct a polynomial like
this, and i can just keep going

136
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:55,960
by adding more and more terms,
so that this polynomial's, you

137
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,350
know, zeroth derivative, which
is means the function, the 0,

138
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:02,300
first, second, third, fourth,
all of this polynomial's

139
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,610
derivatives are going to
be equal to the function.

140
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,835
At least around that point.

141
00:07:06,835 --> 00:07:09,020
And actually, we'll see that
there's actually a whole class

142
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,820
of functions, that the Taylor
polynomial, if you were to take

143
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:16,960
the infinite series, is
actually equal to that

144
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,180
function at all points.

145
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:18,640
But anyway.

146
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,730
And actually, I talk a little
bit about that when I prove

147
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:24,490
that e to the i pi is equal to
negative 1, which to me was the

148
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,080
most amazing result
in mathematics.

149
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,350
Whatever, whatever.

150
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,650
This might have been a little
confusing for you, so let's

151
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,810
do a particular example.

152
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,500
   

153
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,805
The particulars are
always the more fun.

154
00:07:38,805 --> 00:07:41,450
   

155
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,580
I think when you see me do
an example, you'll see

156
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,430
that it's not so bad.

157
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,285
I'm even going to erase
this fourth term.

158
00:07:47,285 --> 00:07:51,560
   

159
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:57,630
So let's approximate, I
don't know, cosine of x.

160
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,154
So let's say that f of x
is equal to, let me do

161
00:08:00,154 --> 00:08:01,520
it in a different color.

162
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,310
We want to approximate f of x
is equal to cosine of access.

163
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,600
And let's pick some
arbitrary number.

164
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,650
Let's not pick some number
that works well with

165
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,550
trigonometric functions.

166
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:14,200
Let's pick around, let's
say c is equal to 2.

167
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,710
No, 1.

168
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:22,380
So we're going to approximate
cosine of x around 1.

169
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,100
So what is the Taylor
approximation, or the

170
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,300
Taylor polynomial?

171
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,770
Well, we could just
chug through this one.

172
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:33,280
p of x, I'll do it in yellow.

173
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,830
p of x is equal to f of c.

174
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:45,090
So the function evaluated at c
is just cosine of 1, right?

175
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:48,560
plus s prime of c.

176
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,410
Well, what is the
derivative of cosine of x?

177
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,360
It's minus sine of x, right?

178
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,820
Minus sine of x, and we
want to evaluate it at c.

179
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:04,770
So it's minus sine of 1,
right? c is one, that's

180
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,390
we're approximating around.

181
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:10,210
Times x minus c.

182
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:15,320
And then, plus the
second derivative of x.

183
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,150
So what's the
second derivative?

184
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,140
What's going to be the
derivative of minus sine,

185
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,180
which is minus cosine of x?

186
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,380
So it's minus cosine.

187
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,920
But we're evaluating it at c,
so there's actually going

188
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,080
to be a number, right?

189
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,910
So c is 1.

190
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,920
Cosine of 1.

191
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,570
Over 2, right?

192
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,420
2 factorial is just 2.

193
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:42,030
Times x minus 1 squared,
oh, sorry, this should

194
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,500
be a one, right?

195
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,480
I said, c is equal to 1.

196
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,040
Times x minus 1 squared.

197
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,220
Let's keep going.

198
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,540
Plus the third derivative,
plus, what's the third

199
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,590
derivative of cosine?

200
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,160
Well, it's the derivative
of minus cosine, so

201
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,820
that's plus sign.

202
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:04,380
So plus sine evaluated at 1.

203
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,790
Sine of 1.

204
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:12,656
Divided by 3 factorial,
so that's 6 over 6 times

205
00:10:12,656 --> 00:10:16,850
x minus 3 to third.

206
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:22,330
Sorry, my brain is really,
I ate too many walnuts.

207
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:27,500
Undo, edit, undo. x minus
1 to the third, right?

208
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,540
And then, let's do one
more term, just for fun.

209
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,740
So then we're going to take the
fourth derivative, which is the

210
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,260
derivative of the third
derivative, so the third

211
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,057
derivative was positive sine,
so now we're going

212
00:10:39,057 --> 00:10:41,910
to be plus cosine.

213
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:47,160
Plus cosine evaluated at
1 over 4 factorial--

214
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,790
what's 4 factorial?

215
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,180
It's 3 factorial times 4.

216
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,590
So over 24.

217
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,290
Times x minus 1 to the fourth.

218
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,240
And we could just keep going.

219
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,590
The fifth derivative over 5
evaluated at 1, over 5

220
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,450
factorial times x minus 1 to
the fifth, and just keep

221
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,800
adding, but then it will
take us forever, et

222
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,380
cetera, et cetera.

223
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,660
So, what does this
thing look like?

224
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,730
And what I'm going to do, is
I'm going to show you how

225
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:13,710
this polynomial develops
as we add terms.

226
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,540
So let's see.

227
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:19,510
I have this graphing calculator
that I-- so this thing I

228
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:25,960
got from, just to give them
credit, it's my.hrw.com.

229
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,930
And this is the graph
of cosine of x.

230
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:31,030
So just the first term here.

231
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,120
Cosine of 1.

232
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,780
If we were to just to graph the
first term of this polynomial,

233
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,810
what does it look like?

234
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:43,510
So I'll just type in cosine
of 1, and graph it.

235
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,110
So there you go.

236
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,590
Just the first term
of the polynomial.

237
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:49,110
If all of these terms weren't
here, the polynomial would

238
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,030
just be a constant, right?

239
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,800
Cosine of one.

240
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,510
And it's a pretty bad
approximation, but at least

241
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,240
it equals the function
at this point.

242
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,490
So it gives a something.

243
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,690
But let's add some terms.

244
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,290
Let's add the
second term to it.

245
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,980
So what was the second term?

246
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:08,390
It was sine of 1 minus sine
of 1 times x minus 1.

247
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,210
Let me add that.

248
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:23,650
   

249
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,840
Graph it.

250
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,960
There you go.

251
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,790
So this is neat.

252
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,060
So when you just added 2
terms, what did we say?

253
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:37,330
The polynomial will be equal to
the function at x equals 1.

254
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,380
And now the slope is also
equal to the function.

255
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,160
The slope of the polynomial is
also equal to the slope of the

256
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,840
function at x is equal to 1.

257
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,190
So this is a better
approximation.

258
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:51,550
At least if we stay pretty
close to our chosen c, it's

259
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:55,490
a decent approximation
for the function.

260
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:58,620
Obviously, if we get far away,
out here, this is a horrible

261
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,840
approximation for the function.

262
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,200
But let's keep adding terms.

263
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,000
As you can see, I just want
to show you that I'm just

264
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,950
typing in the actual terms.

265
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,850
So let me type in
the next term.

266
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,830
just so you believe
that I'm doing it.

267
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,050
So the next term,
we'll have to see it.

268
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,050
Let me type it in.

269
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:27,440
So the next term is minus
cosine of 1 divided by 2

270
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:35,420
times x minus 1 squared.

271
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,660
And let me graph it.

272
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,600
OK.

273
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,220
So now, just to show you, I
just typed in the second

274
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,980
term, and now let's
look at the graph.

275
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,970
Now this is neat, right?

276
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,720
So the first term got us a
horizontal line that just

277
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,220
intersected the point at cosine
of 1, and it was a really

278
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,190
bad approximation.

279
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,590
Then the second term made sure
that at least the first

280
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,910
derivative was the same.

281
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,760
And so then we, the line was
just essentially the tangent

282
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,210
line, we only had 2 terms.

283
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:06,320
Now the third term makes sure
that the second derivative of

284
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,980
our polynomial at x equals 1 is
equal to the second derivative

285
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,810
of the polynomial
of the function.

286
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:19,100
And notice that this
green graph is concave

287
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,390
downwards, right?

288
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:25,110
Which means that, and so
is the function at 1.

289
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,270
So this is this is pretty neat.

290
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,350
We're getting a little bit, so
it's kind of approximating

291
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,060
the curve here.

292
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,060
It's getting a
little bit better.

293
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,950
Remember when we went
out far to the left?

294
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,910
Starting to approximate the
function better around here.

295
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,310
It's closer, at least.

296
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:36,520
Right?

297
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,560
The last time, the line just
went up, and here it was a

298
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,350
really bad approximation.

299
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,080
But let's add another term.

300
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,120
Let's add our third term.

301
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,860
Our third term, I can see
it, it's right there.

302
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:56,870
So plus sine of 1 divided
by 6 times x minus 1

303
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,950
to the third power.

304
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,860
Just to show you, I just
typed it in, right there.

305
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,090
   

306
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:09,060
Let me graph it.

307
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,590
That is neat.

308
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:16,240
Just with three terms on our
polynomial, well, actually,

309
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,860
that's the fourth
term, officially.

310
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,040
But the first term was
essentially-- well,

311
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,280
you get the point.

312
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,270
But we're already starting
to approximate this

313
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,960
pretty well, right?

314
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:33,320
Now the third derivative of the
polynomial is equal to the

315
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,330
third derivative of the
function at the point x is

316
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,530
equal to 1, and we haven't even
studied third derivatives.

317
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,770
That's kind of like the
concativity of the

318
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,490
derivative, or whatever.

319
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,990
But as we can see,
it approximates the

320
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:45,970
function even better.

321
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,290
Obviously, though, when we
go further away, it starts

322
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,000
to break down again.

323
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,600
But pretty close.

324
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,150
If all you saw is from
here to here, it would be

325
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,880
hard to tell them apart.

326
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,180
Let's add that last
term we calculated.

327
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,780
And this should be pretty neat.

328
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,520
Let's see.

329
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,650
The last term.

330
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:07,730
Plus cosine sign of
1 divided by 24.

331
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:11,870
And notice, every term, the
scaling factor, right?

332
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,830
Here's 1, then 1/2, then
1/6, 1/24-- it becomes

333
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,160
a smaller impact on it.

334
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,220
And it only starts to matter as
you move really, really far

335
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,090
away from your chosen c.

336
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,450
In this case 1, right.

337
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,130
The further out you go,
when you're close to your

338
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,720
point that you've picked.

339
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,040
these other terms don't
matter much, right?

340
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,460
Because you're doing 1/24,
and then 1 over 5 factorial,

341
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,090
et cetera et cetera.

342
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:37,400
But as you get further and
further away, these terms

343
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,400
become more significant, right?

344
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,790
As x gets further and further
away from 1, and then that's

345
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,400
where these start to play in,
and you see that in

346
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,710
the approximation.

347
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,330
Anyway, let me graph it.

348
00:16:48,330 --> 00:17:00,450
So cosine of 1 divided by 24
times x minus 1 to the fourth.

349
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,400
Let me graph it.

350
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,240
   

351
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,220
Even neater!

352
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,470
And if you have some spare
time, you might just want to

353
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,050
keep adding terms to this.

354
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:12,110
So that's all the
Taylor polynomial is.

355
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,440
And I realize, this is
probably one of longest

356
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,370
videos I've done.

357
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,790
I'm pushing 17 minutes.

358
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,870
It's a little confusing at
first, because it gives you

359
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,730
this huge formula, and they
give you the c, and you're

360
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,710
like, what is that c, and how
do I take the derivative?

361
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,600
But when you actually try to
chug through it, you just

362
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,770
have to realize, oh.

363
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:30,760
All this is, is saying, we are
constructing a polynomial that,

364
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,450
at some point c that we've
picked, this polynomial's

365
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,740
zeroth, first, second, third,
fourth, fifth, and so on-th

366
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,040
derivative is going to be
equal to our function.

367
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,586
And actually, if we did 10
terms, or if we did all of the

368
00:17:45,586 --> 00:17:48,170
derivatives, these would start
to actually equal each other.

369
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,730
So hopefully that
didn't confuse you.

370
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:53,980
I know when you see the formula
at first, it can be kind of

371
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,770
daunting, and especially,
sometimes it's even more

372
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:59,600
daunting when someone
even explains it to you.

373
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,420
But hopefully that gave
you some intuition.

374
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,640
If it didn't,
ignore this video.

375
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,142
See you soon.
