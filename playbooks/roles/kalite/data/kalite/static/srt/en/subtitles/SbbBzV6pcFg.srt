1
00:00:07,773 --> 00:00:09,106
This is a quadrotor

2
00:00:09,106 --> 00:00:12,553
It's called a quadrotor because it has four propellers that spin & generate thrust

3
00:00:12,553 --> 00:00:17,105
This is the pilot controlling a vehicle with a radio transmitter

4
00:00:17,105 --> 00:00:20,553
That's pretty neat.But if we take a short trip across the street

5
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:27,113
Of course looking both ways before we cross

6
00:00:27,113 --> 00:00:30,022
We come to this place for this quadrotor can fly by itself

7
00:00:30,022 --> 00:00:32,604
without any human help at all

8
00:00:32,604 --> 00:00:35,207
We don't even need a pilot

9
00:00:35,207 --> 00:00:38,058
This flying robot can operate with extreme precision

10
00:00:38,058 --> 00:00:39,922
in tight indoor spaces

11
00:00:39,922 --> 00:00:42,089
It can do some other pretty neat stuff as well

12
00:00:42,089 --> 00:00:43,871
So if you're wondering how to make robots fly

13
00:00:43,871 --> 00:00:45,474
You've come to the right place

14
00:00:45,474 --> 00:00:47,522
Indoor Flying Robots!

15
00:00:47,522 --> 00:00:48,722
A crash course

16
00:00:48,722 --> 00:00:52,456
Maybe crash course isn't the right term

17
00:00:52,456 --> 00:00:54,571
Indoor Flying Robots!

18
00:00:54,571 --> 00:01:02,538
An expedited learning experience

19
00:01:02,538 --> 00:01:04,570
To figure how to make robots fly

20
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:06,855
we'll need to understand the basic physics of quadrotors

21
00:01:06,855 --> 00:01:08,889
How humans pilot them

22
00:01:08,889 --> 00:01:10,904
How we can use a computer to achieve the same task

23
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,038
And why the resulting flying robots can do more complex things

24
00:01:14,038 --> 00:01:16,871
First let's take a quick look at the physics behind

25
00:01:16,871 --> 00:01:19,071
how the quadrotor flies

26
00:01:19,071 --> 00:01:21,370
When the propellers spin they push downward on the air around

27
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,871
Newton's third law tells us that the air applies in an equal & opposite

28
00:01:24,871 --> 00:01:27,004
reaction force on the propeller.When this lifting force

29
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:29,856
equals that of gravity the quadrotor achieves hoverflight

30
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,471
In order to bank one propeller spins slightly faster

31
00:01:32,471 --> 00:01:34,671
than the opposite one

32
00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:36,638
This introduces a horizontal force in addition to the one opposing gravity

33
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,204
And the vehicle moves sideways

34
00:01:38,204 --> 00:01:40,139
That's great, but it didn't tell us how the quadrotor

35
00:01:40,139 --> 00:01:41,504
can rotate about it's vertical axis

36
00:01:41,504 --> 00:01:45,154
It turns out that newton's third law also applies to rotational force

37
00:01:45,154 --> 00:01:46,439
called 'Torque'

38
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,116
When this two propellers spin they apply a torque to the air

39
00:01:49,793 --> 00:01:51,524
in the clockwise direction, the air applies in equal and opposite reaction torque

40
00:01:53,255 --> 00:01:54,988
pushing the vehicle in a counterclockwise direction meanwhile the other two

41
00:01:54,988 --> 00:01:57,505
motors spin in the other direction plus the reaction torque

42
00:01:57,505 --> 00:01:59,273
pushes the vehicle clockwise

43
00:01:59,273 --> 00:02:01,622
When all four motors are turned on the rotational force

44
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:04,004
remember they are called 'Torque' s -balance each other

45
00:02:04,004 --> 00:02:06,588
In flight the vehicle turns by spinning two motors even so

46
00:02:06,588 --> 00:02:08,721
slightly faster than the other two

47
00:02:08,721 --> 00:02:12,404
That went on the basic physics of how quadrotor flies

48
00:02:12,404 --> 00:02:14,904
But before we can fly it robotically we need to know

49
00:02:14,904 --> 00:02:18,639
how to control it. First let's figure out how a human would do that

50
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,492
The task can be broken down into four keysteps

51
00:02:21,492 --> 00:02:23,889
First, the pilot uses his eyes to observe the vehicle

52
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:26,704
and figure out where it is and in which direction it's pointing

53
00:02:26,704 --> 00:02:29,554
In this example let's say the pilot sees that the quadrotor is sinking

54
00:02:29,554 --> 00:02:32,738
Next, the pilot has to decide what control commands to give the vehicle

55
00:02:32,738 --> 00:02:35,804
In this case, the pilot has to stop the vehicle from sinking

56
00:02:35,804 --> 00:02:38,356
And thus decides to increase the speed of all four propellers

57
00:02:38,356 --> 00:02:41,286
To tell the quadrotor what is decided on the pilot uses a radio transmitter

58
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:44,588
which is basically a fancy remote control

59
00:02:44,588 --> 00:02:46,621
Finally the quadrotor listens for the radio commands

60
00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:48,972
and adjust the speed of each motor accordingly.

61
00:02:48,972 --> 00:02:52,304
Now let's see how each of these forces have to change in order to

62
00:02:52,304 --> 00:02:54,371
fly the quadrotor robotically

63
00:02:54,371 --> 00:02:56,588
In the first step, we use specialized cameras for vision

64
00:02:56,588 --> 00:02:59,037
and set up the pilot's eyes. The camera shine infrared light

65
00:02:59,037 --> 00:03:02,639
which bounces off of more reflective markers on the vehicle

66
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,204
and go back to the camera

67
00:03:04,204 --> 00:03:06,940
A camera from the side point of view can tell how far the marker is

68
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,203
in the vertical direction and one horizontal direction

69
00:03:10,203 --> 00:03:13,407
And a camera from the top point of view can tell how far the marker is in both

70
00:03:13,407 --> 00:03:16,172
horizontal directions. Using some slightly more complicated mathematcs

71
00:03:16,172 --> 00:03:19,171
we can use the points of view from 12 different cameras

72
00:03:19,171 --> 00:03:23,306
To determine the exact three dimensional position of the markers

73
00:03:23,306 --> 00:03:26,739
This process is executed many times for second to track the position

74
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,192
of the markers and pass the quadrotor in real time

75
00:03:29,192 --> 00:03:31,888
In step two, we use a computer to handle the control commands

76
00:03:31,888 --> 00:03:35,203
in stead of the pilots brain. The computer program consists of a

77
00:03:35,203 --> 00:03:37,671
couple hundred lines of C++ code written by grad students

78
00:03:37,671 --> 00:03:40,522
who really don't get out much. It does essentially the same thing

79
00:03:40,522 --> 00:03:43,554
as the pilot using the observed position of the quadrotor to evaluate

80
00:03:43,554 --> 00:03:47,054
control commands. Only it does so in a much faster and less dramatic fshion

81
00:03:47,054 --> 00:03:58,504
In step three, the system uses a similar radio transmitter except a smaller one

82
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:01,104
without any switches or control sticks.

83
00:04:01,104 --> 00:04:03,903
Step four is exactly as the same as before. The quadrotor listens for

84
00:04:03,903 --> 00:04:06,872
radio commands and adjust the speed of each motor accordingly.

85
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:10,170
So we've updated all four steps in order to make the quadrotor

86
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:13,420
fly entirely by itself. Now all we need is for our grad students

87
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:18,104
to press the go button and voila. One of the reasons the robot

88
00:04:18,104 --> 00:04:22,086
fly more precisely than the human pilot is because this loop of information

89
00:04:22,086 --> 00:04:25,593
called a 'Feedback Control Loop' can be executed much more quickly by computers

90
00:04:25,593 --> 00:04:29,253
In this case 200 times per second. This allows the researchers

91
00:04:29,253 --> 00:04:33,177
to do cool things with these indoor flying robots. For instance,

92
00:04:33,177 --> 00:04:36,927
fly six of them at once but why not ten

93
00:04:36,927 --> 00:04:39,644
They can teach the vehicles how to switch out their old batteries

94
00:04:39,644 --> 00:04:43,794
for new ones automically or stop propeller for swing

95
00:04:43,794 --> 00:04:54,962
They can even do flips like this one or this one or this one

96
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:57,379
And the fun doesn't stop with quadrotors. The same technology

97
00:04:57,379 --> 00:05:01,110
can be applied to rig the shape into three wing aircraft. One more

98
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:12,982
conventional fixed wing vehicles like this one, this one and this one

99
00:05:12,982 --> 00:05:16,314
that can even fly in loops. Well hopefully you've learn the basics of how to make

100
00:05:16,314 --> 00:05:25,978
robots fly. This concludes the crash course--I, I mean the expedited learning experience
