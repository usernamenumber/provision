1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,460
   

2
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,410
In the last several videos,
we did some fairly hairy

3
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:04,120
mathematics.

4
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,660
And you might have even
skipped them.

5
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,290
But we got to a pretty
neat result.

6
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,970
We got to a formula for the
slope and y-intercept of the

7
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,390
best fitting regression line
when you measure the error by

8
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,150
the squared distance
to that line.

9
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,180
And our formula is, and I'll
just rewrite it here just so

10
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,090
we have something
neat to look at.

11
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,800
So the slope of that line is
going to be the mean of x's

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,700
times the mean of the y's minus
the mean of the xy's.

13
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,870
And don't worry, this seems
really confusing, we're going

14
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,520
to do an example of this
actually in a few seconds.

15
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:40,470
Divided by the mean of x squared
minus the mean of the

16
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,460
x squareds.

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,410
And if this looks a little
different than what you see in

18
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,900
your statistics class or your
textbook, you might see this

19
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:46,850
swapped around.

20
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,130
If you multiply both the
numerator and denominator by

21
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:52,610
negative 1, you could see this
written as the mean of the

22
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:56,980
xy's minus the mean of x times
the mean of the y's.

23
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,930
All of that over the mean of the
x squareds minus the mean

24
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,690
of the x's squared.

25
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,209
These are obviously
the same thing.

26
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:07,620
You're just multiplying the
numerator and denominator by

27
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,810
negative 1, which is same thing
as multiplying the whole

28
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:10,720
thing by 1.

29
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,610
And of course, whatever you get
for m, you can then just

30
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,310
substitute back in this
to get your b.

31
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,640
Your b is going to be equal
to the mean of the

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,350
y's minus your m.

33
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,170
Let me write that in yellow
so it's very clear.

34
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,770
You solved for the m value.

35
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,690
Minus m times the
mean of the x's.

36
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:37,100
   

37
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,440
And this is all you need.

38
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,390
So let's actually put
that into practice.

39
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,740
So let's say I have three
points, and I'm going to make

40
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,680
sure that these points
aren't colinear.

41
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,590
Because, otherwise, it wouldn't
be interesting.

42
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,820
So let me draw three
points over here.

43
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:01,140
Let's say that to one point
is the point 1 comma 2.

44
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,500
So this 1, 2.

45
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,500
   

46
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:18,305
And then we also have
the point 2 comma 1.

47
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:22,660
   

48
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:30,730
And then, let's say we also
have the point, let's do

49
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:38,650
something a little bit
crazy, 4 comma 3.

50
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:45,740
   

51
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,750
So this is 4, 3.

52
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,970
So those are our three points.

53
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:54,190
And what we want to do is find
it the best fitting regression

54
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,380
line, which we suspect
is going to look

55
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:01,020
something like that.

56
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,790
We'll see what it actually looks
like using our formulas,

57
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,180
which we have proven.

58
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,000
So a good place to start is just
to calculate these things

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,370
ahead of time, and then
to substitute

60
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,420
them back in the equation.

61
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,970
So what's the mean of our x's?

62
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:23,940
The mean of our x's is going
to be 1 plus 2 plus

63
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:31,900
4 divided by 3.

64
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,140
And what's this going to be?

65
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,310
1 plus 2 is 3, plus 4
is 7 divided by 3.

66
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:40,800
It is equal to 7/3.

67
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,530
Now, what is the mean
of our y's?

68
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:58,405
The mean of our y's is equal
to 2 plus 1 plus 3.

69
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,030
   

70
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,420
All of that over 3.

71
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,920
So this is 2 plus 1 is 3.

72
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,890
Plus 3 is 6.

73
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:10,490
Divided by 3 is equal to 2.

74
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,400
This is 6 divided by
3 is equal to 2.

75
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:21,260
Now, what is the mean
of our xy's?

76
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:26,685
   

77
00:04:26,685 --> 00:04:31,750
So our first xy over
here is 1 times 2.

78
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:38,210
Plus 2 times 1 plus 4 times 3.

79
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,140
   

80
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,180
And we have three
of these xy's.

81
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,430
So divided by 3.

82
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,200
So what's this going
to be equal to?

83
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,430
We have 2 plus 2, which is 4.

84
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,700
4 plus 12, which is 16.

85
00:04:54,700 --> 00:05:01,420
So it's going to be 16/3.

86
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:06,230
And then the last one we have
to calculate is the mean of

87
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,170
the x squareds.

88
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,530
So what's the mean of
the x squareds?

89
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,640
The first x squared is just
going to be 1 squared.

90
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,830
   

91
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:21,073
Plus this 2 squared, plus
this 4 squared.

92
00:05:21,073 --> 00:05:24,090
   

93
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,152
And we have three data
points again.

94
00:05:27,152 --> 00:05:31,550
So this is 1 plus
4, which is 5.

95
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,570
Plus 16.

96
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:39,440
Is equal to 21/3, which
is equal to 7.

97
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,540
So that worked out to a
pretty neat number.

98
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,650
So let's actually find
our m's and our b's.

99
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:49,150
So our slope, our optimal slope
for our regression line,

100
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,590
the mean of the x's is
going to be 7/3.

101
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,820
   

102
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,890
Times the mean of the y's.

103
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,360
The mean of the y's is 2.

104
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,450
Minus the mean of the xy's.

105
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:05,120
Well, that's 16/3.

106
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,440
And then, all of that over
the mean of the x's.

107
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,730
The mean of the x's
is 7/3 squared.

108
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:16,830
   

109
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,300
Minus the mean of
the x squareds.

110
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,430
So it's going to be minus
this 7 right over here.

111
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,490
And we just have to do a little
bit of mathematics.

112
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,660
I'm tempted to get out my
calculator, but i'll resist

113
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,260
the temptation.

114
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,930
It's nice to keep things
as fractions.

115
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,570
Let's see if I can
calculate this.

116
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:40,910
This is 14/3 minus 16/3.

117
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:50,930
All of that over,
this is 49/9.

118
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,170
And then minus 7.

119
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,700
If I wanted to express that as
something over 9, that's the

120
00:06:54,700 --> 00:07:01,080
same thing as 63/9.

121
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,230
So in our numerator, we
get negative 2/3.

122
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:10,270
And then in our denominator,
what's 49 minus 63?

123
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:16,690
That's negative 14/9.

124
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,320
And this is the same thing
as negative 2/3

125
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,300
times negative 9/ 14.

126
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,250
Divide numerator and
denominator by 3.

127
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,710
Well, the negatives are going
to cancel out first of all.

128
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:29,590
You divide by 3.

129
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,590
That becomes a 1.

130
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,710
That becomes a 3.

131
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,100
Divide by 2.

132
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,150
Becomes a 1.

133
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,560
That becomes a 7.

134
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,360
So our slope is 3/7.

135
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,790
Not too bad.

136
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:42,380
Now, we can go back and figure
out our y-intercept.

137
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,560
So let's figure out our
y-intercept using

138
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,110
this right over here.

139
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,700
So our y-intercept, b, is going
to be equal to the mean

140
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,760
of the y's, the mean of the
y's is 2, minus our slope.

141
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,380
We just figured out our
slope to be 3/7.

142
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,620
   

143
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,410
Times the mean of the
x's, which is 7/3.

144
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:05,520
   

145
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,140
These just are the reciprocal
of each other,

146
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,040
so they cancel out.

147
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,350
That just becomes 1.

148
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:12,060
So our y-intercept is literally
just 2 minus 1.

149
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,710
So it equals 1.

150
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,520
So we have the equation
for our line.

151
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,690
Our regression line is going
to be y is equal to-- We

152
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,160
figured out m.

153
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,530
m is 3/7.

154
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:31,640
y is equal to 3/7 x plus,
our y-intercept is 1.

155
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,130
And we are done.

156
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,400
So let's actually try
to graph this.

157
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,240
So our y-intercept
is going to be 1.

158
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,610
It's going to be right
over there.

159
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,789
And the slope of our
line is 3/7.

160
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:47,240
So for every 7 we
run, we rise 3.

161
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,720
Or another way to think of
it, for every 3.5 we

162
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,080
run, we rise 1.5.

163
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,870
So we're going to go 1.5
right over here.

164
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,270
So this line, if you were to
graph it, and obviously I'm

165
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,850
hand drawing it, so it's not
going to be that exact, is

166
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:05,520
going to look like that
right over there.

167
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,680
And it actually won't go
directly through that line.

168
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,030
So I don't want to give
you that impression.

169
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,530
So it might look something
like this.

170
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:19,200
And this line, we have shown,
that this formula minimizes

171
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,140
the squared distances
from each of these

172
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,360
points to that line.

173
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,480
Anyway, that was, at least
in my mind, pretty neat.

174
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:26,799
