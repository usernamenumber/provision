1
00:00:01,509 --> 00:00:02,949
After the farmer and the pie chain

2
00:00:02,949 --> 00:00:06,333
get involved in this forward contract

3
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:09,172
a few questions start to pop up in each of their minds

4
00:00:09,172 --> 00:00:10,195
the main one is

5
00:00:10,195 --> 00:00:15,388
what if the other party isnt able to uphold their end of the contract

6
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:18,553
and this is called counter party risk

7
00:00:18,553 --> 00:00:21,060
COUNTER PARTY RISK

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,729
which is essentially the counterparty to the farmer is the pie store

9
00:00:24,729 --> 00:00:27,841
and the counter party to the pie chain is the farmer

10
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:30,720
and the risk that the other party wont be able to uphold

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,856
their end of the contract

12
00:00:32,856 --> 00:00:35,271
The other thing that starts to worry either one of these is

13
00:00:35,271 --> 00:00:37,314
what if they have second thoughts

14
00:00:37,314 --> 00:00:37,814
about this forward contract they entered into

15
00:00:37,814 --> 00:00:43,398
will they be able to may be sell their obligation to some one else?

16
00:00:43,398 --> 00:00:46,742
So is their anyway to trade the contract?

17
00:00:46,742 --> 00:00:51,061
and then there is another issue

18
00:00:51,061 --> 00:00:54,311
that even if you were to trade the contract, How will you know

19
00:00:54,311 --> 00:00:57,400
that the other party whoever you want to trade with,

20
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,720
will be cool with a million pounds for 200,000 dollars

21
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,739
may be they want to deal with a smaller quantity

22
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:05,736
may be they would want only a thousand pounds or

23
00:01:05,736 --> 00:01:08,058
hundered thousand dollars worth of apple

24
00:01:08,058 --> 00:01:11,800
So the Local... The local brain comes up

25
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,305
with an idea

26
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:16,370
he is like... Why dont we standardise these forward contracts?

27
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,133
Why dont I just create a bunch of contracts,

28
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:22,733
whenever someone wants to enter to one of these forward contracts

29
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:25,240
but I standardize them and I say there is a thousand

30
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,333
instead of having a million apples, I do a small enough increment

31
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:34,668
so I say, thousand pounds of apples for delivery

32
00:01:34,668 --> 00:01:42,800
for delivery on lets say November... On November 15th

33
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,046
and everyone of these contracts say the samething, a thousand pounds

34
00:01:46,046 --> 00:01:48,533
of apples for delivery on 11/15

35
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:51,133
and this guy, he is also the richest guy in the town,

36
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:53,708
he is already been running a stock exchange,

37
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:58,239
and so to, to help alleviate counter party risk fear,

38
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:00,349
he also says that I am going to guarantee,

39
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:06,386
i will guarantee any of these contracts

40
00:02:06,386 --> 00:02:10,380
so essentially he is taking on all of the counter party risks

41
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,631
to make people more comfortable with trading

42
00:02:13,631 --> 00:02:15,256
so all of a sudden, what happens is, is that

43
00:02:15,256 --> 00:02:18,739
now these guys dont have to do a one off contract

44
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:21,711
they dont have to do this one off forward contract,

45
00:02:21,711 --> 00:02:26,077
there are these standardized contracts, that this exchange can trade

46
00:02:26,077 --> 00:02:29,513
and what happens is, is that smaller farmers,

47
00:02:29,513 --> 00:02:31,185
so small... We ll do this in a different colour

48
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:36,108
You have farmers, Farmer A, Farmer B

49
00:02:36,108 --> 00:02:39,637
Farmer B... Can now... Can now transact with...

50
00:02:39,637 --> 00:02:44,536
Um i should say i guess we can call it Customer ... Customer...

51
00:02:44,536 --> 00:02:49,436
C and Customer... Customer D

52
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:51,572
where they could agree to have a fixed price

53
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:53,569
where they could do smaller increments, more granular increments

54
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:57,800
and if any of them wants to get out of it, they can by selling their

55
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,721
contract to another person on the exchange.

56
00:03:00,721 --> 00:03:04,575
And these more standardized forward contracts, there is still essentially

57
00:03:04,575 --> 00:03:07,333
the same thing... they are just standardized... The agreements to transact

58
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:10,241
at a future date

59
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:14,003
Give a certain amount of money, for certain amount of something else

60
00:03:14,003 --> 00:03:16,650
It could be a security, it could be apples

61
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,668
these things, these standardised forward contracts,

62
00:03:19,668 --> 00:03:24,034
these are called futures,

63
00:03:24,034 --> 99:59:59,999
where they are standardized and they are traded on in exchange
