1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
   

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,880
In this video, I want to prove
some of the basic properties

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,370
of the dot product, and you
might find what I'm doing in

4
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,400
this video somewhat mundane.

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,330
You know, to be frank, it
is somewhat mundane.

6
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,510
But I'm doing it for
two reasons.

7
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,570
One is, this is the type of
thing that's often asked of

8
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,670
you when you take a linear
algebra class.

9
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,530
But more importantly, it gives
you the appreciation that we

10
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:24,810
really are kind of building up
a mathematics of vectors from

11
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,250
the ground up, and you really
can't assume anything.

12
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,780
You ready to prove everything
for yourself.

13
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,520
So the first thing I want to
prove is that the dot product,

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,930
when you take the vector dot
product, so if I take v dot w

15
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,000
that it's commutative.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,350
That the order that I take the
dot product doesn't matter.

17
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:48,140
I want to prove to myself that
that is equal to w dot v.

18
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,300
And so, how do we do that?

19
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,580
Well, and this is the general
pattern for a lot of these

20
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,320
vector proofs.

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,710
Let's just write out
the vectors.

22
00:00:54,710 --> 00:01:01,460
So v will look like v1, v2,
all the way down to vn.

23
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,330
Let's say that this
is equal to v.

24
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:11,350
And let's say that w is
equal to w1, w2, all

25
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,990
the way down to wn.

26
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,590
So what does v dot w equal?

27
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:22,840
v dot to w is equal to--
I'll switch colors

28
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,210
here-- v1 times w1.

29
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,720
   

30
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:37,600
Plus v2 w2 plus all
the way to vn wn.

31
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,730
Fair enough.

32
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:45,190
Now what does w dot v equal?

33
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,880
Well w dot v-- you know, when I
had made the definition, you

34
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,300
just multiply the products.

35
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,930
But I'll just do it in the order
that they gave it to us.

36
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:58,340
So it equals w1 v1 plus w2 v2.

37
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,430
Plus all the way to wn vn.

38
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,970
Now, these are clearly equal to
each other because if you

39
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,729
just match up the first term
with the first term, those are

40
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:14,510
clearly equal to each other.
v1 w1 is equal to w1 v1.

41
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,810
And I can say this now because
now we're just dealing with

42
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:17,530
regular numbers.

43
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,470
Here we were dealing with
vectors and we were taking

44
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,030
this weird type of
multiplication

45
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,300
called the dot product.

46
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,360
But now I can definitely say
that these are equal because

47
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,310
this is just regular
multiplication.

48
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,925
And this is just a commutative
property.

49
00:02:28,925 --> 00:02:31,500
   

50
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,600
Let me see if I'm spelling
commutative.

51
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,460
   

52
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,040
We learned this in-- I don't
know when you learned this, in

53
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,950
second or third grade.

54
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,890
So you know that those are equal
and by the same argument

55
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,360
you know that these
two are equal.

56
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,200
You could just rewrite each of
these terms just by switching

57
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:47,810
that around.

58
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,160
That's just from basic
multiplication of scalar

59
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,250
numbers, of just regular
real numbers.

60
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,810
So that's what tells us that
these two things are equal or

61
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,230
these two things are equal.

62
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,330
So we've proven to ourselves
that order doesn't matter when

63
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,100
you take the dot product.

64
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,020
Now the next thing we could take
a look at is whether the

65
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,520
dot product exhibits the
distributive property.

66
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,850
So let me just define another
vector x here.

67
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,000
Another vector x and you
can imagine how I'm

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,200
going to define it.

69
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,770
x1, x2, all the way
down to xn.

70
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:28,580
Now, what I want to see if the
dot product deals with the

71
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:32,200
distributive property the way I
would expect it to, then if

72
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:39,320
I were to add v plus w and
then multiply that by x.

73
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,030
And first of all, it shouldn't
matter what

74
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,970
order I do that with.

75
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:42,590
I just showed it here.

76
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,080
I could do x dot this thing.

77
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,380
It shouldn't matter because
I just showed you it's

78
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,420
commutative.

79
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,370
But if the distribution works,
then this should be the same

80
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:56,230
thing as v dot x plus w dot x.

81
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,290
If these were just numbers
and this was just regular

82
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,306
multiplication, you would
multiply by it by each of the

83
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,280
terms, and that's what
I'm showing here.

84
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,670
So let's see if this is true
for the dot product.

85
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:12,300
So what is v plus w?

86
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:20,480
v plus w is equal to-- we just
add up each of their

87
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:26,730
corresponding terms. v1 plus
w1, v2 plus w2, all the way

88
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,460
down to vn plus wn.

89
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,670
That's that right there.

90
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:39,340
And then when we dot that with
x1, x2, all the way down to

91
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,900
xn, what do we get?

92
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:54,330
Well we get v1 plus w1 times
x1 plus v2 plus w2 times x2

93
00:04:54,330 --> 00:05:01,080
plus all the way to vn
plus wn times xn.

94
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,400
I just took the dot product
of these two.

95
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,380
I just multiplied corresponding
components and

96
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,430
then added them all up.

97
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,670
That was the dot product.

98
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:10,270
This is v plus w dot x.

99
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,360
Let me write that down.

100
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,330
This is v plus w dot x.

101
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:21,220
Now, let's work on these
things up here.

102
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,140
Let me write it over here.

103
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,600
What is v dot x?

104
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,670
v dot x, we've seen
this before.

105
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:32,110
This is just v1 x1.

106
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,390
No vectors now.

107
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,650
These are just actual
components.

108
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:39,820
Plus v2 x2, all the
way to vn xn.

109
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,950
What is w dot x?

110
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:52,100
w dot x is equal to w1 x1 plus
w2 x2, all the way to wn xn.

111
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,550
Now what do you get when you
add these two things?

112
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,840
And notice, here I'm adding
two scalar quantities.

113
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,350
That's a scalar.

114
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:58,900
That's a scalar.

115
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,250
We're not doing vector
addition anymore.

116
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,340
So this is a scalar quantity and
this is a scalar quantity.

117
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,820
So what do I get when
I add them?

118
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:18,640
So v dot x plus w dot x is equal
to v1 x1 plus w1 x1 plus

119
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:28,940
v2 x2 plus w2 x2, all the
way to vn xn plus wn xn.

120
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,360
I know, it's very monotonous.

121
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,870
But you could immediately see
we're just dealing with

122
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,850
regular numbers here.

123
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,575
So we can take the x's out
and what do you get?

124
00:06:36,575 --> 00:06:38,600
Let me write it here.

125
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,390
This is equal to-- we could
just take the x out,

126
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,850
factor the x out.

127
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:49,710
v1 plus w1, x1 plus v2 plus
w2 x2, all the way

128
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:54,130
to vn plus wn xn.

129
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:59,340
Which we see this is
the same thing as

130
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,000
this thing right here.

131
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,460
So we just showed that this
expression right here, is the

132
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,380
same thing as that expression
or the distribution-- the

133
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:13,010
distributive property seems to
or does apply the way we would

134
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,470
expect to the dot product.

135
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,880
I know this is so mundane.

136
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,270
Why are we doing this?

137
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,260
But I'm doing this to show you
that we're building things up.

138
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,540
We couldn't just assume this.

139
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,200
But the proof is pretty
straightforward.

140
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,460
And in general, I didn't do
these proofs when I did it for

141
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,940
vector addition and scalar
multiplication, and I really

142
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,070
should have. But you can prove
the commutativity of it.

143
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,740
Or for the scalar multiplication
you could prove

144
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,600
that distribution works for it
doing a proof exactly the same

145
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,100
way as this.

146
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,030
A lot of math books or linear
algebra books just leave these

147
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:43,860
as exercises to the student
because it's mundane, so they

148
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,160
didn't think it was
worth their paper.

149
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,190
But let me just show you, I
guess, the last property,

150
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:52,300
associativity, the associative
property.

151
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,430
So let me show you.

152
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:56,570
If I take some scalar and
I multiply it times

153
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,710
v, some vector v.

154
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:02,640
And then I take the dot product
of that with w, if

155
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,560
this is associative the way
multiplication in our everyday

156
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,100
world normally works, this
should be equal to-- and it's

157
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,020
still a question mark because
I haven't proven it to you.

158
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:18,010
It should be equal to
c times v dot w.

159
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:18,820
So let's figure it out.

160
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,780
What's c times the vector v?

161
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:27,730
c times the vector v is c times
v1, c times v2, all the

162
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:30,560
way down to c times vn.

163
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,460
And then the vector w, we
already know what that is.

164
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:37,440
So dot w is equal to what?

165
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,870
It's equal to this times
the first term of w.

166
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:49,580
So c v1 w1 plus this times the
second term of w, c v2 w2, all

167
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,970
the way to c vn wn.

168
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:53,590
Fair enough.

169
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,450
That's what this side
is equal to.

170
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,060
Now let's do this side.

171
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,970
What is v dot w?

172
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,440
I'll write it here.

173
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,880
We've done this multiple
times.

174
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:10,780
This is just v1 w1 plus v2
w2, all the way to vn wn.

175
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,110
I'm getting tired of doing this
and you're probably tired

176
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,920
of watching it, but it's good
to go through the exercises.

177
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,500
You know, if someone asked you
to do this now, you'll be able

178
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,380
to do this.

179
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:21,210
Now what is c times this?

180
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:26,120
So if I multiply some scalar
times this, that's the same

181
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,460
thing as multiplying some
scalar times that.

182
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,650
So I'm just multiplying a scalar
times a big-- this is

183
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:33,890
just the regular distributive
property of just numbers, of

184
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,320
just regular real numbers.

185
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:41,510
So this is going to be equal to
c v1 w1 plus c v2 w2 plus

186
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,760
all the way to c vn wn.

187
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,480
And we see that this is
equal to this because

188
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,040
this is equal to this.

189
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,200
Now the hardest part of this--
I remember when I first took

190
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,300
linear algebra, I found when
the professor would assign,

191
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,740
you know, prove this.

192
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,110
I would have trouble doing it
because it almost seems so

193
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,830
ridiculously obvious.

194
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,460
That hey, well, obviously
if you just look at the

195
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,690
components of them, it just
turns into multiplying of each

196
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,700
individual component and adding
them up and those are

197
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,320
associative, so that's
obviously--

198
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,500
what's there to prove?

199
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,360
And it only took me a little
while that they just wanted me

200
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,920
to write that down.

201
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,900
They didn't want something
earth shattering.

202
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,400
They just wanted me to show
when you go component by

203
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,610
component and all you have to
do is assume kind of the

204
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,840
distributive or the associative
or the commutative

205
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,800
property of regular numbers,
that you could prove the same

206
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,770
properties also apply in a very
similar way, to vectors

207
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:34,880
and the dot product.

208
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,480
So hopefully you found this
reasonably useful and I'll see

209
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,260
you in the next video where we
could use some of these tools

210
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,050
to actually prove some
more interesting

211
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,010
properties of vectors.

212
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:44,999
