99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Simplify 3 times the principal root of 500x to the 3rd power. So what we're gonna do here is to try and

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
break up the stuff we have under the radical sign into some things that are perfect squares, then we

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
can separately take the square roots of those things and leave the left-overs inside of the radical

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
sign. The other thing we have to remember is the principal square root, this radical sign here really

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
means the positive square root of a number. So let's think about this a little bit. So let's see if we

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
can break down the 500 x to the third into some perfect squares and some things that maybe aren't perfect

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
squares, because 500 is not a perfect square, x to the third is not a perfect square, right from the

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
get-go. So, when in doubt, we can just start to prime factorize this and maybe we'll discover some perfect

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
squares. So 500 is divisible by 5 and its 5 times 100, and you probably already recognize that 100 is

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a perfect square. It is 10 times 10. But if you didn't know that, you could just keep factoring. You

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
could say a 100 is 2 times 50 , 50 is 2 times 25 and 25 is 5 times 5. So, you'd see the perfect squares

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
here , coz you would see, you would see two 2s, you have a 2 times two and you have a 5 times a 5. So

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you could really just say that a 100 is 10 times 10 or you could say its 2 squared times 5 squared.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Either of those things would allow you to break this down. And then x to the third is, just clearly,

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the same thing as x to the third, right over here, is clearly the same thing as x squared times x, which

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
allows us to break it down into perfect squares and something that is not a perfect square. So let's

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
just rewrite these numbers under the principal root sign. So, this is going to be equal to 3 times ,

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'll save some space here, 3 times the 500, I could rewrite it as a 100 times 5 and a 100 I could write

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
as 10 squared. So this right here, I could write as 10 squared, I don't have to do all of this business

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
down here, but this will help you recognize that this is a perfect square. Its 4 times 25 , and those

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
are perfect squares. So a 100 is 10 squared, I'm gonna write this as 10 squared squared, 10 times squared
