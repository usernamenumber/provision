1
00:00:06,345 --> 00:00:07,870
Steven: We're at SF MOMA

2
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,026
and we're looking at Marcel Duchamp's

3
00:00:10,026 --> 00:00:12,271
Fountain, which he originally made in

4
00:00:12,271 --> 00:00:15,845
1917, but which he remade in 1964.

5
00:00:15,845 --> 00:00:17,637
Beth: The original is gone.

6
00:00:17,637 --> 00:00:19,604
Steven: Thrown away or who knows what.

7
00:00:19,604 --> 00:00:21,406
Beth: So this is a small series that

8
00:00:21,406 --> 00:00:24,344
was made in 1964,

9
00:00:24,344 --> 00:00:26,503
after that original work in 1917.

10
00:00:26,503 --> 00:00:29,345
And he over saw the making of this series.

11
00:00:29,345 --> 00:00:31,539
Steven: I think we need to be really careful

12
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:33,205
with the word "making."

13
00:00:33,205 --> 00:00:34,536
Beth: [laugh]

14
00:00:34,536 --> 00:00:36,405
Steven:What Duchamp did for us was go

15
00:00:36,405 --> 00:00:38,437
to a plumbing supply house called Mott's

16
00:00:38,437 --> 00:00:40,969
and purchased this and...

17
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:42,404
Beth: He didn't make it

18
00:00:42,404 --> 00:00:44,237
Steven: He made it as a work of art

19
00:00:44,237 --> 00:00:46,344
through the alchemy of the artist

20
00:00:46,344 --> 00:00:47,872
he transformed this.

21
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,504
Beth: he turned the urinal on it's side

22
00:00:49,504 --> 00:00:51,571
and signed it R. Mutt and dated it.

23
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:53,482
Steven: And submitted it to an art

24
00:00:53,482 --> 00:00:56,270
exhibition for a new group that he was a

25
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,136
founding member of

26
00:00:57,136 --> 00:00:59,205
The American Society for Independent Artists

27
00:00:59,205 --> 00:01:02,905
And their notion was that the juried exhibition

28
00:01:02,905 --> 00:01:04,605
that was prevalent in the United States

29
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:05,803
and New York at this time.

30
00:01:05,803 --> 00:01:08,345
Remeber, Duchamp had just come over from Paris

31
00:01:08,345 --> 00:01:10,905
and was in fact a real problem because

32
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:13,404
the jury always selected the traditional

33
00:01:13,404 --> 00:01:15,938
work they were associated with and

34
00:01:15,938 --> 00:01:19,471
this new group wanted to bring in new possibilities.

35
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:21,070
Beth: Right, so they were supposed to accept every

36
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,123
work that was submitted, but they

37
00:01:23,123 --> 00:01:24,558
rejected this one.

38
00:01:24,558 --> 00:01:26,910
Steven: I think he was really pushing the boundaries.

39
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,095
Beth: He submitted it as sculpture,

40
00:01:29,095 --> 00:01:31,837
which to me is even more remarkable,

41
00:01:31,837 --> 00:01:33,870
because when you think about sculpture it

42
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,334
has an even more monumental, heroic

43
00:01:36,334 --> 00:01:38,448
Steven: Grand tradition.

44
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:40,076
Beth: Tradition, then even than painting.

45
00:01:40,076 --> 00:01:42,136
To take this urinal and turn it on it's side.

46
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:44,555
Steven: Some art historians have dealt

47
00:01:44,555 --> 00:01:45,880
with this in the most absurd way

48
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,037
talking about it's formal qualities with it's shine

49
00:01:49,037 --> 00:01:50,204
Beth: Curves

50
00:01:50,204 --> 00:01:51,350
Steven: Porcelain surface.

51
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,206
But it's a urinal, although it is transformed

52
00:01:54,206 --> 00:01:56,438
And this is what Duchamp called a readymade.

53
00:01:56,438 --> 00:01:58,669
Beth: You used the word "alchemy" before

54
00:01:58,669 --> 00:02:00,177
and I think that that's an interesting word

55
00:02:00,177 --> 00:02:02,137
because one of the ways that we can think about

56
00:02:02,137 --> 00:02:06,570
art is a kind transformation of ordinary materials

57
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,011
into something really wonderful, that transports

58
00:02:10,011 --> 00:02:12,238
us, and makes us see things in a new

59
00:02:12,238 --> 00:02:14,303
way, even though he didn't make anything

60
00:02:14,303 --> 00:02:18,437
he is asking us to see the urinal in a new way

61
00:02:18,437 --> 00:02:21,014
not necessarily, as an aesthetic object

62
00:02:21,014 --> 00:02:23,811
but to make us ask those philisophical

63
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:26,269
questions about what art is

64
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:28,705
and what the artist does.

65
00:02:28,705 --> 00:02:31,845
Steven: He separates craftsmanship and

66
00:02:31,845 --> 00:02:33,938
it's relationship to the aesthetic

67
00:02:33,938 --> 00:02:36,270
enjoyment and to the profundity

68
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,762
of a work of art.

69
00:02:37,762 --> 00:02:39,371
Just throwing it out the window.

70
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:40,705
Beth: That's the philosophical question

71
00:02:40,705 --> 00:02:42,069
he wants to open up, does art

72
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:44,105
have to be made by the hand of the artist?

73
00:02:44,105 --> 00:02:45,513
Steven: Of course, he's doing it in the

74
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:47,371
most absurd way by putting a urinal

75
00:02:47,371 --> 00:02:49,095
forward and calling it Fountain.

76
00:02:49,095 --> 00:02:50,770
Beth: So, what is art?

77
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,104
Is it the idea? Is it the concept?

78
00:02:53,104 --> 00:02:55,404
Can the artist just have the idea

79
00:02:55,404 --> 00:02:56,837
and not make the object?

80
00:02:56,837 --> 00:02:58,504
Steven: Can art be pure philosophy,

81
00:02:58,504 --> 00:02:59,401
pure theory?

82
00:02:59,401 --> 00:03:03,401
Beth: Exactly.
