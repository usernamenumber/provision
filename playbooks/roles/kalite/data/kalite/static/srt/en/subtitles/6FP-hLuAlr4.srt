i got a comment on the video where we first introduced parallax - especially relative to stars - essentially

2
00:00:08,729 --> 00:00:12,733
asking how do we know that this angle and this angle are all the same, or how do we know that we are

3
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:19,754
always looking at an isosceles triangle where this side is equal to this side? it worked out for this

4
00:00:19,754 --> 00:00:27,333
example that i drew right here, but what if the star was over here, what if the star was over here?

5
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:34,533
then if you just look at it this way, if you take it at this point, the triangle is no longer (clearly)

6
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:41,067
an isosceles triangle. it looks more like a scalene triangle, i guess, where all the sides are different.

7
00:00:41,067 --> 00:00:46,467
and so a lot of that trigonometry would not apply, because we would not be able to assume that this is

8
00:00:46,467 --> 00:00:50,533
a right triangle over here. and what i want to make clear is that that is true. you would not be able

9
00:00:50,533 --> 00:00:58,467
to pick these two points during the year, these two points in our orbit, 6 months apart, in order to

10
00:00:58,467 --> 00:01:04,067
do the same math that we did in the last video. in order to calculate this and still have an isosceles

11
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:07,867
triangle, what you want to do is pick two different points, 6 months apart. so what you want to do is

12
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:14,733
this is the sun, you want to pick two different points 6 months apart, where it DOES form an isosceles

13
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:21,133
triangle. so if this is the distance from the sun to this other star right over here, you want to pick

14
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:29,400
a point in the earth's orbit around the sun here and then another point in the orbit 6 months later,

15
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:39,533
which would put us right over here. and if you do that, then we are, now all of a sudden, looking at

16
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:47,067
two right triangles, if we pick those periods correctly. and the best way to think about

17
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:52,733
whether this is a perpendicular angle is we are going to try to find the maximum parallax from the center,

18
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:54,600
in each of these time periods.

19
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,215
here it's going to be maximally shifted in one direction, and then when you go this 6 months later,

20
00:01:57,215 --> 00:02:00,562
it's going to be maximally shifted in the other direction.

21
00:02:00,562 --> 00:02:06,133
so the answer to that question, the observation is right, at exactly the middle of the summer, or the

22
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:12,800
middle of the winter, all the stars will not form an isosceles triangle with the sun and the earth. but you can

23
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,800
pick other points in time around the year, 6 months apart, where any star will form an isosceles triangle.

24
00:02:19,800 --> 99:59:59,999
hopefully you found that helpful.
