1
00:00:00,973 --> 00:00:04,983
Let's think about what fraction of this grid is shaded in pink.

2
00:00:04,983 --> 00:00:09,400
So the first thing we wanna thing about is how many equal sections do we have here.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:16,745
Well this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 by 1, 2, 3 grid. So there's 15 sections in here.

4
00:00:16,745 --> 00:00:26,340
You can also count it 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. So they are 15 equal sections here.

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:33,339
And how many of those equal sections are actually shaded in this kind of pinkish colour?

6
00:00:33,339 --> 00:00:40,559
We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So it's 6 fifteens shaded in.

7
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:47,059
But I wanna simplify this more. I have a feeling that there is an equivalent fractions that represent the exact same thing as 6/15.

8
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:55,074
And to get the sense of that. Let me redraw this a little bit where I still shade in 6 of this rectangles but I shade them little bit in one chunk.

9
00:00:55,074 --> 00:01:06,669
So let me draw it in another grid right over here. And let me attempt to shade in the rectangles as fast as possible.

10
00:01:06,669 --> 00:01:13,281
So that is 1 - one rectangle. We can make mine even bigger.

11
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:18,536
Alright, 2 rectangles.

12
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:23,742
3 rectangles. Half way there.

13
00:01:23,742 --> 00:01:28,148
4 rectangles.

14
00:01:28,148 --> 00:01:31,645
5 rectangles shaded in.

15
00:01:31,645 --> 00:01:35,311
And now six rectangles shaded in.

16
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:43,895
So this right over here, what I just did, this is 6 rectangles of the 15 rectangles are shaded in.

17
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:47,146
So this is still 6/15. This represents the same thing.

18
00:01:47,146 --> 00:01:50,601
But how can I simplify this even more?

19
00:01:50,601 --> 00:01:55,676
Well, when you look at it numerically you see that both 6 and 15 are divisible by 3.

20
00:01:55,676 --> 00:01:58,226
In fact, the greatest common factor is 3.

21
00:01:58,226 --> 00:02:01,644
So what happens if we divide the numerator and the denominator by 3?

22
00:02:01,644 --> 00:02:08,232
If we do the same thing to numerator and denominator we're not going to be changing the value of fraction.

23
00:02:08,232 --> 00:02:13,066
So let's divide the numerator by 3 and divide the denominator by 3.

24
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:19,274
And what do we get? We get 2 over 5.

25
00:02:19,274 --> 00:02:24,401
And how does this makes sense in the contex of this diagram right here?

26
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:28,895
Well, here we started off with 6 shaded in divided by 3 is 2 shaded in.

27
00:02:28,895 --> 00:02:34,407
So it's actually saying "Hey, let's group these into the sections of 3". So let's say that this is...

28
00:02:34,407 --> 00:02:48,340
This right over here is 1 section of 3. So that's one section of 3. And then this is another section of 3 right over here.

29
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:55,012
And so you have 2 sections of three (and actually let me colour it a little bit better).

30
00:02:55,012 --> 00:02:59,808
So you have 2 sections of three and If you were combining them it looked just like this.

31
00:02:59,808 --> 00:03:10,813
Notice, it is covering exact same are as your six smaller ones did. And how many equal sections of this size do you have on this entire thing?

32
00:03:10,813 --> 00:03:25,644
Well, you have 5 equal sections. Let me show, cause this is one section of 3 - right over here.This is another section of 3 and this is another section of 3.

33
00:03:25,644 --> 00:03:34,225
So notice you are covering the exact same area of the original thing. You are covering 2 out of 5 equal sections.

34
00:03:34,225 --> 00:03:38,004
So 2 fifths (2/5) and 6 fifteens (6/15) are equivalent fractions.

35
00:03:38,004 --> 00:03:42,004
If you wanna say what fraction of this is covered in the simplest form you would say 2 fifhts (2/5)
