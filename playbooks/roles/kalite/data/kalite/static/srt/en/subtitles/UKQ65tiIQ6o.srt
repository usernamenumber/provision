Let us say this triangle over here is an equilateral triangle

2
00:00:04,333 --> 00:00:06,533
which means all of the sides are of equal length

3
00:00:06,533 --> 00:00:08,600
Let us say the length of this side is "s",

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,533
what i want to do is to come up with a way to

5
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:15,333
find out the area of this equilateral triangle

6
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:18,800
as a function of "s". To do this i am going to

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,333
split this equilateral triangle into 2

8
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:29,400
I am going to drop a line from this top vertex, which

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,800
divides the triangle into 2. This angle is equal to that angle

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:41,800
we proved all these in an earlier video

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,400
In a regular equilateral triangle all of the angles are equal

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:56,000
60 degrees, this is 60, this is 60 and this one up here

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,533
is 60 split into 2, each angle 30 degrees each

14
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:09,000
and the other thing we know is the altitude will bisect

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:21,200
this length into equal parts. Now if the entire length

16
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,667
was "s", all three sides will have the same length,

17
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:32,067
then each of these is "s/2" If this length is known we can

18
00:01:32,067 --> 00:01:43,333
find out this side. The reason why we need to know this is

19
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:51,200
the area of a triangle is 1/2 * base * height.

20
00:01:51,200 --> 00:02:02,733
If this is 's/2", the side over here is √3s/2

21
00:02:02,733 --> 00:02:17,733
In a 30:60:90 triangle if the side opposite to 30 degrees is 1

22
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:22,200
the side opposite to 60 degrees is going to be √3

23
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:29,400
and the side opposite 90 degrees is 2 times it.

24
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:46,933
In this case the side opposite to 30 degrees is "s/2"

25
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,000
side opposite 60 degrees will be √3s/2

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,333
Now we need to figure out what the area of the triangle is.

27
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:54,067
The area of a triangle is 1/2 * base * height of the triangle.

28
00:02:54,067 --> 00:03:01,067
The base of the triangle is "s". The height of the triangle is √3s/2

29
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:23,800
so area = 1/2 * s * √3s/2 = √(3s<i>s)/(2</i>2)

30
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,867
So we if we an equilateral triangle with each side = 1,

31
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:30,267
the area is √3/4. If we have a equilateral triangle with each

32
00:03:30,267 --> 99:59:59,999
side = 2 the are will be √(3 2<i>2)/(2</i>2) = √3
