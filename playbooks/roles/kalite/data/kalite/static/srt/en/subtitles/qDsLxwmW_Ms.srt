1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,960
Alright,we're on problem 59. 59 on page 282.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,030
If a real estate agent received a commission of 6% of

3
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,880
the selling price of a certain house,what was the selling

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,900
price of the house? So the price of the house.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,380
And they just told us that the real estate agent received 6%

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,710
percent but that alone doesn't tell us much.

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,750
So statement number one,they tell us the selling price

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,900
minus the real estate agent's commission was $84,600.

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,160
So let's see if we can write that algebraically.

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,590
The selling price,let's say p for price,

11
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,620
minus the real estate agent's commission--

12
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,810
well,the they told us at the beginning the real estate agent

13
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,160
received 6% of the selling price.

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,470
So that's 0.06,6% of the price.

15
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:54,190
So they're telling us that that is equal to $84,600.

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,600
Well,we're done! That's a linear equation with one unknown.

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,980
This is algebra one. You can solve for this.

18
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,730
Let's see,you could say this is,I mean if you had to,

19
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:11,550
0.94p is equal to 84,600 and then you'd have p is equal to

20
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:17,980
84,600 divided by 0.94,whatever that is. But we don't care.

21
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,810
We just have to know that we could solve it.

22
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,730
Well,since we got so close,let's just solve it.

23
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,520
84,600 divided by point-- this is a bad habit when you're

24
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,760
taking the GMAT,you want to just know that you could solve it

25
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,080
so the selling price of the house is $90,000.

26
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,130
We didn't have to solve that.

27
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,280
That would be a waste of time on the real GMAT

28
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,910
but I just wanted to show you how easy it was to solve.

29
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,380
Statement number two,

30
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,990
let's see if this is independently useful.

31
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:50,170
The selling price was 250% of the original purchase price of

32
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:58,180
$36,000. We chose p as the selling price,right?

33
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,180
The selling price minus--

34
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,950
right,everything we talked about before was the selling price

35
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,470
And now they introduce this thing called the purchase price.

36
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,990
So the price selling is equal to-- and that's what

37
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,120
we're going to figure out-- is equal to 250%.

38
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,610
So that's 2.5 times the purchase price of $36,000.

39
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,670
So times $36,000. Actually we didn't have to write this.

40
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:27,320
So the price is 2.5 times 36,000 which is,I'm guessing,

41
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,270
let's see,72,yep,it's $90,000 again.

42
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,160
We didn't have to do that.

43
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,500
But once again,this is just a very--

44
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,590
this is actually not even algebra.

45
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,970
You just have to multiply 2.5 times 36,000

46
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,610
and your get the answer. So each of these,independently,

47
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:44,380
are enough to solve this problem. So that's D. Next problem.

48
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,780
60. This yellow's a little bit over the top.

49
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,920
Let me do more muted color.

50
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,940
So they write,if the square root of x/y is equal to--

51
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,850
what does that say-- d? Right,is that what they wrote?

52
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,580
Is equal to d? No,that's equal to n I think.

53
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,710
Alright,is equal to n,what is the value of x?

54
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:19,870
So statement number one,they tell us that yn is equal to 10.

55
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,930
Well,this is pretty useful because this first equation

56
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,130
they give us,we would just multiply both sides by y,

57
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,530
we get square root of x is equal to yn,right?

58
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,610
y times both sides gets us this.

59
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:36,040
And if yn is equal to 10 then we know that the square root of

60
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,430
x is equal to 10. So x is equal to 100.

61
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,300
So statement one alone is enough.

62
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,690
Now what does statement two do for us?

63
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:54,000
They tell us y is equal to 40 and n is equal to 1/4.

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,950
So once again,they substituted everything else,

65
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,090
so we just have to solve for x.

66
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,500
So both of these individually are enough so the answer is D.

67
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,550
But we could solve for it just for fun.

68
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:10,790
We get square root of x/40 is equal to 1/4 and then you get,

69
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,090
essentially solving this,you get square root of x

70
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,550
is equal to 10. And you get the same thing,

71
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:18,790
x is equal to 100 and you are all done,right?

72
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,510
And you might say,oh,but isn't there a plus or minus?

73
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,840
No,because we're saying the square root of something

74
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,170
is equal to 10.

75
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,880
We're not saying the square root of 100 is what?

76
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,400
If you said what is the square root of a 100

77
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,610
you'd say it's plus or minus 10.

78
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,420
But if we said the square root of something is 10 that

79
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,060
something has to be 100. Anyway,next problem.

80
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,510
Don't want to dilly-dally. 61.

81
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,660
I want to imbue you with a sense of urgency for the GMAT.

82
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,590
How many integers are there between,

83
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,620
but not including,r and s. Fair enough.

84
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,150
So essentially we have to figure out what r and s are or

85
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,320
how far part they are. So statement number one--

86
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:06,420
so integers between r and s,but not including,

87
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,850
remember,not including.

88
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,860
So statement number one tells us that r minus s

89
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:21,490
is equal to 10. Now this is an interesting question

90
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,940
because if we knew that r and s were integers

91
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,060
then we could just pick.r minus s is--,

92
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:33,030
maybe r is equal to 11 and s is equal to 1.

93
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,510
And then if you actually just want me to write it out

94
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:42,380
you could say,well,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11.

95
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,730
How many integers are between the two and not equaling

96
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:51,500
the two? 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,right?

97
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,470
But that's if we assume that r and s are integers and this

98
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,550
would work for any two sets of integers that are 10 apart.

99
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:01,290
But what happens if we do it a little bit differently?

100
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:08,120
What happens if we say that this is 1.1,2.1, 3.1--

101
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,960
oh no,sorry. What if it's between 1.1 and 11.1?

102
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,930
So if it's 1.1 is r-- oh no,let me write it this way.

103
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:22,920
What if r was 11.1 and s was equal to 1.1?

104
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,980
Then what are the integers between them but not equal?

105
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:31,580
So if you start at 1.1 you would have 2,3,4,5,6,7,

106
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:37,020
8,9,10-- and now 11 would be included because 11 would

107
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,570
still be less than r-- 10,11.

108
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:44,150
So now you have 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.

109
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,230
So statement number one is actually not enough

110
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:49,090
because they didn't tell us that r and s are integers.

111
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:52,480
If r and s were integers then the answer would be 9

112
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,380
in this case.

113
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,940
But if r and s are not integers then the answer could be 10.

114
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:01,020
So statement number one alone is not enough,the answer

115
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,280
could be 9 or 10.OK,what does statement number two do for us.

116
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,130
Let me do it in a different color. Statement number two.

117
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,450
This is an interesting problem.

118
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,800
There are 9 integers between,but not including,

119
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:21,970
r plus 1 and s plus 1. OK. So this is interesting.

120
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,210
So they're telling us that there are 9 integers

121
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,870
between r plus 1 and s plus 1.

122
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,910
So,I mean,actually just looking at it,inspection,

123
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,450
you could say,oh,well then there are 9 integers

124
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,550
between r and s. And they say but not including.

125
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,930
So this is enough. This alone is sufficient

126
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,460
and you don't need statement number one.

127
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,220
Statement number one actually doesn't get you anywhere.

128
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:41,480
So let me prove to you that if there are 9 integers between

129
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,370
r plus 1 and s plus 1-- Well,think of it this way:

130
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,950
if there are 9 integers between r plus 1 an s plus 1,

131
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:54,780
if you subtract 1--so s is one of the one's that are between

132
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,240
now I want to make sure I do this right--

133
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,870
Let me think of a good way for me to prove it to you.

134
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,440
Well,I'll just do it with an example.

135
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:15,560
So let's say that the example is 11 and 1,right?

136
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,830
This isn't a proof but I just want to give you the intuition,

137
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:22,380
right? So if r is 11 and s is 1,so then you would have 12--

138
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,600
well, I don't want to do it that way.

139
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,420
The easiest way to think about it is,it doesn't matter

140
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,180
how much you are adding--

141
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,180
if you add the same amount to both the bottom of the range

142
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,460
and the top of the range it should not change the total number of

143
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,130
integers that are between them.

144
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:42,670
So there would also be 9 integers

145
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:45,920
between r minus 1 and s minus 1.

146
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,150
You're just shifting the range along the number line but

147
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,510
you're not going to actually change the number of integers

148
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,390
in between them.

149
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,900
So if they're 9 integers between r plus 1 and s plus 1,

150
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,980
there's going to be 9 integers between r and s.

151
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,360
So two is all you need.

152
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,950
Hopefully that's a satisfactory explanation.

153
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,020
I didn't want to go into something rigorous

154
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,760
when we're trying to imbue you with a sense of urgency.

155
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,580
See if I have time for the next problem.

156
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,150
OK,62.

157
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,360
What is the number of members of club x who are

158
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,240
at least 35 years of age.

159
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,040
So number who's age is at least 35,so it's greater than

160
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,080
or equal to 35. The number who's age is true. OK.

161
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,700
They tell us statement number one,exactly 3/4 of

162
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:42,880
the members of club x are under 35 years of age.

163
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,240
So 3/4 are less than 35.

164
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:55,640
That is fair enough but that doesn't tell us the number

165
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,720
that are at least 35. This tells us the percentage.

166
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:06,940
This tells us that 1/4 above or we say 1/4 greater than

167
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:14,180
or equal to 35. 1/4 of total members greater than

168
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,950
or equal to 35. So it tells us proportion

169
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,350
but it doesn't tell us the total amount.

170
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:22,330
And I just got the 1/4 from 3/4 are less than 35,1/4 are

171
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,300
going to be greater than or equal to 35 years of age.

172
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,110
So one by itself doesn't help us.

173
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,340
Let's see what two does for us.

174
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,790
The 64 women-- am I reading the same problem?

175
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,610
OK,yeah-- the 64 women in club x constitute 40% of

176
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,250
the club's membership. OK.

177
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:44,100
So 64 is equal to 40% of the total membership.

178
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,190
Now we're set,right?

179
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,600
Because we can use this equation to figure out

180
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,200
the total membership. Call it T for total.

181
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,220
T is going to be equal to 64 divided by 0.4.

182
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,990
They just told us that essentially 64 is 40% percent

183
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,810
of the total. They said it's the women and all that.

184
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:04,730
But they could've just told us that 64 is 40% of the total.

185
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,440
So then you can solve for the total.

186
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,330
And then you substitute that here and you say 1/4 of

187
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:12,410
the total are 35 five years or older and you get

188
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,140
what we were trying to solve for.

189
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:23,010
And so the answer is 1/4 times 64/0.4,and whatever that is,

190
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,020
you can put it in your calculator.

191
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,540
But all we had to care is that when you use both of these

192
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,680
equations combined,you're able to solve for the number

193
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,430
that are greater than or equal to 35 years old.

194
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,980
And each statement alone isn't sufficient,

195
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,200
so you need both statements.

196
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,540
And that is C,both statements together are sufficient.

197
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,550
See you in the next video.
