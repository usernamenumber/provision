1
00:00:04,643 --> 00:00:07,044
We are in the international gallery in Berlin

2
00:00:07,044 --> 00:00:11,988
and we are looking at one of my favourite paintings
by Edward Manet "In the Conservatory".

3
00:00:11,988 --> 00:00:14,484
Now, conservatory is like a greenhouse.

4
00:00:14,484 --> 00:00:20,632
It would be attached to a home
and would allow for plants to survive the winter.

5
00:00:20,632 --> 00:00:23,530
And the woman who takes up most to the painting

6
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,429
seems like a hothouse flower herself.

7
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:28,732
I mean, look at her dress and hat...

8
00:00:28,732 --> 00:00:31,306
She was actually the owner of a butique

9
00:00:31,306 --> 00:00:33,470
and so fashion was important to her

10
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:39,743
and it is a wonderful survey minder of the way which Paris become such a showplace for the bourgeoisie.

11
00:00:39,743 --> 00:00:43,859
Being observed and observing 
were crtically important activities,

12
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:46,148
especially for somebody like Manet.

13
00:00:46,148 --> 00:00:49,620
She has that hair about her of things above it all.

14
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,428
She does seem too touched.

15
00:00:51,428 --> 00:00:56,692
I read it as her aloofness and his desire for intimacy.

16
00:00:56,692 --> 00:01:00,131
The center almost literally is their hands,

17
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:03,200
hers casually on the back of this bench

18
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,773
but his holding a cigar which seems to inch towards her.

19
00:01:07,773 --> 00:01:10,775
She looks out past him and so you are absolutely right

20
00:01:10,775 --> 00:01:14,010
she is the object of his attention, perhaps of his desire

21
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,714
and she seems to be elswhere completely.

22
00:01:16,714 --> 00:01:19,021
That man is her husband, Jules Guillemet.

23
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:24,954
Typical of Manet we have this open brushwork,
this loose handling of paint.

24
00:01:24,954 --> 00:01:27,129
You are right this is a kind of speedo

25
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:30,327
with which his hand 
is moving across the surface of the canvas.

26
00:01:30,327 --> 00:01:33,997
I love the way 
that the bench functions as a barrier between them,

27
00:01:33,997 --> 00:01:37,533
except of course at its top where the hands almost meet.

28
00:01:37,533 --> 00:01:41,971
It's so often Manet does give us a sense of the momentary,

29
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:45,209
the sense of something cought by your eye

30
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:51,530
and I almost have that sense here, 
though we were walking by and cought this moment.

31
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,551
Formally the painting is so interesting.

32
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:55,220
She looks of to the right

33
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,090
and although we don't have a sense
she is looking in something specific.

34
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:02,926
We do see her gaze at drawn area
that we don't have available to us.

35
00:02:02,926 --> 00:02:07,031
The man is looking at her but we can't quite see his eyes.

36
00:02:07,031 --> 00:02:12,008
In Manet's usual way, there is a kind of flattening,
that takes place here.

37
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:15,338
The figures are very close to the foreground

38
00:02:15,338 --> 00:02:18,074
and the verticales of the back of the bench,

39
00:02:18,074 --> 00:02:22,111
how to emphasise through their rythm
the dimensionality of the surface,

40
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:30,120
the relative lack of diferentiation in the greens in the background and even field and a kind of shallow space.

41
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:36,056
And it's this flatness 
and it's also the problems in the narrative

42
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:39,364
that I think would if, upset nineteenth century viewers.

43
00:02:39,364 --> 00:02:42,364
Most academic paintings were offer as a narrative.

44
00:02:42,364 --> 00:02:46,437
There was entirely understanable and this one just isn't.

45
00:02:46,437 --> 00:02:50,573
We can't firmly say what's going on with this figures.

46
00:02:50,573 --> 00:02:54,316
We don't know what's just outside the frame to the right.

47
00:02:54,316 --> 00:02:57,359
So this is kind of ambiguity, not only in the style of painting

48
00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:00,450
but there's a kind of ambiguity in the relationship as well.

49
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,026
All of which was antithetical
to the strong narratives of the academy.

50
00:03:04,026 --> 00:03:09,490
This illegibility is such a beautiful expression 
of the ambiguity of modern life

51
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,695
and Manet was one of the first artist to recognize this

52
00:03:12,695 --> 00:03:16,695
and make the central to his art.
