1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,850
   

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:06,270
One of the viewers pointed out
not incorrectly that one

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,310
definition of return on asset--
so this whole video's

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,670
going to be on return on asset--
that one definition of

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,390
return on asset, and if you
look it up on some of the

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,420
finance sites or even some
finance textbooks, they'll

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:27,220
tell you it's net income
over total assets.

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,310
Which is different from
what I told you.

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,380
And other sources, namely
Wikipedia, will tell you that

10
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,460
it is actually-- so this
is one definition

11
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,690
of return on asset.

12
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,760
Another definition
is net income.

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,800
I'll just abbreviate
that as NI.

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,500
Net income plus interest. So
they're adding back your

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,450
interest. And then they're
subtracting out the tax

16
00:00:51,450 --> 00:01:01,560
savings due to interest.

17
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,950
And we could a whole video on
the tax savings from interest.

18
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,540
And when it makes more sense
to raise money with debt

19
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,130
versus equity, because of the
cost of interest. But that

20
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,880
also increases your chance
of bankruptcy, the more

21
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,830
debt you take on.

22
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,630
We could do a series
of videos on that.

23
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:21,460
But tax savings from interest.
Divided by assets.

24
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,090
This is a definition that
Wikipedia gives you.

25
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,810
And then the very first
definition I gave you was

26
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:36,810
operating profit over assets.

27
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,090
And then I'll add one more
definition to this video, just

28
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,540
because I think it's worth
talking about.

29
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,310
And I think this is kind of a
general theme in finance, is

30
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,490
that there's all these
formulas for things.

31
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,100
And people memorize them.

32
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,220
But in the process, you lose
a lot of the intuition.

33
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,740
And it's also important to
realize that there are

34
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,690
multiple ways of defining the
exact same terms. So people

35
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,360
can confidently say
the ROA is this.

36
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,045
And you know what?

37
00:02:00,045 --> 00:02:01,880
It's never a bad question
to ask them what

38
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,060
they mean by ROA.

39
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,320
And I think you'll also be
surprised by how many people

40
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,890
won't be able to tell you
what they mean by ROA.

41
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,580
But then the last one, if I have
time to go over, we'll

42
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,350
call it EBIT.

43
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,190
I know that look like
a very strange word.

44
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,610
EBIT divided by assets.

45
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,190
But just so you know what EBIT
is, EBIT is just Earnings

46
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,580
Before Interest and Taxes.

47
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:30,920
So this is just the same thing
as net income plus interest

48
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,260
plus taxes.

49
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:38,810
So it's kind of a pre-tax
ROA divided by assets.

50
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,090
So these are all different
things.

51
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,890
And you might already say, wait
if I took net income--

52
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,500
let's actually talk about
this for a second.

53
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,950
Let's compare EBIT to
operating profit.

54
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:52,480
You might immediately say, if
I took net income-- so let's

55
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,560
remember EBIT is just an acronym
for Earnings Before

56
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,440
Interest and Taxes.

57
00:02:59,440 --> 00:02:59,970
So let's see.

58
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,030
If our earnings are $350,000.

59
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,280
And we were to add back the
taxes and the interest. So we

60
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,030
add back the taxes, which
gets us to pre-tax.

61
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,020
And we add back the interest,
at least in this example, we

62
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,240
get to an operating
profit number.

63
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,390
So you might say, why is there
a different term EBIT instead

64
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,120
of, why don't people just always
use operating profit?

65
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,960
And the reason why there's a
different term is, sometimes

66
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,990
you can have the non-operating
profit.

67
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:32,780
So let's say that out of this
$10 million of assets-- and I

68
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,820
didn't go there in the first
example because I didn't

69
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,050
really want to complicate the
issue, but I'll complicate the

70
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,400
issue a little bit now.

71
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,390
Let's say out of this $10
million of assets, let's say

72
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:47,610
that $9 million are
operating assets.

73
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,070
They're the enterprise.

74
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,960
They're the things that are
needed to generate the

75
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,690
operating profit.

76
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,850
And then you had another
$1 million of

77
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,360
assets of this $10 million.

78
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,870
That the company really doesn't
need to operate.

79
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,100
They just have it around.

80
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,500
Maybe they're speculating
on oil prices.

81
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,960
Or they're just hedging
something.

82
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,800
Or they just have a super
flush bank account.

83
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,610
So these assets might
be generating

84
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,150
non-operating income.

85
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,230
So you could have a line here
for interest income or

86
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,200
investment income.

87
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,670
Let me put that.

88
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,300
Investment income.

89
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,380
And then the company might have
made some money there.

90
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,260
It might make $10,000 on
investment income.

91
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,210
And of course that'll
drop to this line.

92
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,360
This'll then become $510,000.

93
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,790
The taxes will be $153,000.

94
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:47,020
And the net income
is $357,000.

95
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,620
Because we have a
30% tax rate.

96
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,430
And that make sense, right?

97
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,450
I added an extra $10,000
of income here.

98
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,300
And then at the end of the day,
you're going to tax at

99
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,440
30%, so this should be $7,000
more of earnings.

100
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,690
So that makes sense. $357,000.

101
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,370
But this is the difference
between

102
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,420
operating income and EBIT.

103
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,490
EBIT in this case would be the
operating profit plus this

104
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,360
investment income.

105
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,490
So EBIT, in the case that I
just added some investment

106
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:19,600
income, would be $1,010,000,
while operating profit would

107
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,350
be $1 million.

108
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,150
I didn't want to go there in
the first video, and that's

109
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:26,600
why I just said operating profit
divided by assets.

110
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,910
But if you really consider all
of the assets, and if you

111
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,740
assume that there are some
assets there that are

112
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,420
non-operating.

113
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,080
They're not really used to
make widgets, or to sell

114
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,770
widgets or market widgets, or
help the CEO in any way do his

115
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,040
or her job.

116
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,990
Then whatever this generates
is actually

117
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,390
non-operating income.

118
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,290
And so EBIT factors that in.

119
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,250
So EBIT, I kind of view that
it goes backwards.

120
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,090
It starts with net income.

121
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,840
And then it adds back the taxes
and interest. While

122
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,680
operating profit, you start at
the top line and you go down.

123
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,710
But in general if you take
EBIT and you take out the

124
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,550
non-operating income, you get
back to operating profits.

125
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,480
So that's what EBIT
is right here.

126
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,950
And so you can already imagine
that both EBIT and the way I

127
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,400
defined it initially, operating

128
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,040
profit divided by assets.

129
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,120
They're ways of saying, before
you consider taxes, what are

130
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,930
your assets doing for you?

131
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,980
So once again, if this is a
balance sheet, this is the

132
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,590
assets, here are your
liabilities.

133
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,620
Debt could be one of them.

134
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,220
But in general it could be
a bunch of other things.

135
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,270
You might owe other vendors
money or whatever.

136
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,810
Then you have your equity.

137
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,100
It's important whenever
you talk about

138
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,520
any of these ratios.

139
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,220
What context?

140
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,640
Are you trying to pass the CFA
exam, or are you trying to

141
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,680
impress your MBA professor?

142
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,010
Or are you trying to get an
intuition for helping to

143
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,600
become a better investor?

144
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,975
And if you are an investor,
you're probably going to want

145
00:06:50,975 --> 00:06:52,560
to do the last of the three.

146
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,320
And there, ROA, the Return on
Assets is telling you, how

147
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,910
good is this company at getting
a return out of this

148
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,290
thing right here?

149
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,590
I don't care how they paid for
it, whether they had debt.

150
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,930
I don't want to think
about, are they good

151
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:07,940
at getting low interest?

152
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,760
I don't want to think about, is
their CFO good at getting a

153
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,770
better interest rate
than another CFO?

154
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:16,160
Or are they better at evading
taxes than another company?

155
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,950
All I care is the assets that
they have, how good are they

156
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,540
at putting those
assets to work?

157
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,800
And what type of a return
can they get?

158
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,270
So if I calculate it using you
EBIT divided by assets, or

159
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:34,960
operating profit divided by
assets, if I use either of

160
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,600
these as my metric for ROA and
Company A has a 10% ROA and

161
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,100
Company B has a 15% ROA, then
I say, you know what?

162
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,120
I don't care whether B's guy
is better at getting a low

163
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,950
interest rate.

164
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:52,970
Or getting some type of tax
handout from the government.

165
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,080
Or doing something fancy
with where he keeps his

166
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,970
subsidiaries.

167
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:00,120
I just want to know which
management is better at

168
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,030
getting a return out
of these assets.

169
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,650
And these metrics will
tell you that.

170
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,660
Because it tells you either how
much operating profit is

171
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,340
being generated from here,
or it could tell

172
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,350
you how much EBIT.

173
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,390
In this case, an EBIT might be a
little bit more informative.

174
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:16,480
Because some of income might
be generated from

175
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,980
non-operating assets.

176
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:22,410
So maybe the company holds some
stock, or it holds some

177
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,370
gold or something.

178
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,040
Or it holds some forward
contracts to hedge its

179
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,720
exposure to oil or foreign
currency or something.

180
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,299
So in general if you want to
know what I think is the best

181
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:36,760
ROA, I would say it's EBIT over
assets, which is very

182
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,950
close to operating profit
over assets.

183
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,909
And now you say, well Sal, why
are these other things here?

184
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:46,170
And why don't you like
them as much?

185
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:50,460
Well, net income over assets,
I think the reason why that

186
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:56,440
definition exists is because:
one, net income does factor

187
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,620
into these things that frankly
I didn't want to

188
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,670
think as much about.

189
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:05,360
But when you talk about return,
what you get off the

190
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,640
asset, you still are going
to pay taxes on them.

191
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,760
And if you do have some
financing, you will be paying

192
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,150
some interest on that.

193
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,620
So that's why this comes out.

194
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,440
Where they actually just
take the bottom line.

195
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,410
When people talk about top line
and bottom line, now you

196
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,410
know where those words
come from.

197
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,790
Top line is revenue.

198
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,730
It's the top line of the
income statement.

199
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,430
And your bottom line, that's
the bottom line

200
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,310
of the income statement.

201
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,820
That's where the word
comes from.

202
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,250
So that one definition takes
this and they divide by the

203
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,250
total assets.

204
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:40,380
But the reason why I don't like
that is this definition

205
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,320
does not separate out that one
company might be better at

206
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,380
evading taxes or paying taxes.

207
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,660
And another company might be
better at somehow getting

208
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,090
better financing
from the bank.

209
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,240
And that's not what matters.

210
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,150
I care about the assets.

211
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,770
I care just about the
left-hand side

212
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:57,670
of the balance sheet.

213
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,530
While this is taking into
consideration some of the

214
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,870
factors on that side of
the balance sheet.

215
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:07,770
For example, let's say you have
two identical companies.

216
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,190
This could be an interesting
example.

217
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:16,250
You have one company-- Actually
I just realized I'm

218
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:16,600
out of time.

219
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,200
I'll continue the example in
the next video, and I'll

220
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:28,060
explain a little bit about the
tax savings from carrying debt

221
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,690
or interest. See you
in the next video.
