1
00:00:00,627 --> 00:00:04,963
Let's review what happened in the last video because, in general, it's just kind of confusing

2
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:07,384
and it's always good to see it a second time.

3
00:00:07,384 --> 00:00:12,725
And then we can think a little bit about how these market dynamics could be manipulated

4
00:00:12,725 --> 00:00:17,369
so that you don't have the Chinese currency getting more expensive.

5
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:22,965
So in the last video, we started off with an exchange rate of 10 Yuan per (US) dollar.

6
00:00:22,965 --> 00:00:27,770
We saw that this manufacturer over here in China had to sell his goods

7
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,045
for the equivalent of 10 Yuan in order for him to make a profit;

8
00:00:31,045 --> 00:00:34,203
and that this guy in United States had to sell his goods abroad --

9
00:00:34,203 --> 00:00:37,978
or we'll say in China -- for the equivalent of $1.

10
00:00:37,978 --> 00:00:44,250
Now this exchange rate, this price was $1, one US dollar in the United States.

11
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:51,399
And at this exchange rate, this guy had to sell his cola for 10 Yuan so that he could get his dollar.

12
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:53,935
So we kind of just drew it out.

13
00:00:53,935 --> 00:00:55,957
And we said at that price --

14
00:00:55,957 --> 00:01:02,410
So for 10 Yuan -- which was $1 -- at $1, there was demand for 100 dolls in the United States.

15
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,127
So we saw this dynamic.

16
00:01:04,127 --> 00:01:06,356
He would ship 100 dolls to the United States;

17
00:01:06,356 --> 00:01:09,344
and then the United States would ship him back $100.

18
00:01:09,344 --> 00:01:14,221
He would sell those dolls for essentially $1 each; he would get back $100.

19
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:17,764
On the other side of the equation, the cola manufacturer

20
00:01:17,764 --> 00:01:24,497
if he were to sell it for 10 Yuan in China, there's demand for 50 cans of soda.

21
00:01:24,497 --> 00:01:31,185
So he would send 50 cans of soda to China; and they would send him 10 Yuan for each can: 500 Yuan.

22
00:01:31,185 --> 00:01:34,761
Now, what happened in that situation is that

23
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:42,191
the Chinese manufacturer had 1,000 Yuan that he needs to convert into dollars --

24
00:01:42,191 --> 00:01:46,115
into $100 preferably -- if that exchange rate were fixed.

25
00:01:46,115 --> 00:01:52,710
The American manufacturer -- and let's say that these are the only two actors in our scenario --

26
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,332
has 500 Yuan that he needs to convert into $50.

27
00:01:56,332 --> 00:02:01,231
So if we just look over here, here's someone who wants to convert (into) 1,000 Yuan.

28
00:02:01,231 --> 00:02:04,807
He wants to convert (his dollars) into 1,000 Yuan.

29
00:02:04,807 --> 00:02:05,690
Let me be very careful.

30
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:13,800
He wants to convert his $100 into 1,000 Yuan, if the currency were to be held constant.

31
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:21,479
But there's only 500 Yuan being offered in the market.

32
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:27,377
So he was going to have to offer more dollars per Yuan than he would if there were more Yuan in the market.

33
00:02:27,377 --> 00:02:28,910
Now you can look at it from the other side.

34
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:34,807
This American manufacturer has 500 Yuan from his sales in China.

35
00:02:34,807 --> 00:02:38,476
He wants to convert it -- if the currency was pegged -- into $50.

36
00:02:38,476 --> 00:02:41,170
But maybe he could do better than $50 here.

37
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:46,046
And as we can see, there's more demand to convert the Yuan than there is to convert the dollars.

38
00:02:46,046 --> 00:02:49,343
He wants to buy $50 using Yuan.

39
00:02:49,343 --> 00:02:56,913
This guy wants to sell $100 (to convert it) into Yuan.

40
00:02:56,913 --> 00:03:11,170
So if you look over here, the supply of dollars is much greater than the demand for dollars.

41
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:16,162
And you know in anything, if the supply of apples is greater than the demand for apples

42
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:18,067
then the price of apples would go down.

43
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:21,549
And the opposite is happening here with the Yuan.

44
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:33,252
The demand for Yuan -- this is the demand -- is much greater than the supply of Yuan.

45
00:03:33,252 --> 00:03:38,732
And we know that when the demand is greater than the supply, the price needs to go up.

46
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:44,212
And so we saw a scenario where the price of the dollar will go down in terms of Yuan.

47
00:03:44,212 --> 00:03:50,899
Now all that means is if you were having to give 10 Yuan per dollar, now you're going to have to give fewer Yuan per dollar.

48
00:03:50,899 --> 00:03:52,928
The price of the Yuan would go down.

49
00:03:52,928 --> 00:04:00,605
If the price of apples in Yuan goes down, instead of offering 10 Yuan per apple, you'd probably offer 8 Yuan per apple.

50
00:04:00,605 --> 00:04:03,299
So we see the exact same thing for the price of the dollar.

51
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:06,294
But that's equivalent to saying the price of a Yuan goes up.

52
00:04:06,294 --> 00:04:09,104
Now we said eventually -- and I'm just making this number up --

53
00:04:09,104 --> 00:04:16,462
it's hard to predict what the actual settling price would be -- we eventually get to 8 Yuan per dollar.

54
00:04:16,462 --> 00:04:18,733
And then we said, at that exchange (rate) --

55
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:22,316
and actually I'm going to change the numbers a little bit, just to make it a little bit cleaner --

56
00:04:22,316 --> 00:04:33,461
at that exchange rate -- at 8 Yuan per dollar -- these 10-Yuan dolls would now cost $1.25.

57
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:41,945
And let's say that at $1.25, in the United States, there is demand for 60 dolls.

58
00:04:41,945 --> 00:04:46,079
(I'm changing the numbers a little bit from the last video just to make the numbers work out a little bit better.)

59
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:48,263
So you can just ignore the numbers from the last video.

60
00:04:48,263 --> 00:05:04,740
And remember, the old demand, when the 10-Yuan dolls were only $1 -- (WRITING) so the old demand was 100 dolls --

61
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:10,962
So it makes sense -- If dolls are $1, people are going to have more of them.

62
00:05:10,962 --> 00:05:16,860
If dolls go up to $1.25, the demand will go down -- and let's say it'll go down to 60 dolls.

63
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:25,869
Now on the other side of the equation, the $1 can of soda at 8 Yuan per dollar will now sell in China for 8 Yuan.

64
00:05:25,869 --> 00:05:28,562
And remember what the old price was.

65
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:34,019
The old price in China -- where the currency rate was 10 to 1 -- was 10 Yuan.

66
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:46,488
So the price -- let me write it here -- the price of the cola went from 10 Yuan down to 8 Yuan.

67
00:05:46,488 --> 00:05:50,761
So the demand, now that the cola is cheaper in China, the demand went up.

68
00:05:50,761 --> 00:05:54,081
And I'll change this number too, so don't do the 80 cans.

69
00:05:54,081 --> 00:06:00,400
We'll say that the demand in China went from 50 cans -- we saw that up here --

70
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,902
he had to ship 50 cans when it cost 10 Yuan per can --

71
00:06:04,902 --> 00:06:09,867
So it went from 50 cans up to -- (WRITING) maybe I should make it go up

72
00:06:09,867 --> 00:06:18,744
the demand went from 50 up to, let's say, 75 cans.

73
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:21,434
I'm using these numbers because it's going to lead to cleaner numbers.

74
00:06:21,434 --> 00:06:23,518
So now what is the actual scenario?

75
00:06:23,518 --> 00:06:25,287
In the last video I said work it out yourself,

76
00:06:25,287 --> 00:06:31,120
but I realize the more concrete examples of this (I can give you), the more it will kind of sink into your brain.

77
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,532
So now what is the trade balance going on?

78
00:06:33,532 --> 00:06:42,692
So going from China, (WRITING) China -- and then you have the US

79
00:06:42,692 --> 00:06:52,485
Over here we're going to be shipping only 60 dolls.

80
00:06:52,485 --> 00:06:58,516
And then the U.S. is going to ship back 60 times $1.25.

81
00:06:58,516 --> 00:07:00,748
That is $75, right?

82
00:07:00,748 --> 00:07:05,204
$1.25 for 60 dolls means you're going to get $75.

83
00:07:05,204 --> 00:07:09,068
So 75 US dollars are going to go back to China.

84
00:07:09,068 --> 00:07:10,972
So that's due to the dolls.

85
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,517
And now let's think about what's going to happen due to the soda.

86
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:27,118
We are going to have -- 75 cans of soda are going to be shipped to China.

87
00:07:27,118 --> 00:07:36,690
And then China is going to send back 75 cans at 8 Yuan per can.

88
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:44,863
75 times 8 is -- it's 600.

89
00:07:44,863 --> 00:07:53,757
So for the 75 cans, he is going to get back 600 Yuan.

90
00:07:53,757 --> 00:07:55,106
So now what's happening?

91
00:07:55,106 --> 00:08:17,075
The Chinese manufacturer -- over here on the left -- wants or needs to convert $75 into --

92
00:08:17,075 --> 00:08:23,455
if we assume that the currency is now 8, and he says, well, I'll just get it at the market rate --

93
00:08:23,455 --> 00:08:27,681
into roughly 600 Yuan.

94
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:31,187
75 times 8 is 600.

95
00:08:31,187 --> 00:08:32,749
8 Yuan per dollar.

96
00:08:32,749 --> 00:08:41,135
And then the U.S. manufacturer wants to convert--

97
00:08:41,135 --> 00:08:46,403
He's got 600 Yuan from his sale of soda, into --

98
00:08:46,403 --> 00:08:52,685
and, if he assumes he can get kind of the last market rate, 600 divided by 8 is into $75.

99
00:08:52,685 --> 00:08:54,152
So what just happened here?

100
00:08:54,152 --> 00:09:02,093
Now the supply of dollars is equal to the demand for dollars.

101
00:09:02,093 --> 00:09:11,149
And also, the supply of Yuan right over here is equal to the demand for Yuan.

102
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:13,796
So now, depending on how you view it,

103
00:09:13,796 --> 00:09:18,918
we're sending the same dollar value to the US as we're sending back to China;

104
00:09:18,918 --> 00:09:22,875
or we're sending the same Yuan value to the US as we're sending back to China

105
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:27,548
and the currency is now in balance. It really shouldn't shift.

106
00:09:27,548 --> 00:09:32,767
So I really wanted to go through this example again to show you that

107
00:09:32,767 --> 00:09:36,714
when you have freely floating currencies, eventually,

108
00:09:36,714 --> 00:09:40,824
one currency should get more -- if there is a trade imbalance,

109
00:09:40,824 --> 00:09:44,702
one currency would become more expensive than the other

110
00:09:44,702 --> 00:09:49,082
until the demand equalizes in both countries -- so that you eventually do have a trade balance.

111
00:09:49,082 --> 00:09:51,854
Hopefully that doesn't confuse you too much.

112
00:09:51,854 --> 00:09:54,585
In the next video, we'll talk about how a government --

113
00:09:54,585 --> 00:10:00,315
and we'll talk about the Chinese Central Bank in particular could intervene so that this doesn't happen

114
00:10:00,315 --> 00:10:05,515
so that they can always ship more to the US than the US ships to China.
