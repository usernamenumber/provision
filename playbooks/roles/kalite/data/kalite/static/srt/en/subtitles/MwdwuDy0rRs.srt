1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,930
Problem 15.

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:07,490
A restaurant is advertising 3-item combination specials

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:11,600
that must include a main dish, a vegetable, and a drink.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,890
OK, so you have to have at least one of these.

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,100
So what are they going to ask us?

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,500
How many 3-item combinations

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:28,450
include a soft drink and a corn?

8
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,100
So let's reread what the conditions are.

9
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,430
A restaurant is advertising 3-item combination specials

10
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:38,190
that must include a main dish, a vegetable, and a drink.

11
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,770
So you pick one from each of these buckets.

12
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,200
So they're already picking two of the buckets for us.

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,960
It includes a soft drink, and it has to include a corn.

14
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,070
So they've essentially already picked our choices

15
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,830
from this bucket and that bucket right there.

16
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,280
And they're saying, how many combinations are left?

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,120
Well, we only have two choices.

18
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,040
We only have freedom when it comes to picking the main dish.

19
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,440
Because the problem has already picked

20
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,670
for us our vegetable and our drink,

21
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:08,960
the corn and the soft drink.

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,310
And so there's only two possible main dishes,

23
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,140
so those are the 3-item combinations

24
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,220
that include a soft drink and a corn.

25
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,140
There's two possible ones, chicken and beef.

26
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,180
So it's two.

27
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,600
Just to make sure you understand that,

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,930
what are the two combinations, just to make it explicit?

29
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:28,700
Well, one combination is chicken, corn, and soft drink.

30
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,000
Right?

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,400
They're forcing the corn and the soft drink on us.

32
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,930
And then the other combination is beef, corn, and soft drink

33
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,060
That's the second combination,

34
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,250
because they're forcing the corn and the soft drink on us.

35
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,170
So there's two combinations.

36
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,240
But the way I just thought about

37
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,870
that is this thing has been constrained for us,

38
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,770
the vegetable and the drink, so you can ignore it.

39
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,150
And so how many combinations of main dishes are there?

40
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:49,750
Well, there's two.

41
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,510
I just counted them.

42
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,430
Chicken and beef.

43
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,490
Problem 16.

44
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:59,140
Donald priced six personal Compact Disc players.

45
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,830
And they wrote the CD right there.

46
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,760
The prices are shown below.

47
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,190
OK, so these are six CD players.

48
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,480
What is the median price?

49
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,220
So the trick of this problem is just knowing

50
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,330
what median means.

51
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,730
Median literally means the middle price.

52
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,320
So if I were to put all of these numbers in order,

53
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,690
which I'm going to do right now,

54
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,580
the median is going to be the middle number.

55
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,310
So let's put them in order.

56
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,780
What's the smallest number here?

57
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,970
21.

58
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,860
Cross that out.

59
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,740
And then we have another 21.

60
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,450
So let me write that down.

61
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,150
I'll cross that out, make sure I know I used it.

62
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,910
The next largest number is 23.

63
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,810
So let me cross that out.

64
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:43,300
The next largest number is 25.

65
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,850
Cross that out.

66
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,730
Next largest number is 31.

67
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,770
Cross that out.

68
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,430
And then the next number is 39.

69
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,360
So what is the middle number here?

70
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,850
Well, you see we have six numbers,

71
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,650
and, actually, there is no middle number.

72
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,050
If we have an even number of numbers,

73
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,490
there's no single middle number.

74
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,410
There's two numbers that we can kind of view as the middle.

75
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,700
These two numbers here are the middle.

76
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,000
Right?

77
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,050
I can't say 23 by itself is the middle,

78
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:12,700
because there's two above it and three below it.

79
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,490
And I can't say 25 is the middle,

80
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,910
because there's two below it and three above it.

81
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,780
So when you have an even number of, I guess, data,

82
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,640
like you have right here, you pick the middle two.

83
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,620
If I had the numbers 1, 2, and 3,

84
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,890
then I could just pick the 2.

85
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,110
But if I have 1, 2, 3, and 4,

86
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,360
I have to pick the middle two numbers.

87
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,070
So here I pick the middle two numbers, and I need a median.

88
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:41,080
And so what I do is I average these middle two numbers.

89
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,440
I take the mean, or I go right in between them.

90
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,410
So what's exactly in between 23 and 25?

91
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,650
Well, you can do that in your head.

92
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,810
It's going to be 24.

93
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,970
But if you can't do it in your head,

94
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,900
you literally would just add those two numbers,

95
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,580
23 plus 25, and then divide by 2.

96
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:02,890
So this is going to be equal to 48 divided by 2,which is $24

97
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:03,900
And I just explained that to you,

98
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,600
and just in case you got the situation

99
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,460
where these are some weird decimal numbers,

100
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,190
or these were much larger numbers,

101
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,010
where you couldn't just say, hey,

102
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:13,630
24 is right in between those two guys right there.
