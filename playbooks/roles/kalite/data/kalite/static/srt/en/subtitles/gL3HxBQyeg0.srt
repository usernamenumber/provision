1
00:00:00,123 --> 00:00:06,200
Let's find the volume of a few more solid figures, and if we have time we may be able to do more surface area problems.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,940
So let me draw a cylinder over here.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,175
So that is the top of my cylinder.

4
00:00:11,222 --> 00:00:14,689
and then this is the height of my cylinder.

5
00:00:14,843 --> 00:00:16,871
this is the bottom right over here.

6
00:00:16,978 --> 00:00:20,632
if this was transparent maybe you would be able to see the backside of my cylinder.

7
00:00:20,786 --> 00:00:23,498
so you can imagine this kind of looks like a soda can.

8
00:00:23,528 --> 00:00:27,595
And let's say that the height of my cylinder "h"

9
00:00:28,305 --> 00:00:33,133
is equal to 8. I'll give some units- 8 cm.

10
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,900
That is my height.

11
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:41,333
And then let's say that the radius of one of these, of the top of my cylinder, or my soda can

12
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:45,333
let's say that this radius over here is equal to 4 cm.

13
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,600
so what is the volume here.

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,000
what is the volume going to be?

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,333
and the idea here is really the exact same thing that we saw in some of the previous problems.

16
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,561
if you can find the surface area of one side

17
00:00:58,561 --> 00:01:02,600
and the figure out kind of how deep it goes, you'll be able to figure out the volume.

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:08,733
So what we are going to do here is figure out the surface area of the top of this cylinder.

19
00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:10,667
The top of this soda can

20
00:01:10,667 --> 00:01:14,234
and then we are going to multiply it by it's height and that'll give us a volume.

21
00:01:14,234 --> 00:01:17,600
this will tell us essentially how many square cm fit into this top

22
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,894
and then if we know; if we multiply that by how many cm we go down, then that will give us the number

23
00:01:23,894 --> 00:01:27,818
of cubic centimeters in this cylinder, or soda can

24
00:01:27,818 --> 00:01:30,067
so how do we figure out this area up here

25
00:01:30,067 --> 00:01:31,881
well the area on top

26
00:01:31,881 --> 00:01:33,333
this is just finding the area of a circle

27
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,733
you could imagine drawing it like this

28
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:38,667
if we were just to look at it straight on

29
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:42,400
that's a circle with a radius of 4 cm.

30
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,674
the area of a circle with an area of 4 cm

31
00:01:45,674 --> 00:01:48,228
area is equal to pie r squared.

32
00:01:48,228 --> 00:01:48,800
so it's going to be

33
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,549
pie times the radius squared

34
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:54,733
times four cm squared

35
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:55,400
which is equal to

36
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,467
4 squared is 16

37
00:01:56,467 --> 00:01:58,817
times pie

38
00:01:58,817 --> 00:02:00,067
and our units now

39
00:02:00,067 --> 00:02:02,067
are going to be cm squared

40
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:06,600
or another way to think of these is square cm

41
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,733
so that's the area

42
00:02:07,733 --> 00:02:08,933
the volume is going to be

43
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:11,467
this area times the height

44
00:02:11,467 --> 00:02:13,886
so the volume is going to be equal to

45
00:02:13,886 --> 00:02:23,151
16 pie cm squared times the height

46
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:25,310
times 8 cm

47
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:30,467
times 8 cm and so

48
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:32,200
when you do multiplication

49
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,400
you could use the associative property

50
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,899
you could kind of rearrange these things

51
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:39,200
it doesn't matter what order you do it.

52
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,067
it is all multiplication

53
00:02:40,067 --> 00:02:42,981
so this is the same thing as 16 times 8

54
00:02:42,981 --> 00:02:44,560
let's see 8 times 8 is 64

55
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,467
16 times 8 is twice that so it's going to be

56
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:53,067
128 pi, then you have cm squared times cm

57
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:56,634
so that gives us cm cubed

58
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:59,333
or 128 pi cubic cm.

59
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,139
remember, pi is just a number

60
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,800
we write it as pi because it is kind of a crazy irrational number

61
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,667
that if you were to write it, you could never completely write pi

62
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:11,147
3.14159 keeps going on

63
00:03:11,147 --> 00:03:12,333
never repeats

64
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,885
so we just leave it as pi

65
00:03:14,885 --> 00:03:15,814
but if you wanted to figure it out

66
00:03:15,814 --> 00:03:18,641
you can get a calculator and this would be 3.14 roughtly

67
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:19,810
times 128

68
00:03:19,887 --> 00:03:23,600
so it would be like you know close to 400

69
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,200
cubic cm

70
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:32,200
now, how would we find the surface area of this figure over here

71
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,760
well, part of the surface area, are the two surfaces, the top and the bottom.

72
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,467
so that would be part of the surface area

73
00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:44,607
and then the bottom over here would also be part of the surface area

74
00:03:44,607 --> 00:03:46,533
so if we are trying to find the surface area

75
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:48,400
let's do, surface

76
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,600
let's find the surface area of our cylinder

77
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,600
it's deffinitely going to have both of these areas here.

78
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,353
so it's going to have the 16 pi cm squared twice

79
00:03:58,353 --> 00:04:01,604
this is 16 pi, this is 16 pi square cm.

80
00:04:01,604 --> 00:04:05,272
so it's going to have two times 16 pi.

81
00:04:05,272 --> 00:04:06,933
cm squared.

82
00:04:06,933 --> 00:04:08,268
i'll keep the units still.

83
00:04:08,268 --> 00:04:11,600
so that covers the top and the bottom of our soda can.

84
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,350
and now we have to figure out the surface area of this thing that goes around

85
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,267
and the way I imagine it is

86
00:04:16,267 --> 00:04:19,285
imagine if you were trying to wrap this thing with wrapping paper

87
00:04:19,285 --> 00:04:20,698
so let me just draw

88
00:04:20,698 --> 00:04:21,313
let me just draw

89
00:04:21,313 --> 00:04:22,179
a little dotted line here

90
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,267
so imagine if you were to cut it just like that

91
00:04:24,267 --> 00:04:27,749
cut the side of the soda can. and if you were to kind of unwind

92
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:29,096
if you were to unwind

93
00:04:29,096 --> 00:04:31,667
this thing that goes around it

94
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:32,811
what would you have?

95
00:04:32,811 --> 00:04:34,600
Well you would have something

96
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,667
You would end up with a sheet of paper

97
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:39,200
Where this length right over here

98
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,404
This length right over here

99
00:04:40,404 --> 00:04:42,533
Is the same thing as this length over here

100
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:44,421
And then it would be completely unwound

101
00:04:44,421 --> 00:04:47,733
And then these two ends

102
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:48,276
Let me do this in magenta

103
00:04:48,276 --> 00:04:52,177
These two ends used to touch each other

104
00:04:52,177 --> 00:04:54,174
And let me do a color that I haven't used yet

105
00:04:54,174 --> 00:04:55,427
I'll do it in pink

106
00:04:55,427 --> 00:04:58,678
These two ends used to touch each other when it was

107
00:04:58,678 --> 00:05:00,267
all rolled together

108
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:02,800
And they used to touch each other right over there

109
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,267
So the length of this side and that side

110
00:05:05,267 --> 00:05:09,267
is going to be the same thing as the height of my cylinders

111
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,067
This is going to be eight centimeters

112
00:05:11,067 --> 00:05:14,600
And then this over here is also going to be eight centimeters

113
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,254
And so the question we'd ask ourselves is

114
00:05:17,254 --> 00:05:22,177
is what is going to be this dimension right over here

115
00:05:22,177 --> 00:05:25,428
And remember that dimension is essentially how far

116
00:05:25,428 --> 00:05:28,586
did we go around the cylinder

117
00:05:28,586 --> 00:05:29,600
Well if you think about it

118
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,600
That's going to be the exact same thing as the

119
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,273
circumference of either the top or the bottom

120
00:05:35,273 --> 00:05:36,333
of the cylinder

121
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,267
So what is the circumference?

122
00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:40,822
The circumference of this circle right over here

123
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,200
which is the same thing as the circumference of that circle over there. It is 2 times the radius times

124
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:59,352
pi. Or 2pi times the radius. 2pi times 4 cm which is equal to 8 pi cm. So this distance right over here

125
00:05:59,352 --> 00:06:06,364
is the circumference of either the top or the bottom of the cylinder. It's going to be 8 pi cm.

126
00:06:06,364 --> 00:06:11,891
So if you want to find the surface area of just the wrapping. Just the part that goes around the cylinder,

127
00:06:11,891 --> 00:06:17,649
not the top or the bottom. It's going to be unwinded, it's going to look like this rectangle.

128
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:25,033
And so it's area, the area of just that part is going to be equal to 8 cm by 8 pi cm.

129
00:06:25,033 --> 00:06:37,067
So let me does this, it's going to be 8 cm times 8 pi cm. And thats equal to 64 pi. 8 times 8 is 64.

130
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:43,006
You have your pi centimeters squared. So when you want the surface area of the whole thing

131
00:06:43,006 --> 00:06:48,625
you have the top, you have the bottom. We already threw those there. And then you want to find the area

132
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:54,941
of the thing around. We just figured that out so it's going to be plus 64 pi cm squared and now we just

133
00:06:54,941 --> 00:07:04,554
have to calculate it. So this gives us 2 times 16 pi is going to be equal to 32, that is 32 pi

134
00:07:04,554 --> 00:07:15,746
cm squared. Plus 64 pi, let me scroll over to the right a little bit. Plus 64 pi cm squared.

135
00:07:15,746 --> 00:07:30,333
And then 32 plus 64 is 96 pi cm squared. So it's equal to 96 pi square cm is going to be a little over 300 square cm.

136
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:37,572
And notice when we did surface area. We got our answer in terms of sq cm. That makes sense because

137
00:07:37,572 --> 00:07:44,631
surface area is a 2 dimensional measurement. We think about how many sq cm can we fit on the surface

138
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:52,851
of the cylinder. We did the volume we got cubed centimeters. And thats because we're trying to figure

139
00:07:52,851 --> 00:08:02,278
out how many 1x1 cm cubes. 1x1x1 cm cubes can we fit inside of this structure so that's why

140
00:08:02,278 --> 99:59:59,999
that's why it's cubic centimeters. Anyway hopefully that clarifies things up a little bit.
