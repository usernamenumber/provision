2
00:00:06,194 --> 00:00:08,916
We're looking at the famous sculpture called

3
00:00:08,916 --> 00:00:13,421
"The Dying Gaul" in the Capitoline Museum in Rome

4
00:00:13,421 --> 00:00:17,684
and this is a copy of a sculpture that dates from

5
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,800
the third century B.C. - the original.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,968
So this is a Roman copy of an ancient Greek original.

7
00:00:26,968 --> 00:00:30,511
But a Greek sculpture that would have actually come originally from Pergamon,

8
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:33,688
on the coast of what is now Turkey.

9
00:00:33,688 --> 00:00:36,548
Right, in one of the areas that was a Greek colony...

10
00:00:36,548 --> 00:00:40,496
and it was to commemorate an important battle over a group

11
00:00:40,496 --> 00:00:43,607
that the Greeks would have looked at as barbarians.

12
00:00:43,607 --> 00:00:46,858
It's interesting because in earlier Greek history,

13
00:00:46,858 --> 00:00:50,805
if this Gaul was to be represented as defeated,

14
00:00:50,805 --> 00:00:53,499
he would have been represented as a barbarian,

15
00:00:53,499 --> 00:00:57,678
as somebody who was inherently less than the Greeks,

16
00:00:57,678 --> 00:01:01,068
and although I think that you can still make the argument that that's the case

17
00:01:01,068 --> 00:01:04,598
if you look at his hair - it's roughly handled, his face - his brow

18
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:10,171
is large, his nose is not as idealized as

19
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:12,260
the Greeks might have represented themselves,

20
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,561
nevertheless we see his pain.

21
00:01:15,561 --> 00:01:20,248
We do. In images of death from the Classical period,

22
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:22,431
in the archaic period,

23
00:01:22,431 --> 00:01:26,332
we get sometimes that archaic smile,

24
00:01:26,332 --> 00:01:30,419
or a sense of... I don't want to say peacefulness,

25
00:01:30,419 --> 00:01:33,344
but a lack of expression... a kind of nobility...

26
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:36,409
something that transcendes that moment of death,

27
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:38,499
and something that is eternal

28
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:41,100
and represents perhaps the heroic.

29
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,097
So that's interesting, but that would be the Greeks

30
00:01:43,097 --> 00:01:45,883
representing themselves, but here, because perhaps

31
00:01:45,883 --> 00:01:48,948
we're seeing a kind of a lesser being, not a Greek,

32
00:01:48,948 --> 00:01:52,557
somebody outside the Greek culture, there is a

33
00:01:52,557 --> 00:01:54,939
willingness to represent in a sense that pain, that suffering,

34
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:57,818
and that weakness, but also there is a kind of nobility here.

35
00:01:57,818 --> 00:02:02,973
That interesting emotion was very typical of the Hellenistic period.

36
00:02:02,973 --> 00:02:03,995
So this is a late period.

37
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:07,292
...move away from that classical period of the fifth century, the 400s,

38
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:11,471
of that interesting and ideal figures,

39
00:02:11,471 --> 00:02:15,326
figures that transcend the everyday, turn interest

40
00:02:15,326 --> 00:02:20,620
in figures that are older, figures that display emotion,

41
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,701
figures that are fully human in a way.

42
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:25,496
Yeah, that's right. And this is an extraordinarily

43
00:02:25,496 --> 00:02:28,143
human rendering of something

44
00:02:28,143 --> 00:02:29,490
that is losing his power.

45
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,927
He's fallen, he's been wounded, you see the broken sword,

46
00:02:32,927 --> 00:02:37,013
the wound in his rib cage... and the horns

47
00:02:37,013 --> 00:02:40,426
that have been dropped, perhaps he was a herald as well,

48
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:42,865
or this a heralding.

49
00:02:42,865 --> 00:02:45,558
He's falling, he's about to lose his strength.

50
00:02:45,558 --> 00:02:48,484
We've got have a real certain moment of time here.

51
00:02:48,484 --> 00:02:49,784
A kind of transitional moment...

52
00:02:49,784 --> 00:02:52,246
We feel him falling to the ground.

53
00:02:52,246 --> 00:02:53,639
But even as we feel that, we feel the

54
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,636
original power of that body,

55
00:02:55,636 --> 00:02:58,376
the strength of those arms.

56
00:02:58,376 --> 00:03:01,905
But that's failing.

57
00:03:01,905 --> 00:03:03,298
And it is a really tragic moment.

58
00:03:03,298 --> 00:03:06,828
It is. It's that beautiful athletic body that

59
00:03:06,828 --> 00:03:10,218
is now defeated by imminent death.

60
00:03:10,218 --> 00:03:12,958
That's what makes it so poignant.

61
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,976
There is this real empathy that exists there

62
00:03:15,976 --> 00:03:18,902
and it really is characteristic of that late

63
00:03:18,902 --> 00:03:21,850
Greek... that Hellenistic moment.

64
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:28,337
