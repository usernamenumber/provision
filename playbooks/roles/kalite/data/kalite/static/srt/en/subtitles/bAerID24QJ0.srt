00:00:01,539 --> 00:00:04,377
welcome to level one linear equations

2
00:00:04,377 --> 00:00:06,201
let's start doing some problems

3
00:00:06,201 --> 00:00:12,264
so let's say i had the equation 5 (that's a big fat 5).

4
00:00:12,264 --> 00:00:16,463
5x equals 20

5
00:00:16,463 --> 00:00:18,802
so at first this might look a little unfamiliar to you

6
00:00:18,802 --> 00:00:22,204
but if I rephrase this, you'll realize this is pretty easy problem

7
00:00:22,204 --> 00:00:31,540
all this is is, it's the same thing as saying this is 5 times questionmark

8
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,410
equals 20

9
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,120
and the reason why we notation a little bit

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,456
we write the 5 next to the x

11
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:38,802
because when you write a number right next to a variable you assume that you're multiplying them.

12
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:44,033
so this is saying 5 times x

13
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:45,124
so instead of a questionmark

14
00:00:45,124 --> 00:00:46,409
we're writing an x

15
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:48,203
so five times x is equal to 20

16
00:00:48,203 --> 00:00:51,803
now most of you can do that all in your head

17
00:00:51,803 --> 00:00:53,909
you can say well what number times 5 is equal to 20?

18
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:56,033
well, it equals 4

19
00:00:56,033 --> 00:00:58,957
but we can do it systematically just in case

20
00:00:58,957 --> 00:01:01,282
that 5 is a more complicated number

21
00:01:01,282 --> 00:01:05,905
so let me make my pen a little thinner. ok.

22
00:01:05,905 --> 00:01:06,954
so rewriting it

23
00:01:06,954 --> 00:01:12,619
if I had 5 x equals 20

24
00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:15,404
we could do 2 things and they're essentially the same thing

25
00:01:15,404 --> 00:01:21,201
we could say we just divide both sides of this equation by 5

26
00:01:21,201 --> 00:01:24,623
in which case the left hand side those two fives will cancel out

27
00:01:24,623 --> 00:01:25,622
we'll get x

28
00:01:25,622 --> 00:01:27,124
and then the right hand side

29
00:01:27,124 --> 00:01:28,708
20 divided by 5

30
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:30,407
is 4. And we've solved it.

31
00:01:30,407 --> 00:01:33,366
Another way to do it and this is actually the exact same

32
00:01:33,366 --> 00:01:34,457
way we are just phrasing it a little different

33
00:01:34,457 --> 00:01:37,457
if you said 5 x

34
00:01:37,457 --> 00:01:39,625
equals 20

35
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:42,036
instead of dividing by 5 we could multiply

36
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:45,202
by one fifth

37
00:01:45,202 --> 00:01:47,700
and if you look at that you could realize that

38
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,801
multiplying by one fifth is the same thing

39
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:51,704
as dividing by five

40
00:01:51,704 --> 00:01:54,602
if you know the difference between dividing and multiplying fractions.

41
00:01:54,602 --> 00:01:55,949
and then that gets the same thing

42
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:56,874
one fifth times 5 is 1

43
00:01:56,874 --> 00:01:59,373
so you're left with an x

44
00:01:59,373 --> 00:02:02,037
equals 4

45
00:02:02,037 --> 00:02:05,705
i tend to focus a little bit more on this

46
00:02:05,705 --> 00:02:07,282
because when we start having fractions instead of a five

47
00:02:07,282 --> 00:02:08,867
it's easier to just think about multiplying

48
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:10,408
by the reciprocle

49
00:02:10,408 --> 00:02:14,404
actually let's do one of those right now

50
00:02:14,404 --> 00:02:20,373
so let's say I had negative 3 over 4

51
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:22,957
times x

52
00:02:23,372 --> 00:02:25,456
equals

53
00:02:25,456 --> 00:02:30,203
10 over 13

54
00:02:30,203 --> 00:02:31,309
now this is a harder problem

55
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:32,623
I can't do this one in my head

56
00:02:32,623 --> 00:02:35,036
We're saying negative three fourths

57
00:02:35,036 --> 00:02:37,623
times some number x

58
00:02:37,623 --> 00:02:40,120
is equal to 10 over 13

59
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,122
if someone came to you on the street

60
00:02:41,122 --> 00:02:43,292
and asked you that I think you'd be like me

61
00:02:43,292 --> 00:02:46,209
you'd be pretty .. ah... stumped.

62
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:48,303
but let's work it out algebraically

63
00:02:48,303 --> 00:02:49,707
well, we'll do the same thing

64
00:02:49,707 --> 00:02:53,200
we multiply both sides by the coefficient

65
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,100
on x

66
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,041
So the coefficient, all that is

67
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,117
all that fancy word means

68
00:02:57,117 --> 00:03:00,907
is the number that's being multiplied by x

69
00:03:00,907 --> 00:03:02,702
so what's the coefficient, the reciprocal

70
00:03:02,702 --> 00:03:04,373
of minus three fourths? well,

71
00:03:04,373 --> 00:03:09,540
it's minus 4 over 3

72
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,206
times... and dot is another way to use times....

73
00:03:13,206 --> 00:03:15,116
and you're probably wondering why in algebra

74
00:03:15,116 --> 00:03:18,409
there are all these other conventions for doing times

75
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:20,288
as opposed to just a traditional multiplication sign

76
00:03:20,288 --> 00:03:26,803
and the main reason I think it's just a regular multiplication sign just gets confused with the variable x so they thought

77
00:03:26,803 --> 00:03:28,507
of either using a dot

78
00:03:28,568 --> 00:03:31,693
if you're multiplying two constants

79
00:03:31,832 --> 00:03:35,829
or just writing it next to a variable to imply you're multiplying a variable

80
00:03:35,952 --> 00:03:37,764
so if we multiply the left hand side by negative four thirds

81
00:03:37,764 --> 00:03:38,768
we also have to do the same thing

82
00:03:38,768 --> 00:03:41,022
to the right hand side

83
00:03:41,022 --> 00:03:42,595
minus four thirds

84
00:03:42,595 --> 00:03:45,006
the left hand side the minus four thirds and three fourths,

85
00:03:45,006 --> 00:03:46,502
they cancel out

86
00:03:46,502 --> 00:03:47,866
you could work it out on your own to see that they do

87
00:03:47,866 --> 00:03:50,125
they equal one so we're just left with x

88
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,874
x is equal to

89
00:03:52,874 --> 00:03:54,708
10 times minus 4

90
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,803
is minus 40

91
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,625
13 times 3

92
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:00,904
well that's equal to 39

93
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,659
so you get x is equal to minus 40 over 39

94
00:04:04,906 --> 00:04:11,302
and I like to leave my fractions improper cause it's easier to deal with them

95
00:04:11,302 --> 00:04:16,311
but you could also... if you wanted to write that as a mixed number

96
00:04:16,311 --> 00:04:19,800
minus 1 and one thirthyninth

97
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,206
i tend to keep it like this though

98
00:04:22,206 --> 00:04:24,204
let's check to make sure that's right

99
00:04:24,204 --> 00:04:27,285
the cool thing about algebra is you can always get your answer and put it back into the orgiginal equation

100
00:04:27,285 --> 00:04:29,540
to make sure you're right

101
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,043
so the original equation was

102
00:04:31,043 --> 00:04:35,209
minus three fourths times x

103
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:39,456
and here we'll substitute the x back into the equation

104
00:04:39,456 --> 00:04:43,121
where we saw x we'll now put our answer

105
00:04:43,121 --> 00:04:46,836
so it's minus 40 over 39

106
00:04:47,128 --> 00:04:53,000
and our original equation said that that equals to 10 over 13

107
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,534
well. and once again when I just write the three fourths times right next to the parenthesis like that

108
00:04:57,534 --> 00:05:00,041
that's another way of writing times

109
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,003
so

110
00:05:02,003 --> 00:05:05,039
minus 3 times minus 40

111
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:11,007
is minus 100 ... actually we could do something a little simpler

112
00:05:11,007 --> 00:05:16,210
this 4 becomes a 1 and this becomes a 10

113
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:21,802
and if you remember how when you're multiplying fractions you can simplify it like that

114
00:05:21,802 --> 00:05:30,706
so it actually becomes plus 30 (because we have a minus times a minus is plus) and 3 times 10

115
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:31,541
over

116
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:34,507
the 4 is now a 1 so all is left is 39

117
00:05:34,507 --> 00:05:36,304
and 30 over 39

118
00:05:36,304 --> 00:05:37,700
if we divide the top and the bottom

119
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,622
by 3

120
00:05:39,622 --> 00:05:41,626
we get 10 over 13

121
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,901
which is the same thing

122
00:05:43,901 --> 00:05:46,636
which the equation said it would be

123
00:05:46,636 --> 00:05:50,008
so we know that we got the right answer

124
00:05:50,008 --> 00:05:52,373
let's do one more problem

125
00:05:53,234 --> 00:05:59,599
minus 5 sixths

126
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:00,618
x

127
00:06:00,618 --> 00:06:01,701
is equal to

128
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:03,005
7 eights

129
00:06:03,005 --> 00:06:03,908
and if you wanna try this problem yourself

130
00:06:03,908 --> 00:06:05,705
now is a good time to pause

131
00:06:05,705 --> 00:06:08,000
And I'm gonna start doing the problem right now

132
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,209
So, same thing

133
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:12,368
What's the reciprocal of minus 5 sixths?

134
00:06:12,368 --> 00:06:15,705
Well, it's minus 6 over 5

135
00:06:15,705 --> 00:06:17,351
We multiply that

136
00:06:17,351 --> 00:06:18,620
If we do it on the left hand side

137
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,706
we have to do it on the right hand side as well

138
00:06:21,706 --> 00:06:23,617
minus 6 over 5

139
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,876
the left hand side the minus 6 over 5

140
00:06:25,876 --> 00:06:27,802
and minus 5 sixths cancel out

141
00:06:27,802 --> 00:06:30,118
we're just left with x

142
00:06:30,118 --> 00:06:32,627
and the right hand side

143
00:06:32,627 --> 00:06:33,826
we have

144
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:38,455
well we can divide both 6 and the 8 by 2

145
00:06:38,455 --> 00:06:40,711
so that makes negative 3

146
00:06:40,711 --> 00:06:43,002
and this becomes 4

147
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:47,541
7 times negative 3 is minus 21

148
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,404
over 20

149
00:06:50,404 --> 00:06:52,702
and assuming I haven't made any careless mistakes

150
00:06:52,702 --> 00:06:54,207
that should be right

151
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,712
actually let's just check that real fast

152
00:06:55,712 --> 00:06:57,803
so minus 5 sixths

153
00:06:57,803 --> 00:07:00,620
times minus 21 over 20

154
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,302
well

155
00:07:03,302 --> 00:07:04,802
that equals

156
00:07:04,802 --> 00:07:07,374
we could make this 5 a 1 and turn this into a 4

157
00:07:07,374 --> 00:07:10,802
make this into a 2

158
00:07:10,802 --> 00:07:12,802
make this into a 7

159
00:07:12,802 --> 00:07:15,008
negative times negative is positive

160
00:07:15,008 --> 00:07:16,120
so 7

161
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,118
2 times 4 is 8!

162
00:07:18,118 --> 00:07:19,903
and that's what we said we would get

163
00:07:19,903 --> 00:07:21,302
so we got it right

164
00:07:21,302 --> 00:07:23,040
I think you're ready at this point

165
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,002
to try some level 1 equations

166
00:07:25,002 --> 00:07:27,400
Have fun!
