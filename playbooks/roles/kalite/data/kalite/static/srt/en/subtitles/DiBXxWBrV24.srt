1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
   

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,240
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,200
When I left off, I was hurrying
a little bit.

4
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,510
But we'd hopefully come to the
conclusion that if I have a

5
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,780
simple lever, like I have here,
and I know the distances

6
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,280
from where I'm applying
the force, to the

7
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,360
fulcrum, to the pivot.

8
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,379
And I know the distance from the
pivot to where the machine

9
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,745
is essentially applying the
force, the machine being the

10
00:00:18,745 --> 00:00:21,710
lever in this situation, I know
the relationship between

11
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,380
the two forces I'm applying.

12
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,005
The input force-- so actually I
shouldn't call this a force

13
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:28,010
too, I should call this an
input force-- anyway, the

14
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,010
input force times the distance
from the input force to the

15
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:36,980
fulcrum is equal to the output
force times the distance from

16
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,010
the output force
to the fulcrum.

17
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,860
And that all fell out of what
we did in the last video.

18
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,280
The conservation of energy and
that the work in has to equal

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:45,850
the work out.

20
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,590
And all work is, is a transfer
of energy, so the transfer of

21
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,980
energy in has to be the transfer
of energy out,

22
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,050
assuming we have no friction
and none of the energy is

23
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:53,690
lost.

24
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,520
And how is this useful?

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,050
Well we could do a bunch
of problems with this.

26
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:07,930
Let's say that I have
a 100 newton object

27
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,820
right here, 100 newtons.

28
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,810
And let's say that I know, no
matter what I do, my maximum

29
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,060
strength that I could push--
well let me draw this a little

30
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,740
different-- let's say it's like
this, cause of my goal is

31
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,870
to lift the 100 newton object.

32
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,050
So the 100 newton object
is right here.

33
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,150
That's a 100 newtons.

34
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,180
And let's say I know that the
maximum downward force that

35
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,530
I'm capable of applying is
only 10 newtons, right?

36
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,940
So I want my force to
be multiplied by 10

37
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,380
to lift this force.

38
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,510
So let's figure out
what would happen.

39
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,830
My input force is 10.

40
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:42,530
And I want to figure
out the distance.

41
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,530
So let's say my input
force is 10.

42
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,220
And let's call this the
input distance.

43
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,920
And I want the output force
to be 100, right?

44
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,290
And let's call this the
output distance.

45
00:01:54,290 --> 00:02:00,540
So if I have a fulcrum here,
this is the input distance and

46
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,770
this is the output distance.

47
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,340
Let me switch colors.

48
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,530
This is getting monotonous.

49
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,670
This is the output distance,
from here to here.

50
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,680
And let's figure out what the
ratio has to be, for the ratio

51
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,970
of the input distance to
the output distance.

52
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,400
Well, if we just divide both
sides by 10, we get the

53
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,910
distance input.

54
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,610
It has to be 10 times the
distance output, right?

55
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,680
100 divided by 10.

56
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,030
So if the distance from the
fulcrum to the weight is, I

57
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,980
don't know, 5 meters, then the
distance from where I'm

58
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,920
applying the force to
the fulcrum has

59
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,750
to be 10 times that.

60
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,060
It has to be 50 meters.

61
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,390
So no matter what, the ratio of
this length to this length

62
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,350
has to be 10.

63
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,090
And now what would happen?

64
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,210
If I design this machine this
way, I will be able to apply

65
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,790
10 newtons here, which is my
maximum strength, 10 newtons

66
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,570
downwards, and I will lift
a 100 newton object.

67
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,960
And now what's the
trade off though?

68
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,560
Nothing just pops
out of thin air.

69
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,245
The trade off is, is that I am
going to have to push down for

70
00:02:56,245 --> 00:02:59,300
a much longer distance, for
actually 10 times the distance

71
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,360
as this object is going
to move up.

72
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,210
And once again I know that
because the work in has to

73
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,000
equal the work out.

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,200
I can't through some magical
machine-- and if you were able

75
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,330
to invent one, you shouldn't
watch this video and you

76
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,840
should go build it and become a
trillionaire-- but a machine

77
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,020
can never generate work
out of thin air.

78
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,660
Or it can never generate
energy out of thin air.

79
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,600
That energy has to come
from some place.

80
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,970
Most machines actually you lose
energy to friction or

81
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,660
whatever else.

82
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,080
But in this situation, if I'm
putting in 10 newtons of force

83
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,660
times some distance, whatever
that quantity is of work, the

84
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,900
work cannot change.

85
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,490
The total work.

86
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:38,910
It can go down if there is some
friction in the system.

87
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,470
So let's do another problem.

88
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:45,160
   

89
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,480
And really they're all kind
of the same formula.

90
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:55,670
And then I'll move into a few
other types of simple systems.

91
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:59,130
I should use the line tool.

92
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:03,060
We'll make this up on the fly.

93
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,180
And you could always create
problems where you can

94
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,800
compound it further and et
cetera, et cetera, using some

95
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,870
of the other concepts
we've learned.

96
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,600
But I won't worry about
that right now.

97
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:16,680
   

98
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:24,630
So let's say that I'm going
to push up here.

99
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,830
Well no let me see what
I want to do.

100
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:35,380
I want to push down here with
a force of-- let's say that

101
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:44,000
this distance right here is 35
meters, this distance is 5

102
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,550
meters-- and let's say I'm going
to push down with the

103
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,730
force of 7 newtons, and what
I want to figure out is how

104
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:52,190
heavy of an object
can I lift here.

105
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,840
How heavy of an object.

106
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,560
Well, all we have to do is
use the same formula.

107
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,240
But the moments-- and I know I
used that word once before, so

108
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,670
you might not know what it is--
but the moments on both

109
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,980
sides of the fulcrum have
to be the same.

110
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,460
Or the input moment has to
be the output moment.

111
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,730
So what's the moment again?

112
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,560
Well, the moment is just the
force times the distance from

113
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,680
the force to the fulcrum.

114
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:19,360
So the input moment is 7 newtons
times 35 meters.

115
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,915
And realize that that does not
work, because the distance

116
00:05:21,915 --> 00:05:24,740
this force is traveling
is not 35 meters.

117
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,240
The distance this force
is traveling is

118
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,470
something like, here.

119
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,320
But this 35 meters is going
to be proportional to the

120
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,490
distance that this is traveling
when you compare it

121
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,910
to this other side.

122
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,950
So this quantity, 7
newtons times 35

123
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,390
meters, is the moment.

124
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,990
And that is going to be equal
to the moment on this side,

125
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,500
the output moment.

126
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,780
So that is equal to 5 meters
times the force that I'm

127
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,405
lifting, or the lifting force
of the machine, times let's

128
00:05:51,405 --> 00:05:53,380
say the force out.

129
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,230
So we can figure out the force
out by just dividing both

130
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,280
sides by 5.

131
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,310
So let's see, 35 divided by 5
is 7, so you get 7 times 7

132
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:07,720
equals the force out,
or 49 newtons.

133
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,280
And you can see that, because
you can see that the length of

134
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,320
this side of the lever is 7
times the length of this side

135
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,710
of the lever.

136
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:18,830
So when you input a force of
7, you output a force of 7

137
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,650
times that.

138
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:23,820
And of course, in order to move
the block 1 meter up in

139
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,760
this direction, you're
going to have to

140
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,210
push down for 7 meters.

141
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:31,450
And that's where we know that
the input work is equal to the

142
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,580
output work.

143
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,920
Well anyway hopefully I didn't
confuse you and you have a

144
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,470
reasonable sense of
how levers work.

145
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:41,050
In the next couple of videos,
I'll introduce you to other

146
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,680
machines, simple machines like
a wedge-- I've always had

147
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,140
trouble calling a wedge
a machine, but it

148
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,040
is one-- and pulleys.

149
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,290
I'll see you in the next video.

150
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,400
