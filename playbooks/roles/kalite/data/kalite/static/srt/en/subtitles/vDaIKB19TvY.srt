1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,280
We now hopefully know a little about variables

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,436
and as we covered in the last video, a variable can be

3
00:00:05,436 --> 00:00:08,834
really any symbol, although we typically use letters

4
00:00:08,834 --> 00:00:11,510
because we're used to writing and typing letters.

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:17,193
But it can be anything from an x, to a y, a z, an a, a b,

6
00:00:17,193 --> 00:00:20,833
and oftentimes we start using greek letters like theta.

7
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:22,826
But you can really use any symbol to say

8
00:00:22,826 --> 00:00:24,090
Hey, this is going to vary

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,300
You can take on multiple values

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,767
But out of all of all of these

11
00:00:27,767 --> 00:00:29,759
The one that is most typically used in algebra

12
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:31,754
Or really in all of mathematics

13
00:00:31,754 --> 00:00:33,703
is the variable "x"

14
00:00:33,703 --> 00:00:36,471
Although all of these are used to some degree

15
00:00:36,471 --> 00:00:39,168
But given that x is used so heavily

16
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:42,757
it does introduce a slight problem.

17
00:00:42,757 --> 00:00:46,247
And that problem is that it looks a lot like the multiplication symbol

18
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:48,501
Or the one that we use in arithmetic

19
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:49,924
So in arithmetic

20
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,209
if I want to write 2 x 3

21
00:00:51,209 --> 00:00:53,635
I literally write "2 x 3"

22
00:00:53,635 --> 00:00:55,481
But now that we are starting to use variables,

23
00:00:55,481 --> 00:00:57,489
if I want to write "2 times x"

24
00:00:57,489 --> 00:00:59,916
Well if I use this as the multiplication symbol

25
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:01,533
it would be 2 times x

26
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,491
And the times symbol and the X

27
00:01:03,598 --> 00:01:05,593
look awfully similar

28
00:01:05,593 --> 00:01:08,747
and if I'm not really careful with my penmanship

29
00:01:08,747 --> 00:01:10,248
it can get very confusing.

30
00:01:10,248 --> 00:01:11,348
Is this "Two x x"?

31
00:01:11,348 --> 00:01:13,301
Is this "two times times something"?

32
00:01:13,301 --> 00:01:15,689
What exactly is going on here?

33
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:18,023
And because this is confusing,

34
00:01:18,023 --> 00:01:21,729
This, right over here, is extremely confusing

35
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:23,967
And it can be misinterpreted,

36
00:01:23,967 --> 00:01:28,636
We tend not to use this multiplication symbol

37
00:01:28,636 --> 00:01:31,101
When we are doing algebra

38
00:01:31,101 --> 00:01:33,683
Instead of that, to represent multiplication,

39
00:01:33,683 --> 00:01:35,971
We have several options.

40
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:38,692
Instead of writing two times x this way,

41
00:01:38,692 --> 00:01:45,831
we could write 2 dot x.

42
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:48,434
And this dot, I want to be very clear,

43
00:01:48,434 --> 00:01:50,683
This is not a decimal

44
00:01:50,683 --> 00:01:52,903
This is just written a little bit higher

45
00:01:52,903 --> 00:01:54,911
And we write this so we don't get confusion

46
00:01:54,911 --> 00:01:57,700
in between this and one of these variables right here.

47
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,324
But this can really be interpreted as "2 times x"

48
00:02:00,324 --> 00:02:02,748
So for example, if someone says

49
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:06,995
2 dot x, when x is equal to 3,

50
00:02:06,995 --> 00:02:09,762
well this would be the same thing

51
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:12,409
as two times three, when x is equal to three.

52
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:13,825
Another way you could write it is

53
00:02:13,825 --> 00:02:16,574
You could write "2" and then you could write the x in parentheses

54
00:02:16,574 --> 00:02:18,494
right next to it.

55
00:02:18,494 --> 00:02:22,221
This is also interpreted as 2 times x

56
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:23,285
Once again, so in this situation

57
00:02:23,285 --> 00:02:24,504
If "x" were seven, this would be

58
00:02:24,504 --> 00:02:27,294
two times seven, or fourteen

59
00:02:27,294 --> 00:02:29,671
And the most traditional way of doing it

60
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:32,302
is to just write the x right after the 2.

61
00:02:32,302 --> 00:02:35,669
And sometimes this will be read as "2x"

62
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:39,568
But this literally does mean "Two times x"

63
00:02:39,568 --> 00:02:41,633
And so wait a minute, how come we didn't always do that?

64
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:44,247
Well it would be literally confusing if we did it over here.

65
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,501
Instead of writing "2 times 3"

66
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:48,272
And wrote "2 3"

67
00:02:48,272 --> 00:02:49,894
Well, that looks like "23".

68
00:02:49,894 --> 00:02:51,253
This doesn't look like two times three

69
00:02:51,253 --> 00:02:52,633
And this is why we never did it.

70
00:02:52,633 --> 00:02:54,365
But here, since we're using a letter now,

71
00:02:54,365 --> 00:02:57,579
It's clear that this isn't a part of that number.

72
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:59,354
This isn't "twenty something"

73
00:02:59,354 --> 00:03:02,838
This is two times this variable x.

74
00:03:02,838 --> 00:03:05,900
So all of these are really the same expression.

75
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,070
Two times x, two times x, and two times x.

76
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,163
And so with that out of the way

77
00:03:10,163 --> 00:03:13,554
Let's try some few worked examples, a few practice problems

78
00:03:13,554 --> 00:03:14,895
And this will hopefully prepare you for the

79
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:16,215
next exercise

80
00:03:16,215 --> 00:03:18,034
Where you'll get a lot of chances to practice this.

81
00:03:18,034 --> 00:03:24,702
So if I where to say "what is 10 minus three y"

82
00:03:24,702 --> 00:03:29,636
And what does this equal when "y" is equal to two

83
00:03:29,636 --> 00:03:31,821
Well, every time you see the "y"

84
00:03:31,821 --> 00:03:32,833
You'd want that 2 there

85
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:35,636
So this is y is equal to 2.

86
00:03:35,636 --> 00:03:37,298
Let's set that y equal to two

87
00:03:37,298 --> 00:03:41,368
This is the same thing as 10 minus three times two

88
00:03:41,368 --> 00:03:43,503
You do the multiplication first.

89
00:03:43,503 --> 00:03:46,369
Multiplication takes precedence in order of operations

90
00:03:46,369 --> 00:03:48,829
So three times two is six,

91
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:53,215
Ten minus six is equal to four.

92
00:03:53,215 --> 00:03:54,414
Let's do another one.

93
00:03:54,414 --> 00:04:08,073
Let's say we had "7x minus 4"

94
00:04:08,073 --> 00:04:14,970
And we want to evaluate that when

95
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:19,861
when x is equal to three.

96
00:04:19,861 --> 00:04:22,169
Where we see the x, we want to put the 3 there

97
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:29,221
So this is the same thing as "7 times 3"

98
00:04:29,221 --> 00:04:34,168
And I'll actually use this notation, so seven times three minus four.

99
00:04:34,168 --> 00:04:37,250
And once again, multiplication takes precedence

100
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,104
by order of operations, over addition or subtracition

101
00:04:40,104 --> 00:04:41,701
So we want to do the multiplying first

102
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:43,970
7 times 3 is 21

103
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:48,233
21 minus 4 is equal to 17.

104
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:50,263
So hopefully that gives you a little bit of background,

105
00:04:50,263 --> 00:04:52,763
and I really encourage you to try the next exercise,

106
00:04:52,763 --> 00:04:54,367
It will give you a lot of practice

107
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:56,357
on being to evaluate expressions like this.
