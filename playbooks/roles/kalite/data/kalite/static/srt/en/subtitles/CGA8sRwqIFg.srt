1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,650
   

2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,189
Everything we've been dealing
with so far has just been with

3
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:07,109
the individual atoms,
but atoms bond.

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,769
Or another way of saying it
is, they stick together.

5
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:13,129
Because if atoms didn't stick
together, then we'd all be

6
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,730
essentially just a collection
of atoms and this video

7
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,359
wouldn't be being produced.

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,960
So atoms stick together and
they form molecules.

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,539
You take a bunch of
atoms together and

10
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:22,369
they'll stick together.

11
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,580
And they'll form molecules.

12
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:26,729
And then obviously molecules
start building up and you get

13
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,679
other structures.

14
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,769
And if we started talking about
organic chemistry, you'd

15
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:34,530
have a bunch of atoms, a lot of
carbons and hydrogens and

16
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,100
other things, fitting
together and

17
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,840
they'd be forming proteins.

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,600
And then proteins would fit
together to form organic

19
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,160
structures.

20
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:42,579
And you fit enough of those
together, and you'll

21
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:45,460
eventually get someone recording
a YouTube video.

22
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,969
So this is where
it all starts.

23
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:49,789
Atoms bond.

24
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:50,969
Or they stick together.

25
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:53,570
And the purpose of this video
is to think about the

26
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,939
different types of ways
that an atom can

27
00:00:55,939 --> 00:00:57,769
stick to another atom.

28
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,720
So the first, and kind of the
most powerful way-- or I think

29
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,519
of it as the most powerful way--
is if you take an atom

30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:11,850
that really wants to give an
electron, and then you have

31
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:14,804
another atom that really wants
to take an electron.

32
00:01:14,805 --> 00:01:18,720
   

33
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:18,920
Right?

34
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,420
And we've talked about
this before.

35
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,950
An atom that wants to give an
electron wants to give it

36
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,365
because it's trying to get into
a stable configuration in

37
00:01:27,364 --> 00:01:28,609
its outer shell.

38
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:30,909
Everyone wants to look
like a noble gas.

39
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:33,049
They're all envious of the noble
gases, because the noble

40
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:36,280
gases have eight electrons
in their outer shell.

41
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,049
So who wants to give?

42
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:40,489
Well if you look at the period
table, the people who want to

43
00:01:40,489 --> 00:01:43,989
give really badly-- and we've
talked about this a good bit--

44
00:01:43,989 --> 00:01:45,479
are the alkali metals.

45
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:50,439
These guys just really want
to offload an electron.

46
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:51,870
And there are other people
who want to give them.

47
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,260
But let's take the
extreme example.

48
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,370
So these guys really want
to offload an electron.

49
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,710
And who wants to take
an electron?

50
00:01:57,709 --> 00:01:58,659
Well, the halogens.

51
00:01:58,659 --> 00:01:59,429
We've talked about it.

52
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,110
These guys love taking
electrons.

53
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:02,230
They're not the only ones.

54
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:09,020
But they have a very high
electronegativity.

55
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,130
They really want to
take electrons.

56
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:14,310
So if you put these around
each other, what happens?

57
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:19,129
Let's say, sodium
and chlorine.

58
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:23,000
And let's say we wanted to
flavor some of our food.

59
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,129
So you have some sodium and
you have some chlorine.

60
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:31,659
So sodium-- let me draw its
valence shell-- sodium's

61
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:33,650
valence shell looks like this.

62
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,980
It's got one electron sitting
there that it would really

63
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:37,639
just like to get rid of.

64
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:39,469
And then chlorine
looks like this.

65
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:42,210
   

66
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,890
It has seven valence
electrons.

67
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:48,549
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

68
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,330
So what happens is this
guy wants to escape.

69
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,550
This little blue electron right
here really wants to

70
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,160
escape the sodium
and essentially

71
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,210
move into the chlorine.

72
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,930
And obviously, it's not
like a one-for-one.

73
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,879
You'd have billions and
trillions of these atoms

74
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,819
rolling around, and these
electrons jump off, then they

75
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:04,389
go to one, then they
jump to another.

76
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:06,709
But for the sake of our
purposes, let's say we just

77
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:11,080
have these two atoms. And what
you have is that that

78
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,630
electron jumps off.

79
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:14,069
And then if that electron
jumps off,

80
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,439
what happens to sodium?

81
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,159
Well then the sodium
has no electrons

82
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,659
in its valence shell.

83
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:20,490
Although it does.

84
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,110
Now its valence shell is one
lower, but we can say it's

85
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,140
lost that one electron
that was out there.

86
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:27,769
And now its atomic configuration
will

87
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,490
look a lot like neon.

88
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:29,810
Right?

89
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,949
Sodium, you lose an electron,
now it looks a lot like neon,

90
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:34,879
at least its electron
configuration.

91
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,859
But now it has one fewer
electrons than protons.

92
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,110
So now, it has a positive
charge.

93
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,500
It was neutral back here.

94
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:42,759
Right?

95
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,899
Now it's positive.

96
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,439
And now, what does a
chlorine look like?

97
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:48,939
And I'm kind of mixing up
notations, but that's really

98
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:49,919
just to give you the idea.

99
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,979
So chlorine before had
seven electrons.

100
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:57,869
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

101
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,710
That electron had jumped
onto the chlorine.

102
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,010
So now it's happy.

103
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:04,625
It looks a lot like argon now.

104
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:08,930
It has a completely filled
valence shell.

105
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,510
And what's the charge now?

106
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:11,729
Well in has one more.

107
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:15,289
Now it will have 18 electrons
instead of 17.

108
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:16,028
Right?

109
00:04:16,028 --> 00:04:18,050
So what is its charge now?

110
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,660
It has 17 protons,
18 electrons.

111
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,040
It has a negative one charge.

112
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,220
So I'll just put a negative
up there.

113
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,950
It has a negative charge now
because it got that electron

114
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:29,170
from sodium.

115
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,640
So now these guys are both
happy from an electron

116
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:32,839
configuration point of view.

117
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:36,089
They both have these stable
valence shells.

118
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:38,169
But they're attracted to
each other, right?

119
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,220
Coulomb forces.

120
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,450
Positive is attracted to
negative, negative is

121
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:42,579
attracted to positive.

122
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:45,620
And it can be very strong, this
electrostatic force, so

123
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,170
they stick to each other.

124
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,250
And so this force
of attraction,

125
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,720
this is an ionic bond.

126
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,690
So they essentially
will form NaCl.

127
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:58,149
   

128
00:04:58,149 --> 00:04:59,739
They're not sharing electrons.

129
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,009
This guy wanted the electrons so
badly, and this guy wanted

130
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:04,519
to give them away so badly, he
just handed the electron over.

131
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:06,279
But then he says, oh, by the
way, now that I handed you the

132
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,739
electron, you're negative,
I'm positive.

133
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,079
I want to stick to you.

134
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:11,959
And then we formed table
salt and we're ready

135
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:14,759
to season our food.

136
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:17,120
Now that's the situation where
one guy really wants to

137
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,579
offload an electron, one guy
really wants to take it.

138
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:25,680
What happens in the situation
where they're both not as

139
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,689
extreme in their views in
whether or not they want to

140
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:31,550
give or take electrons?

141
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,870
So let's think of a few
other examples.

142
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,959
The best example is
elemental oxygen.

143
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:37,359
Right?

144
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,290
Let's see, elemental oxygen.

145
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:42,390
So this right here
is an ionic bond.

146
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:44,560
Not to jump back and forth,
but I'm not sure if I just

147
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,329
mentioned that.

148
00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:47,159
Why is it called
an ionic bond?

149
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,410
Because we formed ions.

150
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,530
When we donated the electron
from sodium to chlorine, we

151
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:52,539
formed an ion.

152
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:57,700
The sodium, this became a
cation, because it's positive.

153
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:01,979
And this became an anion,
because it's negative.

154
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,310
And then they stuck
to each other, so

155
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:06,689
this is an ionic bond.

156
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:07,759
Fair enough.

157
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,110
Now what happens, like I was
just starting to say, if we

158
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,949
have two elements that aren't
that different in how much

159
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:15,310
they want electrons.

160
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,560
Their electronegativity
is very similar.

161
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,079
And the best example
of that is we had

162
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:19,894
two of the same element.

163
00:06:19,894 --> 00:06:21,819
So let's say I had oxygen.

164
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:24,050
Let's have one oxygen there.

165
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,939
Let's look at the periodic table
to make sure that we're

166
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:29,389
not-- oxygen has six valence
electrons, right?

167
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:34,899
One, two, three, four, five,
six valence electrons.

168
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:35,129
Right?

169
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:36,379
It's 2s2, 2p4.

170
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:39,089
   

171
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:42,379
So on the second shell
it has six electrons.

172
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:47,509
So oxygen has one, two, three,
four, five, six.

173
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:49,500
And then let's say we
have another oxygen.

174
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:55,920
It has one, two, three, four,
five, six electrons.

175
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,780
Now both of these oxygen
atoms would love

176
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:00,639
to have eight electrons.

177
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,500
They'd be stable.

178
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,129
They could start pretending
like they're a noble gas.

179
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:06,409
But clearly, they don't
have eight electrons.

180
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,910
And let's say in this, all they
have around each other is

181
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:11,180
other oxygen atoms. So what
they can do is say, this

182
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,240
oxygen goes to that oxygen, and
says, hey, why don't we

183
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,819
share some electrons and then
we can both pretend that we

184
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:18,649
have eight electrons.

185
00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:20,620
And this guy says,
oh, sure enough.

186
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,689
So we can just bring
him over here.

187
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:26,379
And I'll just write
him in blue.

188
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,899
Oxygen doesn't necessarily
have to change colors.

189
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:31,399
I'm joking.

190
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,729
So I'm just going to draw this
guy over on this side just so

191
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:38,009
you recognize that this is
different than this guy.

192
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:40,490
And then they share
these electrons.

193
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,680
So they share these electrons.

194
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,290
And we could do it by
drawing a line here.

195
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:50,360
So they're sharing two
pairs of electrons.

196
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,360
So this guy right here, he had
six electrons, but he can kind

197
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,550
of pretend that he has this
electron and that electron.

198
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,420
So he has eight in his
valence shell.

199
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,050
And this guy, he's going
to do the same thing.

200
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:04,420
He has one, two, three, four,
five, six, but he also can

201
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,319
kind of pretend that
these guys are also

202
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,329
in his valence shell.

203
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:08,539
So he's happy.

204
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,480
And this notion, where you're
actually sharing electrons,

205
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,410
where these electrons are going
to go and both electron

206
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:18,740
probability distribution clouds
of both atoms. This is

207
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,280
called a covalent bond.

208
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:23,939
   

209
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:26,060
And this is typical when
you're dealing with two

210
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:31,300
elements that aren't very
different in terms of their

211
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:36,940
electronegativity or their
desire to attract electrons.

212
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:42,250
Now, when we talked about
ionization energy, I think, we

213
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:47,059
talked about when oxygen
and water bond, right?

214
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:51,189
And oxygen-- oxygen, we've
drawn that-- is six.

215
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,620
Not oxygen.

216
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:51,879
Water.

217
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,980
Oxygen and hydrogen to form
water, and hydrogen looks

218
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,480
something like this.

219
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:55,659
Right?

220
00:08:55,659 --> 00:08:56,850
You have a hydrogen
atom there.

221
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,409
You have a hydrogen
atom there.

222
00:08:58,409 --> 00:08:59,689
They said, hey, why don't
we get together.

223
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,680
Let's share some atoms. And the
hydrogen atoms say, oh,

224
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:05,089
OK, let's share some atoms.
Let me rewrite this oxygen

225
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,899
like this, so it becomes clear
that we're sharing.

226
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:11,860
So if I rewrite this
oxygen like this.

227
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,550
I essentially split up
one of these pairs.

228
00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:19,069
And these hydrogens come along
and they share one hydrogen

229
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,690
there, one hydrogen there.

230
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:23,780
This guy can pretend like he
has his first shell filled,

231
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:25,529
because you can only
put two there.

232
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:26,919
That's where the eight
rule breaks down

233
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:28,029
in the first shell.

234
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:29,069
This guy can pretend, too.

235
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,830
And now oxygen can pretend like
he's got eight electrons

236
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,889
in his valence shell.

237
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:35,879
And everyone's happy.

238
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,980
So this is also a
covalent bond.

239
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,289
Another way we could have
written this, and I think I

240
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:44,639
did this in the last
video, I could have

241
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:45,809
written it like this.

242
00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:48,199
Where the implication of this
line, each of these lines

243
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,480
involve two electrons.

244
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,120
These are equivalent
statements.

245
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,419
But in this situation,
oxygen is more

246
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:55,429
electronegative than hydrogen.

247
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:59,879
It wants to get the electrons
more than hydrogen.

248
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,529
So in this situation, the
electrons are going to spend

249
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:04,909
more time around oxygen than
they will around hydrogen.

250
00:10:04,909 --> 00:10:08,600
So hydrogen will experience, I
guess you could call it, a

251
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,180
partial positive charge on this
side of the molecule,

252
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:14,449
while the oxygen side will
experience a partial negative.

253
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,730
I'm going to draw it
real small, because

254
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,259
it's a partial negative.

255
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:19,429
This is called a polar
covalent bond.

256
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:22,739
   

257
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,570
Because it's still covalent.

258
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,670
We're sharing electrons.

259
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:29,500
But it's polar, because the
electrons are getting pulled

260
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,090
to spend most of their time
at one side of the atom.

261
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,440
And since that is the case, the
molecule as a whole, the

262
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,090
collection of atoms, is going
to have polarity.

263
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:41,170
One side of the molecule is
going to be more negative than

264
00:10:41,169 --> 00:10:43,149
the other side, which will be
more positive because the

265
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:46,500
electrons are spending more
time on that side.

266
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,690
Now the last bond we can talk
about, and I've touched on

267
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,500
this a little bit, is
the metallic bond.

268
00:10:51,500 --> 00:11:01,149
   

269
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:04,779
I was in a metallic bond in
high school, but anyway,

270
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:06,480
that's a subject for
another video.

271
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,360
But with metals, you can't
really draw the electron

272
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:11,930
structure there.

273
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:14,649
But what happens with, let's
say we have iron, right?

274
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:17,819
And you have just a bunch
of neutral iron

275
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,629
atoms sitting around.

276
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:22,399
And we established the one
commonality of metals, what

277
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,639
makes something metallic or have
metallic characteristics

278
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:28,039
is that they have a bunch of
electrons in their outer

279
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:30,240
orbital that they're
very giving.

280
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,750
They're very happy to share.

281
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:36,059
So if you put a bunch of these
guys together, what happens is

282
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:37,309
they share their electrons.

283
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:38,559
So they all become positive.

284
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:43,849
   

285
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,230
They're very communal
this way.

286
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:48,629
   

287
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:51,409
The metallic atoms. And then
their electrons kind of just

288
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:53,370
form this sea out here.

289
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,960
But they all share.

290
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,509
E minus.

291
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:57,189
E minus.

292
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,340
E minus.

293
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,519
E minus.

294
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,539
And because their electrons are
all on the sea and they've

295
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:07,899
kind of gotten this positive
charge, they're attracted to

296
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:09,179
the sea that they've created.

297
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:12,739
They're attracted to their
shared electron pool that all

298
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,639
of the atoms have donated to.

299
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,100
And this is essentially what
allows, well definitely,

300
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,620
metals to be conductive, because
you have this pool of

301
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,919
electrons that are very
easy to move around.

302
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:25,709
And also it's what makes
them malleable.

303
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,509
Because even if you
have visually--

304
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:28,379
it's a little intuitive.

305
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:29,340
There's nothing exact here.

306
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,960
But you can kind
of move these.

307
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,019
You can imagine that this is
kind of a big pudding of

308
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:35,370
electrons or big glue
of electrons.

309
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:39,409
And you can move, you can bend
the rod or flatten the rod

310
00:12:39,409 --> 00:12:41,189
without having it break
or get brittle.

311
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:46,030
While if you're talking about
salts that have a very strong

312
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:51,659
but rigid bond, if you were to
try to bend a bar of salt, the

313
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:53,719
bond will just be broken.

314
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,050
There's no, kind of, squishy
electron mush that you can

315
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:59,419
kind of bend around
and play with.

316
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:01,019
Anyway, so those are
the three bonds.

317
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:02,429
And hopefully that gives
you a little intuition.

318
00:13:02,429 --> 00:13:04,109
And this is super useful,
because in the rest of

319
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:07,409
chemistry, everything we do will
essentially involve some

320
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:10,139
combination of these bonds.

321
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:12,659
And we'll start talking about
what these bonds mean in terms

322
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:17,069
of the temperature at which they
boil, or the properties

323
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,879
of the molecules themselves.

324
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:20,129
Anyway, see you in
the next video.

325
00:13:20,129 --> 00:13:21,379
