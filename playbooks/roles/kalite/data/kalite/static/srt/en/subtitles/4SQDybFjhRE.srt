1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,490
What I want to do now is figure out what's the minimum speed

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,480
that the car has to be at the top of this loop de loop in order to

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,750
stay on the track, in order stay in a circular motion, in order to not fall down like this

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,790
I think we can all appreciate that that is the most difficult part of the loop de loop

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,110
At least at the bottom half right over here

6
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:27,890
the track itself is actually providing the centripetal force to keep it going in a circle

7
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,360
But when you get to the top

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,160
you now have gravity that is pulling down on the car almost completely

9
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:42,980
and the car will have to maintain some minimum speed in order to stay in its circular path

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,250
Let's figure out what that minimum speed is

11
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,540
To help figure that out, we have to figure out what the radius of this loop de loop is

12
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,830
Actually it's not a perfect circle based on this little screen shot that I got here

13
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,010
it looks a little bit elliptical

14
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:01,460
but it looks like the radius of curvature right over here is actually

15
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,660
smaller than the radius of the curvature of the entire loop de loop

16
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,170
So if you made this into a circle, it would actually be even a smaller circle

17
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:15,680
But let's just assume for the sake of our argument right over here

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,870
this thing is a perfect circle, and if it was a perfect circle, let's think about

19
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:27,120
what that minimum velocity would have to be up here at the top of the loop de loop

20
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:33,960
So we know that the magnitude of your centripetal acceleration is going to be equal to

21
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:41,520
your speed squared divided by the radius of the circle that you are going around

22
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:46,580
Now at this point right over here at the top, which is going to be the hardest point

23
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:54,100
the magnitude of our acceleration, this is going to be 9.81 meters per second squared

24
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,010
And the radius we can estimate. I copied and pasted the car and it looks like

25
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:05,480
I can get it to stack on itself 4 times to get the radius of this circle right over here

26
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:11,710
I looked it up on the web and a car size is going to be about 1.5 m high

27
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,380
from the bottom of the tires to the top of the car

28
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,810
And so it looks like just eyeballing it based on these copying and pasting of the cars

29
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:25,250
the radius of this loop de loop here is 6 m

30
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,500
So this right over here is 6 m

31
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,970
Actually we could just in the variables

32
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:35,090
just to manipulate so we can solve v

33
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,110
We have v squared over r is equal to a

34
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:44,790
and then you multiply both sides by r, you get v squared is equal to a times r

35
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,280
And you take the principal square root of both sides

36
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,130
You get v = the principal square root of a times r

37
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,600
And then if we plug in these numbers

38
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,350
this velocity that we have to have in order to stay in the circle

39
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:09,210
is going to be the square root of 9.81 m/s squared times 6 m

40
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,220
and you can verify that. These units work out. Meters times meters is meter squared

41
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,540
per second squared

42
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,010
You take the sqrt of that. You get meters per second

43
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,670
Let's get our calculator out to actually calculate this

44
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:29,960
So we are going to get the principal square root of 9.81 times 6 m

45
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,910
It gives us--and here's our drumroll

46
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:41,800
7.67. I'll just round it three significant digits, 7.67 meters per second

47
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,030
Significant digits in our conversation

48
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:49,350
This is just a very very rough approximation, I am unable to measure this accurately at all

49
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:59,280
but I get a roughly 7.67 meters per second. Approximately 7.7 m/s

50
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,150
And just to give you a sense of how that translates into units that we're used to

51
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,650
when we're driving cars

52
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:13,310
I'll take 7.7 m/s. If you want to say how many meters you go in an hour

53
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,610
well, there's 3600 seconds in an hour

54
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,180
and if you want to convert that into kilometers

55
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:27,400
this will be in meters, you divide by 1000. 1 km is equal to 1000 m

56
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:33,190
These units will cancel out. You have meters, meters; seconds, seconds

57
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,390
You're left with km/h

58
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,600
Let's actually calculate this

59
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,820
And so we get our previous answer and we want

60
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,980
multiply it times 3600 to figure out how many meters in an hour

61
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,440
and then you divide by 1000 to convert to kilometers per hour

62
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,950
So you divide by a thousand

63
00:04:51,240 --> 00:05:01,960
And we get 27.6 km / h

64
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:06,020
which is surprisingly slow. I would've thought that it would be much much much faster

65
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:11,820
but it turns out it doesn't have to be much much faster. Only 27.6 km/h

66
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,070
Now the important thing to keep in mind is

67
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:18,510
this is just fast enough at this point to maintain the circular motion

68
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:24,550
But if this were a perfect circle right over here, and you're going in exactly 27.6 km/h

69
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,280
you would not have much traction with the road. If so

70
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,250
the car might slip and might not be able to actually maintain its speed

71
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:38,670
So you definitely want your speed to be a good bit larger than this

72
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:41,190
in order to keep a nice margin of safety

73
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:47,140
in order to especially have traction with the actual loop de loop to maintain your speed

74
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,290
What I want to do in the next video is actually time the car

75
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,720
to figure out how long it takes to do this loop de loop

76
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,390
We're gonna assume that it's a circle

77
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:01,240
and we're gonna figure out how fast its actual average velocity was

78
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,720
over the course of this loop de loop
