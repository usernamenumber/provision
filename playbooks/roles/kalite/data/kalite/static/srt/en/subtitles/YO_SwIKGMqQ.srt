1
00:00:01,057 --> 00:00:03,730
We're asked to subtract and state the difference

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,319
in simplest form.

3
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:08,863
So we're subtracting one rational expression from another.

4
00:00:08,863 --> 00:00:12,046
And just like the case when you are subtracting fractions,

5
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:14,729
or adding fractions for that matter,

6
00:00:14,729 --> 00:00:17,462
you have to make sure that you have a common denomintator.

7
00:00:17,462 --> 00:00:21,147
And over here it looks like we have kind of the same components,

8
00:00:21,147 --> 00:00:23,063
but they're not quite the same thing.

9
00:00:23,063 --> 00:00:29,617
So we need to find the least common multiple of 7m^2n and 3mn^4,

10
00:00:29,617 --> 00:00:32,495
and then that we can use as a common denominator.

11
00:00:32,495 --> 00:00:34,296
Let's see if we can do that.

12
00:00:34,296 --> 00:00:36,813
So, let me find a common denominator:

13
00:00:36,813 --> 00:00:40,147
we have a negative sign out here and a common denominator over here.

14
00:00:40,147 --> 00:00:42,481
So a common denominator is going to have ...

15
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:44,258
let's just look at each of the numbers.

16
00:00:44,258 --> 00:00:47,147
We have a 7 here and a 3 over here.

17
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:51,045
So the common denominator has to be divisible by both 7 and 3.

18
00:00:51,045 --> 00:00:52,680
Or another way to think about it,

19
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,112
the least common multiple of 7 and 3 is 21.

20
00:00:55,112 --> 00:00:59,462
So we're going to have to have 21 in our common denominator.

21
00:00:59,462 --> 00:01:02,529
And I'm getting that by encorporating the 7 and the 3.

22
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,897
That's what gives me the 21.

23
00:01:04,897 --> 00:01:07,110
Now let's look at the m's.

24
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,745
This denominator has 2 "m"s if you were to factor it.

25
00:01:09,745 --> 00:01:11,529
It's m times m.

26
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,129
This only has one m.

27
00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:15,446
So as long as we're divisible by m^2

28
00:01:15,446 --> 00:01:17,481
then we're also going to be divisible by m

29
00:01:17,481 --> 00:01:19,713
So we just have to put an m^2 over here

30
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:22,746
and an m^2 over here.

31
00:01:22,746 --> 00:01:25,813
Notice this is ... right now this is both divisible by

32
00:01:25,813 --> 00:01:29,080
7, 3, m and m^2.

33
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,530
So we're cool through the "m"s.

34
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,463
Now let's look at the "n" terms.

35
00:01:33,463 --> 00:01:35,112
It has to be divisible by n,

36
00:01:35,112 --> 00:01:37,283
and it also has to be divisible by n^4.

37
00:01:37,283 --> 00:01:39,318
Well, if we're divisible by n^4,

38
00:01:39,318 --> 00:01:41,544
we're also divisible by n, since this is one of the factors of n^4

39
00:01:41,544 --> 00:01:45,880
This to the fourth power is n to the fourth.

40
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,612
Anyway, we have to be divisible by n^4

41
00:01:48,612 --> 00:01:51,862
If we're divisible by n^4 we are divisible by n

42
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,540
So that's our common denominator.

43
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,000
We're divisible by 7m^2n, definitely divisible by 3mn^4.

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,195
So that's our common denominator.

45
00:02:02,195 --> 00:02:06,148
So to go from 7m^2n, to this right over here,

46
00:02:06,148 --> 00:02:09,597
we have to multiply it by 3 times

47
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:12,663
let's see, the m^2, we didn't have to multiply it by anything

48
00:02:12,663 --> 00:02:16,062
to get from n to n^4, we have to multiply it by n^3

49
00:02:16,062 --> 00:02:19,086
So we have to multiply this by 3n^3

50
00:02:19,086 --> 00:02:22,731
So we multiply the denominator by 3n^3 to get this over here

51
00:02:22,731 --> 00:02:26,317
we also have to multiply the numerator by 3n^3

52
00:02:26,317 --> 00:02:29,547
3n^3 times 6m is 18m,

53
00:02:29,547 --> 00:02:36,596
one right over there

54
00:02:36,596 --> 00:02:38,753
and then we have an n^3

55
00:02:38,753 --> 00:02:43,696
now let's do it with the second term right over here

56
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:46,797
or the thing we are subtracting from this first rational expression

57
00:02:46,797 --> 00:02:49,112
so to get from 3m,

58
00:02:49,112 --> 00:02:51,129
so let's see, to get from that to that

59
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,993
what did we have to do?

60
00:02:52,993 --> 00:02:54,212
to get from a 3 to a 21

61
00:02:54,212 --> 00:02:56,230
you have to multiply it by a 7

62
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,179
you have to multiply it by 7

63
00:02:58,179 --> 00:03:03,148
and to get from an m to an m^2 you have to multiply it by m

64
00:03:03,148 --> 00:03:07,229
And to get from n^4 to n^4, you didn't have to multiply by anything

65
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,528
So to get from this expression in the denominator

66
00:03:09,528 --> 00:03:11,045
to this expression in the denominator

67
00:03:11,045 --> 00:03:13,148
you have to multiply it by 7m.

68
00:03:13,148 --> 00:03:15,393
So if you multiply the denominator by 7m

69
00:03:15,393 --> 00:03:18,346
you also have to ultiply the numerator by 7m

70
00:03:18,346 --> 00:03:21,547
And so you have 5 time 7 is 35

71
00:03:21,547 --> 00:03:25,600
and you have 1m, right over here,

72
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,647
and then we have n^3

73
00:03:27,647 --> 00:03:29,648
and now we are ready to subtract

74
00:03:29,648 --> 00:03:31,480
since we have the same denominator

75
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,730
Let me write the denominator here

76
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,713
So the denominator is 21m^2n^4

77
00:03:38,713 --> 00:03:40,962
And in our numerator we have

78
00:03:40,962 --> 00:03:52,596
18mn^3 minus 35mn^3

79
00:03:52,596 --> 00:03:54,196
Now this is interesting,

80
00:03:54,196 --> 00:03:56,730
because we have 18 of something

81
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,379
of mn^3

82
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,745
and we're going to subtract 35 of that same something

83
00:04:00,745 --> 00:04:02,063
mn^3

84
00:04:02,063 --> 00:04:03,564
we have the same power on m,

85
00:04:03,564 --> 00:04:05,529
same power on n

86
00:04:05,529 --> 00:04:08,481
So this is 18 of something -35 of that something

87
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,346
which is going to be equal to what?

88
00:04:10,346 --> 00:04:12,480
18 minus 35,

89
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,805
this is just practicing subtracting negative numbers

90
00:04:14,805 --> 00:04:17,111
is -17

91
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:19,614
Let me do this in a new color

92
00:04:19,614 --> 00:04:23,613
So this is going to be -17

93
00:04:23,613 --> 00:04:29,180
-17mn^3

94
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:34,211
right, 18-35: 35-18 would be 17

95
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:37,711
So if you swap them around you get -17

96
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:39,120
yup that works

97
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:49,481
and then all of that over 21m^2n^4.

98
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:51,861
Now let's see if we can simplify this further

99
00:04:51,861 --> 00:04:53,345
both the numerator ...

100
00:04:53,345 --> 00:04:56,314
17 is prime, so you can't simplify that with 21

101
00:04:56,314 --> 00:05:00,079
both the numerator and denominator are divisible by m

102
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:02,261
So let's divide them both by m

103
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:06,013
this becomes a 1, this becomes just an m

104
00:05:06,013 --> 00:05:09,085
both the numerator and denominator are divisible by n^3

105
00:05:09,085 --> 00:05:13,412
so you divide the numerator by n^3, that becomes 1

106
00:05:13,412 --> 00:05:16,563
you divide the denominator by n^3, this becomes an n

107
00:05:16,563 --> 00:05:21,344
We are left with, in simplest form,

108
00:05:21,344 --> 00:05:31,796
-17 over, I'll do it in the same colors, 21mn.

109
00:05:31,796 --> 99:59:59,999
And we are done.
