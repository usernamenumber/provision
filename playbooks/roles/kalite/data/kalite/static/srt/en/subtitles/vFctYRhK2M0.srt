1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,560
   

2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,780
The neat thing about linear
algebra in general is some

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,630
very seemingly simple concepts
can be interpreted in a bunch

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,740
of different ways, and can be
shown to represent different

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,540
ideas or different problems. And
that's what I'm going to

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,260
do in this video.

7
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,660
I'm going to explore the
nullspace, or even better, I'm

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,990
going to explore the
relationship-- if I have some

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:24,900
matrix A times some vector
x, and that that is

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,560
equal to the 0 vector.

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,890
And we, of course, saw on the
last few videos that the

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:38,520
nullspace of A, is equal to all
of the vectors x in Rn.

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,840
So this will have
n components.

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,375
This would have to be
an m by n matrix.

15
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,490
If this was an m by a matrix,
I'd say all of

16
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:47,330
the vectors in Ra.

17
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,800
So this number right here has to
be the same as that number

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,530
in order for the matrix vector
multiplication to be valid.

19
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,490
But the nullspace of A is all
of the vectors in Rn that

20
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,110
satisfy this equation.

21
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,280
Where if I take A and I multiply
it times any one of

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,600
the vectors in the nullspace,
I should get the 0 vector.

23
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,640
And this is going to have m
components, and we've seen

24
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,680
that in previous-- this is going
to have the 0 vectors.

25
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,270
I'll put it this way, the
0 vector's going to

26
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:21,170
be a member of Rm.

27
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,280
So that's what our
nullspace is.

28
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,080
Let's explore it a little bit.

29
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,930
We know already that our vector,
our matrix, can be

30
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,250
rewritten like this.

31
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,410
We could just write it as
a set of column vectors.

32
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:34,410
I could say this right here,
that's v1, then I'm going to

33
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,640
have v2, and I have n columns.

34
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,980
So this last column right here
is going to be v sub n.

35
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:46,210
So if I define my vectors this
way, that's the first vector,

36
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,870
that's the second vector, than
I can rewrite my matrix A.

37
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,780
I could say A is equal to just
a bunch of column vectors.

38
00:01:53,780 --> 00:02:00,120
v1, v2, all the way to vn.

39
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:06,850
And multiplying this matrix
times a vector x, so times x,

40
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:11,840
so times x1, x2, all
the way to xn.

41
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,100
We've seen in the past on the
matrix vector product

42
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,790
definition video that this can
be interpreted as, this has

43
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,400
actually just coming straight
out of the definition.

44
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,820
This is the same thing as x1
times vector 1, times the

45
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:33,760
first column, plus x2 times the
second column, times that

46
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,500
column, all the way to, and you
just keep adding them up,

47
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,500
all the way to xn.

48
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,150
   

49
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,490
Times the nth column.

50
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:47,110
This just comes straight out
of our definition of matrix

51
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,740
vector products.

52
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:55,200
Now, if we're saying that Ax is
equal to 0, we're looking

53
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,170
for the solution set to that.

54
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,990
If we're looking for the
solution set to Ax is equal to

55
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:04,080
0, then that means-- is equal
to the 0 vector, that that

56
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,840
means that this sum, we're
trying to find a solution set

57
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,020
of this sum is equaling 0.

58
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,090
We want to figure out the x1's,
x2's, x3's, all the way

59
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:19,130
to xn's, that make this
equal the 0 vector.

60
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,090
What are we doing?

61
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,040
We're taking linear
combinations

62
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,860
of our column vectors.

63
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,820
We're taking linear combinations
of our column

64
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,120
vectors, and seeing if we can
take some linear combination

65
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,180
and get it to the 0 vector.

66
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,310
Now, this should start ringing
bells in your head.

67
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,480
This little equation, or this
little expression right here,

68
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,390
should start ringing bells.

69
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:46,590
This was part of how we
defined what linear

70
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,690
independence was.

71
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,050
We said that if this was the
definition of linear

72
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,730
independence, or we proved
this fell out of the

73
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,920
definition of linear
independence, and if I have a

74
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:00,720
bunch of vectors, v1, v2, all
the way to vn, we say that

75
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,325
they are linearly independent.

76
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:09,040
   

77
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,500
There's kind of the
non-mathematical way of

78
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,360
describing it, I guess this is
mathematical as well, is that

79
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,200
look, none of those vectors
can be represented as a

80
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,540
combination of the other ones.

81
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,440
And then we show that that means
that the only solution

82
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,520
to this equation would be
that x1, x2, all of the

83
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,240
coefficients on this, has
to be equal to 0.

84
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,450
That this is the
only solution.

85
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:37,490
Linear independence means that
this is the only solution to

86
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,300
this equation right now.

87
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,540
If the only way that you get
the 0 vector, by taking

88
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,170
combination of all of these
common vectors, the only way

89
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:50,400
to do that is to have all
of these guys equal 0.

90
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,040
Then you are linearly
independent.

91
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,370
Likewise, if v1, v2, all the
way to vn are linearly

92
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,750
independent, then the only
solution to this is for these

93
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,930
coefficients to be 0.

94
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,920
And we saw that in our video
on linear independence.

95
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,590
Now, if all of these
coefficients are 0,

96
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,570
what does that mean?

97
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:14,670
That means that our vector
x is the 0 vector,

98
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,080
and only the 0 vector.

99
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,050
That's the only solution.

100
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,220
So we have something
interesting here.

101
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:25,890
If our column vectors are
linearly independent, if v1,

102
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:35,960
v2, all the way to vn, are
linearly independent, then

103
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:50,370
that means that the only
solution to Ax equals 0, is

104
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,670
that x has to be equal
to 0 vector.

105
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:56,380
Or put another way, the solution
set of this equation,

106
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,410
which is really just a
nullspace, the nullspace is

107
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,770
all of the x's that satisfy
this equation.

108
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:08,480
So that the nullspace of A has
to only contain the 0 vector.

109
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,690
So that's an interesting
result.

110
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:14,300
If we're linearly independent,
then the nullspace of A only

111
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,010
contains the 0 vector.

112
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:19,870
Which is another way of saying
that-- let me write this--

113
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,280
well, I already wrote it down,
that x1, x2, all of them, have

114
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,810
to be equal to 0.

115
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:28,610
Now if I were to multiply this
equation out and get it into

116
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,530
reduced row echelon form,
what does that mean?

117
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:37,090
We saw in a previous video that
the nullspace of A is

118
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:44,260
equal to the nullspace of the
reduced row echelon form of A.

119
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,110
And that's-- the nullspace of
A is 0, because its column

120
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,500
vectors are each linearly
independent, and that means

121
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,960
that the nullspace of the
reduced row echelon form of A

122
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,030
must also equal the 0 vector.

123
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:00,150
And that means that if I take
the reduced row echelon form

124
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:05,050
of A, times-- maybe I'm being
a little redundant-- the

125
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:09,390
reduced row echelon form of A,
and I multiply that times x,

126
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:13,900
or I want to solve this
equation, the only solution

127
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:19,530
right here is x is equal
to the 0 vector.

128
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,790
And if you think about what
that means, if this is the

129
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,840
only solution, that means that
this reduced row echelon form

130
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,530
has no free variables.

131
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,390
It literally would just have
to look like this.

132
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:38,920
So this is x, x1, x2, all the
way to xn, the reduced row

133
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,840
echelon form of A, in order
for this to have a unique

134
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,640
solution, and that unique
solution being 0, the reduced

135
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,640
echelon form is going to
have to look like this.

136
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,840
   

137
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,200
1 times x1 plus 0 times all
the other ones, so you're

138
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,530
going to have just a bunch of
n0's, and you're going to have

139
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:02,150
1 times x2, plus 0's times
everything else.

140
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,170
And those 1's are going to go
all the way down the diagonal,

141
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:07,250
so it's going to look like that,
and then that is going

142
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:11,860
to be equal to the 0 vector.

143
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,910
And this is going to be a square
matrix, where this has

144
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,840
to be n, and this has to be n.

145
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,300
How do I know that?

146
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,570
Because I said that x1, x2, and
all of these have to be

147
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:21,780
equal to 0.

148
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,580
So they have to be equal to 0.

149
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,380
If I just write them as a system
of equations, if I

150
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:36,809
write x1 is equal to 0, x2 is
equal to 0, x3 is equal to 0,

151
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:41,419
all the way to xn
is equal to 0.

152
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:44,860
This system of equations, if
I wrote it as an augmented

153
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:50,370
matrix, remember this is
x1 plus 0, x2 plus 0.

154
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,860
This as in augmented matrix, and
we've done this multiple

155
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,160
times, it would look
like this.

156
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,780
1, you just have a bunch of 0's,
n0's, and then the 1's

157
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,850
would just go down the diagonal,
and then you'd have

158
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,220
n0's right there.

159
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,220
So that's where I'm
getting it from.

160
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:11,130
If we are linearly independent,
the nullspace of

161
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,980
A is going to be just a 0
vector, and if the nullspace

162
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,040
of A is just a 0 vector, then
the nullspace of the reduced

163
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,430
row echelon form is
only the 0 vector.

164
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,320
The only solution is all
of the x's equal to 0.

165
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,420
Which means a reduced row
echelon form of A has to

166
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,870
essentially just be 1's down
the diaganol, with 0's

167
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,330
everywhere else.

168
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:34,040
So anyway, I just want to make
this-- this is kind of a neat

169
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,310
by-product of an

170
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,950
interpretation of the nullspace.

171
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,200
Let me write that.

172
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,490
   

173
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,830
Let me summarize our results.

174
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:48,660
The nullspace of A, if it just
equals 0, then that means, you

175
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,210
can go both ways, that's true
if and only if the column

176
00:09:53,210 --> 00:10:03,240
vectors of A are linearly
independent.

177
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,830
   

178
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:13,366
And all of that's only true--
this is true, I was going to

179
00:10:13,366 --> 00:10:18,240
do a triangle, it might turn
into a square-- if x1, x2, all

180
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,780
of these have to be equal 0.

181
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,030
This is the only solution.

182
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,770
   

183
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:31,060
And then that implies that the
reduced row echelon, and I

184
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,600
didn't do it as precisely as
I would have liked, but the

185
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,300
reduced row echelon form of A
is essentially going to be a

186
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:42,080
square n by n matrix.

187
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,880
And, by the way, this can only
be true if we're dealing with

188
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,560
an n by n matrix
to begin with.

189
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,990
And maybe I'll do that a little
bit more precisely in a

190
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:51,640
future video.

191
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:56,210
But then the reduced row echelon
form of A is going to

192
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:59,020
have to look like this, just
a bunch of 1's down the

193
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,200
diagonal, with 0's
everywhere else.

194
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,420
And these all imply
each other.

195
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:08,990
Now, what if the nullspace of A
contains some other vectors?

196
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:12,520
Well, then we would have to say
that the column vectors of

197
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,480
A are linearly dependent.

198
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,240
And if they're linearly
dependent, then we wouldn't

199
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,230
have a reduced row echelon form
of A that looked like

200
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,570
this, you would have something
that would have some free

201
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:25,880
variables that allows you to
create more solutions there.

202
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,660
But anyway, I just wanted to
give you this angle on how you

203
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,120
can interpret the nullspace and
how it relates to linear

204
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,370
Independence.

205
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:34,782
