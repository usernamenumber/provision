1
00:00:04,975 --> 00:00:06,800
We're in the Glyptothek in Munich, this is

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,602
an extraordinary museum devoted to ancient

3
00:00:09,602 --> 00:00:11,411
Greek and Roman antiquities,

4
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:15,875
and that's all thanks to Prince Ludwig of Bavaria, who in the early 19th century

5
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:21,102
said he wanted to found a collection of antique works of sculpture, because, as he said,

6
00:00:21,102 --> 00:00:25,835
we must also have in Munich what in Rome is known as a museum. I love that,

7
00:00:25,835 --> 00:00:30,033
you know, a museum wasn't even a commonly used word, the idea of a public collection

8
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:37,334
was just coming into being, in Britain, in France, and here in Germany, and Ludwig was ambitious for Munich.

9
00:00:37,334 --> 00:00:43,539
He wrote, "I will turn Munich into a city of the arts, so that no one can claim to know Germany, who has

10
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:48,502
not also seen Munich." So, art was a way of really putting a city on a map; it spoke to its

11
00:00:48,502 --> 00:00:53,142
cultural superiority, and Ludwig put together an incredible collection, and we're looking now

12
00:00:53,142 --> 00:00:59,043
at one of the great treasures of the museum, the sculptures from the pediment of the temple of Aphaea

13
00:00:59,043 --> 00:01:04,612
on the island of Aigina, just off the coast of Greece. This is an island that is visible from Athens,

14
00:01:04,612 --> 00:01:09,768
so it's very close to the Greek mainland. And we really shouldn't say pediment, we should say pediments.

15
00:01:09,768 --> 00:01:16,803
Let's unpack that just a little bit. On a greek temple, imagine the Parthenon. This is a long structure

16
00:01:16,803 --> 00:01:22,569
with a gable either end, that is,above the colonnade. At either short end of the temple,

17
00:01:22,569 --> 00:01:27,502
there is a low triangle, and historically, those were areas that were filled with sculptures.

18
00:01:27,502 --> 00:01:32,588
On the temple of Aphaea, there was a pediment on the East side and on the West side,

19
00:01:32,588 --> 00:01:37,036
on the two short ends of the temple. The sculptures that filled these pediments were

20
00:01:37,036 --> 00:01:42,589
discovered in the early 19th century when some German architects were surveying the

21
00:01:42,589 --> 00:01:49,171
ruins of the temple, and they were soon put on auction, and Ludwig was very pleased to acquire

22
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:54,371
them for his new museum. The pediment sculptures were not made at the same moment, and that makes them

23
00:01:54,371 --> 00:01:58,136
even more interesting, because it helps us see the evolution of greek sculpture.

24
00:01:58,136 --> 00:02:03,803
The West pediment was earlier, and we think that those sculptures were carved when the temple

25
00:02:03,803 --> 00:02:10,203
was actually built, about 490 B.C.E.. The East side was later, and what's really interesting

26
00:02:10,203 --> 00:02:17,202
is those older West sculptures are in the archaic tradition, but the East pediment sculptures

27
00:02:17,202 --> 00:02:21,919
are just taking on the characteristics of the style we'll come to know as the Classical.

28
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:26,728
We can say it's an early moment of the Classical for the sculptures on the East pediment,

29
00:02:26,728 --> 00:02:30,867
this moment of transition as the style really was just being invented.

30
00:02:30,867 --> 00:02:37,167
Now the subject for both pediments was the Trojan War, the war between the Trojans and the Greeks.

31
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:41,948
Now this war was really a mythic war, but we know about it because it is the subject of

32
00:02:41,948 --> 00:02:48,938
Homer's great epic poem, "The Iliad," and some of the heroes of the Trojan War were from the Island of Aegina,

33
00:02:48,938 --> 00:02:52,541
so it makes sense that they would make an appearance on the pediment.

34
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:56,915
So, let's start off by looking at the sculptures on the Western pediment. In terms of

35
00:02:56,915 --> 00:03:01,969
being a space that gets filled with sculpture, a pediment is kind of an awkward environment.

36
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:07,204
It's incredibly awkward, because you have these two narrow areas of the triangle

37
00:03:07,204 --> 00:03:13,335
that are very hard to fill, and so one of the ways you can do that is to have reclining figures.

38
00:03:13,335 --> 00:03:17,674
Well, that's right, that's almost as if the sculptures have to play limbo, they get lower and lower

39
00:03:17,674 --> 00:03:22,204
as you move to the edges. But in this case, the sculptor has really been inventive, and he's found

40
00:03:22,204 --> 00:03:27,037
a marvelous solution. In the very center of the pediment, on both the East and the West sides,

41
00:03:27,037 --> 00:03:32,311
we have a standing figure, noble, looking outward, the Goddess Athena.

42
00:03:32,311 --> 00:03:36,369
And Athena was known as the Goddess of War, in addition to being the Goddess of Wisdom.

43
00:03:36,369 --> 00:03:43,605
On the west pediment, we see Athena, now holding a modern shaft, that is meant to represent

44
00:03:43,605 --> 00:03:48,604
a spear that would have originally been there perhaps in wood, more likely, in bronze or some other metal.

45
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:53,213
When we look at Athena, we see a figure who looks typically archaic in style.

46
00:03:53,213 --> 00:03:59,605
She's frontal, she's rather rigid, fairly symmetrical, and there's a linear quality to her.

47
00:03:59,605 --> 00:04:06,507
She has a typical archaic smile, that removes her from emotion, removes her from the

48
00:04:06,507 --> 00:04:11,468
everyday world. She seems like a transcendant goddess. On either side of the

49
00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:15,800
standing Athena are two warriors, and they move outward. They're actually

50
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:21,209
lunging with spears. One has their shield facing us, one has turned in the other direction,

51
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:26,869
the shield is facing away from us, but they move our eye in either direction outward with real energy and

52
00:04:26,869 --> 00:04:31,304
real velocity, and of course, they are both slightly lower since their knees are bent,

53
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:39,002
so that they fit under the eve of the gable. On either side of those figures we see kneeling archers, who are shooting bows.

54
00:04:39,002 --> 00:04:44,235
The archer on the left we can actually identify as Paris, and we can see his

55
00:04:44,235 --> 00:04:49,939
cap is tied in the back, his weight is on one knee, and on one heel. The bow is missing,

56
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:53,770
but we can certainly see arm movement that suggests that he was in the middle

57
00:04:53,770 --> 00:05:00,136
of loosing his arrow. And then behind him, a striding figure with a weapon, who's attacking a figure

58
00:05:00,136 --> 00:05:05,443
who is falling to the ground. Look at the complexity of that group of three, the way in which they overlap,

59
00:05:05,443 --> 00:05:09,033
there's a real sense of energy, there's a real sense of dynamism, which is pretty extraordinary

60
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:13,872
for the archaic moment. And then on the far left corner, another wounded figure, just fits

61
00:05:13,872 --> 00:05:19,038
into that corner space. Let's focus for a moment on the wounded warrior that is on the right side of the

62
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:25,068
West pediment. We can see that he's fallen back, he's on his left hip, and he's on his left elbow,

63
00:05:25,068 --> 00:05:30,504
and his right hand seems to be clutching, or perhaps trying to remove a spear that has wounded him.

64
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:35,339
Alright, let me stop you for a moment, because he doesn't really look like he's in the position of a

65
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:42,742
wounded warrior. His knee's bent, it comes over his left leg, he's propped up on his left arm,

66
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:50,173
and his right elbow comes up in a rather awkward way. This figure really doesn't seem believable

67
00:05:50,173 --> 00:05:54,582
in terms of what he's supposed to be doing, pulling the spear from his body. Well, that's right,

68
00:05:54,582 --> 00:05:59,501
this must be tremendously painful, probably would kill him, and yet look at his face, it still retains

69
00:05:59,501 --> 00:06:04,838
the archaic smile. For all of us, it is important to remember that this is not naturalism.

70
00:06:04,838 --> 00:06:10,334
This is not an attempt to render the feelings of the embodied, this is a highly stylized,

71
00:06:10,334 --> 00:06:14,668
very schematic structure, and in a way, the figure is a symbol,

72
00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:19,335
more than a real figure, a symbol of the fallen warrior in the Trojan War.

73
00:06:19,335 --> 00:06:25,902
One art historian has likened this figure to vase painting, where there was often an attempt

74
00:06:25,902 --> 00:06:30,770
to raise torsos up so that you could see the full musculature of the entire front.

75
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:36,169
This is not about naturalism, it's about revealing the body in a way. The same art historian likened this

76
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:41,665
figure to a reclining kouros, and that's exactly how he looks. It's as if a standing kouros figure has

77
00:06:41,665 --> 00:06:47,502
been tipped over. This is so different than what we see on the East pediment, which dates from

78
00:06:47,502 --> 00:06:52,704
only a decade or two later, where we see the beginnings of the Classical style. Let's take a look.

79
00:06:52,704 --> 00:07:00,136
The East pediment is much more fragmentary on the left side, but the one figure, of the fallen soldier,

80
00:07:00,136 --> 00:07:06,254
is in great condition, and so different from what we saw of the early archaic West facade.

81
00:07:06,254 --> 00:07:13,604
While this figure still has a bit of that archaic smile, everything else about the position of his body

82
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:22,270
tells us that this is a wounded figure taking his last breaths. You can see that he's holding a sword with his right hand,

83
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:26,665
but he's also trying to push himself back up, but he doesn't seem to be able to do it.

84
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:33,937
His left arm is still in the shield, and he seems to be balancing himself, just a moment before that shield

85
00:07:33,937 --> 00:07:40,603
falls over with a bang. And so there's a sense that he's propping himself up, but also falling

86
00:07:40,603 --> 00:07:47,933
at the same time, lowering his body as he dies. He's looking down at the ground, and his body is more

87
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:52,368
mature than the other figure,it's also much more naturalistically rendered. We're seeing that

88
00:07:52,368 --> 00:07:58,435
origin of the Classical tradition. In the archaic period, we see hard divisions between the muscles

89
00:07:58,435 --> 00:08:03,333
and the parts of the body. Outlines, almost, to the parts of the body, and here,

90
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:11,090
one muscle flows into another, and there's a real sense of skin lying over a skeletal structure.

91
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:16,467
Well thats right, a moment ago, you had said that the archaic sculpture was nothing but really a set of symbols.

92
00:08:16,467 --> 00:08:23,769
And here, it's as if the artist has actually observed the human body, and thought about it, what it must be like, for a figure to fall.

93
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:33,037
Instead of having that back leg coming over the front leg in a very unnatural way, and instead of having that elbow lifted up,

94
00:08:33,037 --> 00:08:39,704
the right arm of the figure comes over his torso fully. There's no attempt to reveal the whole body

95
00:08:39,704 --> 00:08:46,776
tipped forward to us the way we had in the archaic figure. Now, look at the torso. Look at the

96
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:50,502
muscles of the leg, this is a far more complex rendering of the human body in a complex pose.

97
00:08:50,502 --> 00:08:56,803
Just like on the West pediment, as we look at the East pediment,we've got a central figure, again, Athena.

98
00:08:56,803 --> 00:09:03,004
To the right of Athena, we have figures that are much more intact. We have a lunging figure, we saw that on

99
00:09:03,004 --> 00:09:08,934
the West pediment as well, who is in the process of impaling a man who has lost his helmet,

100
00:09:08,934 --> 00:09:15,585
his shield is falling off his arm, and he's tottering; he has lost his balance.

101
00:09:15,585 --> 00:09:20,142
He looks as though he's about to collapse. We know he's lost his helmet because the young man

102
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:24,568
who's in back of him, who seems to be trying to aid him and running towards him.

103
00:09:24,568 --> 00:09:28,102
He's holding a fragment we know that would've originally been his helmet.

104
00:09:28,102 --> 00:09:33,436
His body forms a diagonal in the lunge, so it fits nicely to that triangular space of that pediment,

105
00:09:33,436 --> 00:09:39,438
and behind him is another archer just like we saw on the West pediment. Archaeologists think that

106
00:09:39,438 --> 00:09:45,301
that archer is actually the one who has hit the wounded warrior on the opposite side, the one who we were discussing before.

107
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:52,504
That's right. So we have this wonderful unification of action among all of these figures on the East pediment.

108
00:09:52,504 --> 00:09:57,338
We have this more complex narrative even though the same story is being told. We have a much

109
00:09:57,338 --> 00:10:03,834
more complex musculature, and much more careful attention to the human experience, and this

110
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:08,840
makes us ask what has changed. It's just been a few years between these pediments, yet they are

111
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:14,870
so different. This is always the question art historians ask as we look at works of art that are separated

112
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:21,969
not by a very long period of time, in this case, what has happened in the values of the ancient Greek culture

113
00:10:21,969 --> 00:10:27,417
that has led them to represent the human figure so differently. If you go back in Greek history,

114
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:32,803
the Greeks were deeply influenced by monumental Egyptian sculpture. You can still get a sense

115
00:10:32,803 --> 00:10:38,414
of a trace of that in the archaic tradition, but now, there's a sense of self-awareness.

116
00:10:38,414 --> 00:10:43,103
These are mobile figures out in the world that are almost enacting human emotion,

117
00:10:43,103 --> 00:10:50,134
human expression, and human experience, and that is so different from the idea of representation as symbolic,

118
00:10:50,134 --> 00:10:56,442
which it's so in formed in earlier Greek art. So, in the Classical period, we have figures who we can

119
00:10:56,442 --> 00:11:04,103
believe are part of a story, it's a story that we can begin to feel for them, we can sympathize with them as we

120
00:11:04,103 --> 00:11:10,204
watch them. And this is a moment in ancient Greek history when the Greeks have just defeated

121
00:11:10,204 --> 00:11:15,069
the Persians in battle. This is an epic victory for Greek culture when many of the

122
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:20,604
Greek city states united to fight their enemy, the Persians. That's right, this common enemy that really

123
00:11:20,604 --> 00:11:26,169
should have been victorious, the Persians should have won. It was a much larger army, and the

124
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:31,369
Greeks knew it. The fact that they were victorious suggested to them that there was a kind of

125
00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:36,867
an order in the universe. There's a sense now that the world isn't a place that just operates arbitrarily

126
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:42,469
according to the laws of the gods, but it's a place that the human mind, with its sense of the rational,

127
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:48,334
can understand. So, there is a much greater burden placed on the Greeks, with this realization.

128
00:11:48,334 --> 00:11:54,737
They are now responsible for their own society, they are not part of kind of a random order, they're part

129
00:11:54,737 --> 00:12:00,923
of an order that they actually devise. So art historians see the origins of the Classical style

130
00:12:00,923 --> 00:12:09,069
in this historical moment. We have an obligation, even here in the 21st century, to try to put ourselves,

131
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:15,243
even though it's an impossible task, in the minds of the ancient Greeks, and to truly understand

132
00:12:15,243 --> 00:12:20,336
these works of art from their point of view, and so it's really important to remember that these sculptures

133
00:12:20,336 --> 00:12:24,042
were painted, just like all ancient Greek sculptures, and with very bright colors.

134
00:12:24,042 --> 00:12:29,876
This completely destroys our image of Greek art. When we think about Greek art, we think about

135
00:12:29,876 --> 00:12:35,936
these pristine, brilliant, white, marble surfaces, and they were garish! They were yellow!

136
00:12:35,936 --> 00:12:40,102
They were blue! They were green! Art historians and archaeologists have done scientific analyses

137
00:12:40,102 --> 00:12:46,508
of these sculptures, and found traces and residues of pigments, and they've determined pretty accurately

138
00:12:46,508 --> 00:12:54,122
at least the red and blues that we find here in some of these geometric patterns. It's so jarring, for me, to try to imagine these colors back,

139
00:12:54,122 --> 00:12:58,753
and it's not just that the figures themselves were painted, but the architectural spaces in which these

140
00:12:58,753 --> 00:13:03,748
figures were placed were painted as well. Well, there are some anyways that we're not looking at

141
00:13:03,748 --> 00:13:09,255
these the way that the ancient Greeks did. First of all, these were outside, in the open air, they were high up

142
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:15,936
on a pediment, on this island. Well, certainly, the color would have made it much easier to see these figures

143
00:13:15,936 --> 00:13:20,701
we're trying to fit in the shade of the architecture. You know, there's another element that we can re-imagine,

144
00:13:20,701 --> 00:13:27,276
which is these figures were not only holding things that have since disappeared, they were holding spears,

145
00:13:27,276 --> 00:13:33,436
and bows, and arrows, but they also had other pieces of metal work that have since been lost.

146
00:13:33,436 --> 00:13:41,505
There was hair, sometimes actually hanging kind of like bangs, over the forehead, and also long locks that came down and framed the faces.

147
00:13:41,505 --> 00:13:47,770
In this case, they were made of lead, and you can actually see the pieces of the remaining lead that are still there,

148
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:53,700
and so we know precisely where they came out of the stone, and that would've helped, I think, create not

149
00:13:53,700 --> 00:14:00,769
these figures as single stone objects the way we see them, but as these much more complex figures

150
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:06,585
that interact with their architectural environments. Let's not forget, too, that these are temples, these are

151
00:14:06,585 --> 00:14:15,169
places of religious worship, and that they were homes to the Gods, and that the central figure on both East and West pediments is the Goddess Athena.

152
00:14:15,169 --> 00:14:21,542
And of course, the Greek idea of Gods and Goddesses is entirely different from our own today of

153
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:28,033
Christian tradition. So, these are all important things to keep in mind, as we look at Greek sculptures in museums.
