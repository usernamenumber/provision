1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,540
On the Khan Academy web app, which I need to work on a

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,232
little bit more to make it a little bit faster, they have

3
00:00:05,232 --> 00:00:08,580
this one module that's called the graph of the line.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,670
It has no directions on it, and I thought I would make a little

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,790
video here, at least to explain how to do this module, and in

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,870
the process, I think it'll help people, even those of you who

7
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,810
aren't using the module, understand what the slope and

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,580
the y-intercept of a line is a little bit better.

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,360
So this is a screen shot of that module right here, and the

10
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:31,540
idea is essentially to change this line, and this line right

11
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,630
here in orange is the line specified by this equation

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,840
right here, so right now it's the equation of the

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,500
line 1x + 1.

14
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,440
It has a slope of one, you can see that, for every amount it

15
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,200
moved to the right it moves up exactly one, and has one

16
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,610
for its y-intercept.

17
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,120
It intersects the y-axis at exactly the point (0,1).

18
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,474
Now, the goal of this exercise

19
00:00:54,474 --> 00:00:57,306
is to change your slope and your y-intercept

20
00:00:57,306 --> 00:00:59,400
so that you go through these two points, and

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,290
this point-- half of it's off the screen, hopefully you can

22
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,607
see them if you're watching these in HD-- you can

23
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:06,720
see these two points.

24
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,690
Our goal is to make this line go through them by essentially

25
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,200
changing its equation.

26
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:18,100
So it's a kind of a tactile way of-- you know, as tactile as

27
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,000
something on the computer can get-- of trying to figure out

28
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:23,550
the equation of the line that goes through these two points.

29
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,880
So how can we do that?

30
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,650
So you can see here, when I change the slope, if I make

31
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,260
the slope higher, it becomes more steep.

32
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,400
Now the slope is three.

33
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,080
For every one I move to the right, I have to go three up.

34
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,200
My change in y is three for every change in x of one.

35
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,460
Or that's my slope.

36
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,110
My y-intercept is still one.

37
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,250
If I change my y-intercept, if I make it go down, notice it

38
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,910
just shifts the line down.

39
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,180
It doesn't change its inclination or its slope, it

40
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,710
just shifts it down along this line right there.

41
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,830
So how do I make my line go through those two points?

42
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,880
Well it looks like, if I shift it up enough-- let's shift up

43
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,200
that point-- and then let's say let's lower the slope.

44
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,040
This looks like it has a negative slope.

45
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,110
So if I lower my slope, notice I'm flattening out the line.

46
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,870
That's a slope of zero.

47
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,460
It looks like it has to be even more negative than that.

48
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,180
Let's see, maybe even more negative than that, right?

49
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,350
It has to look like a line that goes bam, just down like that.

50
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,740
Even more-- that looks close.

51
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,810
Let me get my y-intercept down to see if I can

52
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,110
get closer to that.

53
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,930
It still seems like my slope is a little bit too high.

54
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:29,860
That looks better.

55
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,940
So let me get my y-intercept down even further.

56
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,990
It's now intersecting way here, off the screen.

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,050
You can't even see that.

58
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,470
I just realized this is copyright two thousand and eight Khan

59
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,090
Academy, it's now two thousand and nine.

60
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,300
It's almost near the end of two thousand and nine.

61
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,680
I should change that.

62
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,460
Maybe I'll just write two thousand and ten there.

63
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:45,830
OK.

64
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,270
So y-intercept.

65
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,715
Even more.

66
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,200
So I lowered the y-intercept but our slope is still

67
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,080
not strong enough.

68
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,860
The y-intercept is actually off the chart.

69
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,190
It's intersecting at minus eighteen.

70
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,440
That's our current y-intercept.

71
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,720
But the slope of minus five is still not enough, so

72
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,230
let me lower the slope.

73
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,750
So if I lower the slope, let's see, if I lower the y-intercept

74
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,820
a little bit more, is that getting me?

75
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,640
There you go.

76
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,780
It got me to those points.

77
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,950
So the equation of the line that passes through both

78
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,960
of those things is -6x - 22.

79
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,420
Let's do another one.

80
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,740
So, once again, it resets it, so I just say the equation 1x

81
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,530
+ 1, but it gives me these two new points that I have

82
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,050
to make it go through.

83
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,470
And once again this is going to be a negative slope, because

84
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,360
for every x that I move forward positive, my y

85
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,130
is actually going down.

86
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,020
So I'm going to have a negative slope here, so let me lower

87
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,880
the slope a little bit.

88
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,910
It's actually doing fractions, so this thing jumps

89
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,590
around a little bit.

90
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,490
I should probably change that a little bit.

91
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,200
That looks about right, so let me shift the graph down a

92
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:54,160
little bit by lowering its y-intercept.

93
00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:00,410
By lowering its y-intercept, can I hit those two points?

94
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,400
There you go.

95
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,870
This is the equation of that line that goes to the points

96
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,660
(-5,1) and the point (9,-9).

97
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,330
You have a slope of -5/7.

98
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,130
For every seven you go to the right, you go down five.

99
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,970
If you go one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, you're going to

100
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,830
go down one, two, three, four, five.

101
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,030
And that, we definitely see that on that line.

102
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,970
And then the y-intercept is minus eighteen over seven, which is a

103
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,260
little over two, it's about a little over-- it's what,

104
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,000
a little over two and one / two.

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,040
And we see right there that the y-intercept is

106
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,420
a little over two and a half.

107
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,330
That's the equation for our line.

108
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,850
Let's do another one.

109
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,170
This is a fun module, because there are no wrong answers.

110
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,570
You can just keep messing with it until you eventually get

111
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,560
that line to go through both of those points, but the idea is

112
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,660
really give you that intuition that the slope is just what the

113
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:53,550
inclination of the line is, and then the y-intercept is how far

114
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,890
up and down it gets shifted.

115
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,100
So this is going to be a positive slope, but

116
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,480
not as high as one.

117
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:06,500
It looks like, for every one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven,

118
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,430
twelve, for every twelve we go to the right, we're going

119
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,800
to go one, two, three up.

120
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:15,250
So our slope is going to be three over twelve, which is also one over

121
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,060
four, and we can just look at that visually.

122
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,670
Let's lower our slope.

123
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,740
That's three / four, not low enough.

124
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,570
one / two, not low enough.

125
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:26,050
one / four, which I just figured out it is, that looks right, and

126
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,010
then we have to lower the y-intercept.

127
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,460
We're shifting it down, and there we go.

128
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,830
So the equation of this line, its slope is one / four, so the

129
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,140
equation of the line is one / fourx plus one / four.

130
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,210
So hopefully, for those of you trying to do this module, that,

131
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,050
one, explained how to do it, and for those of you who don't even

132
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,980
know what this module is, it hopefully gives you a little

133
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,060
intuition about what the slope and the y-intercept do

134
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,030
to an actual line.
