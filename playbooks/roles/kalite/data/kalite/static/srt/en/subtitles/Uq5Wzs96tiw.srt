What I want to do in this video is introduce you to the idea of a budget line

2
00:00:04,365 --> 00:00:06,467
And that probably isn't a new idea

3
00:00:06,467 --> 00:00:08,467
It's kind of a derivitive idea

4
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:11,958
What you've seen often in the introductory algebra course

5
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:13,886
Where you've got a certain amount of money

6
00:00:13,886 --> 00:00:16,467
and you can spend it on a certain combination of goods

7
00:00:16,467 --> 00:00:18,333
what are all the different possibilities

8
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:18,971
that you can actually buy,

9
00:00:18,971 --> 00:00:21,256
so that's really what a budget line is.

10
00:00:21,256 --> 00:00:23,290
So let's say that you have an income

11
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,704
and I'll do it both in the abstract and the concrete

12
00:00:25,704 --> 00:00:27,667
So I'll do it with variables and then I'll do it with

13
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:29,200
actual numbers

14
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,333
So let's say your income

15
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:35,209
in 1 month is Y,

16
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:38,290
And let's say that you spend all of your money

17
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,533
so that your income is equal to your expenditures

18
00:00:41,533 --> 00:00:45,533
So we're assuming in our little model here

19
00:00:45,533 --> 00:00:47,067
that you're not going to be saving any money

20
00:00:47,067 --> 00:00:50,800
and, to show how overly simplified we can make

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,933
a model

22
00:00:51,933 --> 00:00:54,033
We are going to only assume that you can spend

23
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:55,287
on 2 different goods.
