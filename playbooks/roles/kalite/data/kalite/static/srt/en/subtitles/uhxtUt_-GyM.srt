1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,270
Welcome to the playlist
on statistics.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,380
Something I've been meaning
to do for some time.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,710
So anyway, I just want to get
right into the meat of it and

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:12,220
I'll try to do as many examples
as possible and hopefully

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,990
give you the feel for what
statistics is all about.

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,850
And, really, just to kind of
start off in case you're not

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,550
familiar with it -- although, I
think a lot of people have an

8
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,660
intuitive feel for what
statistics is about.

9
00:00:22,414 --> 00:00:27,169
And essentially -- well in very
general terms it's kind of

10
00:00:27,169 --> 00:00:28,590
getting your head around data.

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,540
And it can broadly
be classified.

12
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,640
Well there are maybe
three categories.

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,330
You have descriptive.

14
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,150
So say you have a lot of data
and you wanted to tell someone

15
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,480
about it without giving
them all of the data.

16
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,360
Maybe you can kind of find
indicative numbers that

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,560
somehow represent all of
that data without having to

18
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,540
go over all of the data.

19
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,370
That would be
descriptive statistics.

20
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,510
There's also predictive.

21
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,110
Well, I'll kind of
group them together.

22
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,110
There's inferential statistics.

23
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,908
And this is when you use
data to essentially make

24
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,200
conclusions about things.

25
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,500
So let's say you've sampled
some data from a population --

26
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,890
and we'll talk a lot about
samples versus populations but

27
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,390
I think you have just a basic
sense of what that is, right?

28
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,800
If I survey three people
who are going to vote for

29
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,500
president, I clearly haven't
surveyed the entire population.

30
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,160
I've surveyed a sample.

31
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,780
But what inferential statistics
are all about are if we can do

32
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,890
some math on the samples, maybe
we can make inferences or

33
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,740
conclusions about the
population as a whole.

34
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,760
Well, anyway, that's just
a big picture of what

35
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,800
statistics is all about.

36
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,620
Let's just get into the
meat of it and we'll start

37
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,746
with the descriptive.

38
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:41,012
So the first thing that, I
don't know, that I would want

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,330
to do or I think most people
would want to do when they are

40
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:47,320
given a whole set of numbers in
they're told to describe it.

41
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,030
Well, maybe I can come up with
some number that is most

42
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,430
indicative of all of the
numbers in that set.

43
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,092
Or some number that represents,
kind of, the central tendency

44
00:01:57,092 --> 00:01:59,900
-- this is a word you'll see
a lot in statistics books.

45
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,040
The central tendency
of a set of numbers.

46
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,375
And this is also
called the average.

47
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,780
And I'll be a little bit more
exact here than I normally am

48
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,060
with the word "average." When I
talk about it in this context,

49
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,090
it just means that the average
is a number that somehow

50
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,640
is giving us a sense of
the central tendency.

51
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,430
Or maybe a number that is most
representative of a set.

52
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,030
And I know that sounds all
very abstract but let's

53
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,870
do a couple of examples.

54
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,850
So there's a bunch of ways
that you can actually measure

55
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,200
the central tendency or the
average of a set of numbers.

56
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,950
And you've probably
seen these before.

57
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,534
They are the mean.

58
00:02:40,534 --> 00:02:42,960
And actually, there's types
of means but we'll stick

59
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,040
with the arithmetic mean.

60
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,810
geometric means and maybe we'll
cover the harmonic

61
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,040
mean one day.

62
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:02,640
There's a mean, the
median, and the mode.

63
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,050
And in statistics speak,
these all can kind of be

64
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,620
representative of a data sets
or population central tendency

65
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,650
or a sample central tendency.

66
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,590
And they all are collectively
-- they can all be

67
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,070
forms of an average.

68
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,520
And I think when we see
examples, it'll make a

69
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,470
little bit more sense.

70
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:23,440
In every day speak, when people
talk about an average, I think

71
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,100
you've already computed
averages in your life, they're

72
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,710
usually talking about
the arithmetic mean.

73
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,320
So normally when someone says,
"Let's take the average of

74
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,530
these numbers." And they expect
you to do something, they want

75
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,470
you to figure out the
arithmetic mean.

76
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,490
They don't want you figure
out the median or the mode.

77
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,780
But before we go any further,
let's figure out what

78
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,110
these things are.

79
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,230
Let me make up a
set of numbers.

80
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,630
Let's say I have the number 1.

81
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:50,220
Let's say I have
another 1, a 2, a 3.

82
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,885
Let's say I have a 4.

83
00:03:52,885 --> 00:03:55,410
That's good enough.

84
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,370
We just want a simple example.

85
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:02,650
So the mean or the arithmetic
mean is probably what you're

86
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,710
most familiar with when
people talk about average.

87
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,600
And that's essentially -- you
add up all the numbers and you

88
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,160
divide by the numbers
that there are.

89
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:16,290
So in this case, it would be 1
plus 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4.

90
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,420
And you're going to divide
by one, two, three,

91
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,020
four, five numbers.

92
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:21,540
It's what?

93
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,470
1 plus 1 is 2.

94
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,600
2 plus 2 is 4.

95
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,640
4 plus 3 is 7.

96
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,500
7 plus 4 is 11.

97
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,550
So this is equal to 11/5.

98
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,040
That's what?

99
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,410
That's 2 1/5?

100
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:38,320
So that's equal to 2.2.

101
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,560
And so someone could
say, "Hey, you know.

102
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,060
That is a pretty
good representative

103
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,490
number of this set.

104
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,680
That's the number that all of
these numbers you can kind of

105
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,390
say are closest to." Or, 2.2
represents the central

106
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,140
tendency of this set.

107
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,400
And in common speak, that
would be the average.

108
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,450
But if we're being a little
bit more particular, this

109
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,410
is the arithmetic mean
of this set of numbers.

110
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,740
And you see it kind
of represents them.

111
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,210
If I didn't want to give you
the list of five numbers, I

112
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,030
could say, "Well, you know, I
have a set of five numbers and

113
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,680
their mean is 2.2." It kind of
tells you a little bit of at

114
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,900
least, you know, where
the numbers are.

115
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,510
We'll talk a little bit more
about how do you know how far

116
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:12,500
the numbers are from that mean
in probably the next video.

117
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,840
So that's one measure.

118
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,150
Another measure, instead of
averaging it in this way, you

119
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,510
can average it by putting the
numbers in order, which

120
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,460
I actually already did.

121
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,340
So let's just write them
down in order again.

122
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,810
1, 1, 2, 3, 4.

123
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,490
And you just take
the middle number.

124
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,790
So let's see, there's one, two,
three, four, five numbers.

125
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,010
So the middle number's going
to be right here, right?

126
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:34,940
The middle number is 2.

127
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,240
There's two numbers greater
than 2 and there's two

128
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,610
numbers less than 2.

129
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,720
And this is called the median.

130
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,560
So it's actually very
little computation.

131
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,440
You just have to essentially
sort the numbers.

132
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,620
And then you find whatever
number where you have an

133
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,260
equal number greater than
or less than that number.

134
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,430
So the median of this set is 2.

135
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,010
And you see, I mean,
that's actually fairly

136
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,320
close to the mean.

137
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,020
And there's no right answer.

138
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,550
One of these isn't a better
answer for the average.

139
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,890
They're just different ways
of measuring the average.

140
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:05,020
So here it's the median.

141
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,980
And I know what you might be
thinking. "Well, that was

142
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,640
easy enough when we
had five numbers.

143
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,160
What if we had six numbers?"
What if it was like this?

144
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,260
What if this was our
set of numbers?

145
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:19,880
1, 1, 2, 3, let's add
another 4 there.

146
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,660
So now, there's no
middle number, right?

147
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,870
I mean 2 is not the middle
number because there's two less

148
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,600
than and three larger than it.

149
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,820
And then 3's not the middle
number because there's three

150
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,530
larger and -- sorry, there's
two larger and three

151
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,550
smaller than it.

152
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,990
So there's no middle number.

153
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,390
So when you have a set with
even numbers and someone tells

154
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,500
you to figure out the median,
what you do is you take the

155
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:43,750
middle two numbers and then you
take the arithmetic mean

156
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,050
of those two numbers.

157
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:50,770
So in this case of this set,
the median would be 2.5.

158
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:51,730
Fair enough.

159
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,020
But let's put this aside
because I want to compare the

160
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,680
median and the means and the
modes for the same

161
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,620
set of numbers.

162
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,160
But that's a good thing to
know because sometimes it

163
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,340
can be a little confusing.

164
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,760
And these are all definitions.

165
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,930
These are all kind of
mathematical tools for getting

166
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,470
our heads around numbers.

167
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,720
It's not like one day someone
saw one of these formulas on

168
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,660
the face of the sun and says,
"Oh, that's part of the

169
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,980
universe that this is how the
average should be calculated."

170
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,380
These are human constructs to
kind of just get our heads

171
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,110
around large sets of data.

172
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,670
This isn't a large set of data,
but instead of five numbers, if

173
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,760
we had five million numbers,
you can imagine if you don't

174
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,780
like thinking about every
number individually.

175
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,640
Anyway, before I talk more
about that, let me tell

176
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,410
you what the mode is.

177
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,200
And the mode to some degree,
it's the one I think most

178
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,650
people probably forget or never
learn and when they see it on

179
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,930
an exam, it confuses them
because they're like, "Oh, that

180
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:45,420
sounds very advanced." But in
some ways, it is the easiest of

181
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:49,450
all of the measures of central
tendency or of average.

182
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:53,810
The mode is essentially what
number is most common in a set.

183
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,220
So in this example, there's
two 1's and then there's one

184
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,510
of everything else, right?

185
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,230
So the mode here is 1.

186
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,840
So mode is the most
common number.

187
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,890
And then you could kind of
say, "Whoa, hey Sal, what

188
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:05,880
if this was our set?

189
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:11,620
1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4." Here I have
two 1's and I have two 4's.

190
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,040
And this is where the mode gets
a little bit tricky because

191
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,810
either of these would have been
a decent answer for the mode.

192
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:20,270
You could have actually said
the mode of this is 1 or the

193
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,135
mode of this is 4 and it gets
a little bit ambiguous.

194
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:24,840
And you probably want
a little clarity from

195
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,790
the person asking you.

196
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,510
Most times on a test when they
ask you, there's not going

197
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,190
to be this ambiguity.

198
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:33,164
There will be a most
common number in the set.

199
00:08:33,164 --> 00:08:35,950
So now it's like oh, well you
know, why wasn't just one

200
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:36,900
of these good enough?

201
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,490
You know why we learned
averages, why don't

202
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,270
we just use averages?

203
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,220
Or why don't we use arithmetic
mean all the time?

204
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,080
What's median and
mode good for?

205
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,890
Well, I'll try to do one
example of that and see if

206
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,710
it rings true with you.

207
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,020
And then you can think
a little bit more.

208
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,950
Let's say I had this
set of numbers.

209
00:08:53,950 --> 00:09:04,350
3, 3, 3, 3, 3, and,
I don't know, 100.

210
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,960
So what's the
arithmetic mean here?

211
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,070
I have one, two, three,
four, five 3's and 100.

212
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:17,350
So it would be 115
divided by 6, right?

213
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,090
I could have one, two, three,
four, five, six numbers.

214
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,990
115 is just the sum
of all of these.

215
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:27,270
So that's equal to -- how many
times does 6 go into 115?

216
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,600
6 goes into it one time.

217
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,520
1 times 6 is 6.

218
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,320
55 goes into it 9 times.

219
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,370
9 times 6 is 54.

220
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,950
So it's equal to 19 1/6.

221
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,470
Fair enough.

222
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,610
I just added all the
numbers and divided by

223
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,150
how many there are.

224
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,840
But my question is, is this
really representative

225
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,560
of this set?

226
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,740
I mean, I have a ton of 3's
and then I have 100 all of a

227
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,270
sudden, and we're saying that
the central tendency is 19 1/6.

228
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,610
And, I mean, 19 1/6 doesn't
really seem indicative

229
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,080
of the set.

230
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,390
I mean maybe it does, depending
on your application, but it

231
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,850
just seems a little
bit off, right?

232
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,800
I mean, my intuition would be
that the central tendency is

233
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,660
something closer to 3 because
there's a lot of 3's here.

234
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,770
So what would the
median tell us?

235
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,720
I already put these
numbers in order, right?

236
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,375
If I give it to you out of
order, you'd want to put it

237
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,480
in this order and you'd say
what's the middle number?

238
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,375
Let's see, the middle two
numbers, since I have an

239
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,410
even number, are 3 and 3.

240
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,890
So if I take the average of
3 and 3 -- or I should be

241
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:21,820
particular with my language.

242
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:26,800
If I take the arithmetic
mean of 3 and 3, I get 3.

243
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,390
And this is maybe a better
measurement of the central

244
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:34,400
tendency or of the average of
this set of numbers, right?

245
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,120
Essentially, what it does is by
taking the median, I wasn't so

246
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,720
much affected by this really
large number that's very

247
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,080
different than the others.

248
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,765
In statistics they
call that an outlier.

249
00:10:43,765 --> 00:10:47,010
A number that, you know, if you
talked about average home

250
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:51,580
prices, maybe every house in
the city is $100,000 and then

251
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,140
there's one house that
costs $1 trillion.

252
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,120
And then if someone told you
the average house price was, I

253
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,440
don't know, $1 million, you
might have a very wrong

254
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,760
perception of that city.

255
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,640
But the median house price
would be $100,000 and you get

256
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,440
a better sense of what the
houses in that city are like.

257
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,720
So similarly, this median,
maybe, gives you a better

258
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,820
sense of what the numbers
in this set are like.

259
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,550
Because the arithmetic mean
was skewed by this, what

260
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,030
they call an outlier.

261
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,990
And being able to tell what
an outlier is, it's kind of

262
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:22,130
one of those things that a
statistician will say, well,

263
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,110
I know it when I see it.

264
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,450
There isn't really a formal
definition for it but it tends

265
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,290
to be a number that really kind
of sticks out and sometimes

266
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,190
it's due to, you know, a
measurement error or whatever.

267
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,020
And then finally, the mode.

268
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,310
What is the most common
number in this set?

269
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,590
Well there's five 3's
and there's 100.

270
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,440
So the most common number
is, once again, it's a 3.

271
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,905
So in this case, when you had
this outlier, the median and

272
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:46,700
the mode tend to be, you know,
maybe they're a little bit

273
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,650
better about giving you an
indication of what these

274
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:51,650
numbers represent.

275
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,220
Maybe this was just a
measurement error.

276
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,370
But I don't know, we
don't actually know

277
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,250
what these represent.

278
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,530
If these are house prices, then
I would argue that these are

279
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:00,700
probably more indicative
measures of what the

280
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,050
houses in a area cost.

281
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,520
But if this is something else,
if this is scores on a test,

282
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,850
maybe, you know, maybe there is
one kid in the class -- one out

283
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,750
of six kids who did really,
really well and everyone

284
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,410
else didn't study.

285
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:13,680
And this is more indicative
of, kind of, how students at

286
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,680
that level do on average.

287
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,830
Anyway, I'm done talking
about all of this.

288
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,430
And I encourage you to play
with a lot of numbers and deal

289
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,460
with the concepts yourself.

290
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,960
In the next video, we'll
explore more descriptive

291
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,480
statistics.

292
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,510
Instead of talking about the
central tendency, we'll talk

293
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,410
about how spread apart things
are away from the

294
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,520
central tendency.

295
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,370
See you in the next video.
