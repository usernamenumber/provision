1
00:00:00,952 --> 00:00:05,000
Problem number 1: at time t, a particle moving in the xy-plane

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,800
is at position (x(t), y(t)), where x(t) and y(t)

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,502
are not explicitly given.

4
00:00:11,764 --> 00:00:14,141
For t is greater than or equal to 0,

5
00:00:14,141 --> 00:00:17,390
the derivative of x with respect to t is 4t+1

6
00:00:17,667 --> 00:00:21,797
the derivative of y with respect to t is sin(t^2)

7
00:00:21,797 --> 00:00:26,240
and at time t=0, x(0)=0 and y(0)=-4

8
00:00:26,378 --> 00:00:28,800
Fair enough, let's do part a.

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,610
Find the speed of the particle at time t=3,

10
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:37,067
and find the acceleration vector of the particle at

11
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:40,533
time t is equal to 3 as well.

12
00:00:40,533 --> 00:00:45,333
So, the speed is really just the magnitude of the velocity vector.

13
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,137
So what's the velocity vector?

14
00:00:47,137 --> 00:00:50,979
Our velocity vector as a function of time

15
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:55,890
is going to be equal to the derivative of our x position

16
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,467
as a function of time, or we could say the velocity in the x-direction

17
00:00:59,467 --> 00:01:06,887
times the i unit vector, plus the velocity in the y-direction times the j unit vector.

18
00:01:06,887 --> 00:01:08,383
I just wrote this in engineering notation,

19
00:01:08,383 --> 00:01:12,307
obviously there are many ways that you could specify a vector.

20
00:01:12,307 --> 00:01:15,800
And, in this case, x'(t), they've already given it to us:

21
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,000
x'(t) is 4t+1

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,333
they just wrote it as dx/dt.

23
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:27,005
So this over here is 4t+1 times the i unit vector,

24
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:31,467
and then this here, this y'(t), they gave it to us

25
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:33,933
the derivative of y with respect to t is sin(t^2).

26
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:41,800
So, plus sin(t^2) times the j unit vector.

27
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,502
That is our velocity vector. So what is our velocity-

28
00:01:46,502 --> 00:01:49,134
or this is our velocity vector as a function of time,

29
00:01:49,134 --> 00:01:53,185
So what is our velocity at time t=3?

30
00:01:53,400 --> 00:02:01,000
Well, we just have to substitute 3 for t, so 4(3)+1 is 13i.

31
00:02:01,123 --> 00:02:11,216
Plus 3 squared- 3 squared is 9 -sine of 9. Plus sin9j.

32
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:15,000
Our speed, what they want us to figure out is going to be

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,200
equal to- or maybe I should write it as our speed at time 3

34
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:26,400
-our speed is going to be equal to the magnitude of our velocity vector at time 3,

35
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:34,933
which is equal to the magnitude of 13i+(sin9)j.

36
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:40,133
And then this we literally, this is, we use essentially the Pythagorean Theorem

37
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:41,133
to find the magnitude.

38
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:47,400
This is going to be equal to the square root of 169 (that's 13 squared)

39
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:55,746
plus (sin9)^2. So let me get my TI-85 out.

40
00:02:55,961 --> 00:03:00,048
This part of the exam we are allowed to use calculators.

41
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:15,058
So we get the square root of 169+(sin9)^2.

42
00:03:15,535 --> 00:03:18,608
Alright, that's 13 squared plus sin9 squared.

43
00:03:18,885 --> 00:03:24,133
And, we get- we get 13.00- I'll just round it to 7,

44
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:27,513
just to show that we didn't get just straight up 13,

45
00:03:27,513 --> 00:03:30,067
that the sin9 squared did do something.

46
00:03:30,067 --> 00:03:33,255
So 13.007.

47
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:38,384
So this is approximately equal to 13.007.

48
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,381
So we've answered the first part.

49
00:03:40,381 --> 00:03:45,200
The speed of the particle at time t=3 is 13.007.

50
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,933
Then they want us to find the acceleration vector of the particle at time t=3.

51
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:58,214
So the acceleration vector as a function of time is just going to be the second derivative of x

52
00:03:58,214 --> 00:04:01,733
with respect to t, or you'd say the acceleration in the x-direction

53
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:06,769
as a function as a function of time times i, plus the acceleration in the y-direction.

54
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:11,472
So it's the second derivative of y with respect to t in the j-direction.

55
00:04:11,472 --> 00:04:14,676
And this, of course, is just going to be equal to

56
00:04:14,676 --> 00:04:19,800
the derivative of x of- the derivative of x- the second derivative of x(t) is just the derivative of

57
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,667
the first derivative. So the first derivative is 4t+1,

58
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:25,892
you take the derivative of that, you just get 4.

59
00:04:26,215 --> 00:04:34,067
So, we get 4i plus... and then the derivative- the second derivative, or the second derivative of y with respect to t

60
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:35,733
is just the derivative of the first derivative.

61
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:39,963
The derivative- the first derivative is sin(t^2), so

62
00:04:39,963 --> 00:04:48,554
derivative of that is going to be 2t*cos(t^2), and of course we have our j.

63
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:52,400
We have our j right over there and I just did this from the chain rule.

64
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,533
The derivative of t^2 with respect to t is 2t,

65
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:04,733
derivative of sin(t^2) with respect to t^2 is cos(t^2).

66
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:08,440
And so that is the acceleration vector as a function of t

67
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,400
but they care at time t is equal to 3.

68
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:17,795
So, 4 still stays 4, then you have 2(3)+cos(9).

69
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:21,733
So let me write this, this is going to be our acceleration vector

70
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:24,667
our acceleration vector at time 3 is going to be

71
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:32,733
4i plus... and let's just put, if this is 2 times 3, which is 6...

72
00:05:35,225 --> 00:05:38,547
(6cos9)j.

73
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:42,575
Let's get the calculator out so we actually get a value there

74
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:45,242
since they allow us to use or almost want us to use a calculator here.

75
00:05:45,242 --> 00:05:56,133
So, 6cos9 is negative 5.47, or 5.467 if we want.

76
00:05:56,133 --> 00:06:02,400
So, plus negative- oh, what was I doing, this is j

77
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,333
-so plus -5.467j.

78
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,867
So that is our acceleration vector.

79
00:06:09,867 --> 00:06:12,410
And once again, I wrote it in engineering notation

80
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,800
(which I'm sure the advanced placement exam people wouldn't mind)

81
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,733
but you could also write it in kind-of

82
00:06:20,102 --> 00:06:23,533
the paramiterized vector notation or your ordered-pair notation as a vector

83
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:27,733
you could say that the acceleration vector at time 3

84
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:29,067
you could write it this way too:

85
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:33,369
<4, -5.467>

86
00:06:33,369 --> 00:06:34,933
These are really specifying the same thing.

87
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:36,133
This is the x-component of the vector,

88
00:06:36,133 --> 00:06:38,000
this is the y-component of the vector.

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,221
This is the x-component of the vector,

90
00:06:39,221 --> 00:06:41,817
this is the y-component of the vector.
