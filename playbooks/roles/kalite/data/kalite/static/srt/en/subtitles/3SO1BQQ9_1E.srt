1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,900
We're asked: Do the points
on the graph

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,290
below represent a function?

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:09,140
So in order for the points to
represent a function, for

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,610
every input into our function,
we can only get one value.

5
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,990
So if we look here, they've
graphed the point--it looks

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,340
like negative 1, 3, so that's
the point negative 1, 3.

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,740
So if we assume that this is our
x-axis, and that is our f(x)

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,540
axis -- 
and I'm just assuming it's a function,

9
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,320
I don't know whether it really
is just now, this point is

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,820
telling us that if you put
negative 1 into our function,

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,760
or that thing that might be
a function, or maybe our

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,520
relation, you'll get a 3 So
it's telling us that f(x) of

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,580
negative 1 is equal to 3.

14
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,220
So far it could be a reasonable
function.

15
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,960
You give me negative 1 and
I will map it to 3.

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,720
Then they have if x is 2, then
our value is negative 2.

17
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,500
This is the point 2, negative
2, so that still seems

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,510
consistent with being
a function.

19
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:01,170
If you pass me 2, I will map
you or I will point you to

20
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,560
negative 2.

21
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,930
Seems fair enough.

22
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,230
Let's see this next
value here.

23
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:09,250
This is the point 3,
2 right there.

24
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,190
So once again, that says that,
look, if you give me 3 into my

25
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,800
function, into my black box,
I will output a 2.

26
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,780
Pretty reasonable.

27
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,200
No reason why these points
can't represent

28
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,970
a function so far.

29
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:28,480
Now, what about when we input
4 into the function?

30
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,720
Let me do this in magenta.

31
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,440
So what happens if I input
4 into my function?

32
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,390
So this is 4 right here.

33
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:38,120
Well, according to these points,
there's two points

34
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,440
that relate to 4 -- that
4 can be mapped to.

35
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,900
I could map it to the
point 4, 5.

36
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,720
So that says if you give me
a 4, I'll give you a 5.

37
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:54,130
But it also says if you give me
a 4, I could also give you

38
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:58,330
a negative 1 because that's
the point 4, negative 1. So

39
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,030
this is not a function.

40
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,250
It cannot be a function if for
some input into the function

41
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,460
you could give me two
different values.

42
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,560
And you can see that
right here.

43
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,800
And an easy test is to just
see, look, for one value I

44
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,900
have two points for
this relationship.

45
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,940
So this cannot be a function.

46
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:20,060
So this is not a function!

47
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,320
I'll put an exclamation mark.
