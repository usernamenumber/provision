1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,960
   

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,700
Let's try to get our heads
around the idea of divergence.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,890
So first, like I did with
gradients, I'll show you the

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,050
mechanics, which are actually
pretty straightforward.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,280
And then I'll try to
give you the intuition.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,036
And once you have the
intuition, at first it

7
00:00:14,036 --> 00:00:16,820
will seemed very, I don't
know, unintuitive, maybe.

8
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,610
But it once you get it,
you're like oh, that's it.

9
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:21,380
So let's see what
divergence is.

10
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,870
Let's say I have
a vector field.

11
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,920
And let's say this vector
field, just for the purposes

12
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,320
of visualization it could be
anything, but let's say it

13
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,130
represents the velocity of
particles of fluid of any

14
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,650
point in two dimensions.

15
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,690
So it's going to be a
two-dimensional vector field.

16
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,860
It's going to be a function of
x and y, so the velocity at any

17
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:50,140
point-- it's a vector field --
let's say it is, and I'm just

18
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,880
going to make up something.

19
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:57,670
Let's say it's x squared, yi.

20
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,760
   

21
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,710
So at any point in the
x-direction, at any point x

22
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,730
comma y, its velocity in the
x-direction will

23
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:07,860
be x squared, y.

24
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,230
And then its velocity in the
y-direction, I don't know

25
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,080
maybe it's just 3y, j.

26
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,920
   

27
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,240
That's its velocity
in the x-direction.

28
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,310
So its velocity in the
x-direction is actually

29
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,680
a function of x and y.

30
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,475
its velocity in the y-direction
is just a function of y.

31
00:01:26,475 --> 00:01:29,030
So what is the divergence?

32
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,090
So a couple of ways
we can write it.

33
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,560
The correct way to write
it is the divergence of

34
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,170
our vector field, v.

35
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,610
But a common mnemonic to
remember the operation of

36
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:48,820
diverge and is to write the
upside down triangle, which was

37
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,270
the same notation we used for
gradient, but take the dot

38
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,630
product of that and the vector.

39
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,980
And if you remember from the
gradient discussion, we said

40
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:04,240
that you can view, although
it's kind of an abuse of

41
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,440
notation, but you could view
this upside down triangle as

42
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:16,070
being equal to the partial
derivative with respect to x in

43
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:20,330
the x-direction plus the
partial derivative with respect

44
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:25,320
to y in the y-direction,
which is the j-unit vector.

45
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,180
And then if we went to three
dimensions, the partial

46
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,170
derivative with respect to
z and the k-direction,

47
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:29,870
et cetera, et cetera.

48
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,590
But we're dealing with a
two-dimensional vector here,

49
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,700
so let's just stick with
two dimensions, x and y.

50
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,720
So what would this
turn out to be?

51
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:45,520
If you took the dot product of
this, which is this upside down

52
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,720
triangle, with this vector
field, what would you get?

53
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,650
Well, you would just get the
partial derivative of the x

54
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:56,150
dimension with respect to x, so
you would get-- it's actually

55
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,950
pretty straight forward to
memorize; you might not even

56
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:01,360
need this mnemonic right here,
this abuse of notation; you

57
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,990
might just know it off hand
--the x component, you take the

58
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,683
partial derivative with respect
to x, and the y component, you

59
00:03:07,683 --> 00:03:09,470
take the partial derivative
with respect to y.

60
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,430
But I'll show you why it
looks like the dot product.

61
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,790
So if you took the dot product
of that and that, it would be

62
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:18,310
the partial derivative with
respect to x of that

63
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:26,500
expression, of x squared, y and
then plus the partial

64
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:33,170
derivative with respect to y of
that second expression, the y

65
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:39,930
component of 3y, and then
you would evaluate it.

66
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,950
What's the partial derivative
of this with respect to x?

67
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:46,410
We just pretended y is a
constant, just a number, so

68
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,670
the derivative of this with
respect to x, would be

69
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,340
2x times the constant.

70
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:58,810
So it'll be 2xy plus-- what's
the partial derivative

71
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,460
of 3y with respect to y?

72
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,295
Well, there's nothing else to
hold constant, so it's just

73
00:04:02,295 --> 00:04:03,930
like taking the derivative
with respect to y

74
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,340
--so it's 2y plus 3.

75
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,070
So this is the divergence
at a point x, y.

76
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,290
You could almost view it
as a function of x and y.

77
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,170
So you could almost say you
know, that the divergence of

78
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:20,310
v-- I'm going to make up some
notation here --as long as you

79
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,870
get the point across, you can
say that the divergence

80
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,470
of v, that this is a
function of x and y.

81
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,760
That we just have an expression
that if you give me a point

82
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,290
anywhere in this vector
field, I can tell you the

83
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,430
divergence at that point.

84
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,640
So I think you'll find that
the computation of divergence

85
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,910
isn't too difficult.

86
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,260
You just take the partial
derivative of the x component

87
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,550
with respect to x, and you add
that to the partial derivative

88
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,480
to the y component
with respect to y.

89
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,450
And if you had the z, you
would do the same thing,

90
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,580
so on and so forth.

91
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,130
Actually, let me do just do one
more just hit the point home,

92
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,375
and then we'll work
on intuition.

93
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:57,650
   

94
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:02,170
So if I said that I had, I
don't know, let's say, my

95
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:10,455
vector field is cosine of yi
plus-- so it's interesting; my

96
00:05:10,455 --> 00:05:14,980
x-direction is dependent on
my y-coordinate --plus, I

97
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:20,040
don't know, e to the xyj.

98
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,780
   

99
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,820
So then oh, that's difficult
because I have these

100
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,210
e's and these cosines.

101
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,770
But we'll see; if you just
keep your head straight on

102
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,150
what's constant and what's
not, it's not too bad.

103
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:41,230
So the divergence of v is equal
to the partial derivative

104
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,080
of this expression
with respect to x.

105
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,050
Well, what's the derivative
of this with respect to x?

106
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,200
If y is just a constant,
cosine of y is just a number.

107
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,670
So the derivative of this with
respect to x is just 0 plus--

108
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,110
what's the derivative of
this with respect to y?

109
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,660
Well, you could just do x,
since it's a constant,

110
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,130
as the coefficient on y.

111
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:05,590
So the derivative of x, y
with respect to y is just x.

112
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:09,830
And then the derivative of e
to anything is e to anything.

113
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,670
I just did the chain rule.

114
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,430
e to the x, y.

115
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,100
And so that is the divergence.

116
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,130
So you could just ignore this.

117
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,490
It's x, e to the x, y.

118
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:21,360
One thing to immediately
realize, even before we work on

119
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:28,400
the intuition, is when we did
gradient I gave you a surface

120
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,980
and it gave us a vector field.

121
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:36,700
Or I gave you a scalar field
and you got a vector field.

122
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,250
When you take the divergence of
something, you're going in the

123
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,310
opposite direction,
in some ways.

124
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,420
You start with the
vector field, right?

125
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,170
And what's a factor field?

126
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,770
It's something that if you
give me any point x and y,

127
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:47,810
I'll give you a vector.

128
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,830
So if you wanted to graph it,
in the x, y plane you'd have a

129
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,120
bunch of vectors, and I'll show
you how that looks in a second

130
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,200
when we go over to intuition.

131
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,040
Well, when you take the
divergence of it, you get a

132
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,000
value for any point x, y.

133
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,080
So even though a vector field
has all these vectors on it,

134
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,180
the divergence tells you an
actual scalar number at

135
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,180
any point in the field.

136
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,950
So let's get a little bit
of intuition of what a

137
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:16,050
divergence actually is.

138
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,040
Let me do it in one dimension.

139
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,770
Or we can even, let's do it
in two dimensions, but I'll

140
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,600
make it constant in the y.

141
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,010
So let's say that my-- let me
erase this; I'll probably

142
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:28,270
need some space.

143
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,270
OK, oh, I didn't want
to do that dot.

144
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:35,250
OK let's say the velocity of
fluid, or the particles in

145
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:40,180
fluid, at any point in the x, y
plane, let's say it is equal to

146
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:51,140
5xi plus, I don't know, 0y--
there's never any, sorry --0j,

147
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,510
right? j is the unit vector
in the y-direction.

148
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:56,190
So there's never a y component
to the velocity vector.

149
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,250
So what would that look like?

150
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,570
I don't need a computer
to draw this.

151
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:03,480
I can handle this
one myself I think.

152
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,250
So if that's the y-axis,
that's my x-axis.

153
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,400
   

154
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,200
So when x is equal-- I'll just
sample some points and draw

155
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:19,740
some vectors --when x is equal
to 1-- let's say x is 1 there

156
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,580
--what's the magnitude
of this vector?

157
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:26,740
It'll be 5, right?

158
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,730
Actually, let me make this a
different number, because

159
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:30,620
it'll make it hard to do.

160
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,070
Let's make this 1/2 x.

161
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,980
So when x is 1, the magnitude
of my vector is 1/2.

162
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,850
Only in the x-direction.

163
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,480
It has no y component;
ignore this right here.

164
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,460
It's 1/2xi plus 0j.

165
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,000
Or you could just say 1/2xi.

166
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,180
And when x is equal to 2-- I
could have picked any points,

167
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,600
but I'm just picking the
numbers that's easy to

168
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,020
calculate --when x is equal to
2, what is the magnitude

169
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,650
of the vector?

170
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:55,420
It's 1/2 times 2, which is 1.

171
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,870
So it's going to
be twice as big.

172
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:03,350
   

173
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,160
And remember, if I have a
particle right here in my

174
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,680
fluid, if this is a particle,
its velocity in the x-direction

175
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,010
is going to be 1 meter
per second to the right.

176
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:17,850
If I have a particle here, it's
velocity in the x-direction

177
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,160
is going to be 1/2 a meter
per second to the right.

178
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,720
Let's just do one more point.

179
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,820
So let's say that
x is equal to 3.

180
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,740
What's my velocity
to the right?

181
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,210
I'll do it in a different
color just so that you

182
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,310
don't get confused.

183
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,440
There's going to be 3/2; it's
going to be even longer.

184
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:40,600
   

185
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,550
But the general idea here,
and as we move up in x it

186
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,710
doesn't change much, right?

187
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,340
It doesn't change at all.

188
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,786
Our x value doesn't--

189
00:09:48,786 --> 00:09:49,660
[COUGHS].

190
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:54,280
So for any y, the magnitude
of the vector doesn't

191
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:54,760
change, right?

192
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,090
It's only dependent on x.

193
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:01,000
And then for example, here,
it'll be even longer.

194
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,950
If we draw the vector here
it'll be even longer, right?

195
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,150
If you do it here.

196
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:05,990
I think you get the point.

197
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,830
The further you go to the
right, the faster the particles

198
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,260
are moving towards the right.

199
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,030
So now let's try to get a
little bit of intuition.

200
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,870
Oh, I just realized that I ran
out of time, so I will continue

201
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,370
this in the next video.

202
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,000
