1
00:00:00,315 --> 00:00:02,123
Let's say you're me and you're in math class

2
00:00:02,123 --> 00:00:03,964
and you're supposed to be learning trigonometry

3
00:00:03,964 --> 00:00:05,622
but you're having trouble paying attention because

4
00:00:05,622 --> 00:00:07,879
is boring and stupid. This is not your fault.

5
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:09,307
It's not even your teacher's fault.

6
00:00:09,322 --> 00:00:12,576
It's pi's fault, because pi is wrong.

7
00:00:12,622 --> 00:00:15,999
I don't mean that pi is incorrect. The ratio of a circle's diameter

8
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:18,011
is still 3,14 and so on.

9
00:00:18,011 --> 00:00:21,231
I mean that pi, as a concept, is a terrible mistake

10
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:23,754
that has gone uncorrected for thousends of years.

11
00:00:23,754 --> 00:00:26,587
The problem with pi and pie days is the same as the problem with

12
00:00:26,587 --> 00:00:30,815
Columbus and Columbus day. Sure Christopher Columbus was a real person who did some stuff,

13
00:00:30,815 --> 00:00:34,249
but everything you learn about him in school is worked and overemphasised.

14
00:00:34,249 --> 00:00:39,281
He didn't discover America, he didn't discover the world was round, and he was a bit of a jerk.

15
00:00:39,281 --> 00:00:41,539
So why do we celebrate Columbus day?

16
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:44,180
Same with pi. You learn in school that pi is the all important

17
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,401
circle constant, and had to memorize a whole bunch of equations involving it.

18
00:00:47,401 --> 00:00:50,503
Because that's the way it's been taught for a very long time.

19
00:00:50,503 --> 00:00:53,858
If you found any of this equations confusing, it's not your fault,

20
00:00:53,858 --> 00:00:55,738
it's just that pi is wrong.

21
00:00:55,738 --> 00:00:57,317
Let me show you what I mean.

22
00:00:57,317 --> 00:00:59,530
Radians, good system for meassuring angles when

23
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,347
it comes to mathematics. It should make sense, but it doesn't

24
00:01:02,347 --> 00:01:04,069
because pi messes it up.

25
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:06,124
For example, how much pi is this?

26
00:01:06,124 --> 00:01:09,915
You might think this should be one pi, but it's not.

27
00:01:09,915 --> 00:01:13,778
The full 360Â° of pie is actually 2pi.

28
00:01:13,778 --> 00:01:14,846
What?

29
00:01:14,846 --> 00:01:16,815
Say I ask you how much pie you want, and you say pi/8.

30
00:01:16,815 --> 00:01:19,668
You'd think that should be an eight of a pie, but it's not.

31
00:01:19,668 --> 00:01:21,663
It's a sixteenth of a pie.

32
00:01:21,663 --> 00:01:23,254
That's confusing.

33
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,356
You may be thinking, come on Vi, it's a simple conversion,

34
00:01:26,356 --> 00:01:30,581
all you have to do is divide by 2. Or multiply by 2 if you're going the other way.

35
00:01:30,581 --> 00:01:33,901
So you just have to make sure... you pay... attention... to which way you star...

36
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:36,247
No! You're making excuses for pi.

37
00:01:36,247 --> 00:01:39,590
Mathemathics should be as elegant and beautiful as possible.

38
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,543
When you complicate something that should be as simple as

39
00:01:42,543 --> 00:01:44,468
1 pi equals 1 pie

40
00:01:44,468 --> 00:01:48,600
by adding all this conversions, something gets lost in translation.

41
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,620
But Vi, you ask, is there a better way?

42
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,975
Well for this particular example there's an easy answer

43
00:01:53,975 --> 00:01:57,324
for what you'd have to do to make a pie be one pi instead of 2pi.

44
00:01:57,324 --> 00:02:01,484
You can redefine pi to be 2pi. Or 6,28 and so on.

45
00:02:01,484 --> 00:02:05,635
But I don't want to redefine pi because that would be confusing.

46
00:02:05,635 --> 00:02:07,410
So let's use a different letter: tau.

47
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,716
Because tau looks kind of like pi.

48
00:02:09,716 --> 00:02:13,319
A full circle would be one tau, a half circle would be a half tau. Or tau/2.

49
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:18,973
And if you want 1/16 of this pie, you want tau/16.

50
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:21,047
That would be simple.

51
00:02:21,047 --> 00:02:25,414
But Vi, you say, that seems rather arbitrary. Sure tau makes radians easier

52
00:02:25,414 --> 00:02:29,543
but it would be annoying to have to convert between tau and pi everytime you wanna work in radians.

53
00:02:29,543 --> 00:02:33,414
True, but the way of mathematics is to make stuff up and see what happens.

54
00:02:33,414 --> 00:02:36,068
So let's see what happens if we use tau in other equations.

55
00:02:36,068 --> 00:02:40,752
Math classes make you memorize stuff like this, so you can draw graph like this.

56
00:02:40,752 --> 00:02:43,951
I mean, sure you can derive this values everytime, but you don't,

57
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:49,515
because is easier to just memorize it, or use your calculator, because pi and radians are confusing.

58
00:02:49,515 --> 00:02:54,080
This appaling notation makes us forget what the sin wave actually represents,

59
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,075
which is how high this point is when gone whoever far around this unit circle.

60
00:02:58,075 --> 00:03:01,418
When your radians are notated horrificly, all of trigonometry

61
00:03:01,418 --> 00:03:05,115
becomes ugly. But it doesn't have to be this way.

62
00:03:05,115 --> 00:03:06,667
What if we use tau?

63
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:09,299
Let's make a sin wave starting with tau at zero.

64
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:12,025
The height of sin(tau) is also 0.

65
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,876
At tau/4 we've gone a quarter of the way around the circle.

66
00:03:14,876 --> 00:03:18,926
The height, or y value at this point is so obviously one when you don't

67
00:03:18,926 --> 00:03:24,405
have to do the extra step -- the "in your head" conversion of pi/2 is actually a quarter of a circle.

68
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:27,749
Tau/2, half a circle around, back at zero.

69
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,907
3/4 of tau, 3/4 of the way around, -1.

70
00:03:30,907 --> 00:03:33,751
A full turn brings us all the way back to zero. And bam!

71
00:03:33,751 --> 00:03:36,204
That just make sense. Why?

72
00:03:36,204 --> 00:03:38,755
Because we don't make circles using a diameter,

73
00:03:38,755 --> 00:03:40,837
we make circle using a radius.

74
00:03:40,837 --> 00:03:43,273
The length of the radius is the fundamental thing that

75
00:03:43,273 --> 00:03:46,312
determines the circunference of a circle, so why

76
00:03:46,312 --> 00:03:50,580
would we define the circle constant as a ratio of the diameter to the circunference.

77
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:55,593
Defining it by ratio of the radius of the circunference makes much more sense.

78
00:03:55,593 --> 00:03:57,364
And that's how you get our lovely tau.

79
00:03:57,364 --> 00:04:00,046
There's a boat load of important equations and identities where

80
00:04:00,046 --> 00:04:03,878
2pi shows up, which could and should be simplified to tau.

81
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:06,248
But Vi, you say, what about e to the i pi?

82
00:04:06,248 --> 00:04:09,168
Are you really suggesting we ruin it by making it

83
00:04:09,168 --> 00:04:12,037
e to the i tau/2 equals -1?

84
00:04:12,037 --> 00:04:14,421
To which I respond, who do you think I am?!

85
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:18,611
I would never suggest doing something so ghastly as killing Euler's identity.

86
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:20,905
Which, by the way, comes from the Euler's formula, which

87
00:04:20,905 --> 00:04:24,568
is e to the i theta equals cos theta plus i sin theta.

88
00:04:24,568 --> 00:04:27,037
Let's replace theta with tau.

89
00:04:27,037 --> 00:04:30,741
It's easy to remember that the sin or y value of a full tau turn

90
00:04:30,741 --> 00:04:34,845
of a unit circle is zero. So this is all zero.

91
00:04:34,845 --> 00:04:38,091
Cos of a full turn is the x value, which is 1.

92
00:04:38,091 --> 00:04:41,703
So check this out, e to the i tau equals one.

93
00:04:41,703 --> 00:04:43,262
What now!

94
00:04:43,262 --> 00:04:46,274
If you're still not convinced, I recomend reading the Tau manifesto

95
00:04:46,274 --> 00:04:48,974
by Michel Hartl, who does a pretty through job addressing

96
00:04:48,974 --> 00:04:51,846
every posible complains at tauday.com.

97
00:04:51,846 --> 00:04:54,081
If you still want to celebrate pie day, that's fine.

98
00:04:54,081 --> 00:04:56,078
You can have your pie and eat it.

99
00:04:56,078 --> 00:05:03,278
But I hope you all join me on June 28th, because I'll be making tau and eating too.

100
00:05:12,432 --> 00:05:16,368
I've got pie here and pie there, I'm pie-winning.
