1
00:00:00,508 --> 00:00:05,106
I've been drawing my indifference curves to look something like this.

2
00:00:05,106 --> 00:00:07,673
That's the vertical axis, that's one good.

3
00:00:07,673 --> 00:00:11,647
So this is the quantity of Good A. This is the quantity of Good B.

4
00:00:11,647 --> 00:00:14,571
And I've been drawing the indifference curves like this.

5
00:00:14,571 --> 00:00:16,977
So it might look like that. That's one indifference curve.

6
00:00:16,977 --> 00:00:18,974
Then another indifference curve would look like that.

7
00:00:18,974 --> 00:00:21,143
And I could keep drawing indifference curves.

8
00:00:21,143 --> 00:00:25,894
And this is what an indifference curve would look like for two normal goods.

9
00:00:25,894 --> 00:00:29,833
Let me write that down. These are normal goods.

10
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:32,653
And the reason why normal goods indifference curves would look like that

11
00:00:32,653 --> 00:00:36,113
are when I'm trying to figure out the combinations of two normal goods.

12
00:00:36,113 --> 00:00:41,150
Because if I have a lot of one good -- so at this point right over here I have a lot of Good A

13
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:46,443
and I have very little of Good B -- I would be willing to trade off a lot of A

14
00:00:46,443 --> 00:00:51,146
to get one extra of B. But if all of a sudden I have a lot of B

15
00:00:51,146 --> 00:00:58,485
and less A, I would be willing to trade off very little A to get an incremental B.

16
00:00:58,485 --> 00:01:03,841
So that's why we have kind of this inward bow-shaped curve right over here.

17
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:07,985
Or you could -- mathematically it looks like it's part of a hyperbola.

18
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:13,234
And so that's what "normal goods" - indifference curves, if we were trading off between normal goods, would look like.

19
00:01:13,234 --> 00:01:16,238
Now let's think about the indifference curve - so it would be this kind of curved thing.

20
00:01:16,238 --> 00:01:20,072
The marginal rate of substitution would constantly be changing.

21
00:01:20,072 --> 00:01:23,509
Now let's think about different types of goods.

22
00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:32,576
Let's say that this is the quantity of $5 bills.

23
00:01:32,576 --> 00:01:37,163
And let's say this is the quantity of $10 bills.

24
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:42,575
$10 bills. And we're talking about the actual -- the good now is actually the dollar bills.

25
00:01:42,575 --> 00:01:49,775
So let's say that this right over here is ten $5 bills.

26
00:01:49,775 --> 00:01:55,048
Well, that's 50 bucks. I'd be indifferent between that and five $10 bills.

27
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:59,100
This is five right over here. And any point in between I would be indifferent

28
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,150
because I'm always willing to trade off two $5 bills for one $10 bill.

29
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,985
So it would look -- my indifference curve would be linear in this case.

30
00:02:07,985 --> 00:02:13,243
My indifference curve would be linear.

31
00:02:13,243 --> 00:02:17,376
So, no matter what, on this indifference curve I'm always willing.

32
00:02:17,376 --> 00:02:23,659
If I want to get one extra $10 bill I'm always willing to give up two $5 bills, which makes complete sense.

33
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:27,780
Because two $5 bills are completely equivalent to one $10 bill.

34
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,446
Now we could take it to another extreme: let's say I have an indifference --

35
00:02:33,446 --> 00:02:44,325
let me draw the quantity of, I don't know, the quantity of M&M's.

36
00:02:44,325 --> 00:02:50,170
Let's say red M&M's.

37
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,510
And I should have done that in red, but I won't.

38
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,113
And let's say this is the quantity of blue M&M's.

39
00:02:55,113 --> 00:02:59,572
And let's say that I actually am indifferent between red and blue M&M's. Some people aren't.

40
00:02:59,572 --> 00:03:01,847
Red M&M's and blue M&M's.

41
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:07,335
So having 10 red M&M's to me is completely equivalent to having 10 blue M&M's.

42
00:03:07,335 --> 00:03:13,252
I'm willing to trade them off one for one. I don't care. I get the same total utility.

43
00:03:13,252 --> 00:03:15,842
I get the same total utility.

44
00:03:15,842 --> 00:03:20,579
So in this case, assuming that I really don't care the color of my M&M,

45
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:26,782
I am completely indifferent as I swap them out. And so this is a case of perfect substitutes.

46
00:03:26,782 --> 00:03:31,634
Perfect substitutes.

47
00:03:31,634 --> 00:03:38,783
Now, I'd always be happy to have more M&M's. So another indifference curve might look something like this.

48
00:03:38,783 --> 00:03:42,242
But it's always going to have a slope of negative one.

49
00:03:42,242 --> 00:03:47,983
I'm always giving up one red M&M to get one blue M&M, then I would be indifferent.

50
00:03:47,983 --> 00:03:52,834
And likewise over here you could have another indifference curve between $5 bills and $10 bills

51
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:55,655
that looks like this.

52
00:03:55,655 --> 00:03:58,920
But the slope would be the exact same thing.

53
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,921
Now, the last situation I want to think about is what we'll call perfect complements.

54
00:04:04,921 --> 00:04:09,241
So, goods that if you have one of them you really need the other one.

55
00:04:09,241 --> 00:04:12,375
Otherwise one of the two is somewhat useful.

56
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:21,517
And maybe the most pure version of perfect complements - let me write it over here.

57
00:04:21,517 --> 00:04:28,436
So let's say this is the quantity of Right shoes

58
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:33,444
and this is the quantity of Left shoes.

59
00:04:33,444 --> 00:04:38,922
So obviously, if we're just talking about just one pair, you have one of each.

60
00:04:38,922 --> 00:04:42,174
Now, do you really care if you get more left shoes?

61
00:04:42,174 --> 00:04:44,101
No. You have the exact same preference.

62
00:04:44,101 --> 00:04:46,784
It doesn't really change your life. You have the same total utility.

63
00:04:46,784 --> 00:04:49,243
In fact it might even be negative, because you have to store them all.

64
00:04:49,243 --> 00:04:52,174
But let's just assume you have the same total utility and you don't get any benefit

65
00:04:52,174 --> 00:04:55,851
of having those spare shoes, in case your shoe gets destroyed or anything like that.

66
00:04:55,851 --> 00:05:00,103
In terms of what you can get out of it, what you can wear, you get the same utility.

67
00:05:00,103 --> 00:05:06,510
And so you're really indifferent, no matter how many extra left shoes someone gives you.

68
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:12,317
And you'd also be indifferent no matter how many extra right shoes someone gives you.

69
00:05:12,317 --> 00:05:17,239
Now, you would be happier if you had maybe two right shoes and two left shoes,

70
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:21,745
because now you have two pairs. So this would be another indifference curve.

71
00:05:21,745 --> 00:05:27,176
And once again, if you have two right shoes you don't really care how many more than two left shoes you get.

72
00:05:27,176 --> 00:05:31,658
And if you have two left shoes you really don't care how many more than two right shoes you get.

73
00:05:31,658 --> 00:05:36,836
This indifference curve in green is clearly preferable to the one in white,

74
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:42,506
but along each indifference curve it doesn't benefit you to have three left shoes and only two right shoes.

75
00:05:42,506 --> 00:05:46,506
So this is what perfect complements would look like. This is perfect substitutes. And this is normal goods.
