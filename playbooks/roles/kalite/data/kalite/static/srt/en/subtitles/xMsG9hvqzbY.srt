1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,420
   

2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:04,470
Like the last video, I want
to start with two warm up

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,210
problems. And then we'll
do an actual word.

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,050
And you're going to see these
are going to be a little bit

5
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,340
more involved than the equations
in the last video.

6
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,190
But we're still going to
be doing the exact same

7
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,630
operations, or what we could
consider legitimate

8
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,130
operations, to get our answer.

9
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,880
So here we have 3 times x
minus 1 is equal to 2

10
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,590
times x plus 3.

11
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,880
So let's see what
we can do here.

12
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,880
The first thing I like to do--
and there's no definite right

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,730
way to do it-- there's several
ways you could do these

14
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,439
problems-- but I like
to distribute out

15
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,000
the 3 and the 2.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,240
So 3 times x minus 1, that's the
same thing as 3x minus 3--

17
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,440
I just distributed the
3-- is equal to--

18
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,810
distribute out the 2.

19
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:48,570
2 times x, plus 2 times
3, which is 6.

20
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:54,100
Now what I like to do is get
all of my constant terms on

21
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,220
the same side of the equation
and all my variable terms on

22
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,390
the same side of the equation.

23
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,660
So let's see if we can get
rid of this 2x term on

24
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:02,580
the right hand side.

25
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,220
So let's subtract 2x.

26
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,120
I'm going to do a slightly
different notation this time

27
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,290
because you might see
it done this way.

28
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,880
Or you might find it easier
to visualize it this way.

29
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,410
It doesn't matter.

30
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,360
It's the same thing we did
in the last video.

31
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,160
But I want to subtract 2x from
this side of the equation.

32
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,960
But if I subtract 2x from the
side of the equation, I also

33
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,610
have to subtract 2x from that
side of the equation.

34
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,930
So then when we subtract 2x
from both sides of the

35
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,470
equation, what do we get?

36
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,810
Here we get 3x minus 2x.

37
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,900
That's just 1x, or x minus 3.

38
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,690
   

39
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:40,390
2x minus 2x is no x's, or 0.

40
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,130
Then you just have the 6.

41
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,620
So we get x minus
3 is equal to 6.

42
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,980
That was by getting rid of the
2x from the right hand side;

43
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,890
subtracting it from both
sides of this equation.

44
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,140
Now we have this negative
3 on the left hand side.

45
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:54,920
I don't want it there.

46
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,410
I just want an x there.

47
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,640
So to get rid of that
we can add 3 to both

48
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,890
sides of this equation.

49
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:03,040
   

50
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,910
You could imagine this is being
adding this equation to

51
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,980
the equation 3 is equal to 3.

52
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,570
3 is, obviously, equal to 3.

53
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:13,250
Negative 2x is, obviously,
equal to negative 2x.

54
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,070
You could do it either way.

55
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,410
But if you add 3 to both sides
of this equation the left hand

56
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,170
side of the equation becomes
just an x, because these two

57
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:26,710
guys cancel out. x equal,
and 6 plus 3 is 9.

58
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,650
And we are done.

59
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,520
And we can even check
our answer.

60
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,950
3 times 9 minus 1 is what?

61
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,890
This is 3 times 8.

62
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,450
This is 24.

63
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,400
So that's what the left
hand side equals.

64
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,220
What does the right
hand side equal?

65
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,890
That is 2 times 9 plus 3.

66
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:49,390
That's the 2 times 12, which
is also equals 24.

67
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:53,790
So it all works out.
x is equals to 9.

68
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,430
Next problem.

69
00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:01,830
z over 16 is equal to 2 times 3z
plus 1, all of that over 9.

70
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:04,210
So it's a hairy looking
problem.

71
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:09,820
Let's multiply both sides
of this equation by 9.

72
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,520
So if you multiply both sides
of this equation by

73
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,510
9, what do we get?

74
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:20,490
We get 9 over 16z is equal to--
this 9 and that 9 will

75
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:26,250
cancel out-- 2 times
3z plus 1.

76
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,240
Now let's distribute this 2.

77
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:38,540
So we get 9 over 16z is equal
to 2 times 3z is 6z plus 2.

78
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,900
Now let's get all of z's on the
same side of the equation.

79
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,070
So let's subtract 6z from both
sides of the equation.

80
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:50,210
So let's subtract minus 6z
there, and that, of course,

81
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,370
equals minus 6z there.

82
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,390
And what do we get?

83
00:03:54,390 --> 00:04:02,250
On the left hand side,
we get 9/16 minus 6.

84
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,640
What is 6 if I have 16
as a denominator?

85
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,030
6 is equal to what over 16?

86
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,956
Let me think about it.

87
00:04:09,956 --> 00:04:11,890
60 plus 36.

88
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,980
It's equal to 96/16.

89
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:20,140
So it's 9 minus 96 over 16z.

90
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,240
This is just 6-- I just rewrote
minus 6 here-- is

91
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,360
equal to-- these
two cancel out.

92
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,985
That's why I subtracted
6z in the first place.

93
00:04:27,985 --> 00:04:29,940
So it's going to equal 2.

94
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,710
So what does this equal
right over here?

95
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,100
Let me do it in orange.

96
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,320
9 minus 96.

97
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:38,820
Well let's see.

98
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,710
The difference between 9 and
96 is going to be 87.

99
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,650
And, of course, we're
subtracting the larger from

100
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,130
the smaller.

101
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:53,460
So it's going to be negative
87 over 16z is equal to 2.

102
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,460
And we're almost there.

103
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,540
We just have to multiply both
sides of this equation by the

104
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,730
inverse of this coefficient.

105
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:10,630
So multiply both sides of this
equation by negative 16/87.

106
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,750
These cancel out.

107
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,420
87, 87, 16 and 16.

108
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,660
The negative signs plus.

109
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,990
You're just left with z is equal
to 2 times this thing.

110
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:25,830
So 2 times negative 16
is negative 32/87.

111
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,160
And we are done.

112
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,970
That's not a pretty looking
answer, but

113
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:30,620
that's what we got.

114
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,460
And you can try it with
multiple methods.

115
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,850
Maybe you can multiply both of
the equation by 16 first.

116
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,970
Maybe you can distribute out the
2 9's first. All sorts of

117
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:39,550
things you can do.

118
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,970
And you could also verify that
this is, indeed, the answer.

119
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:47,240
Let's do a word problem now
that we're warmed up.

120
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,030
All right.

121
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:52,360
It says Manoj and Tomar are
arguing about how a number

122
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,200
trick they heard goes.

123
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,880
Tomar tells Andrew to
think of a number.

124
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,770
Let's say that x is the number
that Andrew thinks of.

125
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:01,750
Think of a number.

126
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,010
Multiply it by 5.

127
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:05,730
So this is what Tomar
is saying.

128
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:10,105
Ć is telling Andrew to think of
a number, multiply it by 5,

129
00:06:10,105 --> 00:06:11,130
so let me do that.

130
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:17,435
So multiply it by 5, and
subtract 3 from the result.

131
00:06:17,435 --> 00:06:20,150
   

132
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,325
We'll do that in a
different color.

133
00:06:21,325 --> 00:06:23,280
We'll do it in blue.

134
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,670
Subtract 3 from the result.

135
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,030
So subtract 3 from the result.

136
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,740
Then Manoj comes along.

137
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,490
So here's Manoj.

138
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,010
Manoj comes along and tells
Andrew once again

139
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,820
to think of a number.

140
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,150
So once again, think
of a number.

141
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,600
We'll call that x.

142
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,250
So they both are telling him
to think of a number.

143
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,780
Add five.

144
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,960
So now he's saying add
five to the number.

145
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,370
So you add 5 to number.

146
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:55,290
And then multiply
the result by 3.

147
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,990
So multiply the result by 3.

148
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,580
Andrew says that which ever way
he does the trick, he gets

149
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,730
the same answer.

150
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,100
What was Andrew's number?

151
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,080
So regardless of whether he does
5 times the number, and

152
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,170
then subtracts 3, or whether he
adds 5 and then multiples

153
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,950
the whole answer by 3, he
gets the same number.

154
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,470
So that must mean that these
two things are equal.

155
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,070
He gets the same answer.

156
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,630
That means that these
two are equals.

157
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:22,540
So let's solve this equation.

158
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:30,380
We get 5x minus 3 is equal
to 3 times x plus 5.

159
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,870
A good place for me-- I like to
distribute out this 3, so

160
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,620
that is equal to 3x plus 15.

161
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,820
Always have to remember to
multiply the 3 times all of

162
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,330
the terms in parentheses.

163
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,020
This is a 15.

164
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,460
And, of course, 5x minus
3 is equal to that.

165
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,040
Now, I think you know how
I like to operate.

166
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,090
I like to get all of my
ex-coeffients on one side.

167
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,590
So let's get them all on
the left hand side.

168
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,770
Which means, let's get rid of
them on the right hand side.

169
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,120
So let's subtract 3x
from both sides.

170
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,420
So minus 3x minus 3x and
then what do we get?

171
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:08,410
Our equation becomes
5x minus 3x is 2x.

172
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:12,420
You still have a minus 3 is
equal to-- these cancel out--

173
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,380
equal to 15.

174
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,170
Equal to that yellow
15 right there.

175
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,300
Now we want to get rid
of this negative 3 on

176
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,170
the left hand side.

177
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,110
And the best way to do it
is to add 3 to both

178
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,170
sides of the equation.

179
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:28,620
So add 3 to both sides
of this equation.

180
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,770
So what do you get?

181
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:35,539
You now get 2x-- and these
cancel out-- is equal to 18.

182
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:38,144
And then you divide both
sides of this by 2.

183
00:08:38,144 --> 00:08:40,980
   

184
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,159
And you get x is equal
to 18 over 2.

185
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,340
Or 9.

186
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,560
So in either situation, Andrew
was thinking of the number 9.

187
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,430
Let's see if it works according
to both Tomar and

188
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,720
Manoj's method.

189
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,190
If I were to take 5 times-- if
this is 9-- you get 5 times 9

190
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:01,350
is 45 minus 3.

191
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,270
So you get 42.

192
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,910
That's when you do
Tomar's method.

193
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:08,270
When you do Manoj's method--
this is a 9, right there.

194
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,110
9 plus 5 is 14.

195
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:14,990
So this thing becomes 14, and
it becomes 3 times 14.

196
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,860
3 times 14 is 30 plus
12, which is 42.

197
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,790
So Andrew was right.

198
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,230
When he randomly picked the
number 9, and regardless of

199
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,030
which method he uses, he
gets the same results.

200
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,000
He gets 42.

201
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,266
