1
00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:11,725
Microorganisms are small. So small you can't even see them unless they cluster together.

2
00:00:11,725 --> 00:00:14,724
Each of these dots is really millions of
bacteria.

3
00:00:14,724 --> 00:00:20,426
But down at a microscopic scale, mold and
bacteria fight vicious battles.

4
00:00:20,426 --> 00:00:22,643
Their resources and territory are scarce

5
00:00:22,643 --> 00:00:25,530
and the stakes are survival.

6
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:30,375
Mold has a powerful chemical weapon in its arsenal.

7
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:34,029
I'm Emily, and I'd like to show you
Alexander Fleming's famous

8
00:00:34,029 --> 00:00:37,721
discovery that bread mold kills bacteria.

9
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:41,014
Here's some fresh bread.

10
00:00:41,014 --> 00:00:44,105
I'll add some water because mold loves moisture.

11
00:00:44,105 --> 00:00:47,784
Now I need bacteria, which you can find
basically anywhere,

12
00:00:47,784 --> 00:00:49,689
including in your mouth.

13
00:00:49,689 --> 00:00:52,668
This petri dish has a jello-like layer of agar:

14
00:00:52,668 --> 00:00:55,615
food for the bacteria in my saliva.

15
00:00:55,615 --> 00:01:00,962
It'll take a few days before the
colonies of bacteria are big enough to see.

16
00:01:00,962 --> 00:01:09,098
Let's set up a place to grow the mold and bacteria in a contained way, so it doesn't spread or infect anything else.

17
00:01:09,098 --> 00:01:11,038
These bell jars will help make sure that

18
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:12,940
nothing contaminates the experiment,

19
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:18,326
and the experiment doesn't contaminate anything else.

20
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,332
I'm back!

21
00:01:23,332 --> 00:01:25,792
Wow! There's a lot of bacteria!

22
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:29,486
Each cell divided and divided and divided to make a
colony

23
00:01:29,486 --> 00:01:32,066
that we can see now.

24
00:01:32,066 --> 00:01:34,206
Some bread mold also grew.

25
00:01:34,206 --> 00:01:36,958
Let's see if it can kill some bacteria.

26
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:40,177
I'll take a chunk of bread mold and let it do its work.

27
00:01:40,177 --> 00:01:44,277
Legend has it that in Fleming's original experiment,

28
00:01:44,277 --> 00:01:49,627
some mold from his lunch sandwich
accidentally dropped into his petri dish.

29
00:01:49,627 --> 00:01:51,354
Let's take a closer look,

30
00:01:51,354 --> 00:01:54,835
and we'll come back later and see what's
changed.

31
00:01:54,835 --> 00:01:58,076
Under a microscope mold looks something
like this yellow model,

32
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:02,880
and mold attacks bacteria cell walls, 
represented by these cups.

33
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,659
Mold secretes a chemical: penicillin,

34
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:10,280
which damages bacteria cell walls, 
stamping out the competition.

35
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,476
This means the bacteria surrounding the mold will die.

36
00:02:14,476 --> 00:02:18,554
We're looking for bacterial death around
the mold.

37
00:02:18,554 --> 00:02:21,592
Do you see where the bacteria have died around
the mold?

38
00:02:21,592 --> 00:02:25,124
This is called the ring of death.

39
00:02:25,124 --> 00:02:29,600
Mold and bacteria have been battling for
millions of years.

40
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,039
Mold keeps coming up with new weapons:
antibiotics;

41
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,287
and bacteria keeps coming up with new
shields: resistance.

42
00:02:37,287 --> 00:02:42,271
Alexander Fleming, after treating wounded
soldiers in World War One, was the first person

43
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:46,215
to realize how useful
antibiotics are for treating infection.

44
00:02:46,215 --> 00:02:49,697
Today we remember him for his
discovery of penicillin.

45
00:02:49,697 --> 00:02:54,044
I think his experiment is really neat, and I hope you do, too.
