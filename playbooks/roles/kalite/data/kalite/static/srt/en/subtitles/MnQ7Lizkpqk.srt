1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,440
   

2
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,080
What is the nth number in
the following sequence?

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:04,400
Let's see.

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,620
The first term here is a 6.

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,990
So over here I'll
put the term.

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,760
So this is the number.

7
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,080
I'll just write num there.

8
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,260
That's the number.

9
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,970
And this is the term.

10
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,820
So the first term here is a 6.

11
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,060
It looks like we add 3 to
that to get to a 9.

12
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,410
Or maybe there's some
other pattern here.

13
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,250
So that's the second
term, is 9.

14
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,350
Then they go from 9 to 12.

15
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:30,740
Looks like we add 3 again.

16
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:31,480
So we keep adding 3.

17
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,400
So the third term is 12,
the fourth term is 15.

18
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,170
And we need to think of a
general expression that will

19
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,310
give us the value
of the nth term.

20
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,555
The nth number in the
following sequence.

21
00:00:44,555 --> 00:00:46,210
So let's think a little
bit about it.

22
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,500
We know that we're incrementing
by 3 every time

23
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,460
and we're starting at 6.

24
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,880
So let's write these in terms
of multiples of 3, since we

25
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,200
know that that's the
increment level.

26
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,480
This first term right
here is 3 times 2.

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,360
The second term right
here is 3 times 3.

28
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,290
This third term is 3 times 4.

29
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,270
And so it looks like it's 3
times one more than the actual

30
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,710
term you are dealing with.

31
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:12,000
Right?

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,120
Here, if you take your term,
you add 1 and then multiply

33
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,530
that by 3, you get 6.

34
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,660
Take your term, add 1, then
multiply it by 3.

35
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,200
Take your term, add
1, you get 4.

36
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,300
Then multiply by 3.

37
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,960
Take your term, add 1-- which
would be 5-- and then multiply

38
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,480
by 3, you get 15.

39
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,660
So it looks like any time-- so
if you have your nth term.

40
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,920
So if you go all the way out
here to your nth term, the

41
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,050
value here would be
you'd add 1 to it.

42
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:41,290
So you'd have n plus 1, and then
you'd multiply that by 3.

43
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:44,080
So the nth term is
3 times n plus 1.

44
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:50,470
Or if you wanted to distribute
out the 3, it'd be 3n plus 3.

45
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,790
And just make sure that
works for all of them.

46
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,600
The first term, 3 times 1
is 3 plus 3, that works.

47
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,250
That's 6.

48
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,140
The second term, 3 times
2 plus 3 is 9.

49
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,480
So it works for all
of these terms. So

50
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,630
that is the nth term.

51
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,530
We have to assume that this
pattern continues.

52
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,066
