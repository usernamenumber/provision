1
00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:03,160
Solve for a and check your solution.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,373
And, we have a plus 5 is equal to 54.

3
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:10,674
Now, all this is saying is that we have some number, some variable a,

4
00:00:10,674 --> 00:00:14,018
and if I add 5 to it, I will get 54.

5
00:00:14,018 --> 00:00:17,810
And you might be able to do this in your head, but we're going to do it a little bit more systematically,

6
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,206
'cause that'll be helpful when you have more complicated problems.

7
00:00:21,206 --> 00:00:25,375
So, in general, whenever you have an equation like this we want the variable,

8
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:27,469
we want this a, all by itself

9
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:29,764
on one side of the equation.

10
00:00:29,764 --> 00:00:31,610
We want to isolate it.

11
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,392
It's already on the left hand side, so let's try to get rid of everything else on the left hand side.

12
00:00:35,392 --> 00:00:38,262
Well, the only other thing on the left hand side is this positive 5.

13
00:00:38,262 --> 00:00:45,208
Well, the best way to get rid of a plus 5, or of a positive 5, is to subtract 5.

14
00:00:45,223 --> 00:00:50,024
So, let's subtract 5, but remember this says "a plus 5 is equal to 54".

15
00:00:50,024 --> 00:00:57,200
If we want the equality to still hold, anything we do to the left hand side of this equation we have to do to the right side of the equation.

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,617
So we also have to subtract 54 [sic] from the right.

17
00:01:00,617 --> 00:01:03,115
So, we have a plus 5 minus 5,

18
00:01:03,115 --> 00:01:05,043
well that's just going to be "a plus 0",

19
00:01:05,043 --> 00:01:06,967
cause you add 5 and subtract 5,

20
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:08,108
they cancel out.

21
00:01:08,108 --> 00:01:10,349
So a + 0 is just a.

22
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:15,247
And then, 54 minus 5 that is 49, and we're done.

23
00:01:15,247 --> 00:01:19,022
We have solved for a. a is equal to 49.

24
00:01:19,022 --> 00:01:27,107
And now we can check it. And we can check it by just substituting 49 back for a in our original equation.

25
00:01:27,107 --> 00:01:32,404
So instead of writing a plus 5 is equal to 54, let's see if 49 plus 5 is equal to 54.

26
00:01:32,404 --> 00:01:34,135
So, we're just substituting it back in.

27
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:39,905
49 plus, let me do that in that same shade of green,

28
00:01:39,905 --> 00:01:43,379
49 + 5 is equal to 54,

29
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:45,033
we're trying to check this,

30
00:01:45,033 --> 00:01:50,887
49 + 5 is 54, and that indeed is equal to 54,

31
00:01:50,887 --> 00:01:53,946
so it all checks out.
