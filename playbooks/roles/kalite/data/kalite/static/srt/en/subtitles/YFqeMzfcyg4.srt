1
00:00:01,269 --> 00:00:04,756
So we have this line segment; JL here and we have point

2
00:00:04,756 --> 00:00:06,803
K that also sits on that segment

3
00:00:06,803 --> 00:00:11,009
and they tell us that JK is equal to 7x plus 9

4
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:14,766
So this distance right over here is equal to 7x

5
00:00:14,766 --> 00:00:19,678
plus 9. Then they tell us that JL is equal to a 114

6
00:00:19,678 --> 00:00:23,204
So JL is the entire length of the segment. So this entire thing

7
00:00:23,204 --> 00:00:27,839
is equal to 114. Then they tell us that KL

8
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:29,935
is equal to 9x plus 9

9
00:00:29,935 --> 00:00:33,673
So this right over here is equal to 9x plus 9.

10
00:00:33,673 --> 00:00:36,870
And they say find KL

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,275
So they essentially want us to figure out

12
00:00:38,275 --> 00:00:41,099
what does 9x plus 9 equal

13
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:42,343
And to figure that out we have to

14
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:43,094
figure out what x equals

15
00:00:43,094 --> 00:00:47,327
And lucky for us, they have given us all the information we need.

16
00:00:47,327 --> 00:00:52,603
They tell us that the entire segment is 114

17
00:00:52,603 --> 00:00:55,512
long. And they don't give us any units, it's just 114

18
00:00:55,512 --> 00:00:59,204
it has the length of 114. And we know that this segment

19
00:00:59,204 --> 00:01:02,800
JK plus KL added together is going to be equal

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,537
to the length of the entire thing.

21
00:01:04,537 --> 00:01:08,136
So we can say that 7x plus 9

22
00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:11,762
We could say that 7x plus 9, actually let me write it this way,

23
00:01:11,762 --> 00:01:15,604
we could write that JK,

24
00:01:15,604 --> 00:01:17,759
that the length of segment JK

25
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,800
plus the length of segment KL

26
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,014
plus KL,

27
00:01:24,014 --> 00:01:26,204
is going to be equal to 114.

28
00:01:26,204 --> 00:01:29,603
114.

29
00:01:29,603 --> 00:01:30,759
And we know that the length

30
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:32,764
of the segment JK is 7x plus 9.

31
00:01:32,764 --> 00:01:34,675
7x plus 9.

32
00:01:34,675 --> 00:01:39,200
We know that the length of segment KL is 9x plus 9.

33
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,093
So plus 9x plus 9,

34
00:01:42,093 --> 00:01:45,346
And this is going to be equal to 114.

35
00:01:45,346 --> 00:01:46,347
And now we just have to

36
00:01:46,347 --> 00:01:48,202
work out a little bit of our algebraic skills.

37
00:01:48,202 --> 00:01:49,536
So the first thing

38
00:01:49,536 --> 00:01:50,348
we might wanna do is,

39
00:01:50,348 --> 00:01:53,143
let's see we have, we have two terms

40
00:01:53,143 --> 00:01:54,603
and x is in them.

41
00:01:54,603 --> 00:01:58,346
So if I have 7 x's,

42
00:01:58,346 --> 00:02:01,136
and I would add that to another 9 x's,

43
00:02:01,136 --> 00:02:05,009
that means I'm going to have 16 x's.

44
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,203
And then if I have, so this is just plain ol' 9,

45
00:02:08,203 --> 00:02:11,843
and I add it to another 9, that's going to give me 18

46
00:02:11,843 --> 00:02:18,136
That's going to be equal to 114.

47
00:02:18,136 --> 00:02:21,742
Now I just subtract 18 from both sides,

48
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:25,346
So I subtract 18 from both sides...

49
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:28,936
On the left-hand side, I have 16x

50
00:02:28,936 --> 00:02:31,077
and on the right-hand side, I'm going to have

51
00:02:31,077 --> 00:02:33,935
a 114 minus 18

52
00:02:33,935 --> 00:02:35,936
Or if I were to subtract 14 I would get to a hundred,

53
00:02:35,936 --> 00:02:37,764
so if I were to subtract 4 more from that

54
00:02:37,764 --> 00:02:40,738
so that's going to get me to 96.

55
00:02:40,738 --> 00:02:43,069
And now we just have to divide both sides by 16.

56
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:48,269
Divide both sides by 16.

57
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:50,271
And, let's see, this looks like,

58
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:51,870
96 divided by 16

59
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,603
it looks like it's going to be 6

60
00:02:54,603 --> 00:02:56,209
6 times 10 is 60,

61
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,870
6 times 6 is 36,

62
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,763
60 plus 36 is 96.

63
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:04,403
So we get x is equal to 6.

64
00:03:04,403 --> 00:03:06,093
But we're not done yet.

65
00:03:06,093 --> 00:03:07,349
We're not just looking for x

66
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:09,209
we're looking for the length of KL.

67
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:13,090
KL is 9x plus 9, let me write that down.

68
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,680
So KL is equal to 9x plus 9.

69
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,590
They told us that, right over there.

70
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,736
it's equal to 9x plus 9.

71
00:03:20,736 --> 00:03:23,094
We just figured out that x is equal to 6.

72
00:03:23,094 --> 00:03:27,269
So this is equal to 9 times 6 plus 9

73
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:28,466
and this is equal to

74
00:03:28,466 --> 00:03:32,269
9 times 6 is 54,

75
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:35,269
plus 9 is equal to 63.

76
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:39,269
So KL is equal to 63.
