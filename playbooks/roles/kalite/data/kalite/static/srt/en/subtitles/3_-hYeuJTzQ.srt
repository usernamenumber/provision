2
00:00:04,138 --> 00:00:07,340
We're in the Prado, looking at

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,480
El Greco's "Adoration of the Shepherds."

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,162
This is a painting that he did very late in his career;

5
00:00:12,162 --> 00:00:15,116
it was about 1612, 1614.

6
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:17,538
And one that had personal significance for him,

7
00:00:17,538 --> 00:00:19,473
since it was for his family chapel.

8
00:00:19,473 --> 00:00:21,095
It's a wild painting!

9
00:00:21,095 --> 00:00:22,983
Well, all El Greco's are wild,

10
00:00:22,983 --> 00:00:26,589
but he clearly gets wilder later in his career.

11
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:29,623
And maybe felt freer because it was personally related.

12
00:00:29,623 --> 00:00:33,480
The figures are incredibly elongated;

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,758
their positions of their bodies make no sense;

14
00:00:36,758 --> 00:00:40,933
I mean, there's just enormous license with naturalism here.

15
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:43,769
Naturalism, in fact, doesn't even seem to be a requirement,

16
00:00:43,769 --> 00:00:45,309
even though we're just coming really

17
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:47,002
out of the Renaissance here. I mean,

18
00:00:47,002 --> 00:00:49,446
even by Mannerist standards

19
00:00:49,446 --> 00:00:54,010
(right? Because we're basically in the period of Mannerism, but moving into the Baroque),

20
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,641
this is extreme.

21
00:00:55,641 --> 00:00:58,243
Well, El Greco was Greek, and he was trained actually

22
00:00:58,243 --> 00:00:59,842
as a Greek icon painter.

23
00:00:59,842 --> 00:01:03,257
And of course, the Byzantine tradition was

24
00:01:03,257 --> 00:01:08,300
a tradition that was concerned with distorting the body for symbolic purpose.

25
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,675
And so, I think there is a kind of license that comes from that tradition.

26
00:01:11,675 --> 00:01:14,131
Now, El Greco gets to Spain,

27
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:15,920
and he does these paintings in Toledo,

28
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,897
for the most part, by way of Italy,

29
00:01:18,897 --> 00:01:21,557
where he really does train in the Renaissance style;

30
00:01:21,557 --> 00:01:25,033
so, he understands contemporary art at this point.

31
00:01:25,033 --> 00:01:26,760
I mean, he really understands what people are doing.

32
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,128
But he's also willing to let go. Look what he's done.

33
00:01:30,128 --> 00:01:34,412
He's removed virtually any reference to actual space.

34
00:01:34,412 --> 00:01:36,100
We have almost no sense of real depth.

35
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,419
We have a little bit of a, what, a barrel vault

36
00:01:38,419 --> 00:01:41,175
right behind the Virgin Mary. But besides that,

37
00:01:41,175 --> 00:01:43,364
it's all clouds and light.

38
00:01:43,364 --> 00:01:46,505
And movement. If you look at the structure of the painting,

39
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:49,837
the composition, the Christ Child,

40
00:01:49,837 --> 00:01:54,122
who occupies the center of about five or six figures,

41
00:01:54,122 --> 00:01:56,344
almost provides the light source,

42
00:01:56,344 --> 00:02:00,048
almost as though it was a fire in the center of those figures

43
00:02:00,048 --> 00:02:02,490
that they were all warming their hands by.

44
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,890
I think actually that idea of fire is perfect.

45
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,260
The figures feel like flames.

46
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,706
In fact, the light seems to be flickering.

47
00:02:08,706 --> 00:02:11,347
There seems to be - everything seems to be transient,

48
00:02:11,347 --> 00:02:13,403
and nothing seems to be fixed.

49
00:02:13,403 --> 00:02:14,844
Even the human bodies themselves,

50
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:17,481
as you mentioned before, seem completely mutable.

51
00:02:17,481 --> 00:02:21,381
I think that this pictorial language that we're describing

52
00:02:21,381 --> 00:02:24,982
represents the spiritual, the transcendent,

53
00:02:24,982 --> 00:02:27,013
the otherworldly.

54
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:29,042
Well, the Church was really trying to combat

55
00:02:29,042 --> 00:02:31,211
the threat of the Reformation -

56
00:02:31,211 --> 00:02:31,910
Right!

57
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,757
- and I think that, especially in Toledo,

58
00:02:33,757 --> 00:02:35,939
you have a very severe reaction,

59
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:41,255
a Counter-Reformation, taking the Council of Trent's doctrine very seriously.

60
00:02:41,255 --> 00:02:44,127
So the Church is really looking to reform itself,

61
00:02:44,127 --> 00:02:49,500
to inspire faith in believers in a new and powerful way,

62
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,316
and I think El Greco's paintings were able to achieve that.

63
00:02:54,316 --> 00:02:55,687
One of the things that he's doing

64
00:02:55,687 --> 00:02:59,163
is using color in a way that's -

65
00:02:59,163 --> 00:03:01,503
really, I think, unprecedented.

66
00:03:01,503 --> 00:03:05,094
We have neon oranges, and greens, and blues,

67
00:03:05,094 --> 00:03:08,540
and golds, that I don't think I've ever seen before.

68
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,393
It really won't be until Delacroix,

69
00:03:10,393 --> 00:03:12,963
in the 19th century, that somebody is as bold with color;

70
00:03:12,963 --> 00:03:14,682
and even Delacroix, I think, is muted

71
00:03:14,682 --> 00:03:16,047
in comparison to this.

72
00:03:16,047 --> 00:03:19,476
We also have these very stark contrasts of light and dark,

73
00:03:19,476 --> 00:03:22,327
and figures that are very close to us,

74
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:25,681
and this amazing foreshortening. I mean,

75
00:03:25,681 --> 00:03:28,204
look at those angels up in the sky.

76
00:03:28,204 --> 00:03:32,005
I mean, we're seeing them from these remarkable angles.

77
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:33,586
There is a sense in El Greco's work,

78
00:03:33,586 --> 00:03:36,023
and especially in "The Adoration of the Shepherds,"

79
00:03:36,023 --> 00:03:38,017
that the Divine is with us,

80
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:39,925
in the most complete way;

81
00:03:39,925 --> 00:03:43,564
that is, it completely infuses the physical world,

82
00:03:43,564 --> 00:03:45,567
in a way that more traditional,

83
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:48,266
more representational Renaissance painting,

84
00:03:48,266 --> 00:03:51,208
and even Mannerist painting, doesn't quite achieve.

85
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:55,786
There is a sense that the Divine actually is a physical force,

86
00:03:55,786 --> 00:03:59,075
that runs as a current through the space

87
00:03:59,075 --> 00:04:00,828
that El Greco defines.

88
00:04:00,828 --> 00:04:09,892
