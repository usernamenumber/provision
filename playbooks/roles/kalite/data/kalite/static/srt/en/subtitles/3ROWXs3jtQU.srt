1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,680
   

2
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,170
Most everything that a chemist
does involves mixing things

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,960
together in some way, so I
thought now would be a good

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,490
time to introduce some
terminology and some ideas

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:11,740
involved with mixtures.

6
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,820
   

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,470
And in particular, I'll talk
about homogenized or

8
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,780
homogeneous mixtures.

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,930
Homogenized implies that they
were made homogeneous, but

10
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,530
maybe they were homogeneous
to begin with.

11
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:32,020
So homogeneous mixtures, and
you're probably asking what

12
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,540
does homogeneous mean?

13
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,510
It means uniform or consistent
throughout, that there's not a

14
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,870
lot of variation in the
mixture itself.

15
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,620
And the most common word or
the example of this is

16
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,140
homogenized milk.

17
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,980
   

18
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:54,630
I don't know if you've had the
privilege of directly milking

19
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,760
a cow or a goat, but you'll find
very quickly that if you

20
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,140
do, that the fat, the milk
fat and the non-milk fat,

21
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,400
separates very quickly.

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,480
So if this is regular,
straight-from-the-udder milk,

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,990
you'll have a layer of fat that
shows up there, and all

24
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,720
of this stuff over here
is much more liquidy.

25
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,610
What homogenized milk does is it
makes sure that all of this

26
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,980
fat is dispersed completely
evenly through the milk.

27
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,590
So that's why, when you go to
your local grocery store and

28
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,450
you buy homogenized milk,
it's all nice and creamy

29
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:30,360
throughout.

30
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,640
And you don't get this-- I guess
some people actually

31
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,190
like it, but you don't
get this nice sheen

32
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,740
of fat at the top.

33
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,440
And it all goes down a
little bit smoother.

34
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,850
So that's what homogenized
means.

35
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,040
So a homogeneous mixture is
the same thing: even and

36
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,570
consistent throughout.

37
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:52,080
Now, that is further divided,
depending on how large the

38
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,230
particles that are diluted
in the mixture are.

39
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:59,840
So if we have a situation where
the particles are larger

40
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,160
than 500 nanometers-- and that
might sound large, but it

41
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,950
still isn't that big, because
a nanometer is one-billionth

42
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,580
of a meter.

43
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,470
But if we have particles mixed
in, say, water-- but it

44
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,430
doesn't have to be mixed in
a fluid, or especially it

45
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,300
doesn't have to be water--
that are greater than 500

46
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,970
nanometers, we're dealing
with a suspension.

47
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,890
   

48
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,930
And the one characteristic that
people associate with a

49
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,100
suspension is that whatever you
suspend in it, whatever

50
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,240
you mix in-- let's say I
have a suspension here.

51
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,190
Maybe it's water, just because
it's easy for me to visualize.

52
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,750
And I have some big particles
here-- that they'll stay in

53
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,850
the water for some amount of
time, but eventually they'll

54
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,270
deposit on the bottom
of the container.

55
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,070
Or sometimes, they'll actually
float to the top.

56
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,460
Depending on whether they're
heavier or depending on their

57
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,110
buoyancy, they'll either float
to the top or the bottom.

58
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,200
In order to get it back into the
suspension state, you've

59
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,340
got to shake the bottle.

60
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,970
So two examples I can
think of this.

61
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,780
One is mixed paint, right?

62
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,610
Before you paint your walls,
you've got to make sure that

63
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,410
the can is well shaken.

64
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,070
Otherwise, you're going to
get an inconsistent coat.

65
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,180
The other, that's close to my
heart, is chocolate milk.

66
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:21,240
   

67
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,470
Because when you mix it up,
it's nice and it seems

68
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,940
homogeneous, right?

69
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,380
It's nice.

70
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,650
And I already have milk here.

71
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,540
So right at first when you stir
it nice, you have all the

72
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,790
little chocolate clumps in
there, at least the chocolate

73
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,960
when I make it is like that.

74
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,470
But then if you let it sit
around for a long time,

75
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,390
eventually all the chocolate
is going to collect at the

76
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,640
bottom of the glass.

77
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,050
   

78
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,100
Actually, different
parts of it.

79
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,860
I've seen situations where the
sugar all collects at the

80
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,880
bottom and then you have these
little clumps at the top.

81
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,120
But you get the idea, that
the mixture separates.

82
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,150
And that's because the particles
in either the paint

83
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,240
or the chocolate milk are
greater than 500 nanometers.

84
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,500
Now, if we get to a range that's
a little bit smaller

85
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,740
than that, if we get to the
situation where we're at 2 to

86
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:10,520
500 nanometers, we're dealing
with a colloid.

87
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,920
That word, I remember in seventh
grade, I think you

88
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,250
learned it in science
class: the colloid.

89
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:22,770
And a friend and I, we thought
it was a more appropriate word

90
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,040
for some type of
gastrointestinal problem.

91
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,970
But it's not a gastrointestinal
problem.

92
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,060
It's a type of homogeneous
mixture.

93
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,310
And it's a homogeneous mixture
where the particles are small

94
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,500
enough that they
stay suspended.

95
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,860
So maybe they could call it
a better suspension or a

96
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,970
permanent suspension.

97
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:43,260
So here the molecules are-- so
let's say that's my mixture.

98
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,660
So water, maybe it's water.

99
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,780
It doesn't have to be water.

100
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,680
It could be air or whatever.

101
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,240
Now the molecules
are small enough

102
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,700
that they stay suspended.

103
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,640
So the forces, either their
buoyancy or the force--

104
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,630
actually, more important, the
forces between the particles

105
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:02,690
and the intermolecular forces
kind of outweigh these

106
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,920
particles' tendencies
to want to exit the

107
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,110
solution in either direction.

108
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,190
And so common examples of
these-- well, the one I always

109
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:15,410
think of, for me, the
colloid is Jell-O.

110
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,690
Jell-O is the brand name, but
gelatin is a colloid.

111
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:25,410
The gelatin molecules stay
suspended in the-- the gelatin

112
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:29,720
powder stays suspended in the
water that you add to it, and

113
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,980
you can leave it in the fridge
forever and it just won't ever

114
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,800
deposit out of it.

115
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,530
Other examples, fog.

116
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:44,650
Fog, you have water molecules
inside of an air mixture.

117
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,900
And then you have smoke.

118
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,860
   

119
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,780
Fog and smoke, these are
examples of aerosols.

120
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:58,280
This is an aerosol where you
have a liquid in the air.

121
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,230
This is an aerosol where you
have a solid in the air.

122
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:04,240
Smoke just comes from little
dark particles that are

123
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,220
floating around in the air,
and they'll never

124
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,800
come out of the air.

125
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,880
They're small enough that
they'll always just float

126
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,150
around with the air.

127
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:16,320
Now, if you get below 2
nanometers-- maybe I should

128
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,960
eliminate my homogenized milk.

129
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,720
   

130
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,590
If you get below 2 nanometers--
I'm trying to

131
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,660
draw in black.

132
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,460
If you're less than 2
nanometers, you're now in the

133
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,710
realm of the solution.

134
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,360
   

135
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,660
And although this is very
interesting in the everyday

136
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,110
world, a lot of things that we--
and this is a fun thing

137
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,560
to think about in your house, or
when you encounter things,

138
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,510
is this a suspension?

139
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,740
Well, first, you should just
think is it homogeneous?

140
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,690
And then think is
it a suspension?

141
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,550
Is it eventually going to not
be in the state it's in and

142
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,450
then I'll have to shake it?

143
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:54,370
Is it a colloid where it will
stay in this kind of nice,

144
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,520
thick state in the case of
Jell-O or fog or smoke where

145
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,000
it will really just stay
in the state that

146
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,660
it's already in?

147
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,130
Or is it a solution?

148
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,450
And solution is probably the
most important in chemistry.

149
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:07,000
Although people talk about
colloids and suspensions, 99%

150
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,150
of everything we'll
talk about in

151
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,240
chemistry involves solutions.

152
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,200
And in general, it's an aqueous
solution, when you

153
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,270
stick something in water.

154
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,840
So sometimes you'll see
something like this.

155
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,530
You'll see some compound x in
a reaction and right next to

156
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,580
it they'll write this aq.

157
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,830
They mean that x is dissolved
in water.

158
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:29,200
It's a solute with water
as the solvent.

159
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,040
So actually, let me put that
terminology here, just because

160
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,700
I used it just now.

161
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,120
So you have a solute.

162
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,810
This is the thing that's usually
whatever you have a

163
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,415
smaller amount of, so
thing dissolved.

164
00:07:41,415 --> 00:07:46,950
   

165
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,200
And then you have the solvent.

166
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,980
   

167
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,620
This is often water
or it's the thing

168
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,890
that's in larger quantity.

169
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,620
Or you can think of it as the
thing that's all around or the

170
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,870
thing that's doing
the dissolving.

171
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:05,350
   

172
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,150
For example, you could
have sodium

173
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,460
chloride in aqueous solution.

174
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,520
   

175
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,690
That means it's in water.

176
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:16,020
And what's happening is that
the sodium and the chloride

177
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,180
particles are dispersing.

178
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,550
So sodium is positive.

179
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:23,240
Chloride is negative, an ion,
because it took away the atom

180
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,930
from the sodium.

181
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,940
But when you put it in the
presence of water-- remember,

182
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,980
water, you know, you have all
the oxygen and the hydrogens.

183
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,130
I've done this tons
of times already.

184
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:35,390
Oxygen and hydrogen.

185
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,090
This is partially positive
over here on this end.

186
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:41,289
This is partially negative
over here, so you'll have

187
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:47,790
these larger-- the positive
sodium cation will separate

188
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,310
from the chloride and be
attracted to the oxygen ends

189
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,700
of the water.

190
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,200
And then the chloride, the
negative anion, will be

191
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,990
attracted to the hydrogen
ends of the water.

192
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,690
That's what allows it
to get dissolved.

193
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:09,060
Because these ions have some
charge, they like to mix in

194
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,540
with the water, which has these
hydrogens, or has this

195
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,620
polarity to it.

196
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,170
And see, the chlorine,
I'll draw here.

197
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,450
It will be over here with
a minus charge.

198
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,060
   

199
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,710
So this is probably
the single most

200
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,670
important thing to realize.

201
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:25,680
And just so you get a sense of
what 2 nanometers is, this is

202
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,480
still pretty big.

203
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,710
It allows for molecules that
have anywhere from-- actually,

204
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:34,120
a good number of atoms. If you
think of even a fairly large

205
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,270
atom, cesium, the cesium atom,
which is one of the largest--

206
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,040
at least one of the largest
that you might encounter,

207
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:46,490
there are larger-- is on the
order of 2.6 angstroms. An

208
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:51,540
angstrom is a tenth of a
nanometer, so that's 0.26

209
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,560
nanometers.

210
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,880
So, for example, if you wanted
a molecule that would get you

211
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,220
out of the solution state and
into the colloid, and we're

212
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,325
talking in three dimensions
here.

213
00:10:00,325 --> 00:10:02,220
So in three dimensions you could
actually fit a lot of

214
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:07,860
cesium atoms within a
2-nanometer diameter sphere.

215
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,890
Cesium doesn't bond in that way,
but I think you get the

216
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:13,080
idea that this is a scale of,
you know, on the order of 20

217
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,950
to 30 atoms can be
in this molecule.

218
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,950
Actually, even more than that,
especially if you have very

219
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,950
small atoms like hydrogen.

220
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:23,160
So the next question is how do
you measure these things?

221
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,690
And there's a lot of different
ways to measure concentration.

222
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,750
We already actually
used one of them,

223
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,000
which is mole fraction.

224
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:39,060
   

225
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:47,300
And this is the number of moles
of solute divided by the

226
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:53,670
number of moles in the whole
solution, or moles of solute

227
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:58,650
plus moles of solvent.

228
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,500
And we did this when we figured
out the partial

229
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,190
pressure problems. Because in
order to figure out the

230
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,830
partial pressure of something,
you just figured out what the

231
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,760
total pressure is, and then
you said what is the mole

232
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,690
fraction of, say, oxygen
in the mixture?

233
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:13,280
And then you multiply that times
the partial pressure and

234
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,860
you got the mole fraction.

235
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,950
Now, the ones that show up a lot
in chemistry-- and since

236
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:21,350
their words are so similar can
get a little confusing-- are

237
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:28,320
molarity, not to be confused
with morality.

238
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,780
One day I'll make a video on
that once I figure out enough

239
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,400
about it-- and molality.

240
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,250
   

241
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,090
And molarity, it sounds like
the right one because it's

242
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:43,180
almost like morality and it
has the word molar in it,

243
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:47,690
which is for me more intuitive
than the word molal.

244
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:51,080
But molarity in my mind is not
a good measure because it's

245
00:11:51,080 --> 00:12:02,130
moles of solute, so what you're
dissolving into it,

246
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:06,570
divided by liters of solution.

247
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:09,000
And the reason why I don't
like molarity much-- and

248
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,750
you'll see that molality is
actually, at least in my

249
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,810
opinion, more useful.

250
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,790
But the reason why I don't like
this is because liters of

251
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,600
solution is not invariant.

252
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,700
It changes, right?

253
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,680
We've learned that a bunch.

254
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,640
You know, pV equals nRT.

255
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,830
The volume-- which liters is a
measure of-- volume can vary

256
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,410
with pressure and temperature.

257
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,650
So the molarity is going to
vary with pressure and

258
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,570
temperature for the
same solution.

259
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:33,145
If you just take the same
solution and take it to Denver

260
00:12:33,145 --> 00:12:36,660
or take it to Death Valley, the
molarity of the solution

261
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,330
is going to change.

262
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:41,300
So, to me, that isn't that
satisfying of a measure of

263
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,470
concentration.

264
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,140
Molality, on the other hand,
is moles of solute.

265
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,460
   

266
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:52,290
So the numerator in both cases
is essentially the number of

267
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:56,270
solute particles we have-- the
number of particles we have

268
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:02,770
divided by the mass of the
solvent, or the kilograms of

269
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,140
whatever we're being
dissolved into.

270
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,610
And the reason why this one is
better is because no matter

271
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:10,630
where you go, whether you're
in Denver or Death Valley,

272
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,010
moles aren't going to change.

273
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,340
They didn't change
here either.

274
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,870
And the mass won't change.

275
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,630
Now, the pressure and the volume
and the temperature

276
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,930
might change, but the mass won't
change unless you're

277
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,670
adding more or less solvent.

278
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,600
So this, in my mind, is kind
of the better one.

279
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,680
And actually, I'll put a little
contest on this video,

280
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,060
if you all can think of good
ways to remember the

281
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,360
difference between molality
and molarity.

282
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,650
Because, frankly, I think
this is one of the

283
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,290
most-- it's not confusing.

284
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,680
They're very simple
definitions.

285
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,660
But I think a lot of people
get confused, especially a

286
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,340
year or two out of taking
chemistry class.

287
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,610
If someone says, oh, what's
the difference between

288
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:44,810
molality and molarity?

289
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,680
You're like, oh, there was a
difference with volume and

290
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,260
mass, but I forget
which is which.

291
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,400
And I'll leave it up to you guys
to think of a good way to

292
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,940
memorize the difference
between the two.

293
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,750
See you in the next video.
