1
00:00:00,701 --> 00:00:04,240
Let's say the United States economy is going into a recession,

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,221
or maybe even worse than a recession,

3
00:00:06,221 --> 00:00:08,712
and you are the chairman of the Federal Reserve

4
00:00:08,712 --> 00:00:10,222
and you need to do something about it.

5
00:00:10,222 --> 00:00:12,883
Well the first thing that you would do is that you would lower the

6
00:00:12,883 --> 00:00:17,825
Federal Funds Rate, and that's the rate that banks lend to each other overnight

7
00:00:17,825 --> 00:00:22,560
and the way that you lower it, if the banks don't do it on their own after you say you want to lower it

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,869
is that you print money, as the Federal Reserve

9
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:31,452
and you use it to buy, usually short-term treasury securities

10
00:00:31,452 --> 00:00:34,058
and that money gets deposited in banks,

11
00:00:34,058 --> 00:00:37,124
so the demand for reserves, because that's what these things are

12
00:00:37,124 --> 00:00:40,274
the demand for reserves goes down, and the supply goes up

13
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:42,879
and the federal funds rate should go down.

14
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,108
But what happens if you keep doing this,

15
00:00:45,108 --> 00:00:47,378
and you keep lowering the federal funds rate

16
00:00:47,378 --> 00:00:49,501
all the way down so that the overnight borrowing rate is

17
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:54,243
approximately 0%, what do you do then?

18
00:00:54,243 --> 00:00:57,209
If the economy still looks like it's in a bit of a tail spin?

19
00:00:57,209 --> 00:01:01,211
well you could still print, you could still print money

20
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:04,187
but using that money to buy short-term debt

21
00:01:04,187 --> 00:01:06,748
won't help any, because you're not going to lower

22
00:01:06,748 --> 00:01:10,020
the short-term overnight inter-bank interest rate anymore,

23
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:16,572
so you can go out and buy other things

24
00:01:16,572 --> 00:01:23,104
and those other things can be longer-term treasuries

25
00:01:23,104 --> 00:01:26,329
or, they could be other types of securities

26
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:31,181
they could be, you could buy mortgage backed securities

27
00:01:31,181 --> 00:01:35,614
you could buy commercial debt

28
00:01:35,614 --> 00:01:38,199
and this idea of printing money,

29
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:40,347
not just for a target interest rate,

30
00:01:40,347 --> 00:01:43,614
but essentially to get that money into circulation

31
00:01:43,614 --> 00:01:46,028
and maybe to effect other parts of the market

32
00:01:46,028 --> 00:01:51,629
this is called quantitative easing.

33
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:55,270
And in Bernanke's mind, although that's exactly what he's doing

34
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,281
he's printing money to buy other things

35
00:01:57,281 --> 00:01:58,980
than what the Fed traditionally does,

36
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,214
when it cares about the overnight borrowing rate,

37
00:02:01,214 --> 00:02:03,883
he calls it, not necessarily quantitative easing,

38
00:02:03,883 --> 00:02:06,365
but credit easing, and in his mind,

39
00:02:06,365 --> 00:02:08,876
even though mechanically they're the same thing,

40
00:02:08,876 --> 00:02:11,069
in his mind, he's saying, "Look, I'm printing this money

41
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:13,615
"...not just for the sake of printing the money,

42
00:02:13,615 --> 00:02:15,198
"...and putting it into circulation,

43
00:02:15,198 --> 00:02:20,378
"...I'm printing the money so that I can buy particular assets,

44
00:02:20,378 --> 00:02:24,694
"...where it seems like there might be a log jam in the credit market"

45
00:02:24,694 --> 00:02:27,352
because with just printing money and buying government securities

46
00:02:27,352 --> 00:02:30,360
maybe the interest rates on government debt goes down

47
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,804
but maybe because of panic or crisis, interest or the prices on these things

48
00:02:35,804 --> 00:02:39,092
don't behave properly. So in order to fix that

49
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:43,210
credit easing, in Bernanke's sense, would be to

50
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:47,348
go out and buy this type of asset.
