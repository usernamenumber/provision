1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,950
   

2
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:01,800
Hello.

3
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,820
I'm now going to use the actual
Khan Academy website to

4
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:05,680
do some more problems.

5
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,490
And this time we're going to
go the other way around.

6
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,860
We're going to look at the
graph of a trigonometric

7
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,090
function and we're going to try
to figure out the equation.

8
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,950
So let's start with the problem
we have in front of us.

9
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,990
So we have a-- well we don't
know if it's a sine curve or a

10
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,680
cosine curve, but I guess it's
fair to say that it's

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,390
one of the two.

12
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,250
Actually, let's answer
that question first.

13
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,020
What do you think this is?

14
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:31,490
Do you think that this is a
sine curve or a cosine curve?

15
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,290
What's the difference?

16
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,560
Or what's the easiest
difference to differentiate

17
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,840
between the two?

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,870
Well, what was sine of 0?

19
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:41,110
Let me get a little
chalkboard in here.

20
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,140
Let me bring it right here.

21
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,040
   

22
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,845
Let me make sure my
pen tool is correct.

23
00:00:48,845 --> 00:00:51,640
All right.

24
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,540
What is sine of 0?

25
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,420
And it could be 0
degrees or 0 radians.

26
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,930
Well if you remember from a
couple of the other modules,

27
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,570
or even if you want to use a
calculator, sine of 0 is 0.

28
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,150
And what is cosine of 0?

29
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,030
Well cosine of 0, if you
remember from the last modules

30
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,840
or you want to use a
calculator-- although you

31
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,010
shouldn't have to use a
calculator for cosine of 0--

32
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,980
you might remember
that it was 1.

33
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:23,820
So this graph that we have
here, it's definitely when x is

34
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,530
0, when the x-axis is 0, the
function definitely isn't 0.

35
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,100
In fact, in this
case it's 1 1/2.

36
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,130
So this tells us that this
isn't a sine curve-- although

37
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,710
later with shifts we'll learn
that it could be a shifted sine

38
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,120
curve-- that this isn't a sine
curve, that this is

39
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,120
a cosine curve.

40
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,080
And then you might ask, well
Sal if this is a cosine curve

41
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:48,230
why is f of 0 equal to 1
1/2, or 3/2, instead of 1?

42
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:52,010
Because I just said here
that cosine of 0 is 1.

43
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,240
Well that's because there must
be some type of a coefficient

44
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,610
here, let's call it A, that is
changing the amplitude

45
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,170
of this cosine curve.

46
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,160
And if you remember from
the last module, what

47
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,380
do you think this A is?

48
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,600
Well that A is just literally
the amplitude of the curve.

49
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,710
And what's the amplitude
of this curve?

50
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:14,950
Well, the amplitude of this
curve, if we just see how much

51
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,710
it moves above and below the
x-axis, well it's that 3/2,

52
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,610
or that 1 1/2, we've
been talking about.

53
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,030
See it moves up 3/2,
and it moves down 3/2.

54
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,530
So let me just write that.

55
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:35,410
So we know that this is 3/2
cosine of, well, something x.

56
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,490
Right?

57
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:41,360
We know f of x is equal to
3/2 cosine of something x.

58
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,140
And we could use the formula
that we learned in the previous

59
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,510
video, that it equals
2pi over the period x.

60
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,430
So now we just have to look at
the graph and try to figure

61
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,720
out what the period
of the graph is.

62
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,420
Well how many radians does
it take for the graph to

63
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,110
start repeating again?

64
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,450
Let me click on the
hint button, and maybe

65
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,460
this'll help us.

66
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,900
When I click hint--
there; drew the period.

67
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,180
And you could have figured
it out on your own.

68
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,990
If you just go from any point
and then follow the curve back

69
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:15,540
to the same point again, you'll
see how long it's period is.

70
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,730
And the hint on the Khan
icon actually told us

71
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,430
that the period is 4pi.

72
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,475
And you could just start from
any point to any other point.

73
00:03:20,475 --> 00:03:23,860
You could have gone from this
point and then gone down,

74
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,350
gone back up, come down.

75
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,680
And then you would have seen
that this distance is also 4pi.

76
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,200
So we know that the
period is 4pi.

77
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,060
And then I could click hint
again and it'll tell us stuff

78
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,810
that we already figured out.

79
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,700
The amplitude, we already
figured out, was 1 1/2.

80
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,525
But let's just use a period,
because we already knew

81
00:03:38,525 --> 00:03:39,750
what the amplitude is.

82
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,370
So the period here we already
figured out was 4pi.

83
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,670
So let's just write
that in our equation.

84
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:56,400
So f of x is equal to 3/2
cosine of 2pi divided by

85
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,810
the period-- the period
in this case is 4pi-- x.

86
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:11,770
That equals 3/2
cosine of 1/2 x.

87
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:14,060
Now if you ever forget this
formula, which frankly

88
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:14,990
I always do forget it.

89
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,210
I've actually never
memorized it.

90
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,920
I just try to think about
what the period would be.

91
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,680
The way I think about it is the
coefficient on the x-term,

92
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,360
that's a measure of how
many cycles does the graph

93
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,300
do within 2pi radians.

94
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,150
Let me see if I can explain
that within the context

95
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,240
of this problem.

96
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,720
So this problem, if we start at
0 and then 2pi is here, how

97
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,330
many cycles do we complete
by the time we get to 2pi?

98
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,950
We start here, we go back
here, and then we're at 2pi.

99
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,980
Well we only got halfway
done through a cycle.

100
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,420
So that's the coefficient
on the x-term.

101
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,230
And that's how I remember it.

102
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:56,980
So I could just say, well
that's 3/2 cosine of

103
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,430
how many cycles do I
complete in 2pi radians?

104
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,810
Well I only complete
half a cycle.

105
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,660
3/2 times the cosine of 1/2 x.

106
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,580
So that's our f of x.

107
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,550
Let's do another problem.

108
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:18,490
   

109
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,130
All right.

110
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:19,490
OK.

111
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,630
This one's interesting.

112
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,520
So the first thing, just by
inspection we can figure out

113
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,590
what this amplitude is.

114
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,860
This is pretty easy.

115
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,130
Right?

116
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:30,180
How much does it move above
and below the x-axis?

117
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,860
Well it only goes 1, so we know
that the coefficient, or the

118
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,020
multiplier times the sine
or the cosine function--

119
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,240
whichever this is-- is 1.

120
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,680
So let's write that down.

121
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:48,300
Let's write down that the
amplitude is equal to 1.

122
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,580
Now let's try to figure
out if this is a sine

123
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,800
or a cosine function.

124
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:59,290
In the last problem we
said sine of 0 is 0

125
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,880
and cosine of 0 is 1.

126
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,750
Well f of 0 of this function,
whichever it is, is 0.

127
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:08,830
So we know this is a
non-shifted sine function.

128
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:09,870
So there.

129
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,080
We have another piece
of information.

130
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,070
It's a sine function.

131
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:15,120
   

132
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,680
So the last thing we have to
figure out, we can either

133
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,110
figure out the period or we
could use the method that I

134
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:23,500
just showed you where we say,
well how many times does it

135
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,800
cycle within 2pi radians?

136
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,610
So let's do it that way.

137
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,910
And then we immediately
know the coefficient.

138
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,270
Let's see.

139
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,770
Well actually, this graph
board doesn't even get

140
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:32,960
all the way to 2pi.

141
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,480
But let's see.

142
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,890
It goes one cycle, two cycles.

143
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,770
And I did two cycles in
only pi radians, right?

144
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,840
Because I'm only at
x equals pi here.

145
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,830
So if I did two cycles in pi
radians, then we must be able

146
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,820
to do four cycles
in 2pi radians.

147
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,100
Or we could actually
start here.

148
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,750
Actually, this is better.

149
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,020
Right?

150
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,230
Going from negative pi to pi.

151
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,990
That's 2pi radians.

152
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:58,560
So we finish one cycle,
two cycles, three

153
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,080
cycles, four cycles.

154
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,670
So then we know what the
coefficient on the x-term is.

155
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,960
So we know that it
is sine of 4x.

156
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,340
So the answer here is f of x is
equal to 1-- because that's the

157
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:16,400
amplitude-- the amplitude
times sine of 4x.

158
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,620
I think we have
time for one more.

159
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,410
And I want you to-- don't just
mechanically do whatever

160
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:22,840
I'm telling you.

161
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,420
I want you to think about why
counting the number of cycles

162
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,150
within 2pi radians, why
that makes sense to you.

163
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,160
Then think back to
the unit circle.

164
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,790
Or think back why that formula,
the 2pi divided by the period,

165
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:34,610
is also the coefficient.

166
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,100
Think about why
that makes sense.

167
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,990
If you realize why it makes
sense you'll never have to

168
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,310
memorize it, and then 20 years
later when you're doing it like

169
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,520
I'm doing it right now
you won't be confused.

170
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,460
You'll be able to
re-derive the formulas.

171
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,320
Let's do one more.

172
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:53,840
   

173
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,080
All right.

174
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,890
So what's the amplitude here?

175
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:57,430
Well, let's see.

176
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,510
The amplitude is 1/2.

177
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:03,462
So let me delete the old stuff
that I was writing before.

178
00:08:03,462 --> 00:08:04,905
For some reason
it's not deleting.

179
00:08:04,905 --> 00:08:07,900
   

180
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,220
OK.

181
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,200
Hope I don't confuse you.

182
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,980
So the amplitude, let's
just call it Amplitude,

183
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,730
is equal to 1/2.

184
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:18,140
   

185
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:24,040
And how many cycles does it
complete within 2pi radians?

186
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,560
Let's see.

187
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,180
If we start here it looks like
it completes only half a cycle.

188
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:30,390
Right?

189
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:35,770
Because it takes 4pi radians
to complete the entire cycle.

190
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,820
So it only completes
half a cycle.

191
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,450
So we could think of
it either two ways.

192
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:45,730
We could say that the period is
equal to 4pi, because that's

193
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,720
how long it takes to complete
one cycle, or we could say

194
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,710
it can only complete half a
cycle within 2pi radians.

195
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,130
The last thing we have to
figure out: Is it a sine

196
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,340
or a cosine function?

197
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,640
Well, f of 0 is 0.

198
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,020
Right?

199
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,250
So it's a non-shifted
sine function.

200
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,500
So then we're done.

201
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:09,160
We have f of x is equal to
1/2-- figured out it's a sine

202
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,950
function-- sine of what?

203
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,280
How many cycles did it
complete in 2pi radians?

204
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,950
It only completed half a cycle.

205
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,090
Let me not cover the problem.

206
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,360
It only completes half a cycle.

207
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,530
So it's 1/2 sine of 1/2 x.

208
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:29,300
Or we could use the formula f
of x equals goes 1/2 sine of

209
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,190
2pi divided by the period x.

210
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,430
Right?

211
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:37,840
Because 2pi divided by the
period is equal to 2pi over

212
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,100
4pi, which also equals 1/2.

213
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,210
I think that'll give you
a sense of how to do

214
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,850
these problems now.

215
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,740
And I encourage you to
practice them on the

216
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,140
Khan Academy website.

217
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,630
Have fun.

218
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:51,800
