1
00:00:00,779 --> 00:00:04,674
We have our scale again,
with some masses on the left-hand side,

2
00:00:04,674 --> 00:00:08,116
and some masses on the right-hand side
and we see that our scale is balanced.

3
00:00:08,116 --> 00:00:12,815
We have the same total mass on the left-hand side
that we have on the right-hand side.

4
00:00:12,815 --> 00:00:15,402
Instead of labeling the mystery masses with a question mark,

5
00:00:15,402 --> 00:00:16,882
I have labeled them all "x."

6
00:00:16,882 --> 00:00:21,300
Since they all have an 'x' on them, we know
that each of these has the same mass.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,947
What I am curious about is:
what is that mass?

8
00:00:23,947 --> 00:00:28,815
What is the mass of each of these
mystery masses?

9
00:00:28,815 --> 00:00:36,420
I will let you think about this for a second:
how would you figure out what the mystery mass is,

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,349
or what this x-value actually is?
How many kilograms is each of these things?

11
00:00:41,349 --> 00:00:45,681
What could you do to either one 
or both sides of this scale?

12
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:47,650
I will give you a few seconds to think about that...

13
00:00:49,815 --> 00:00:51,882
You might be tempted to say,

14
00:00:51,882 --> 00:00:57,430
"If I could end up with just one mystery mass,
and if I keep my scale balanced,

15
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,882
then that thing will be equal
to whatever is on the right-hand side."

16
00:01:00,882 --> 00:01:02,949
And that part would be a true statement.

17
00:01:02,949 --> 00:01:07,749
And to get to just one of these mystery masses,
you might say,

18
00:01:07,749 --> 00:01:11,923
"Why don't I just remove two of them?

19
00:01:11,923 --> 00:01:18,419
Why don't I just remove that one 
and that one?

20
00:01:18,419 --> 00:01:20,747
Then I will just be left with that single one."

21
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,013
But if you just removed these two,

22
00:01:23,013 --> 00:01:28,147
the left-hand side would become lighter
than the right-hand side,

23
00:01:28,147 --> 00:01:32,680
So left will move up, 
and right will move down.

24
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,763
Now you could say: "OK, I understand!
Whatever I do to the left-hand side,

25
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:40,213
I have to do to the right-hand side
so I can keep my scale balanced."

26
00:01:40,213 --> 00:01:45,147
So you might say: "Why don't I remove 
2 of these mystery masses from the right-hand side?"

27
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:48,347
But that is a problem too, because
you don't know what this mystery mass is.

28
00:01:48,347 --> 00:01:50,091
You could try to remove two,

29
00:01:50,091 --> 00:01:52,480
but how many of these blocks
represent a mystery mass?

30
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,747
We actually do not know.

31
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:58,080
But you might then say, "I have got
three of these things here,

32
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,165
If I multiply what I have here by a third,

33
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:06,347
If I leave a third of the stuff here,
and I leave a third of the stuff here,

34
00:02:06,347 --> 00:02:08,480
then the scales should be balanced."

35
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,480
If this has the same total mass as this,

36
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,680
then 1/3 of this total mass will be equal
to 1/3 of that total mass.

37
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,280
So let's just keep only one-third
of this here.

38
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,850
This is equivalent to multiplying
by one-third.

39
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:29,565
If we are only going to keep 1/3 there,
we will be left with only one of the masses,

40
00:02:29,565 --> 00:02:31,840
And if we only keep 1/3 here, let's see,

41
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,556
we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 masses.

42
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:43,218
If we multiply this by one-third:
1/3 x 9 is only 3.

43
00:02:43,218 --> 00:02:47,909
So we remove these, and now we have 1/3 of 
what we had on the right-hand side,

44
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:50,547
and 1/3 of what we originally had
on the left-hand side.

45
00:02:50,547 --> 00:02:55,480
And they will be balanced, because
we took 1/3 of the same total masses.

46
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,347
And so, what you are left with is
just one of these mystery masses

47
00:02:59,347 --> 00:03:02,680
- this 'x' thing over here, 
whatever x might be -

48
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,556
and you have 3 kilograms on the right-hand side.

49
00:03:05,556 --> 00:03:09,347
So you can make the conclusion,
as you kept this thing balanced the whole time,

50
00:03:09,347 --> 00:03:12,634
that x = 3.
