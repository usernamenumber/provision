1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,650
   

2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,650
In the last video, I hinted
that this was leading to a

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,940
discussion of an elastic money
supply-- or a supply of money

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,890
that can change depending on
the needs for the money.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,340
So before we go there-- and I
took a little hiatus and told

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,880
you a little bit about
treasuries because that's a

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,710
critical component-- let's
review what the

8
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,400
money supply even is.

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,030
So there were two definitions.

10
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:25,050
When we had originally talked
about kind of an M0, I talked

11
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,530
about just the gold reserves,
but now we're going to expand

12
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,640
that definition a little bit
and I think you can tell--

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,650
I've got a lot of questions
about this-- eventually

14
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,990
getting off the gold reserve
system and we will get there

15
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:41,070
and we're kind of already there,
but now I'll consider

16
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,400
the base money supply
as Federal Reserve

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,640
deposits and notes.

18
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,570
So in this reality that I just
created, all of the Federal

19
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,340
Reserve deposits have
essentially been turned into

20
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,180
notes, but if this bank didn't
want all cash, it could have

21
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,600
had some of this as just a
checking account with the

22
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,140
Federal Reserve bank.

23
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,230
So a Federal Reserve note and
a Federal Reserve deposit

24
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,140
account is essentially
the same thing.

25
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,940
A note is just a little
bit more fungible.

26
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,110
You can hand it to someone and
then they can hand it to

27
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,760
someone else, while a checking
account or demand account with

28
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,820
the Federal Reserve bank, you
have to kind of do a wire

29
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,330
transfer or write a check, et
cetera, but that is the base

30
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:18,930
money supply.

31
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,150
You could call that
base money.

32
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:25,980
And that's essentially the size
of the liabilities of the

33
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,510
Federal Reserve, in very broad
terms. We'll go into detail on

34
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,000
the actual Federal
Reserve's balance

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,130
sheet in the near future.

36
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,860
So in this example right now,
our base money supply is 200--

37
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,020
let's call it dollars now.

38
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,340
Let's move away from
gold pieces.

39
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,930
Let's just say a dollar equals
a gold piece for the sake of

40
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,880
our instruction right now.

41
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,260
So our base money supply--
and I'll call that M0.

42
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:51,610
   

43
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,310
And that's the cash out there,
which are the Federal Reserve

44
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,870
notes plus the Federal Reserve
demand deposits.

45
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:01,100
So for example, this could have
been just 100, like a

46
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,140
checking account at the reserve
bank and then this

47
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,800
over here would have been a
checking account instead.

48
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,330
But it would still be considered
part of the base

49
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,830
money supply because if this
bank, who had a checking

50
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,880
account, says, I just want that
in terms of notes, then

51
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,350
the Federal Reserve bank will
just issue notes and cancel

52
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,330
out this checking account and it
would turn back into notes.

53
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,150
So they're equivalent.

54
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,630
They're just a different way
of keeping track of it.

55
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,870
So that's the base
money supply.

56
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,740
Now, a slightly broader
definition

57
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,840
of the money supply.

58
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,585
We could call this bank money.

59
00:02:29,585 --> 00:02:33,160
It's sometimes referred to as
that and the formal definition

60
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,740
is M1-- and that's essentially
that notion that I went over I

61
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,000
think almost 10 videos ago--
how much money do

62
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,440
people think they have?

63
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,810
And that's the amount of money
in demand deposit accounts.

64
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,670
So that in this case,
that's this.

65
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,890
So all the people in this bank,
they think they have

66
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,360
$100 there, right?

67
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,500
That's $100 that they think that
they have that they can

68
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,450
write checks against.
And then this bank

69
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,710
also has another $100.

70
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:12,820
And so the base money supply--
no, that's not right.

71
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,420
No, no, sorry.

72
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,530
They don't have $100.

73
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,180
Why am I saying $100?

74
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:17,460
Let's see.

75
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:23,750
This bank had $100 in gold and
it could lend out up to $200

76
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,700
in-- or it could put
out up to $200 in

77
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,830
checking deposit accounts.

78
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,220
So it has $200.

79
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,850
Right, that's what I was--
because we talked about

80
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,670
earlier in the last video that
we have a 50% reserve ratio,

81
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,290
which tells us that if this
bank has $100 in reserves,

82
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:46,130
that it can essentially manage--
or it can issue $200

83
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,810
in demand deposit accounts.

84
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,010
And we went over that many times
on how that happens.

85
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,350
And then this bank
can do the same.

86
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,040
It'll have $200 in demand
deposit accounts.

87
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,790
And so the total amount of money
that people think they

88
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:04,150
have, either in demand deposit
accounts-- in this situation,

89
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,330
I'm assuming that all of the
cash is sitting in the reserve

90
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,330
bank, although we do know that
some of this is going to be

91
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,490
sitting around circulating.

92
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,530
But let's just say we live in
a world where everyone uses

93
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,670
debit cards all the time
and no-one uses cash.

94
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,870
And I think we're heading to
that world very quickly.

95
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,410
And as we'll see soon, that
actually increases the money

96
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,339
supply when you do that.

97
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,740
But anyway, I don't want to
go too technical just yet.

98
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,950
But the M1, which is the total
amount of demand deposit

99
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:29,540
accounts in our universe,
is $400.

100
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,660
And this relationship makes
a lot of sense because our

101
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,410
reserve requirements are 50%.

102
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:38,190
So we can kind of assume that
banks tend to get as close to

103
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,890
their reserve requirement as
they can because they don't

104
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,390
get interest on reserves.

105
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:47,200
They make interest on the loans
that they make against

106
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,540
demand accounts.

107
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,090
So if the reserve requirement
were 10% and our base money

108
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:56,550
was $200, we would probably see
$2,000 in the M1 supply.

109
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,840
So my question to you is-- and
maybe you want to pause and

110
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,470
think about this is-- how can
the government or the central

111
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,930
bank or, how can the economy,
increase or

112
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,470
decrease the money supply?

113
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,110
And I guess the first question
is, why would you want to

114
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,420
increase or decrease
the money supply?

115
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,060
Well, let's say we're in this
world already and we only have

116
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,810
these two banks.

117
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,250
And we have an M1
supply of $400.

118
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,130
But let's say the
economy expands.

119
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,590
We have more goods
and services that

120
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,260
we're able to produce.

121
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,140
Maybe we have immigrants come
in so we have more labor.

122
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:31,150
Maybe we have some innovative
technology.

123
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,110
Or maybe it's just seasonal.

124
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,600
Maybe it's the crop planting
season so a lot of farmers

125
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,830
need their cash in order
to hire people

126
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,920
to plant the crops.

127
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,800
So that's another time where
you'd want more money.

128
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,120
If you don't increase the money
supply at those times

129
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,220
when you have economic expansion
or there's just more

130
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,260
demand because of some type of
seasonal fluctuaction-- if you

131
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,340
don't increase the money, then
what you're going to do is

132
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,620
money's going to become
more expensive.

133
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,390
And I'll do a whole video
on that so don't get too

134
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,550
confused, but money getting
more expensive means that

135
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,200
interest rates will go up.

136
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,510
And if money becomes too
expensive, then some good

137
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,470
projects, maybe some farmers who
might have planted seeds,

138
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,970
wouldn't be able to-- and so
you would kind of restrict

139
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,070
economic expansion.

140
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:12,090
But we'll have a whole other
discussion on when does it

141
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,750
make sense to expand
or contract money.

142
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,820
Let's just talk now about how
you would actually do it.

143
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,860
So there's two ways.

144
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,550
I just said if this reserve
requirement were 10%, then

145
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,200
these banks could create more
checking accounts, right?

146
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,090
They could lend out more money
and create more checking

147
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,460
accounts if the reserve
requirement were 10%.

148
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:34,130
If it was 10%, then you would
have an M1 of $2,000, right?

149
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,256
It would be 10 times this
instead of two times this.

150
00:06:36,256 --> 00:06:38,770
   

151
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,410
And that is considered one of
the tools of the Federal

152
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,040
Reserve bank.

153
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,790
Because we've said in the past
that the Federal Reserve bank

154
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,640
actually sets these reserve
requirements.

155
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,680
But the problem with that tool,
if you think about it,

156
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,670
is, if we made a reserve
requirement 10%, right?

157
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,970
And all of a sudden all of these
banks started lending a

158
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,840
lot more money and they
only had 10%.

159
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,460
The ratio of reserves to
checking accounts were 10%.

160
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,430
Think about what would happen
if we wanted to raise the

161
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,630
reserve requirement
back to 50%.

162
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,150
Then all of the banks-- they'd
only have 10% reserves.

163
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:13,540
How would they get
back to 50%?

164
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:17,570
All of these banks would have to
either start selling assets

165
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,690
or unwinding loans.

166
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,330
It would be a very
messy situation.

167
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,850
If you were to lower the reserve
requirement and then

168
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,880
wanted to actually increase it
again, you would actually make

169
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,640
a lot of banks become
undercapitalized, because most

170
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,630
banks just operate right
at where they need to.

171
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,820
So you really don't want to mess
around with this reserve

172
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,660
requirement much.

173
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,830
So the question is, if you're
not going to change the

174
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:41,510
reserve requirement, which is
the ratio of the reserves to

175
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:44,030
checking accounts, if you're not
going to mess with that,

176
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,320
the only other way that you
can actually increase the

177
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,420
number of checking accounts is
if somehow you can increase

178
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,600
the reserves.

179
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:56,120
If you can somehow add some
actual reserves over here.

180
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,210
So my question is, how
can you do that?

181
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:01,480
Well, let's just say that--
we're hopefully already

182
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,180
reasonably familiar with
fractional reserve banking.

183
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,770
So you might have seen it
coming, that that also applies

184
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:09,790
to the central bank.

185
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,110
So the central bank right now,
all of its deposits were

186
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,910
directly backed by gold, 1:1.

187
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:19,400
But there's nothing to stop
this bank from also doing

188
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,130
fractional reserve lending.

189
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:24,970
And actually, the central bank
has no reserve requirement.

190
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,690
And that's because to some
degree, it can always provide

191
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:31,180
the liquidity because its notes
are obligations of the

192
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:31,630
government.

193
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:36,059
So it can always tax more people
to back up its loans.

194
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:39,700
So what essentially the Federal
Reserve can do is--

195
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,159
and this is the printing press
of the base money supply that

196
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,190
people talk about.

197
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,460
But there's two printing
presses.

198
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,640
There's the base money printing
press and then

199
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,750
there's the leverage
printing press.

200
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,170
So if this increases-- well,
I'll do a whole video on that

201
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,950
another-- I don't want to get
too technical because I

202
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,930
realize I'm running
out of time.

203
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,880
So what the Federal Reserve
could do in this situation is

204
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,690
it can print some notes.

205
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:09,450
So let's say it prints 100 of
the notes, right, and those

206
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,360
are just-- it literally just
prints those dollars.

207
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,260
It pays the treasury to print
it for them, but it creates

208
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,400
these notes and then of course,
offsetting that is a

209
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,000
liability, right?

210
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,190
Notes outstanding,
100 liability.

211
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,990
And then what it does is, it
takes these $100-- I mean,

212
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,290
these are literally dollar bills
although it could be

213
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:33,540
some type of demand account or
whatever, but take these $100

214
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:38,220
bills that it printed and
then it can buy treasury

215
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,170
securities.

216
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,920
So what happens if it takes
these $100 bills and buys

217
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,350
treasuries?

218
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,790
And the treasuries don't
have to be issued by

219
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,630
the government anymore.

220
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,630
Because whenever the government
does issue

221
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,760
treasuries, it's bought
by just a bunch of

222
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,310
people in the world.

223
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,340
There's always a bunch of
treasuries sitting out there

224
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,300
as long as the treasury
has some debt.

225
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,650
So I was holding the treasuries
and let's say that

226
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,900
this is the central bank.

227
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,510
   

228
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,780
I was holding some some of these
government IOUs, right,

229
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,820
that I had bought from
the government.

230
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:17,630
And the Federal Reserve,
they have this $100.

231
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,880
Let me draw that in green.

232
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,700
   

233
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,300
So they just buy the
treasury from me.

234
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,640
Maybe I don't want to sell it
at the current price so they

235
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,610
have to pay me a little bit more
than the current price in

236
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,610
order for me to part with it--
and I'll do a whole other

237
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,510
video on what that means and
how that changes the yield

238
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,310
curve and all of that, but I
just want to get you to that

239
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:42,610
base notion that the treasury
essentially creates a notes

240
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,530
outstanding liability and has
an offsetting $100 of dollar

241
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:50,160
bills that it just created or
prints-- and then it can use

242
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,700
those $100 bills to buy
treasuries, or government

243
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,910
IOUs, in the open market.

244
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,510
And now what happens here?

245
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,820
Well, these $100 bills, these
are now treasuries.

246
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,060
   

247
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,450
And my question to you
is, what am I-- I

248
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,430
was holding a treasury.

249
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,730
It was sitting in my mattress.

250
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,790
What am I now going-- now
I don't have a treasury.

251
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,190
I have $100.

252
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,430
What am I going to do
with that $100?

253
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,950
Well, I'm going to deposit
it in the bank.

254
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,530
I'm going to deposit
it in the bank.

255
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,480
So this is me depositing
my $100.

256
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,100
Maybe I deposited it up here,
but-- and my checking account

257
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,520
grows a little bit, but
what's the net effect?

258
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,030
Now all of a sudden the banking
system, the national

259
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:34,500
banking system, has more
currency, more dollar

260
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,860
reserves, that apply to
its reserve ratio.

261
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,470
So now it got my $100 deposit.

262
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,140
Now it can also do another
$100 of lending.

263
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,370
So I would have essentially
increased the base-- so now

264
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:50,550
the M0 goes from $200 to $300
right, because I have $300 in

265
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,670
notes outstanding.

266
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,960
And now my M1-- I took that $100
bill that the treasury

267
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,160
gave me, deposited it
in a bank account.

268
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,520
Now I have a bank account that
says $100 and then because of

269
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,150
a 50% reserve requirement, the
bank can issue another loan.

270
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,820
I know it's getting messy.

271
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,690
$400-- so essentially
our M1 is now $600.

272
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:14,780
So just like that, just by
printing money and issuing

273
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:20,890
treasuries, the central
bank was able to

274
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,880
increase the M1 by $200.

275
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,940
I'll do more videos on this.

276
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,910
I don't want to confuse
you too much.

277
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,420
See you soon.
