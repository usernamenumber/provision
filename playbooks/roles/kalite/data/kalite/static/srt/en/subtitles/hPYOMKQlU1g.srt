1
00:00:03,942 --> 00:00:05,470
Let's take a look at this capital.

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,621
It's what would be referred to as historiated capital

3
00:00:08,621 --> 00:00:12,232
which is to say that it's a capital that actually has a narrative carved into it.

4
00:00:12,232 --> 00:00:15,161
The most obvious and recognizable and decorative element

5
00:00:15,161 --> 00:00:18,557
a non-narrative element are the representations of acanthus leaves

6
00:00:18,557 --> 00:00:21,593
which come out of Greek and then Roman architecture

7
00:00:21,593 --> 00:00:24,668
but this is later, this is medieval, this is 13th century.

8
00:00:24,668 --> 00:00:27,303
And one of the things one notices about them immediately

9
00:00:27,303 --> 00:00:29,501
is how deeply carved they are.

10
00:00:29,501 --> 00:00:34,307
So you have those lovely dark shadows forming the edges of the leaves.

11
00:00:34,307 --> 00:00:38,674
One of the first elements that you see is the story of the original sin,

12
00:00:38,674 --> 00:00:42,187
story of Adam and Eve both of whom look really terrified.

13
00:00:42,187 --> 00:00:45,246
They do look terrified and they're both covering themselves

14
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:48,131
that tells us what specific moment in the story it is.

15
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:51,238
They know their nakedness and God is probably at this moment

16
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:54,294
confronting them and asking them why they hide from him.

17
00:00:54,294 --> 00:00:58,462
I love how their eyes are drilled with these deep holes

18
00:00:58,462 --> 00:01:01,666
and then they have these large oval shapes around them

19
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:04,305
so they just look like their eyes are bulging out of their heads

20
00:01:04,305 --> 00:01:08,745
from that terrible recognition of what they've done and how they've betrayed God.

21
00:01:08,745 --> 00:01:14,656
They've actually seem to have plucked one of the leaves of acanthus from the capital next to them

22
00:01:14,656 --> 00:01:17,620
in order to cover themselves and that's what they are hold between their hands.

23
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,624
Eve especially, she rips the top of that leave to her chest

24
00:01:21,624 --> 00:01:24,355
and her hair fans out like a flame.

25
00:01:24,355 --> 00:01:28,203
She's just a really powerful image of the knowledge

26
00:01:28,203 --> 00:01:30,663
of what they've done and the consequences

27
00:01:30,663 --> 00:01:34,164
of what their actions are gonna be are already present here.

28
00:01:34,164 --> 00:01:36,511
It's widely emotional in that sense

29
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:39,828
and I think that in the 21st century we would even say psychological now.

30
00:01:39,828 --> 00:01:43,506
There's another Old Testament scene that's represented on this capital.

31
00:01:43,506 --> 00:01:47,497
If we move to the right we actually have a pretty complicated image

32
00:01:47,497 --> 00:01:50,628
of a large arching figure, an angel.

33
00:01:50,628 --> 00:01:52,517
You can see the angel's wings.

34
00:01:52,517 --> 00:01:56,790
She's got her hands around two figures, Abraham and Isaac.

35
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,159
And these figures are stumpy and not in correct proportions

36
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,633
in that we that we kind of think [of them] as Medieval

37
00:02:02,633 --> 00:02:08,068
and they are indicated by lines, as opposed to form.

38
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:11,703
So this is Abraham obviously about to kill Isaac, his son

39
00:02:11,703 --> 00:02:14,876
and the angel who stops him from doing this terrible thing

40
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:20,441
and you know this story is a prefiguration of the story of the crucifixion of Christ.

41
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:24,487
It's also critically important story in terms of the necessity

42
00:02:24,487 --> 00:02:26,416
of one's absolute obedience to God.

43
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:29,743
The protectiveness of the angel, of her arms,

44
00:02:29,743 --> 00:02:37,994
her wings covering the figures and the way that her head forms the corner of that capital,

45
00:02:37,994 --> 00:02:39,985
I think it's very powerful.

46
00:02:39,985 --> 00:02:45,563
It is interesting that the anger's face is not looking down to Abraham and Isaac

47
00:02:45,563 --> 00:02:48,839
but in some more direct way looking out to us.

48
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:51,205
In fact they all seem to be looking out to us.

49
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:54,511
It's beseeching us to follow this example.

50
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:56,783
The portals of many romanesque churches were decorated

51
00:02:56,783 --> 00:02:59,019
with scenes of the last judgement and the idea was

52
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:02,920
as you walked in you were reminded of the price of sin.

53
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,321
The price of sin was eternity in hell.

54
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:09,073
These are the choices that we face as humans

55
00:03:09,073 --> 00:03:10,704
about what we can do with our lives.

56
00:03:10,704 --> 00:03:14,135
Nobody is going to accuse romanesque sculptors of being subtle.

57
00:03:14,135 --> 00:03:18,202
And they are very powerful and very emotional

58
00:03:18,202 --> 00:03:21,042
and they have taken us a few moments to decode

59
00:03:21,042 --> 00:03:23,839
and visitors to the museum they have to look at the label

60
00:03:23,839 --> 00:03:28,904
but there is no doubt that anyone in the romanesque church in the 12th or 13th century

61
00:03:28,904 --> 00:03:31,247
would have been able to read these stories very easily.

62
00:03:31,247 --> 00:03:35,247
Yes, this is what have been very direct messages and constant reminders.
