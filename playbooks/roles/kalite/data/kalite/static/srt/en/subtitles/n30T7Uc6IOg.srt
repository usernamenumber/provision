1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,640
   

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:07,430
We are on problem number
10 on page 489.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:12,400
Stacy noted that she is both the
12th tallest and the 12th

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,510
shortest student in her class.

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:16,580
So let me write 12th down.

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,050
She's the 12th tallest and
shortest. If everyone in the

7
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,490
class is a different height,
how many students are

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,700
there in the class?

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,310
And these are the type of
questions that I just like to

10
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,470
make sure that I'm
not miscounting.

11
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,940
So she's the 12th tallest.
So what does that mean?

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:39,110
That means that there are 11
people taller than her.

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:47,460
So let's say from shortest to
tallest. So this is Stacy

14
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,650
right here.

15
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,150
And so, if she is the
12th tallest-- let

16
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:54,890
me put it this way.

17
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:58,220
If I said that she was the
first tallest, that means

18
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,420
there's no one taller
than her.

19
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,510
If she's the second tallest,
that means there's one person

20
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:03,440
taller than her.

21
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,560
If she's the third tallest, that
means there's two people

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,660
taller than her.

23
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,580
And likewise, if she's the 12th
tallest, that means that

24
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:16,240
there are 11 people taller.

25
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,930
Similarly, if she's the 12th
shortest, well, that must mean

26
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,890
that there are 11 shorter
than her.

27
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,250
So this is really just making
sure that you parse the words

28
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,290
correctly and count properly.

29
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,820
So if there's 11 shorter, 11
taller, and then there's

30
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,900
Stacy, well, that's
22 plus her.

31
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,780
There's 23 students
in the class.

32
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,920
And this is just to make sure
that you don't say, oh, 12

33
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,030
taller, 12 shorter, and say
25 or something like that.

34
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:46,650
It's just to confuse you
really, I think.

35
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,780
Problem number 11.

36
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,510
Image.

37
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,650
Clear image.

38
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,680
Invert colors.

39
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,200
Problem number 11.

40
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,450
Switch colors.

41
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,620
   

42
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:02,560
The quadratic function g is
given by-- this is just the

43
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,970
general way people write
quadratic functions-- is equal

44
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:12,280
to ax squared plus bx plus
c, where a and c

45
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,530
are negative constants.

46
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:19,050
   

47
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,000
Which of the following could
be the graph of g?

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,310
So I'm not going to even
look at the choices.

49
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,660
I'll just show you how I would--
if someone didn't even

50
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,610
give me any choices, and say,
well, if a and c are less than

51
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,280
0, what's this going
to look like?

52
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,352
So let's draw the x and y.

53
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:33,320
So let's say that that
is the x-axis.

54
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,520
   

55
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,730
Actually, I drew this--
let me edit, undo.

56
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,130
OK.

57
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,720
So let me draw the x-axis.

58
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,490
You might realize pretty soon
why I have to redo this.

59
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,740
The y-axis.

60
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:53,790
   

61
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,790
x, y.

62
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:56,510
All right.

63
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,060
So we know that a and
c are negative.

64
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,030
So c is the y-intercept,
right?

65
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,770
When x is equal to 0, we're
just left with g of

66
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:04,710
x is equal to c.

67
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,790
So c is the y-intercept.

68
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,140
So if c is less than 0, we know
that the y-intercept is

69
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,590
going to be below the x-axis.

70
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,780
It's going to be a
negative number.

71
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,360
We know that this is c.

72
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,180
That's where the graph
intersects the y-axis.

73
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,020
We also know it's going to be
symmetric around the y-axis.

74
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,750
   

75
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,970
Well, actually, we don't know
for sure that it's going to be

76
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,620
symmetrical around the y-axis.

77
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,630
And I could go into that in
more detail, but I won't.

78
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,880
But that's all we
need to know.

79
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,710
It depends what the bx--
this term-- is.

80
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,290
But let's just ignore
that for now.

81
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,310
And then we know that
a is negative.

82
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,260
So in general, you might want
to prove it to yourself, you

83
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,560
know the graph of y
equals x squared.

84
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,875
That opens up like this.

85
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:52,650
And the graph of y is equal
to minus x squared.

86
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,970
It goes down like that.

87
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,590
So a possible graph for this
would look like this.

88
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,040
   

89
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,300
The important thing is these
are the two things that you

90
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,340
know when they tell you
a and c is negative.

91
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,070
It's going to be a graph that
opens downwards, and it's

92
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:21,180
going to intersect the y-axis
in the negative area, below

93
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,520
the x-axis.

94
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,660
A legitimate graph also would
have looked like this.

95
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,890
It could have also
looked like this.

96
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,310
It didn't actually have
to be symmetric.

97
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,500
It depends what this
bx term does.

98
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,450
But if we look at the choices,
the only choice that

99
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:42,330
intercepts the y-axis below
the x-axis at a negative

100
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,940
y-intercept and opens
down is choice A.

101
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,680
There's only three choices
that open down, and only

102
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,540
choice A intercepts in
the negative area, so

103
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,150
the answer is A.

104
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,520
It actually looks eerily
like what I drew,

105
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,130
just out of the blue.

106
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,380
Next question.

107
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,770
   

108
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,930
Problem number 12.

109
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,190
OK, so they drew a square.

110
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,350
And I will draw a square,
because they drew a square.

111
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:17,960
And they say this is A, this
is B, this is C, D.

112
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,720
And this is P.

113
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,110
This is Q.

114
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,990
And out here is R.

115
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,580
I don't know where this
problem's going, but it looks

116
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,120
interesting.

117
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,600
Figure not drawn to
scale, of course.

118
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,510
In the figure above, ABCD
is a rectangle, with

119
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,760
BC is equal to 4.

120
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,240
   

121
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,940
AB is equal to 6.

122
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,800
P, Q, and R are different points
on a line, not shown,

123
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,850
that is parallel to AD.

124
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:54,020
So P, Q, and R are apparently
all on the same line that is

125
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,640
parallel to AD.

126
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,500
Well, I guess that is the
way they drew it.

127
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,060
So let me erase.

128
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:05,400
Let's just say this is Q.

129
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,610
That R is down here.

130
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,130
This isn't R.

131
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,320
So they're all on
the same line.

132
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,970
And they say the line
isn't shown, but

133
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,100
it's parallel to AD.

134
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,200
So let me draw that line.

135
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,116
So that line looks something
like this.

136
00:06:18,116 --> 00:06:21,520
Let me draw it straight.

137
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,310
And on that line, you have
P, Q, and R, and it

138
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,870
is parallel to AD.

139
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,120
Good enough.

140
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,070
   

141
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:37,220
Points P and Q are symmetric
about line AB.

142
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,790
   

143
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:46,690
OK, so that means that P and
Q are equidistant from this

144
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:52,450
line, so that means that
this distance is

145
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,350
equal to this distance.

146
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,300
When they say P and Q are
symmetric around AB, you can

147
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,720
almost pretend like AB's a
mirror right here, and P and Q

148
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,940
are the mirror images
of each other.

149
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,380
Good enough.

150
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:10,240
And then it also says
points Q and R are

151
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,460
symmetric around line CD.

152
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:16,710
   

153
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:21,650
So we also know that
this distance is

154
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,440
equal to this distance.

155
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,990
Good enough.

156
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:31,680
What is the length of PR?

157
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,600
   

158
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,100
This is fascinating.

159
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,830
So let's say that this length
right here-- let me do it in

160
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:45,840
yellow-- this length is x.

161
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,990
Then what is this green
length going to be?

162
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,800
This green length right here
is going to be 4 minus x.

163
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,600
   

164
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,840
How did I know it
was 4 minus x?

165
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,025
Well, this distance
up here is 4.

166
00:07:58,025 --> 00:08:00,550
   

167
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,520
So this is x.

168
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,800
This is 4 minus x.

169
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,860
Well, then this distance right
here is also going

170
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,490
to be 4 minus x.

171
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,070
And if this yellow distance is
x, then we also know that this

172
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,940
distance is x.

173
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,630
So the distance from P to R is
going to be the sum of all of

174
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:19,240
these, right? x plus x plus
4 minus x plus 4 minus x.

175
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,460
And I think you see where
this is going.

176
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:30,920
It's x plus x plus 4 minus
x plus 4 minus x.

177
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,360
These x's all cancel
out, right?

178
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,520
2x minus 2x.

179
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,990
And we're just left with 8.

180
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,929
And that's our answer.

181
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:37,919
B.

182
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,929
And you could've tried it out.

183
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:40,619
You could have assumed Q was
right in the middle, and it

184
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:43,340
would have worked out the same,
but you know for sure

185
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,360
that the answer is 8.

186
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,990
Next problem.

187
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,590
Image clear.

188
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,680
Invert.

189
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,010
I don't know if I'll
have time for this.

190
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,200
The price-- I get nervous when
I'm running out of time.

191
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,540
So I'm going to do this
in the next video.

192
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,300
See you soon.
