1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
   

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,170
Now that we know a little bit
about the convolution integral

3
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,200
and how it applies to the
Laplace transform, let's

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,950
actually try to solve an actual
differential equation

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,270
using what we know.

6
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,440
So I have this equation here,
this initial value problem,

7
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,410
where it says that the second
derivative of y plus 2 times

8
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:23,380
the first derivative of y, plus
2 times y, is equal to

9
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,970
sine of alpha t.

10
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,340
And they give us some
initial conditions.

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,740
They tell us that y of 0 is
equal to 0, and that y prime

12
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,090
of 0 is equal to 0.

13
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,350
And that's nice and convenient
that those initial conditions

14
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,280
tend to make the problem
pretty clean.

15
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,170
But let's get to the problem.

16
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,940
So the first thing we do is we
take the Laplace transform of

17
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,960
both sides of this equation.

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,470
The Laplace transform of
the second derivative

19
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,380
of y is just s squared.

20
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,550
This should be a bit of second
nature to you by now.

21
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,530
It's s squared times the Laplace
transform of Y, which

22
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,580
I'll just write as capital Y
of s, minus s-- so we start

23
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,500
with the same degree as the
number of derivatives we're

24
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,040
taking, and then we decrement
that every time-- minus s

25
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,130
times y of 0-- you kind of think
of this as the integral,

26
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,770
and you take the derivative 1,
so this isn't exactly the

27
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,286
derivative of that-- minus, you
decrement that 1, you just

28
00:01:22,286 --> 00:01:25,680
have a 1 there, y prime of o.

29
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,210
And that's the Laplace transform
of the second

30
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:28,730
derivative.

31
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:33,370
Now, we have to do the Laplace
transform of 2 times the first

32
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:33,860
derivative.

33
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:40,470
That's just going to be equal
to plus 2, times sY of s-- s

34
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,930
times the Laplace transform
of y; that's that

35
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,920
there-- minus y of 0.

36
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,010
And we just have one left.

37
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,110
The Laplace transform of 2y.

38
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,530
That's just equal to plus
2 times the Laplace

39
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,320
transform of y.

40
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,060
And then that's going to be
equal to the Laplace transform

41
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,910
of sine of alpha t.

42
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,300
We've done that multiple
times so far.

43
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:15,840
That's just alpha over s squared
plus alpha squared.

44
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,820
Now, the next thing we want to
do is we want to separate out

45
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,500
the Laplace transform of y
terms, or the Y of s terms.

46
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,790
Actually, even better, let's
get rid of these initial

47
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,640
conditions.

48
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,460
y of 0, and y prime of 0 is
0, so this term is 0.

49
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,230
That term is 0, and
that term is 0.

50
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,570
So our whole expression-- I
can get rid of the colors

51
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,380
now-- it just becomes-- let me
pick a nice color here--

52
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:51,230
becomes s squared times Y of
s, plus 2s, Y of s-- that's

53
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:57,580
that term right there-- plus
2Y of s, is equal to the

54
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:03,750
right-hand side, is equal to
alpha over s squared plus

55
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,960
alpha squared.

56
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,390
Now let's factor out the
Y of s, or the Laplace

57
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,210
transform of y.

58
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:17,790
And so we get s squared plus 2s,
plus 2, all of that times

59
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,350
Y of s, is equal to this
right-hand side, is equal to

60
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:26,480
alpha over s squared,
plus alpha squared.

61
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,350
Now we can divide both sides of
this equation by this thing

62
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,250
right here, by that
right there.

63
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:38,870
And we get Y of s, the Laplace
transform of Y is equal to

64
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:44,570
this thing, alpha over s
squared, plus alpha squared,

65
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:49,770
times-- or, you know, I could
just say times-- 1 over s

66
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,380
squared, plus 2s, plus 2.

67
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,040
I could just say divided by
this, but it works out the

68
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,700
same either way.

69
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,590
Now, what can we do here?

70
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,290
Remember, I was doing this in
the context of convolution, so

71
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:04,110
I want to look for a Laplace
transform that looks like the

72
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,820
product of two Laplace
transforms. I know what the

73
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,330
inverse Laplace transform
of this is.

74
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,380
In fact, I just took it.

75
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,890
It's sine of alpha t.

76
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,150
So if I can figure out the
inverse Laplace transform of

77
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,950
this, I could at least express
our function y of t at least

78
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,170
as a convolution integral, even
if I don't necessarily

79
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,070
solve the integral.

80
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,870
From there, it's just calculus,
or if it's an

81
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,180
unsolvable integral, we could
just use a computer or

82
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,060
something, although you could
actually use a computer to

83
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,500
solve this so, you might
skip some steps even

84
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,080
going through this.

85
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,360
But anyway, let's just try
to get this in terms of a

86
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,430
convolution integral.

87
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,930
So what can I do with this?

88
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,970
This is, let's see, this
isn't a perfect square.

89
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,250
So if this isn't a perfect
square, the next best thing is

90
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,870
to try to complete
the square here.

91
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:45,990
So let's try to write this as
a, so let's see, if I write

92
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:53,640
this as s squared plus 2s,
plus something, plus 2.

93
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,110
I just rewrote it like this.

94
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,250
And if I wrote this as s squared
plus 2s, plus 1, that

95
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,130
becomes s plus 1 squared.

96
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,210
But if I add a 1, I have
to also subtract a 1.

97
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,430
I can't just add 1's arbitrarily
to things.

98
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,990
So if I add 1 I have to subtract
a 1 to cancel out

99
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:07,430
with that 1.

100
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,690
So I really haven't changed
this at all, I just

101
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,720
rewrote it like this.

102
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,890
But this now, I can rewrite
this term right

103
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,900
here as s plus 1 squared.

104
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,460
And then this becomes plus 1.

105
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,810
That's this term right here.

106
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,250
This is the plus 1.

107
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:31,390
So I could rewrite my whole Y
of s is now equal to alpha

108
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:39,690
over s squared, plus alpha
squared, times 1 over this

109
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:45,630
thing, s plus 1 squared,
plus 1.

110
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:49,430
Now, I already said, I know
what the inverse Laplace

111
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,920
transform of this thing is.

112
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,760
   

113
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,600
Now I just have to figure out
what the inverse Laplace

114
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,260
transform of this thing is.

115
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:02,160
Of this-- let me pick a nice
color-- of this blue thing in

116
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,240
the blue box, and then
I can express it as

117
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,350
a convolution integral.

118
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,200
And how do I do that?

119
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,270
I could just do it right now.

120
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:11,250
I could just immediately say
that y of t-- let me write

121
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:17,830
this down-- y of t, so the
inverse is equal to the

122
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:22,740
inverse Laplace transform
of, obviously of Y of s.

123
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,430
Let me write that
down, Y of s.

124
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,630
Which is equal to the inverse
Laplace transform

125
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,420
of these two things.

126
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:36,370
The inverse Laplace transform of
alpha over s squared, plus

127
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:46,060
alpha squared, times 1 over
s plus 1 squared, plus 1.

128
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,300
And now the convolution theorem
tells us that this is

129
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,440
going to be equal to the inverse
Laplace transform of

130
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,182
this first term in
the product.

131
00:06:58,182 --> 00:07:02,740
So the inverse Laplace transform
of that first term,

132
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:08,960
alpha over s squared, plus
alpha squared, convoluted

133
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,710
with-- I'll do a little
convolution sign there.

134
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,510
I was about to say convulsion.

135
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,610
They're not too different.

136
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,930
Convoluted with the inverse
Laplace transform of this

137
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:27,990
term, the inverse Laplace
transform of 1 over s plus 1

138
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,950
squared, plus 1.

139
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,730
If I have the product of two
Laplace transforms, and I can

140
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,100
take each of them independently
and I can invert

141
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,410
them, the inverse Laplace
transform of their product is

142
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:44,230
going to be the convolution of
the inverse Laplace transforms

143
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:48,460
of each of them, each
of the terms.

144
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,920
And what I just said confused
me a bit, so I don't want to

145
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,470
confuse you.

146
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,550
But I think you get the idea.

147
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,620
I have these two things.

148
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,590
I recognize these
independently.

149
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,210
I can independently take the
inverse of each of these

150
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:02,840
things, so the inverse Laplace
transform of their products is

151
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,930
going to be the convolution
of each of their inverse

152
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,610
transforms. Now what's
this over here?

153
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,340
Well I had this in the beginning
of the problem?

154
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,210
The inverse Laplace transform
of this, right here, is sine

155
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,460
of alpha t.

156
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,070
   

157
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:24,140
And then we're going to
convolute that with the

158
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,070
inverse Laplace transform
of this right here.

159
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,980
Let's do a little bit of work on
the side, just to make sure

160
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,380
we get this right.

161
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:41,490
So the Laplace transform of sine
of t is equal to 1 over s

162
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,960
squared, plus 1.

163
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,480
That looks like this, but I
was shifted by minus 1.

164
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,780
You might remember that the
Laplace transform of e to the

165
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:58,090
at sine of t, when you multiply
e to the at times

166
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:00,350
anything, you're shifting
its Laplace transform.

167
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:04,820
So that will be equal
to 1 over s minus a

168
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,900
squared, plus 1.

169
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,390
We essentially shifted
it by a.

170
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,830
So now we have something that
looks very similar to this.

171
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:17,110
If we just set our a to be equal
to negative 1, here our

172
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:20,400
a is equal to negative 1, then
it fits this pattern.

173
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,230
This is s minus negative 1.

174
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,640
So the inverse Laplace transform
of this thing right

175
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:34,530
here is just e to the a, which
is minus 1, so minus 1t,

176
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:39,800
times sine of t.

177
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,980
So this is the solution to our
differential equation, even

178
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,780
though it's not in a pleasant
form to look at.

179
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,890
And we can, if we want, express
it as an integral.

180
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,410
I'm not going to actually solve
the integral in this

181
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,570
problem, because it gets hairy,
and it's not even clear

182
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,190
that-- well, I won't even
attempt to do it.

183
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,100
But I just want to get into a
form, and from there it's just

184
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,020
integral calculus.

185
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,500
or maybe a computer.

186
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,110
What's the convolution
of these two things?

187
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:10,400
It's the integral from 0 to t,
of sine of the first function

188
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,810
of t minus tau.

189
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,600
   

190
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,800
Well, I could actually switch,
and I haven't shown you this,

191
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,170
but we can switch the order
either way, but actually let

192
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,420
me just do it this way.

193
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,720
   

194
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,390
I could write this as
sine of [? out ?]

195
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:32,950
t minus tau, times alpha-- I'm
taking the sine of all of

196
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:42,870
those things-- times e to the
minus tau, sine of tau, dtau.

197
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,330
That's one way, that if I wanted
to express the solution

198
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,310
of this differential equation's
integral, I could

199
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,310
write it like that.

200
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,660
And it actually should be kind
of obvious to you that this

201
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,890
could go either way.

202
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:57,190
Because when it was a product up
here, obviously order does

203
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:57,730
not matter.

204
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,470
I could write this term first,
or I could write that term

205
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:05,450
first. So regardless of which
term is written first, the

206
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,690
same principle would apply.

207
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,910
And I'll formally prove
it in a future video.

208
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,290
So we could have also done
it the other way.

209
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:16,260
We could have written this
expression as e to the minus

210
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:22,700
t, sine of t, convoluted
with sine of alpha t.

211
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,510
And that would be equal to the
integral from 0 to t, of e to

212
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:38,560
the minus t minus tau, sine of
t, minus tau, times sine of

213
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,800
alpha tau, dtau.

214
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,770
So these are equivalent.

215
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:46,440
Either of these would be
an acceptable answer.

216
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,480
And normally on a test like
this, the teacher won't expect

217
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,240
you to actually evaluate
these integrals.

218
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,370
The teacher will just say, get
it into an integral just to

219
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:56,150
kind of see whether you know
how to convolute things and

220
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,260
get your solution to the
differential equation at least

221
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,310
into this form, because from
here it really is just, I

222
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,860
won't say basic calculus,
but it's

223
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,135
non-differential equations.

224
00:12:05,135 --> 00:12:08,560
So hopefully, this second
example with the convolution

225
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,790
to solve an inverse transform
clarified

226
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,940
things up a little bit.

227
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,209
