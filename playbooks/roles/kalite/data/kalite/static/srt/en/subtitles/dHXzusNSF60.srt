1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:04,287
Despite the fact that Wilson had just
won re-election in 1916

2
00:00:04,287 --> 00:00:06,609
based on a platform of keeping the
United States out of war,

3
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:07,932
by april...

4
00:00:07,932 --> 00:00:10,036
...by april of...

5
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:11,479
...nineteen...

6
00:00:11,495 --> 00:00:13,039
...seventeen,

7
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:16,171
the administration had decided that
Germany had gone too far, and in

8
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:20,209
particular had gone too far with the
unrestricted submarine warfare

9
00:00:20,209 --> 00:00:25,527
so this right over here is a picture of
President Wilson on april second

10
00:00:25,527 --> 00:00:31,145
1917 giving a war message
to Congress as to why the U.S.

11
00:00:31,145 --> 00:00:32,292
needs to declare

12
00:00:32,292 --> 00:00:34,820
war on Germany,

13
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,425
and april fourth

14
00:00:36,425 --> 00:00:40,411
Congress passes the resolution to
declare war, and the President

15
00:00:40,411 --> 00:00:43,289
approves it on april sixth, so by early april

16
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:44,920
the United States

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,074
was at

18
00:00:46,074 --> 00:00:51,649
war with Germany. Which is a good time to
start thinking about why did all of this happen.

19
00:00:51,657 --> 00:00:54,328
Now, the things that are typically cited,
and these are the things that are

20
00:00:54,328 --> 00:00:58,122
uh... inflamed public opinion in the
U.S. and that many of which were cited

21
00:00:58,122 --> 00:01:00,150
by President Woodrow Wilson,

22
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,143
and in this tutorial, that this is part of,
a kind of can of men at work,

23
00:01:03,143 --> 00:01:06,968
I've put the entire text of his speech,
which I highly recommend reading,

24
00:01:06,968 --> 00:01:10,401
to see all of the things that President
Wilson cited in his speech.

25
00:01:10,401 --> 00:01:14,199
But just as a summary of that, the things
that tend to get cited most often

26
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,779
are the unrestricted submarine warfare,

27
00:01:16,779 --> 00:01:18,557
on the part of Germany,

28
00:01:18,557 --> 00:01:20,206
unrestricted...

29
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:22,077
...submarine...

30
00:01:22,077 --> 00:01:26,879
...warfare, and particular cases are, the most
cited example of that is the sinking of

31
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,086
the Lusitania.

32
00:01:28,086 --> 00:01:30,319
The Germans stopped doing that for a
little under two years, but then

33
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:32,897
as we enter into 1917

34
00:01:32,897 --> 00:01:35,307
they began doing it again.

35
00:01:35,307 --> 00:01:36,321
And...

36
00:01:36,321 --> 00:01:40,346
it also made the Americans quite angry to realize that the Germans were trying

37
00:01:40,346 --> 00:01:43,125
to enside the Mexicans against them, so you have

38
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:44,656
the Zimmermann...

39
00:01:44,656 --> 00:01:47,214
you have the Zimmermann telegram

40
00:01:47,214 --> 00:01:48,437
the Zimmermann..

41
00:01:48,437 --> 00:01:49,504
...telegram,

42
00:01:49,504 --> 00:01:53,465
is also a reason that the Wilson
administration and why people

43
00:01:53,465 --> 00:01:54,501
in general were

44
00:01:54,501 --> 00:01:56,141
fairly angry about things.

45
00:01:56,141 --> 00:01:58,114
Now on top of that

46
00:01:58,114 --> 00:02:02,761
there were, there were atrocities
committed by the Germans in their march

47
00:02:02,761 --> 00:02:06,977
through Belgium as they were trying to
execute on the Schlieffen plan.

48
00:02:06,977 --> 00:02:08,656
So belgian..

49
00:02:08,656 --> 00:02:10,056
...belgian...

50
00:02:10,056 --> 00:02:12,524
...atrocities, and these were early in the war, at nineteen forty, which

51
00:02:12,524 --> 00:02:15,501
immediately made many Americans kind of
not like what's going on,

52
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:18,261
belgian atrocities.

53
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:20,922
And to put on top of that, the British were able to

54
00:02:20,922 --> 00:02:25,055
leverage the belgian atrocities, to
fairly, to execute...

55
00:02:25,055 --> 00:02:31,154
uh...a fairly effective propaganda
campaign uh... in America.

56
00:02:31,154 --> 00:02:33,674
Now on top of that, and this is
something that Wilson

57
00:02:33,674 --> 00:02:37,556
speaks very strongly about in his speech, is
the notion of fighting for Democracy

58
00:02:37,556 --> 00:02:40,926
fighting...

59
00:02:40,926 --> 00:02:42,276
...for...

60
00:02:42,276 --> 00:02:44,334
...fighting for Democracy.

61
00:02:44,334 --> 00:02:47,220
And what you have here, and in the
First World War,

62
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,034
the central powers, you're talking about the German
Empire, you're talking about the

63
00:02:50,034 --> 00:02:51,449
Austro-hungarians,

64
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:54,925
these are monarchies, these are,
emperors were controlling it, and even

65
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:58,445
though the UK, the United Kingdom was
nominally a kingdom

66
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:00,785
it was really a democracy,

67
00:03:00,785 --> 00:03:04,801
at least for those who could vote, we're
not talking about the entire British Empire.

68
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:06,077
So the UK...

69
00:03:06,077 --> 00:03:08,152
is functionally a democracy,

70
00:03:08,152 --> 00:03:09,598
...democratic...

71
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:11,779
and so was the third: French republic.

72
00:03:11,779 --> 00:03:13,232
...and so was...

73
00:03:13,232 --> 00:03:14,560
...and so was France.

74
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,872
So there's this argument that the U.S.

75
00:03:16,872 --> 00:03:18,443
is fighting for

76
00:03:18,443 --> 00:03:21,959
the represent... the representation of
people.

77
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:22,977
Now,

78
00:03:22,977 --> 00:03:25,906
there is a more cynical argument, that
some people have made, and I think it's

79
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:29,064
reasonable to give that due time,

80
00:03:29,064 --> 00:03:31,995
and one of the cynical arguments, or the
more cynical arguments, is that the U.S.

81
00:03:31,995 --> 00:03:34,138
had close financial and trade ties

82
00:03:34,138 --> 00:03:36,814
to Britain, not to mention cultural ties,

83
00:03:36,814 --> 00:03:39,130
...financial ties to...

84
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,286
...the British.

85
00:03:41,286 --> 00:03:42,417
On top of that

86
00:03:42,417 --> 00:03:44,972
you have very successful British
propaganda

87
00:03:44,972 --> 00:03:49,654
the... one talking about the atrocities
in Belgium, which did actually happen

88
00:03:49,654 --> 00:03:50,695
but the British

89
00:03:50,695 --> 00:03:53,182
were able to exploit this as a
propaganda machine,

90
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:55,899
...successful propaganda, but they also
spread

91
00:03:55,899 --> 00:03:58,912
rumors that after the sinking 
of the Lusitania, that

92
00:03:58,912 --> 00:04:02,694
the Germans had their school's children
celebrating, and these were all made up,

93
00:04:02,694 --> 00:04:07,252
...propaganda.

94
00:04:07,267 --> 00:04:09,378
And then

95
00:04:09,378 --> 00:04:12,288
a more cynical view of why 
the U.S. entered the war,

96
00:04:12,288 --> 00:04:14,301
and this is true of probably
most wars,

97
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:15,641
is that there's a lot of

98
00:04:15,641 --> 00:04:17,936
lobbying on the part of war profiteers.

99
00:04:17,936 --> 00:04:19,535
War...

100
00:04:19,535 --> 00:04:24,095
...profiteers. In fact in little orphan
Annie Daddy Warbucks, the main reason why

101
00:04:24,095 --> 00:04:25,938
his last name is "Warbucks" is
because he made...

102
00:04:25,938 --> 00:04:27,688
...he made his fortune

103
00:04:27,688 --> 00:04:32,128
as a war profiteer during World War One.
War profiteers these are people who

104
00:04:32,128 --> 00:04:33,684
might be selling arms to

105
00:04:33,684 --> 00:04:38,028
the Allies, or who might sell arms to the
U.S. Government if the U.S. were to get

106
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:41,383
into a war, that might somehow supply the
troops and includes

107
00:04:41,383 --> 00:04:45,600
uh... potentially focus on Wall Street,
there were significant lending to the Allies

108
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,154
and mainly the Allies, not to
the central power,

109
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:53,598
and so the view is that the Allies win,
those loans are going to be made good.

110
00:04:53,598 --> 00:04:56,828
And I have the entire text of the speech
from...

111
00:04:56,828 --> 00:05:02,811
..senator George Norris who was one of
five senators, oh sorry... one of six senators

112
00:05:02,811 --> 00:05:05,510
to vote against the resolution to go to
war, there were fifty represent...

113
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:10,577
fifty representatives who also voted against
it, this is a little excerpt but also

114
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:14,508
in this tutorial I have the full text of
the speech in a highly, highly, highly

115
00:05:14,508 --> 00:05:18,263
uh... recommended reading that, along with
Wilson's text of his speech

116
00:05:18,263 --> 00:05:21,698
to Congress in his war... 
in his war message.

117
00:05:21,698 --> 00:05:23,857
But I'll just read this part because it
does, I think,

118
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:28,015
point out that the U.S. from the
beginning did have by the seas

119
00:05:28,015 --> 00:05:31,361
that were more pro-British, and the so
this is part of the speech:

120
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:34,692
"The reason given by the President and
asking Congress to declare

121
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:36,469
war against Germany

122
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:40,150
is that the German government has
declared certain war zones within which,

123
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,828
by the use of submarines, she sinks
without notice american ships and

124
00:05:43,828 --> 00:05:45,730
destroys american lives.

125
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,422
The first war zone was declared
by Great Britain.

126
00:05:48,422 --> 00:05:54,121
She gave us and the world notice of it
on the fourth day of november 1914.

127
00:05:54,126 --> 00:05:59,147
The zone became effective november fifth
1914, this zone so declared

128
00:05:59,147 --> 00:06:02,564
by Great Britain covered
the whole of the North Sea.

129
00:06:02,564 --> 00:06:07,300
The first german war zone was declared
on the fourth day of february 1915,

130
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,523
just three months after the british
war zone was declared

131
00:06:10,523 --> 00:06:15,001
Germany gave fifteen days notice of the
establishment of her zone which became

132
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:18,297
effective on the eighteenth
day of february 1915.

133
00:06:18,297 --> 00:06:20,924
The german war zone covered
the english channel

134
00:06:20,924 --> 00:06:24,270
and the high sea waters around
the british isles.

135
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:28,883
It is unnecessary to cite authority
to show that both of these orders

136
00:06:28,883 --> 00:06:34,237
declaring military zones were illegal
and contrary to international law.

137
00:06:34,237 --> 00:06:35,871
It is sufficient to say

138
00:06:35,871 --> 00:06:39,958
that our government has officially
declared both of them to be illegal.

139
00:06:39,973 --> 00:06:42,936
and has officially protested
against both of them.

140
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,409
The only difference

141
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:47,839
is that in the case of Germany we have
persisted in our protest

142
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:52,100
while in the case of England we have
submitted". I encourage you once again

143
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:56,268
to read to read the text of 
both Wilson's speech

144
00:06:56,268 --> 00:06:57,154
and...

145
00:06:57,154 --> 00:06:58,200
uh... and...

146
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,761
...and senator Norris's speech

147
00:06:59,761 --> 00:07:02,314
and come up to your... with your own
decisions,

148
00:07:02,314 --> 00:07:04,498
there might be a little bit of both.
