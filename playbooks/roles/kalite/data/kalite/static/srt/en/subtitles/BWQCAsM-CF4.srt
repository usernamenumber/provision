1
00:00:01,914 --> 00:00:04,888
Why doesn't our cell membrane fall apart when it is too hot?

2
00:00:04,888 --> 00:00:07,438
Or why doesn't our cell membrane freeze when it gets too cold?

3
00:00:07,438 --> 00:00:13,290
Well our cell membrane actually has a very unique property called Membrane Fluidity

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,487
Now a lot of different factors can affect membrane fluidity.

5
00:00:17,487 --> 00:00:22,505
But the three most important ones that we are going to focus on today are:

6
00:00:22,505 --> 00:00:23,739
Number 1 TEMPERATURE

7
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:25,435
Number 2 CHOLESTEROL

8
00:00:25,435 --> 00:00:31,854
and Number 3 which is whether we have unsaturated or saturated fatty acids.

9
00:00:31,854 --> 00:00:37,426
Now just to quickly remind us, the building blocks of the cell membrane are what we call phospholipids.

10
00:00:37,426 --> 00:00:38,927
They look like this.

11
00:00:38,927 --> 00:00:45,375
There is a phosphate head group that is represented by a circle. And two fatty acids chains kind of like strings hanging below.

12
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:51,872
And in this video we're actually going to really going to focus in on the impact of phospholipids in our cell membrane.

13
00:00:51,872 --> 00:00:54,933
So the first thing we are going to start off with is temperature.

14
00:00:54,933 --> 00:01:00,882
We have low temperature. And obviously we have high temperature.

15
00:01:00,882 --> 00:01:04,198
So let's pretend that our cell membrane is only made up of phospholipids.

16
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:07,623
What do you think our cell membrane is going to look like at low temperatures?

17
00:01:07,623 --> 00:01:14,304
Since the temperature is low, our phospholipids are actually going to start clustering together really closely.

18
00:01:14,304 --> 00:01:15,651
Kind of like that.

19
00:01:15,651 --> 00:01:22,751
And the reason why is because these phospholipids are at a low temperature which means that they don't have a lot of energy to move around a lot.

20
00:01:22,751 --> 00:01:24,558
So they are going to huddle really close together.

21
00:01:24,558 --> 00:01:29,307
At extremely low temperatures we actually call this a crystallized state.

22
00:01:29,307 --> 00:01:33,836
And since they are huddled so close together they don't have a lot of energy to move around.

23
00:01:33,836 --> 00:01:36,908
The fluidity is actually pretty low.

24
00:01:36,908 --> 00:01:42,458
As the temperature decreases the fluidity of the cell membrane also decreases.

25
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,752
What happens at high temperatures?

26
00:01:44,752 --> 00:01:49,027
Well, at high temperatures our phospholipids have a little more energy.

27
00:01:49,027 --> 00:01:55,989
So they actually are going to move around a little more and cause themselves to have more of a distance between each other.

28
00:01:55,989 --> 00:01:57,915
Kind of like that.

29
00:01:57,915 --> 00:02:04,819
So you'll notice that the distance between phospholipids is now much greater than what is was over here at low temperatures.

30
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:10,811
Which was very very small. This increased distance allows our fluidity to increase.

31
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:14,591
Because there is much more room for the cell membrane to move around.

32
00:02:14,591 --> 00:02:19,198
So as the temperature increases, our membrane fluidity also increases.

33
00:02:19,198 --> 00:02:21,739
What happens when we add cholesterol?

34
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:27,579
At low temperatures, our phospholipids still tend to cluster pretty closely together.

35
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:30,651
But occasionally something really interesting happens

36
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:35,827
Which is when cholesterol actually inserts itself between the phospholipids, like this.

37
00:02:35,827 --> 00:02:41,651
It doesn't do this for every single phospholipid, but it will occasionally insert itself into the membrane.

38
00:02:41,651 --> 00:02:44,570
The same goes for the phospholipids that are underneath.

39
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:48,588
And you'll notice that the membrane doesn't always have to line up in the sense that the phospholipids

40
00:02:48,588 --> 00:02:53,324
can actually be in the same place as the ones above or in a slightly different place.

41
00:02:53,324 --> 00:02:57,524
In some membranes there's more cholesterol and in others there is less.

42
00:02:57,524 --> 00:03:01,738
But the presence of cholesterol itself does something really unique.

43
00:03:01,738 --> 00:03:06,989
And what that is, is it actually increases the distance between some of the phospholipids.

44
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:09,348
And like we've talked about for the high temperatures

45
00:03:09,348 --> 00:03:14,979
as the distance between the phospholipids increases, the fluidity can also increase.

46
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:17,723
What happens at high temperatures with cholesterol?

47
00:03:17,723 --> 00:03:22,448
At high temperatures our phospholipids are already pretty far apart.

48
00:03:22,448 --> 00:03:24,126
Just like the above picture.

49
00:03:24,126 --> 00:03:28,678
But just like before, the cholesterol will insert itself into the membrane at random places.

50
00:03:28,678 --> 00:03:34,819
And what this will actually do is it will cause the phospholipids to pull themselves closer together

51
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:37,651
because they kind of want to attach to that cholesterol.

52
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:42,506
So now there is more stuff inserted throughout the membrane and so the molecules in the membrane

53
00:03:42,506 --> 00:03:47,091
are now closer together. So the fluidity actually decreases.

54
00:03:47,091 --> 00:03:50,599
So cholesterol is actually really interesting because at low temperatures

55
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:55,651
the fluidity will increase and at high temperatures the fluidity will decrease.

56
00:03:55,651 --> 00:04:00,340
If you kind of think about cholesterol like a buffer, kind of like in chemistry

57
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:06,257
it allows our cell membrane to remain at a fairly stable and normal level of fluidity.

58
00:04:06,257 --> 00:04:10,150
When the temperature gets too low the fluidity will increase a little.

59
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,064
And when the temperature gets too high the fluidity will decrease.

60
00:04:13,064 --> 00:04:18,998
So moving on to our third one

61
00:04:18,998 --> 00:04:23,295
which is the presence of saturated versus unsaturated fats

62
00:04:23,295 --> 00:04:28,176
we're going to go ahead and make a new canvas to give ourselves a little bit of room.

63
00:04:28,176 --> 00:04:33,039
So in number 3 we're comparing the presence of saturated versus unsaturated fats.

64
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,737
And when we're talking about saturated versus unsaturated

65
00:04:35,737 --> 00:04:41,413
we're talking about the fatty acids chains that are hanging below our phosphate head group.

66
00:04:41,413 --> 00:04:42,852
So just to remind us from chemistry....

67
00:04:42,852 --> 00:04:45,862
a saturated fatty acid can be represented like this.

68
00:04:45,862 --> 00:04:49,034
Where every angle or pointy end is a carbon

69
00:04:49,034 --> 00:04:52,803
In the case of an unsaturated fatty acid it can look pretty different.

70
00:04:52,803 --> 00:04:56,760
Because an unsaturated fatty acid means that we have some double bonds.

71
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,038
So let's say we have 2 double bonds like that.

72
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:01,997
By themselves there doesn't seem to be anything special

73
00:05:01,997 --> 00:05:06,954
Granted they look different. But how would these interact with multiple fatty acids next to them?

74
00:05:06,954 --> 00:05:10,996
In the case of a saturated one, and in the case of an unsaturated one

75
00:05:10,996 --> 00:05:14,366
our molecule will still have some double bonds.

76
00:05:14,366 --> 00:05:18,080
And what's really unique you'll notice that in the saturated fatty acid

77
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,709
these 2 fatty acid chains stack together really neatly, kind of like Legos.

78
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:27,079
But in our unsaturated fatty acid these 2 don't really stack together that neatly.

79
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:29,491
How will this effect our membrane fluidity?

80
00:05:29,491 --> 00:05:34,967
Well for the sake of this particular explanation

81
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,807
We are going to draw the saturated fatty acid chains as straight lines like this.

82
00:05:37,807 --> 00:05:42,872
And just because we are trying to represent the fact that these straight lines stack together really well.

83
00:05:42,872 --> 00:05:46,791
So what's going to happen is they'll stack pretty closely together.

84
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,555
And so will the ones underneath.

85
00:05:48,555 --> 00:05:55,089
And since the distances between the molecules is pretty small, our fluidity is actually pretty low.

86
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:58,123
So what do you think will happen with our unsaturated fatty acids?

87
00:05:58,123 --> 00:06:04,116
Well, you'll notice that there is a little bit of a bend in these fatty acid chains.

88
00:06:04,116 --> 00:06:07,968
So I'm actually going to represent the phospholipid with a little bend in it.

89
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:12,685
And these might occur in different places or they might have both of them being bent.

90
00:06:12,685 --> 00:06:18,807
But you'll notice that I'm unable to draw these phospholipids as closely together.

91
00:06:18,807 --> 00:06:26,619
There becomes more distance between these phospholipids because of this unsaturated bend in our phospholipids

92
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:30,638
Well since there is more distance between our phospholipids the fluidity increases.

93
00:06:30,638 --> 00:06:33,375
Just to quickly sum up. Today we learned

94
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:36,146
the three factors that can affect membrane fluidity

95
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,437
the first being temperature.

96
00:06:37,437 --> 00:06:39,894
As temperature increases, fluidity also increases.

97
00:06:39,894 --> 00:06:41,991
The second is cholesterol

98
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:44,176
and cholesterol acts as a buffer

99
00:06:44,176 --> 00:06:48,662
increasing fluidity at low temperatures and decreasing fluidity at high temperatures.

100
00:06:48,662 --> 00:06:53,486
And the last are unsaturated fatty acids in our phospholipids

101
00:06:53,486 --> 00:06:58,580
When we increase the amount of unsaturated fatty acids in our cell membrane

102
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,580
the fluidity also increases
