1
00:00:02,177 --> 00:00:03,770
So what you're looking at is

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:08,037
one of the most amazing organs in your body. This is the human heart.

3
00:00:08,037 --> 00:00:11,140
And it's shown with all the vessels on it and you can see

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,137
the vessels coming into and out of it

5
00:00:13,137 --> 00:00:17,643
but the heart at its core is a pump and this pump is why we

6
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:22,102
call it one of the hardest working organs in your body, because the heart starts pumping

7
00:00:22,102 --> 00:00:26,509
blood from the point where you're a little fetus and you're eight weeks old

8
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:29,936
all the way until the point when you die. So this

9
00:00:29,936 --> 00:00:34,174
organ I think it will be really cool to look at it in detail

10
00:00:34,174 --> 00:00:39,042
but it's hard to do that looking just at the outside, so what did is I actually drew

11
00:00:39,042 --> 00:00:41,035
what it might look like at the inside.

12
00:00:41,035 --> 00:00:44,082
So let me just show you that now and it will follow

13
00:00:44,082 --> 00:00:48,757
the path of blood through the heart using this diagram

14
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:51,849
Let me start with the little picture in the corner

15
00:00:51,849 --> 00:00:55,043
so let's say we have a person here

16
00:00:55,043 --> 00:01:00,147
this is teir face, this is their neck and I'm gonna draw their arms

17
00:01:00,147 --> 00:01:05,470
and they have in the middle of their chest their heart.

18
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,704
SO the whole goal was to make sure that blood from all parts of the body, including their legs

19
00:01:09,704 --> 00:01:13,600
will make its way back to the heart first of all and then get pumped back

20
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,171
out to the body. So blood is gonna come out from this arm

21
00:01:18,171 --> 00:01:21,738
let's say dumped into the air and the same on this side,

22
00:01:21,738 --> 00:01:24,737
and it's gonna come from their head and all three sources

23
00:01:24,737 --> 00:01:30,240
two arms and a head are gonna come together into one big vein

24
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,702
And that's gonna be dumping into the top of the heart. And then separately you have veins from the legs.

25
00:01:36,702 --> 00:01:40,902
Meaning veins from the belly. Coming into another opening into the heart.

26
00:01:40,902 --> 00:01:52,313
So that's how the blood gets back to the heart. And anytime I mention the word vein, I just want to make sure you think of blood going towards the heart.

27
00:01:52,313 --> 00:02:02,545
Now If blood is going towards the heart, after the blood is pumped by the heart, it´s gonna have to go out to the heart.

28
00:02:02,545 --> 00:02:06,148
Right it´s gonna have to go away from the heart. So that´s the aorta.

29
00:02:06,148 --> 00:02:10,000
The aorta actually has the little arch like that. We call that the aortic arch.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:22,967
And it sends off one vessel to the arm, one vessel up this way, the vessel over this way and then this arch gonna go down and splits like that.

31
00:02:22,967 --> 00:02:24,943
So this is kind of simplified version of it.

32
00:02:24,943 --> 00:02:30,067
You can see how there are definetely some parallels between how the veins and arteries are set up.

33
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:37,033
And arteries or anytime I mention the word artery, I want you to think about the blood going away from the heart.

34
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:41,371
And easy way to remember that is that both start with the letter "A".

35
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:50,300
So going to the big diagram we can see that blood´s coming this way and blood´s coming this way is ending up with the same spot.

36
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:56,569
It´s going to end up at the, maybe I should draw it here, it´s ending up with the right atrium.

37
00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:02,571
That´s just the name of the chamber where the blood ends up in.

38
00:03:02,571 --> 00:03:09,311
And it came up in the right atrium from a giant vessel up top called the superior vena cava.

39
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:14,936
And this is a vein of course because it´s bringing blood towards the heart.

40
00:03:14,936 --> 00:03:19,094
And down here the inferior vena cava.

41
00:03:19,094 --> 00:03:24,769
So these are the two direction the blood is going to be flowing.

42
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:29,518
And once the blood is in right atrium, it´s going to head down into the right ventricle.

43
00:03:29,518 --> 00:03:33,805
So this is the right ventricle, down here.

44
00:03:33,805 --> 00:03:38,039
This is the second chamber of the heart.

45
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:40,763
And it gets there by passing through the valve.

46
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:46,537
And this valve and all valves in the heart are basically there to keep blood moving in the right direction.

47
00:03:46,537 --> 00:03:48,936
So it doesn't go to backwards direction.

48
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:51,769
So this valve is called the Tricuspid valve.

49
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:59,468
And it´s called that because it´s basically got three little flaps. That´s why they call it tri-.

50
00:03:59,468 --> 00:04:04,139
And I know you can only see two in my drawing and that´s just because my drawing is not perfect.

51
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:08,932
And it´s hard to show kind of flap coming out of juby you can imagine it.

52
00:04:08,932 --> 00:04:12,936
So blood goes into the rigt verticle and where it goes next.

53
00:04:12,936 --> 00:04:18,467
Well after that it´s gonna go this way: it´s going to go to this vessel and it´s gonna split.

54
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:22,102
But before it goes it has to passed another valve.

55
00:04:22,102 --> 00:04:23,815
So this is a valve right here.

56
00:04:23,815 --> 00:04:26,552
Call it Pulmonary valve.

57
00:04:26,552 --> 00:04:29,076
And it gives you the clue where the things we are going to go next.

58
00:04:29,076 --> 00:04:32,302
Because the word pulmonary means lungs.

59
00:04:32,302 --> 00:04:37,838
And so if this is my lung on this side. This is my left lung.

60
00:04:37,838 --> 00:04:42,012
And this is my right lung on this side.

61
00:04:42,012 --> 00:05:00,069
Then these vessels and all that they trying to get will be called, these vessels, this will be my, make sure I get my right and left straight, this is my left pulmonary artery.

62
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:05,147
And I hesitated there just to make sure I got that because it´s taking blood away from the heart.

63
00:05:05,147 --> 00:05:10,842
And this is my right pulmonary artery.

64
00:05:10,842 --> 00:05:14,436
So this is my right and left pulmonary artery.

65
00:05:14,436 --> 00:05:21,578
As the blood goes down into my lungs, right. these the lungs that kind of nessel into my thorax, where my heart is sitting, goes into my lungs

66
00:05:21,578 --> 00:05:25,700
and remember this blood is blue.

67
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,543
Why is it blue? Well,it´s blue because it doesn´t have very much oxygen.

68
00:05:29,543 --> 00:05:33,755
So one thing that I need to pick up is oxygen.

69
00:05:33,755 --> 00:05:39,769
So that´s one thing what the lungs gonna help me pick up and I´m gonna write O2 for oxygen.

70
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:46,876
An it´s also blue and that reminds us that it´s full of carbondioxides, full of wastes.

71
00:05:46,876 --> 00:05:49,422
Because it´s coming from the body.

72
00:05:49,422 --> 00:05:51,005
Well the body made a lot of carbondioxides that it's trying to get rid of.

73
00:05:51,005 --> 00:05:55,745
So in the lungs you get rid of the carbondioxides and you pick up oxygen.

74
00:05:55,745 --> 00:06:01,977
So that´s why I switch it in this point blue colored vessel to red colored vessel.

75
00:06:01,977 --> 00:06:08,869
So now blood comes back this way and this way and dumps into this chamber.

76
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:13,849
So what is that - that is our left atrium.

77
00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:17,824
So just like our right atrium we have one on the left.

78
00:06:17,824 --> 00:06:25,204
And it goes down into, you can probably guess how this one is called, is our left ventricle.

79
00:06:25,204 --> 00:06:32,975
So just like before where we went from the right atrium to the right vertricle, now we´re going from the left atrium to the left ventricle.

80
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:41,848
And it passed through the valve here. So this valve is called the Mitral valve.

81
00:06:41,848 --> 00:06:48,703
And it´s job is of course to make sure the blood does not go from the left ventricle back to the left atrium by accident.

82
00:06:48,703 --> 00:06:51,471
Wants to make sure there is forward flows.

83
00:06:51,471 --> 00:07:04,137
And then the final valve, I need to find a nice spot to write it maybe to right here, this final valve that passes through is called the Aortic valve.

84
00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:14,604
And the Arotic valve is going to be what divides the left ventricle from this giant vessel that we talked about earlier.

85
00:07:14,604 --> 00:07:19,036
And this is of course the aorta. This is my aorta.

86
00:07:19,036 --> 00:07:23,635
So now blood is gonna go through the aorta to the rest of the body.

87
00:07:23,635 --> 00:07:30,011
So you can see how blood now flows from the body into the four chambers.

88
00:07:30,011 --> 00:07:32,701
The first into the right atrium. This is chamber number one.

89
00:07:32,701 --> 00:07:36,407
And then it goes into the right ventricle. This is chamber number two.

90
00:07:36,407 --> 00:07:41,603
It goes to the lungs and then back up to the left atrium. So this is chamber number three.

91
00:07:41,603 --> 00:07:43,703
And then the left ventricle.

92
00:07:43,703 --> 00:07:47,703
And this happens every moment of every day, everytime you heard your heart beating, this process is going on.
