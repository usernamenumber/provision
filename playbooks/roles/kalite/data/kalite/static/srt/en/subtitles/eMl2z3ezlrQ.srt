1
00:00:00,163 --> 00:00:02,208
Based on the examples in the last video

2
00:00:02,208 --> 00:00:07,764
let's see if we can come up with some rules of thumb for figuring out how many significant figures,

3
00:00:07,764 --> 00:00:08,957
or how many significant digits,

4
00:00:08,957 --> 00:00:11,912
there are in a number - or a measurement.

5
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:16,834
So the first thing that is pretty obvious is that any non-zero digit,

6
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:19,574
and any of the zero digits in between are significant.

7
00:00:19,574 --> 00:00:24,375
Really the 7 and the 5 here are significant and the zero's in between them, it's also going to be significant.

8
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:37,763
So let's write this over here: so, any non-zero digits and zero's in between

9
00:00:37,763 --> 00:00:43,677
are going to be significant. That's pretty straightforward.

10
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:49,436
Now the zero's that are not in between non-zero digits, these become a little bit more confusing.

11
00:00:49,436 --> 00:00:52,315
So let's just make sure we can rule out some of them.

12
00:00:52,315 --> 00:00:56,542
So you can always rule out - when you're thinking about significant figures -

13
00:00:56,542 --> 00:00:57,875
the leading zero's.

14
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:00,169
And when I talk about leading zero's, I'm talking about the zero's

15
00:01:00,169 --> 00:01:03,507
that come before your non-zero digit.

16
00:01:03,507 --> 00:01:06,897
So these are leading zero's here, these are leading zero's.

17
00:01:06,897 --> 00:01:11,169
There's no leading zero's here, no leading zero's in this one, this one, and this one.

18
00:01:11,169 --> 00:01:15,349
But in any situation, the leading zero's are not significant.

19
00:01:15,349 --> 00:01:25,429
So leading zero's not significant.

20
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:30,907
And so the last question, all you have left, I mean, you only have non-zero digits

21
00:01:30,907 --> 00:01:33,044
and zero's in between; you could have some leading zero's

22
00:01:33,044 --> 00:01:34,668
which you've already said are not significant.

23
00:01:34,668 --> 00:01:39,637
And so the only thing left that you have to figure out is what do you do with the trailing zero's,

24
00:01:39,637 --> 00:01:46,510
the zero's behind the last non-zero, or to the right of, the last non-zero digit.

25
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:51,665
So that these trailing zero's here, there's actually two trailing zero's over,

26
00:01:51,665 --> 00:01:54,406
and then there is three trailing zero's over here.

27
00:01:54,406 --> 00:02:01,502
So let me make a little... so trailing zero's.

28
00:02:01,502 --> 00:02:02,669
What do we do with them?

29
00:02:02,669 --> 00:02:05,643
So the easy way to think about is, if you have a decimal,

30
00:02:05,643 --> 00:02:10,009
if there is a decimal anywhere in your number, count them.

31
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:15,581
If you have a decimal count them as significant.

32
00:02:15,581 --> 00:02:20,597
they are significant. Count them as significant.

33
00:02:20,597 --> 00:02:25,659
If there is no decimal anywhere in the number,

34
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:27,563
then it's kind of ambiguous.

35
00:02:27,563 --> 00:02:29,978
You're kind of not sure, and this is the situation.

36
00:02:29,978 --> 00:02:33,662
So clearly, over here, there's a decimal in the number

37
00:02:33,662 --> 00:02:37,269
so you count the trailing zeros - these are adding to the precision.

38
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:40,984
Over here, there's a decimal so you count the trailing zero.

39
00:02:40,984 --> 00:02:43,260
There's a decimal here so you count the trailing zero's.

40
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,349
There are no trailing zero's here.

41
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:49,669
And over here, well the way I later put a decimal here,

42
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:54,312
here you would count it, so if you have a decimal there you would count all five.

43
00:02:54,312 --> 00:02:59,978
If you didn't have the decimal, if you just had 37,000 like that

44
00:02:59,978 --> 00:03:04,343
it's ambiguous, and if someone doesn't give you more information

45
00:03:04,343 --> 00:03:08,987
you're best assumption is probably that they just measured to the nearest thousand,

46
00:03:08,987 --> 00:03:11,210
that they didn't measure exactly to the one and just happened

47
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,586
to get exactly on 37,000.

48
00:03:13,586 --> 00:03:16,510
So if there's no decimal, let me write it this way,

49
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:23,662
it's ambiguous, which means that you're really not sure what it means,

50
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:27,333
it's not clear what it means, and you're proabably safer assuming

51
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:35,644
to not count the trailing zero's.

52
00:03:35,644 --> 00:03:38,568
If someone really does measure, if you were to really measure something

53
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:43,260
to the exact one, then you should put a decimal at the end like that.

54
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,862
And there is a notation for specifying:

55
00:03:46,862 --> 00:03:49,669
let's say you do measure - let me do a different number -

56
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:53,848
let's say you do measure 56,000

57
00:03:53,848 --> 00:03:59,003
and there is a notation for specifying that 6 definitely is the last significant digit

58
00:03:59,003 --> 00:04:01,975
and sometimes you'll see a bar put over the 6,

59
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:04,576
sometimes you'll see a bar put under the 6.

60
00:04:04,576 --> 00:04:07,642
And that could be useful, because maybe, you're last

61
00:04:07,642 --> 00:04:09,671
significant digit is this zero over here,

62
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:13,492
maybe you were able to measure to the 100's with a reasonable level of precision.

63
00:04:13,492 --> 00:04:16,511
And so then you would write something like,

64
00:04:16,511 --> 00:04:19,901
you'd still write 56,000,

65
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:22,641
but then you would put the bar above that zero

66
00:04:22,641 --> 00:04:26,681
or the bar below that zero to say that that was the last significat digit.

67
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:30,582
So if you saw something like this, you would say 3 significant digits.

68
00:04:30,582 --> 00:04:35,646
This isn't used so frequently. A better way to show that you've measured

69
00:04:35,646 --> 00:04:40,012
to 3 significant digits would be to write it in scientific notation.

70
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:41,187
There's a whole video on that.

71
00:04:41,187 --> 00:04:43,167
But to write this in scientific notation,

72
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:51,637
you could write this as 5.60 times 10 to the fourth power, right?

73
00:04:51,637 --> 00:04:55,335
Cause if you multiply this by 10 to the fourth

74
00:04:55,335 --> 00:04:57,054
you'd move this decimal over four spaces

75
00:04:57,054 --> 00:04:59,003
and get us to 56,000.

76
00:04:59,003 --> 00:05:02,000
So 5.60 times 10 to the fourth;

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,124
and if this confuses you,

78
00:05:03,124 --> 00:05:05,319
watch the video on scientific notation.

79
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:06,991
Hopefully it will clarify things a little bit.

80
00:05:06,991 --> 00:05:10,010
But when you write a number in scientific notation,

81
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,426
it makes it very clear about your precision

82
00:05:12,426 --> 00:05:14,400
and how many significant digits you're dealing with.

83
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,054
So instead of doing this notation that's a little bit outdated,

84
00:05:17,054 --> 00:05:18,601
I haven't seen it used much,

85
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:21,666
with these bars below or above the high significant digit,

86
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,988
instead you can represent it with a decimal

87
00:05:23,988 --> 00:05:26,018
in scientific notation

88
00:05:26,018 --> 00:05:31,000
and then it's very clear you have 3 significant digits.

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,976
So hopefully that helps you out.

90
00:05:31,976 --> 00:05:33,133
In the next couple of videos,

91
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:36,109
we'll explore a little bit more why significant digits are important

92
00:05:36,109 --> 99:59:59,999
especially when you do calculations with multiple measurements.
