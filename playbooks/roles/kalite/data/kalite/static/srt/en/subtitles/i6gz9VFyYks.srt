1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,220
   

2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:04,070
In the last video, we learned
that the pressure at some

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:10,120
depth in a fluid is equal to the
density of the fluid times

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,670
how deep we are in the fluid,
or how high is the column of

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,990
fluid above us times gravity.

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,870
Let's see if we can use that
to solve a fairly typical

7
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,750
problem that you'll see in your
physics class, or even on

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,660
an AP physics test.

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's say that I have a bowl.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:37,900
   

11
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,740
And in that bowl, I have
mercury, and then I also have

12
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,000
this kind of inverted test
tube that I stick in the

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,480
middle of-- this is the side
view of the bowl, and I'll

14
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,950
draw everything shortly.

15
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,960
Let's say my test tube looks
something like this.

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:58,320
   

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,090
Let's say I have no air in this
test tube-- there's a

18
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,120
vacuum here-- but the outside
of the bowl, this whole area

19
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,950
out here, this is exposed
to the air.

20
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,530
We are actually on Earth, or
actually in Paris, France, at

21
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:14,550
sea level, because that's what
an atmosphere is defined as--

22
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,940
the atmospheric pressure.

23
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,970
Essentially, the way you could
think about it-- the weight of

24
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,830
all of the air above us is
pushing down on the surface of

25
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,270
this bowl at one atmosphere.

26
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,530
An atmosphere is just the
pressure of all of the air

27
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,000
above you at sea level
in Paris, France.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,650
And in the bowl,
I have mercury.

29
00:01:32,650 --> 00:02:05,380
   

30
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,536
Let's say that that mercury--
there's no air in here, and it

31
00:02:08,536 --> 00:02:11,000
is actually going to go up
this column a little bit.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,200
We're going to do the math as
far as-- one, we'll see why

33
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,830
it's going up, and then we'll do
the math to figure out how

34
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,110
high up does it go.

35
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:24,030
Say the mercury goes up
some distance-- this

36
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,280
is all still mercury.

37
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,498
   

38
00:02:29,498 --> 00:02:31,820
And this is actually how a
barometer works; this is

39
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,860
something that measures
pressure.

40
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,730
Over here at this part, above
the mercury, but still within

41
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:45,040
our little test tube, we have
a vacuum-- there is no air.

42
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,680
Vacuum is one of my favorite
words, because it has

43
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,930
two u's in a row.

44
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,400
   

45
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,740
We have this set up, and so my
question to you is-- how high

46
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,430
is this column of mercury
going to go?

47
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,210
   

48
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:05,270
First of all, let's just have
the intuition as to why this

49
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,660
thing is going up
to begin with.

50
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,780
We have all this pressure from
all of the air above us-- I

51
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,320
know it's a little un-intuitive
for us, because

52
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,140
we're used to all of that
pressure on our shoulders all

53
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,520
of the time, so we don't really
imagine it, but there

54
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,340
is literally the weight of
the atmosphere above us.

55
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,830
That's going to be pushing down
on the surface of the

56
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,420
mercury on the outside
of the test tube.

57
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,630
Since there's no pressure here,
the mercury is going to

58
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,220
go upwards here.

59
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,810
This state that I've drawn is
a static state-- we have

60
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,260
assumed that all the
motion has stopped.

61
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,267
So let's try to solve
this problem.

62
00:03:41,267 --> 00:03:44,300
Oh, and there are a couple of
things we have to know before

63
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,140
we do this problem.

64
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,710
It's mercury, and we know the
specific gravity-- I'm using

65
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,000
terminology, because a lot of
these problems, the hardest

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:09,350
part is the terminology--
of mercury is 13.6.

67
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,230
That's often a daunting
statement on a test-- you know

68
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,860
how to do all the math, and all
of a sudden you go, what

69
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,060
is specific gravity?

70
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,589
All specific gravity is, is the
ratio of how dense that

71
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:21,300
substance is to water.

72
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:29,460
All that means is that
mercury is 13.6

73
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:37,365
times as dense as water.

74
00:04:37,365 --> 00:04:40,260
   

75
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,070
Hopefully, after the last
video-- because I told you

76
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,240
to-- you should have memorized
the density of water.

77
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,870
It's 1,000 kilograms per meter
cubed, so the density of

78
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:53,210
mercury-- let's write that down,
and that's the rho, or

79
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,400
little p, depending on how you
want to do it-- is going to be

80
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,240
equal to 13.6 times the density
of water, or times

81
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:11,960
1,000 kilograms per
meter cubed.

82
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,830
Let's go back to the problem.

83
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,060
What we want to know
is how high this

84
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,350
column of mercury is.

85
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,290
We know that the pressure--
let's consider this point

86
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,700
right here, which is essentially
the base of this

87
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,270
column of mercury.

88
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,030
What we're saying is the
pressure on the base of this

89
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,630
column of mercury right here, or
the pressure at this point

90
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:39,800
down, has to be the same thing
as the pressure up, because

91
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,180
the mercury isn't moving--
we're in a static state.

92
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,180
We learned several videos ago
that the pressure in is equal

93
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:50,350
to the pressure out on
a liquid system.

94
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,740
Essentially, I have one
atmosphere pushing down here

95
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,380
on the outside of the surface,
so I must have one atmosphere

96
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,630
pushing up here.

97
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,820
   

98
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,590
The pressure pushing up at this
point right here-- we

99
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,520
could imagine that we have
that aluminum foil there

100
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,850
again, and just imagine where
the pressure is hitting-- is

101
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:14,450
one atmosphere, so the pressure
down right here must

102
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:18,090
be one atmosphere.

103
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,840
What's creating the pressure
down right there?

104
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,330
It's essentially this column
of water, or it's this

105
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,380
formula, which we learned
in the last video.

106
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,000
What we now know is that the
density of the mercury, times

107
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,880
the height of the column of
water, times the acceleration

108
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,300
of gravity on Earth-- which is
where we are-- has to equal

109
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,810
one atmosphere, because it has
to offset the atmosphere

110
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,820
that's pushing on the outside
and pushing up here.

111
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:52,880
The density of mercury is this:
13.6 thousand, so 13,600

112
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,550
kilogram meters per
meter cubed.

113
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,060
That's the density times the
height-- we don't know what

114
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,695
the height is, that's going to
be in meters-- times the

115
00:07:03,695 --> 00:07:06,460
acceleration of gravity,
which is 9.8

116
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,340
meters per second squared.

117
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,350
It's going to be equal
to one atmosphere.

118
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,020
Now you're saying-- Sal,
this is strange.

119
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,850
I've never seen this atmosphere
before-- we've

120
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,600
talked a lot about it, but how
does an atmosphere relate to

121
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,330
pascals or newtons?

122
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,320
This is something else you
should memorize: one

123
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:32,120
atmosphere is equal to 103,000
pascals, and that also equals

124
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:38,660
103,000 newtons per
meter squared.

125
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,350
One atmosphere is how much we're
pushing down out here.

126
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,230
So it's how much we're pushing
up here, and that's going to

127
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,560
be equal to the amount of
pressure at this point from

128
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,650
this column of mercury.

129
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:54,380
One atmosphere is exactly this
much, which equals 103,000

130
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,800
newtons per meters squared.

131
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,430
   

132
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:07,660
If we divide both sides by
13,609.8, we get that the

133
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:21,130
height is equal to 103,000
newtons per meter cubed, over

134
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:36,659
13,600 kilograms per meter cubed
times 9.8 meters per

135
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:37,909
second squared.

136
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:40,480
   

137
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,940
Make sure you always have the
units right-- that's the

138
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,600
hardest thing about these
problems, just to know that an

139
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,210
atmosphere is 103,000 pascals,
which is also the same as

140
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:52,410
newtons per meter squared.

141
00:08:52,410 --> 00:09:01,810
Let's just do the math, so let
me type this in-- 103,000

142
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:17,000
divided by 13,600 divided
by 9.8 equals 0.77.

143
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,250
We were dealing with newtons,
so height is

144
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,870
equal to 0.77 meters.

145
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,720
And you should see that the
units actually work, because

146
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,030
we have a meters cubed in the
denominator up here, we have a

147
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,060
meters cubed in the denominator
down here, and

148
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,260
then we have kilogram meters
per second squared here.

149
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,780
We have newtons up here,
but what's a newton?

150
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:39,720
A newton is a kilogram meter
squared per second, so when

151
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,700
you divide you have kilogram
meters squared per second

152
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,060
squared, and here you
have kilogram

153
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,390
meter per second squared.

154
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,080
When you do all the division of
the units, all you're left

155
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,450
with is meters, so we have 0.77
meters, or roughly 77

156
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,850
centimeters-- is how high this
column of mercury is.

157
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:57,255
And you can make a barometer out
of it-- you can say, let

158
00:09:57,255 --> 00:09:59,760
me make a little notch on this
test tube, and that represents

159
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,550
one atmosphere.

160
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,540
You can go around and figure
out how many atmospheres

161
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,780
different parts of
the globe are.

162
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,200
Anyway, I've run out of time.

163
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,940
See you in the next video.
