1
00:00:01,483 --> 00:00:06,816
After the fall of the Soviet Union and even China's migration to a market-based economy - even though

2
00:00:06,816 --> 00:00:10,199
they called themselves communists the economy is now essentially capitalist -

3
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:15,217
there's been a kind of general consensus around the world that capitalism is the way to go.

4
00:00:15,217 --> 00:00:23,065
You know, just to put my bias... I am in that camp. I would consider myself a capitalist.

5
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:28,585
But what I wanna do in this video is do a little bit more of a nuanced discussion

6
00:00:28,585 --> 00:00:31,533
of capitalism versus, say, socialism.

7
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:35,200
Because I feel like there has been especially here in the United States and in the West

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:43,117
there's sometimes a knee-jerk reaction against anything that even has a whiff of the government getting involved, or

9
00:00:43,117 --> 00:00:47,254
even a whiff of socialism.

10
00:00:47,254 --> 00:00:49,950
So I want to think more about what are we trying to achieve in the capitalist system,

11
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,417
and where we could fall into kind of the things we don't want to achieve

12
00:00:55,417 --> 00:01:03,150
if some of the aspects of capitalism are allowed to go on without any type of controls or maybe some

13
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,984
type of regulation.

14
00:01:05,984 --> 00:01:08,733
I don't wanna advocate anything, I just wanna give you maybe a framework for thinking about it.

15
00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:12,649
So if you ask any capitalist including myself you say

16
00:01:12,649 --> 00:01:14,266
what is good about capitalism?

17
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:17,183
I would say that it aligns everyone's incentives.

18
00:01:17,183 --> 00:01:21,050
Good incentives.

19
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:26,150
If you work harder you can earn more, you can generate the capital for yourself.

20
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,759
You can use that improving standard of living.

21
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:31,117
You can reinvest that capital.

22
00:01:31,117 --> 00:01:32,599
So it's a good incentive structure.

23
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:36,399
I am not saying that everyone is motivated purely by the desire to earn

24
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:43,933
I think, you know, there's plenty of people in the world who are motivated for the desire for social good, for elevating mankind

25
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:50,716
But the general sense is in a lot of parts is that those types of things are specific to certain domains, but

26
00:01:50,716 --> 00:01:59,000
in other domains if someone's running a trucking company it's not clear that someone would run

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,017
a trucking company optimally just for the good for mankind

28
00:02:02,017 --> 00:02:08,233
Maybe they would run some non-profit that way but a trucking company or a farm or something like that, who knows.

29
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:12,766
So in general you have a good incentive structure.

30
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:18,766
There is also this notion in a capitalist economy: that it's a meritocracy. It is meritocracy.

31
00:02:18,766 --> 00:02:23,650
And I am gonna actually put a box around this

32
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,835
because a meritocracy in my mind is super-duper important

33
00:02:26,835 --> 00:02:29,015
Almost everyone is a fan of a meritocracy

34
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,848
Even the communists were a fan of a meritocracy.

35
00:02:30,848 --> 00:02:38,234
They would give exams to people and have the people who were successful have more authority within the communist regime.

36
00:02:38,234 --> 00:02:42,216
So meritocracy is something that other, everyone lays claims to

37
00:02:42,216 --> 00:02:45,584
And actually a lot of socialists or communists would claim that

38
00:02:45,584 --> 00:02:50,149
extreme forms of capitalism when the wealth disparity becomes too extreme

39
00:02:50,149 --> 00:02:52,184
where you have inherited wealth

40
00:02:52,184 --> 00:02:56,817
actually goes against the idea of meritocracy

41
00:02:56,817 --> 00:03:00,817
Let me put meritocracy here as well. We'll talk about that in a second.

42
00:03:00,817 --> 00:03:10,517
And then the other idea is that you have innovation in capitalism

43
00:03:10,517 --> 00:03:15,199
And these are all related ideas.

44
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:20,484
That if the incentives are good, if capital gets in the hands of people

45
00:03:20,484 --> 00:03:22,868
who are most deserving of it, because they've somehow earned it

46
00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:23,899
they somehow innovated

47
00:03:23,899 --> 00:03:25,442
that it can also lead to innovation

48
00:03:25,442 --> 00:03:27,684
because right people are handling the capital

49
00:03:27,684 --> 00:03:30,800
Now if we go to the socialist's side of things

50
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,383
They'll say: well look, there's a social cohesiveness to this.

51
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:36,904
Let me write this down.

52
00:03:36,904 --> 00:03:39,385
And I won't speak to... You know...

53
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:43,234
I don't claim what I'm going to do in these video is comprehensive of all of the pros and cons of either

54
00:03:43,234 --> 00:03:48,984
I just wanna give a little bit nuance to the discussion.

55
00:03:48,984 --> 00:03:50,816
So social cohesiveness

56
00:03:50,816 --> 00:03:53,500
You won't have this situation where you have you know

57
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:59,298
a gazillionaire sitting behind the walled compound with armed guards and there are people right on the other side of that walled compound starving to death

58
00:03:59,298 --> 00:04:03,799
and these people don't even necessarily view themselves as part of the same society, as part of you know

59
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:07,682
as somehow the responsibility to each other

60
00:04:07,682 --> 00:04:12,149
And that is happening in some parts of the world.

61
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:13,484
where we have severe disparities of wealth.

62
00:04:13,484 --> 00:04:16,517
Where the rich people don't even view themselves as the same species as the poor people.

63
00:04:16,517 --> 00:04:18,634
Or even vice-versa

64
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:21,922
The other idea

65
00:04:21,922 --> 00:04:26,867
and I'll put this thing in quotes, of "fairness"

66
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:30,622
I'll put it in quotes because one could say: well, it's fair

67
00:04:30,622 --> 00:04:35,266
if you make more, if you work harder you should get more, you should innovate more, you should get more.

68
00:04:35,266 --> 00:04:42,919
And this notion of fairness as well. But looking sometimes at wealth is so extreme, sometimes we have this notion of inherited wealth, generation after generation, old money

69
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:45,649
What's fair about that?

70
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:50,199
That people just rent people can extract the interest out of the wealth

71
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:55,067
and never have to work and other people have to work super hard and and really get nothing for it.

72
00:04:55,067 --> 00:05:03,066
So you know, the notion of fairness I'll put over here as well.

73
00:05:03,066 --> 00:05:05,149
Fairness... because there's arguments for either

74
00:05:05,149 --> 00:05:07,282
And so like I said I am definitely biased to the capitalist side of things

75
00:05:07,282 --> 00:05:13,834
I think there is an important... Two of these things that we have on the right hand side

76
00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:17,706
But the reality - at least, you know, what we've seen in the economic experiments of the 20th century

77
00:05:17,706 --> 00:05:24,434
is that even though communists and socialists might speak to these types of things

78
00:05:24,434 --> 00:05:32,149
to large degree there is less social cohesivness; the senior communists in the Soviet Union would drive fancy cars

79
00:05:32,149 --> 00:05:37,384
and they did have a very different lifestyle than the workers,

80
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:42,933
and they would hide that lifestyle, and then it would lead to a lot of hypocrisy

81
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:46,267
in general the extreme forms of socialism. Not clear that it was a meritocracy.

82
00:05:46,267 --> 00:05:52,200
It might have been just the best people climbing up the party ladder that get to the top as opposed to the people

83
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,932
who would innovate actually, produce in a better way.

84
00:05:55,932 --> 00:06:00,450
But with that's said I wanna give fair warning.

85
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:04,400
I want to give fair warning that capitslism, if it kind of goes unchequed in certain ways,

86
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,348
it can also lead to those same problems as socialism.

87
00:06:08,348 --> 00:06:16,116
The main problems there when we think about good incentives.

88
00:06:16,116 --> 00:06:23,467
I think the incentives, and once again, I'm giving my opinion here. The incentives work out well when you have a bunch of competitors

89
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,266
who can compete and innovate

90
00:06:25,266 --> 00:06:27,934
And it makes complete sense. Let's say that this person comes up with an innovation

91
00:06:27,934 --> 00:06:32,717
and because they have the innovation they are able to provide a better good that's cheaper to society

92
00:06:32,717 --> 00:06:38,683
So they make more profit. It seems reasonable that that person should get more profit, more wealth and grow

93
00:06:38,683 --> 00:06:43,234
And it could even be good for society because this person is an innovator.

94
00:06:43,234 --> 00:06:49,484
Maybe there is an element of luck there,

95
00:06:49,484 --> 00:06:54,350
but it seems like they are competent at managing these resouces so it's good for society to give them more resources to manage.

96
00:06:54,350 --> 00:07:00,585
The problem where capitalism... the area where it becomes less clear that capitalism is unambiguously good

97
00:07:00,585 --> 00:07:04,668
is the situation where this person becomes outright dominant.

98
00:07:04,668 --> 00:07:11,000
So let's say that this person becomes so big that none of these other players can even compete with him.

99
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,767
So they all disappear; this person can just undercut everybody and all of the other players disappear.

100
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:18,834
This is a situation of a monopoly.

101
00:07:18,834 --> 00:07:22,850
And the problem here - monopoly -

102
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:27,599
is that when this guy had competition he had every incentive to work harder,

103
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,449
had every incentive to innovate.

104
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,600
It was a meritocracy because the person who innovates well grows fastest

105
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,734
But once it gets to a monopoly stage and everyone else has died down,

106
00:07:35,734 --> 00:07:39,717
this is the only player in the economy.

107
00:07:39,717 --> 00:07:43,167
Then all of a sudden he has not incentive to innovate. This corporation or this person can just keep raising prizes,

108
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:50,234
there is no competition. There is no one who can say: hey I can make a better product, or I can sell it to you cheaper.

109
00:07:50,234 --> 00:07:53,585
So it actualy goes against the ideas of innovation.

110
00:07:53,585 --> 00:07:59,667
That's why it is really important, that's why it is the part of, especially in the United States , is part of the economic system

111
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:03,232
that you try to break up monopolies.

112
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,449
That you don't like monopolistic practices.

113
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:15,250
The other risk that you have when you start having a lot of wealth and a lot of influence of one entity or one person or one cooperation

114
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:19,450
And this sometimes can happen in a democratic and even in a non-democratic regime

115
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:26,100
Is that the control of resources aren't just control of those resources, aren't just control of land and buildings and railroads

116
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,100
They can also use it to influence government.

117
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:37,965
And in the United States this is kind of institutionlised in the form of lobbying.

118
00:08:37,965 --> 00:08:41,300
And when you have access to resources and you can influence government in this way

119
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:48,098
you can get the government - so let's say this is the government over here -

120
00:08:48,098 --> 00:08:50,766
You can get government to essentially do things for you,

121
00:08:50,766 --> 00:08:53,899
so it works to you advantage, and maybe allowing you eventually to become a monopoly

122
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:57,918
So you can kind of view this as crony capitalism

123
00:08:57,918 --> 00:09:01,419
where, you know, lobbying can be a form of legalised bribery.

124
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:04,849
And in that way you can kind of own the elected officials.

125
00:09:04,849 --> 00:09:07,616
I'm not saying that this is happenning everywhere, but it could happen.

126
00:09:07,616 --> 00:09:09,982
And in that situation you have the government acting at the behalf of these.

127
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:12,399
And once again it goes against the idea of a meritocracy.

128
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,366
Because when you have this cycle of developing, maybe this person right over here has the innovation

129
00:09:17,366 --> 00:09:22,567
But this person does not have the influence with the government

130
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:24,918
and so this guy gets the government contract for the plane.

131
00:09:24,918 --> 00:09:28,866
so this guy gets the tax benefits from the government

132
00:09:28,866 --> 00:09:32,483
So he can be even more competitive. He can undercut this guy.

133
00:09:32,483 --> 00:09:34,984
Even though this guy has the innovation.

134
00:09:34,984 --> 00:09:37,417
The other element - and I could talk about this for hours,

135
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:40,019
and these are just things to think about - are the idea of inherited wealth

136
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:44,567
and I am not saying that inherited wealth is a bad thing

137
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:51,160
But there's this idea that let's say someone through their competence, maybe competence with a little bit a luck

138
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,993
is able to accrue a huge amount of wealth

139
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,411
and maybe they are not even a monopolist

140
00:09:56,411 --> 00:09:58,144
but they are able to get a huge amount of wealth

141
00:09:58,144 --> 00:10:05,344
but they were able to do it, that they were really good managers, they are this kind of this, you know, really smart dude.

142
00:10:05,344 --> 00:10:08,526
He can really manage a lot of resouces well.

143
00:10:08,526 --> 00:10:12,661
The question arises is what happens when this person passes away.

144
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:18,775
In the very purely capitalist situation you pass this on to your children.

145
00:10:18,775 --> 00:10:27,210
And the issue here is, one, what did this person do to earn it

146
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:32,692
And also from a society's point of view, maybe this person here is a dummy

147
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:36,877
maybe, you know, maybe there is another kid over here

148
00:10:36,877 --> 00:10:40,911
who was born exact the same time who is way, you know, way smarter, and who, you know...

149
00:10:40,911 --> 00:10:47,244
But this kid is now in control of a hundred gazillion dollars. And he can completely mismanage

150
00:10:47,244 --> 00:10:50,527
these resources so that they're completely wasted.

151
00:10:50,527 --> 00:10:55,776
And so you have this idea of, over time, inherited wealth in a capitalist society,

152
00:10:55,776 --> 00:10:58,708
Can go against the ideas of meritocracy.

153
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:02,577
It can go against the idea of good incentives.

154
00:11:02,577 --> 00:11:05,627
Because if this guy inherits enough money, he has no incentive to work.

155
00:11:05,627 --> 00:11:10,826
Why should he study hard and go and, you know, tackle math and all of that?

156
00:11:10,826 --> 00:11:14,611
He inherits enough money. He gets millions of dollars just of the interest

157
00:11:14,611 --> 00:11:21,276
Why should he educate himself? Ge go daddy's or granddad's money and so it also goes against the idea.

158
00:11:21,276 --> 00:11:24,145
Why should he try to innovate, why should he do anything?

159
00:11:24,145 --> 00:11:28,977
I'll just... he can just hire some of these people and, you know, give them a minimum salary or whatever it takes.

160
00:11:28,977 --> 00:11:32,075
And so it kind of goes against these ideas of fairness and all of that.

161
00:11:32,075 --> 00:11:34,360
And I'm not saying that I am against inheritance.

162
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,460
I'm just saying it's something we should think and there's probably some threshhold of inheritance

163
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:45,159
That starts to undermine some of these ideas of a meritocracy and good incentives and fairness and all of that.

164
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:50,893
That's why I think it's funny when people who call themselves old money

165
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:54,493
are kind of proud of it, that they view themselves somehow being part of a better caste

166
00:11:54,493 --> 00:11:58,193
Because old money means that you did not earn the money youself,

167
00:11:58,193 --> 00:12:00,676
that your granddad or your great granddad earned the money,

168
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:03,978
And you've just happened to be born in this family, and, you know,

169
00:12:03,978 --> 00:12:06,976
are essentially just living of the interest.

170
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:12,727
And it's funny cause they talk about new money, new money like it's not just as good as old money

171
00:12:12,727 --> 00:12:17,743
But at least the new money people - maybe it was through luck but maybe it was through competence or innovation

172
00:12:17,743 --> 00:12:21,294
This is something that at least in mind I'd respect more.

173
00:12:21,294 --> 00:12:24,442
For old money you've done nothing. I mean what's the difference between old money or

174
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:33,561
king or queen or aristocracy in Europe that kind of go against a lot of philosophical under fittings that the US is sort of based on

175
00:12:33,561 --> 00:12:35,176
So I'll leave you there

176
00:12:35,176 --> 00:12:37,227
I just wanted to add a little bit of nuance to the conversation

177
00:12:37,227 --> 00:12:42,876
We'll say that I come to this conversation with a capitalist bias

178
00:12:42,876 --> 00:12:46,693
But I'm hoping that this gives you just a little bit of more nuance

179
00:12:46,693 --> 00:12:52,872
So instead of saying that capitalism is an unabmiguous good and socialism is an unambiguous bad

180
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:57,561
these are the things that we should try to promote and to do that we do have to do soem things

181
00:12:57,561 --> 00:13:01,593
Like make sure that everyone is educated so that we can can a meritocracy

182
00:13:01,593 --> 00:13:04,394
If everyone is educated then we have equal opportunity

183
00:13:04,394 --> 00:13:14,226
and that does involve on some scale some type of re-distribution in the form of education

184
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:19,510
Maybe we do need some form or way for people to get health care

185
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,742
You don't want people dying in the streets

186
00:13:21,742 --> 00:13:26,394
I'm not going to take a stance here but I just wanted to show that you can't just say that everything has to be purely capitalist

187
00:13:26,394 --> 00:13:33,384
and you cannot have any notion of government intervention

188
00:13:33,384 --> 00:13:39,876
You want the governement to invest in things like long term research where maybe you don't have an immidiate

189
00:13:39,876 --> 00:13:45,002
profit motive but 15, 20, 100 years down in the future it might help a society to thrive

190
00:13:45,002 --> 99:59:59,999
or something else. So I'll leave you there
