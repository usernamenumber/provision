1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,501
So we want to take the indefinite integral of 4x^3 over x^4 plus 7 dx.

2
00:00:08,501 --> 00:00:11,573
So how can we tackle this? It seems like a hairy integral.

3
00:00:11,573 --> 00:00:18,184
Now the key inside here is to realize you have this expression x^4 + 7

4
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:26,171
and you also have its derivative up here. The derivative of x^4 plus 7 is equal to 4x^3.

5
00:00:26,171 --> 00:00:30,843
Derivative of x^4 is 4x^3; derivative of 7 is just 0.

6
00:00:30,843 --> 00:00:36,903
So that's a big clue that u-substitution might be the tool of choice here.

7
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:39,575
U-sub -- I'll just write u- -- I'll write the whole thing.

8
00:00:39,575 --> 00:00:47,180
U-Substitution could be the tool of choice. So given that, what would you want to set your u equal to?

9
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,486
And I'll let you think about that 'cause it can figure out this part

10
00:00:49,486 --> 00:00:53,982
and the rest will just boil down to a fairly straightforward integral.

11
00:00:53,982 --> 00:00:58,737
Well, you want to set u be equal to the expression that you have its derivative laying around.

12
00:00:58,737 --> 00:01:09,745
So we could set u equal to x^4 plus 7. Now, what is du going to be equal to?

13
00:01:09,745 --> 00:01:18,406
du, I'm doing it in magenta. du, well it's just going to be the derivative of x^4 plus 7 with respect to x,

14
00:01:18,406 --> 00:01:27,278
so 4x^3 plus 0 times dx. I wrote it in differential form right over here,

15
00:01:27,278 --> 00:01:32,929
but it's a completely equivalent statement to saying that du, the derivative of u with respect to x,

16
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:40,848
is equal to 4x^3 power. When someone writes du over dx, like this is really a notation to say

17
00:01:40,848 --> 00:01:46,512
the derivative of u with respect to x. It really isn't a fraction in a very formal way,

18
00:01:46,512 --> 00:01:50,421
but often times, you can kind of pseudo-manipulate them like fractions.

19
00:01:50,421 --> 00:01:56,378
So if you want to go from here to there, you can kind of pretend that you're multiplying both sides by dx.

20
00:01:56,378 --> 00:01:59,377
But these are equivalent statements and we want to get it in differential form

21
00:01:59,377 --> 00:02:03,911
in order to do proper use of u-substitution. And the reason why this is useful --

22
00:02:03,911 --> 00:02:07,277
and I'll just rewrite it up here so that it becomes very obvious;

23
00:02:07,277 --> 00:02:15,410
our original integral we can rewrite as 4x^3 dx over x^4 plus 7.

24
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,580
And then it's pretty clear what's du and what's u.

25
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:26,110
U, which we set to be equal to x^4 plus 7. And then du is equal to this.

26
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:32,580
It's equal to 4x^3 dx. We saw it right over here. So we could rewrite this integral --

27
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,244
I'll try to stay consistent with the colors -- as the indefinite integral,

28
00:02:37,244 --> 00:02:44,722
well we have in magenta right over here, that's du over -- try to stay true to the colors --

29
00:02:44,722 --> 00:02:52,978
over x^4 plus 7, which is just u. Or, we could rewrite this entire thing as

30
00:02:52,978 --> 00:03:09,961
the integral of 1 over u du. Well, what is the indefinite integral of 1 over u du?

31
00:03:09,961 --> 00:03:16,120
Well that's just going to be equal to the natural log of the absolute value --

32
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,060
and we use the absolute value so it'll be defined even for negative use --

33
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,881
and it actually does work out. I'll do another video where I'll show you it definitely does.

34
00:03:23,881 --> 00:03:32,564
The natural log of the absolute value of u and then we might have a constant there that was lost when we took the derivative.

35
00:03:32,564 --> 00:03:38,631
So that's essentially our answer in terms of u. But now we need to un-substitute the u.

36
00:03:38,631 --> 00:03:42,301
So what happens when we un-substitute the u?

37
00:03:42,301 --> 00:03:45,132
Well, then we are left with -- this is going to be equal to --

38
00:03:45,132 --> 00:03:55,392
the natural log of the absolute value of -- well, u is x^4 plus 7 -- not C, plus 7 --

39
00:03:55,392 --> 00:03:59,392
and then we can't forget our plus C out here. And we are done!
