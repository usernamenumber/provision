1
00:00:01,134 --> 00:00:03,190
Zucker: We're looking at Alberto Giacometti's

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:04,748
The Palace at 4 a.m.

3
00:00:04,748 --> 00:00:06,439
We're in the Museum of Modern Art.

4
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:08,415
It's really interesting that all this verticality

5
00:00:08,415 --> 00:00:11,555
in Giacometti's work after the war and a lot of

6
00:00:11,555 --> 00:00:14,257
horizontality in Giacometti's work earlier.

7
00:00:14,257 --> 00:00:19,680
Harris: Although I sense the same sense of frigility and tenuousness

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,523
here in the structures of this house that seems to be outlined, kind of with sticks.

9
00:00:25,523 --> 00:00:27,768
Zucker: That's true and they're very delicate sticks and they're not especially

10
00:00:27,768 --> 00:00:32,204
well-wrought. It seem's like sort of a weekend project kind of thing.

11
00:00:32,204 --> 00:00:35,439
Harris: It does. Something a child would make almost.

12
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:36,867
Zucker: Oh that's true.

13
00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:45,149
Yeah, there's a very wonderful kind of child-like quality here, but also a kind of stage-like quality, as if what's taking place is sort of enacted before us.

14
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:46,607
So the Palace at 4 a.m.

15
00:00:46,607 --> 00:00:51,307
And clearly what Giacometti's talking about is the unconscious, his dream.

16
00:00:51,307 --> 00:00:54,352
Harris: So we have a female figure on the left.

17
00:00:54,352 --> 00:01:02,118
Zucker: Almost like a little chess piece. Harris: Standing very vertically and proper. Zucker: Very erect and very much a kind of presence.

18
00:01:02,118 --> 00:01:11,680
Harris: Super-ego perhaps, suggesting what one should do. And then also having that kind of super-ego feeling is that phallic shape.

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,842
Zucker: Oh, see I saw that as the Id. Harris: Oh, really?

20
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:18,352
Zucker: Yes. Harris: I saw the Id as the dinosaur-bird figure in the upper right. Zucker: The pterodactyl.

21
00:01:18,352 --> 00:01:25,806
Harris: And also that embryonic spine that seems to be in a kind of cage in the lower right.

22
00:01:25,806 --> 00:01:28,648
Zucker: And it's almost as if we're in the Museum of Natural History. And I think it's important to

23
00:01:28,648 --> 00:01:33,505
remember that psychoanalysis at this time was being seen by the surrealists in France

24
00:01:33,505 --> 00:01:40,355
really second-hand as linked to this idea of kind of a primordial past, as somehow the unconscious

25
00:01:40,355 --> 00:01:46,700
being linked to some ancient truth. Harris: Some truth about the human species. Zucker: About our most sort of

26
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,429
fundamental instincts and desires. So here we have

27
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:56,667
then this stage where, every night, Giacometti's unconscious in a sense enacts itself, or perhaps ours.

28
00:01:56,667 --> 00:02:02,734
Harris: But it's all held together with string and glue, and maybe that's a good representation of the

29
00:02:02,734 --> 00:02:11,360
unconscious mind. Zucker: I think so. And its mutability, its flexibility, that it's rebuilt every night, perhaps. Absolutely.
