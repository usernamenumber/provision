1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,020
I've already made videos on the
arcsine and the arctangent, so

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,820
to kind of complete the
trifecta, I might as well make

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,090
a video on the arccosine.

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:17,240
And just like the other inverse
trigonometric functions, the

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,600
arccosine is kind of the
same thought process.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,800
If I were to tell you the arc,
no, I'm doing cosine, if our

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,370
tell you that arccosine
of x is equal to theta.

9
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,530
This is an equivalent statement
to saying that the inverse

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,330
cosine of x is equal to theta.

11
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,700
These are just two different
ways of writing the

12
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,940
exact same thing.

13
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,780
And as soon as I see either an
arc- anything, or an inverse

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,590
trig function in general, my
brain immediately

15
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,780
rearranges this.

16
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,620
My brain immediately says, this
is saying that if I take the

17
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:59,640
cosine of some angle theta,
that I'm going to get x.

18
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,080
Or that same statement up here.

19
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,760
Either of these should
boil down to this.

20
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,820
If I say, you know, what is the
inverse cosine of x, my brain

21
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,880
says, what angle can I take
the cosine of to get x?

22
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,790
So with that said, let's
try it out on an example.

23
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:22,650
Let's say that I have the arc,
I'm told, no, two c's there,

24
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:29,020
I'm told to evaluate the
arccosine of minus 1/2.

25
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,310
My brain, you know, let's say
that this is going to be equal

26
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,330
to, it's going to be
equal to some angle.

27
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:38,210
And this is equivalent to
saying that the cosine of

28
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,550
my mystery angle is
equal to minus 1/2.

29
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,290
And as soon as you put it in
this way, at least for my

30
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,820
brain, it becomes a lot
easier to process.

31
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,130
So let's draw our unit circle
and see if we can make

32
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,580
some headway here.

33
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:55,650
So that's my, let me see if I
can draw a little straighter.

34
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,150
Maybe I could actually draw,
put rulers here, and if I put

35
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,330
a ruler here, maybe I can
draw a straight line.

36
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:01,880
Let me see.

37
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,150
No, that's too hard.

38
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:10,350
OK, so that is my y-axis,
that is my x-axis.

39
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:15,620
Not the most neatly drawn
axes ever, but it'll do.

40
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,180
Let me draw my unit circle.

41
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,460
Looks more like a unit ellipse,
but you get the idea.

42
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,660
And the cosine of an angle as
defined on the unit circle

43
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,960
definition is the x-value
on the unit circle.

44
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,990
So if we have some angle,
the x-value is going to

45
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,330
be equal a minus 1/2.

46
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,120
So we got a minus
1/2 right here.

47
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,300
And so the angle that we have
to solve for, our theta, is the

48
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,620
angle that when we intersect
the unit circle, the

49
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,350
x-value is minus 1/2.

50
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,350
So let me see, this is
the angle that we're

51
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,070
trying to figure out.

52
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,720
This is theta that we
need to determine.

53
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,750
So how can we do that?

54
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,030
So this is minus
1/2 right here.

55
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,470
Let's figure out these
different angles.

56
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,480
And the way I like to think
about it is, I like to figure

57
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,330
out this angle right here.

58
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,100
And if I know that angle, I can
just subtract that from 180

59
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,650
degrees to get this light blue
angle that's kind of the

60
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,050
solution to our problem.

61
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:18,240
So let me make this triangle
a little bit bigger.

62
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,620
So that triangle, let
me do it like this.

63
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,770
That triangle looks
something like this.

64
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:30,160
Where this distance
right here is 1/2.

65
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,910
That distance right
there is 1/2.

66
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,820
This distance right here is 1.

67
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,720
Hopefully you recognize
that this is going to be

68
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,500
a 30, 60, 90 triangle.

69
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,230
You could actually solve
for this other side.

70
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,550
You'll get the square
root of 3 over 2.

71
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,680
And to solve for that other
side you just need to do

72
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,660
the Pythagorean theorem.

73
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,780
Actually, let me just do that.

74
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,650
Let me just call this, I don't
know, just call this a.

75
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,160
So you'd get a squared,
plus 1/2 squared, which

76
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,650
is 1/4, which is equal to
1 squared, which is 1.

77
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:04,300
You get a squared is equal to
3/4, or a is equal to the

78
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,920
square root of 3 over 2.

79
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,080
So you immediately know this
is a 30, 60, 90 triangle.

80
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,750
And you know that because the
sides of a 30, 60, 90 triangle,

81
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,960
if the hypotenuse is 1, are 1/2
and square root of 3 over 2.

82
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,290
And you also know that the side
opposite the square root of

83
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,910
3 over 2 side is 60 degrees.

84
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,930
That's 60, this is 90.

85
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,570
This is the right angle, and
this is 30 right up there.

86
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,360
But this is the one
we care about.

87
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,260
This angle right here we just
figured out is 60 degrees.

88
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,380
So what's this?

89
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,880
What's the bigger angle
that we care about?

90
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,370
What is 60 degrees
supplementary to?

91
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,990
It's supplementary
to 180 degrees.

92
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:48,720
So the arccosine, or the
inverse cosine, let

93
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,490
me write that down.

94
00:04:49,490 --> 00:05:01,354
The arccosine of minus 1/2
is equal to 120 degrees.

95
00:05:01,354 --> 00:05:03,630
Did I write 180 there?

96
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,120
No, it's 180 minus the 60, this
whole thing is 180, so this is,

97
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,810
right here is, 120
degrees, right?

98
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,230
120 plus 60 is 180.

99
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:17,970
Or, if we wanted to write that
in radians, you just right 120

100
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:26,240
degrees times pi radian per 180
degrees, degrees cancel out.

101
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:35,030
12 over 18 is 2/3, so it
equals 2 pi over 3 radians.

102
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:43,130
So this right here is equal
to 2 pi over 3 radians.

103
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:48,150
Now, just like we saw in the
arcsine and the arctangent

104
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:52,530
videos, you probably say, hey,
OK, if I have 2 pi over 3

105
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,160
radians, that gives me
a cosine of minus 1/2.

106
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,440
And I can write that.
cosine of 2 pi over 3

107
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,220
is equal to minus 1/2.

108
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,210
This gives you the same
information as this

109
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,390
statement up here.

110
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,520
But I can just keep going
around the unit circle.

111
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,930
For example, I could, how
about this point over here?

112
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,230
Cosine of this angle, if I were
to add, if I were to go this

113
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,030
far, would also be minus 1/2.

114
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,560
And then I could go 2 pi
around and get back here.

115
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,240
So there's a lot of values that
if I take the cosine of those

116
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,250
angles, I'll get
this minus 1/2.

117
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,190
So we have to
restrict ourselves.

118
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:29,190
We have to restrict the
values that the arccosine

119
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,400
function can take on.

120
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,470
So we're essentially
restricting it's range.

121
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,880
We're restricting it's range.

122
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,740
What we do is we restrict it's
range to this upper hemisphere,

123
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,130
the first and second quadrants.

124
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:48,950
So if we say, if we make the
statement that the arccosine

125
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:53,480
of x is equal to theta,
we're going to restrict our

126
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,110
range, theta, to that top.

127
00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:00,010
So theta is going to be greater
than or equal to 0 and less

128
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:06,310
than or equal to 102 pi.

129
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,850
Less, oh sorry, not 2 pi.

130
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:13,620
Less than or equal
to pi, right?

131
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,630
Where this is also 0
degrees, or 180 degrees.

132
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:21,020
We're restricting ourselves
to this part of the

133
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,530
hemisphere right there.

134
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:25,230
And so you can't do this, this
is the only point where the

135
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,220
cosine of the angle
is equal minus 1/2.

136
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,200
We can't take this angle
because it's outside

137
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,750
of our range.

138
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,290
And what are the
valid values for x?

139
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,210
Well any angle, if I take
the cosine of it, it can be

140
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,700
between minus 1 and plus 1.

141
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:43,595
So x, the domain for the
arccosine function, is going

142
00:07:43,595 --> 00:07:48,060
to be x has to be less than
or equal to 1 and greater

143
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,760
than or equal to minus 1.

144
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,710
And once again, let's
just go check our work.

145
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:56,130
Let's see if the value I got
here, that the arccosine of

146
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:00,230
minus 1/2 really is 2 pi over
3 as calculated by the TI-85.

147
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,860
   

148
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,120
We turn it on.

149
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,900
So i need to figure out the
inverse cosine, which is the

150
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:15,710
same thing as the arccosine
of minus 1/2, of minus 0.5.

151
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,420
It gives me that decimal,
that strange number.

152
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,570
Let's see if that's the
same thing as 2 pi over 3.

153
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:27,880
2 times pi divided by
3 is equal to, that

154
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,820
exact same number.

155
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,390
So the calculator gave me
the same value I got.

156
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,980
But this is kind of a
useless, well, it's

157
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,700
not a useless number.

158
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,950
It's a valid, that
is the answer.

159
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,560
But it doesn't, it's not
a nice clean answer.

160
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,780
I didn't know that this
is 2 pi over 3 radians.

161
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,290
And so when we did it using
the unit circle, we were

162
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,840
able to get that answer.

163
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,070
So hopefully, actually let
me ask you, let me just

164
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,450
finish this up with an
interesting question.

165
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,370
And this applies
to all of them.

166
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:58,970
If I were to ask you, you know,
say I were to take the

167
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:05,270
arccosine of x, and then I were
to take the cosine of that,

168
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:09,810
what is this going
to be equal to?

169
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:14,280
Well, this statement right here
can be said, well, let's say

170
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:20,870
that the arccosine of x is
equal to theta, that means that

171
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:26,540
the cosine of theta is
equal to x, right?

172
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,410
So if the arccosine of x
is equal to theta, we can

173
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:33,020
replace this with theta.

174
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,200
And then the cosine of theta,
well the cosine of theta is x.

175
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,180
So this whole thing
is going to be x.

176
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,680
Hopefully I didn't get
confuse you there, right?

177
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,690
I'm saying look, arccosine
of x, just call that theta.

178
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,620
Now, by definition, this
means that the cosine

179
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,650
of theta is equal to x.

180
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:50,260
These are equivalent
statements.

181
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:54,220
These are completely equivalent
statements right here.

182
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,360
So if we put a theta right
there, we take the cosine of

183
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,000
theta, it has to be equal to x.

184
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,340
Now let me ask you a bonus,
slightly trickier question.

185
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,550
What if I were to ask you,
and this is true for any

186
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,950
x that you put in here.

187
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,730
This is true for any x, any
value between negative 1 and 1

188
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:15,030
including those two endpoints,
this is going to be true.

189
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:20,730
Now what if I were ask you
what the arccosine of

190
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,860
the cosine of theta is?

191
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,140
What is this going
to be equal to?

192
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:31,160
My answer is, it
depends on the theta.

193
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,880
So, if theta is in the, if
theta is in the range, if theta

194
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:43,920
is between, if theta is between
0 and pi, so it's in our valid

195
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:50,020
a range for, kind of, our range
for the product of the

196
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,580
arccosine, then this
will be equal to theta.

197
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,630
If this is true for theta.

198
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,940
But what if we take some
theta out of that range?

199
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,720
Let's try it out.

200
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,580
Let's take, so let me do one
with theta in that range.

201
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:09,790
Let's take the arccosine of
the cosine of, let's just do

202
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,820
one of them that we know.

203
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,180
Let's take the cosine
of, let's stick with

204
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,250
cosine of 2 pi over 3.

205
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,320
   

206
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,960
Cosine of 2 pi over 3 radians,
that's the same thing as

207
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:25,090
the arccosine of minus 1/2.

208
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,210
Cosine of 2 pi over
3 is minus 1/2.

209
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,860
We just saw that in the
earlier part of this video.

210
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,390
And then we solved this.

211
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,320
We said, oh, this is
equal to 1 pi over 3.

212
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,360
So for in the range of thetas
between 0 and pi it worked.

213
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,380
And that's because the
arccosine function can

214
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,350
only produce values
between 0 and pi.

215
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:52,210
But what if I were to ask you,
what is the arccosine of the

216
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:58,540
cosine of, I don't
know, of 3 pi.

217
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,780
So if I were to draw the unit
circle here, let me draw the

218
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,290
unit circle, a real quick one.

219
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,610
And that's my axes.

220
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,080
What's 3 pi?

221
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,700
2 pi is if I go around once.

222
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,620
And then I go around another
pi, so I end up right here.

223
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,810
So I've gone around 1 1/2
times the unit circle.

224
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:15,870
So this is 3 pi.

225
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,130
What's the x-coordinate here?

226
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,640
It's minus 1.

227
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,460
So cosine of 3 pi
is minus 1, right?

228
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:27,390
So what's arccosine of minus 1?

229
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,990
Arccosine of minus 1.

230
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:33,640
Well remember, the range, or
the set of values, that

231
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,810
arccosine can evaluate to is
in this upper hemisphere.

232
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:44,920
It's between, this can
only be between pi and 0.

233
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,350
So arccosine of negative 1
is just going to be pi.

234
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,210
So this is going to be pi.

235
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:54,000
Arccosine of negative, this
is negative 1, arccosine

236
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,250
of negative 1 is pi.

237
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,370
And that's a reasonable
statement, because the

238
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,730
difference between 3 pi and pi
is just going around the unit

239
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,130
circle a couple of times.

240
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,180
And so you get an equivalent,
it's kind of, you're at the

241
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,480
equivalent point on
the unit circle.

242
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,260
So I just thought I would
throw those two at you.

243
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,390
This one, I mean this
is a useful one.

244
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,700
Well, actually, let
me write it up here.

245
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,770
This one is a useful one.

246
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:18,330
The cosine of the arccosine of
x is always going to be x.

247
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,680
I could also do that with sine.

248
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:28,070
The sine of the arcsine of
x is also going to be x.

249
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,830
And these are just useful
things to, you shouldn't just

250
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,710
memorize them, because
obviously you might memorize it

251
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,780
the wrong way, but you should
just think a little bit about

252
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,870
it, and you'll never forget It.
