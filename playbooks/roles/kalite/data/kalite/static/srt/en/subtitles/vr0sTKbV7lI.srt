1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,740
   

2
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,160
Let's say I wanted to find the
volume of a cube, where the

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,150
values of the cube-- let's say
x is between-- x is greater

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,350
than or equal to 0, is less
than or equal to,

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,780
I don't know, 3.

6
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,600
Let's say y is greater than
or equal to 0, and is

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,000
less than or equal to 4.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,270
And then let's say that z is
greater than or equal to 0 and

9
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,055
is less than or equal to 2.

10
00:00:23,055 --> 00:00:26,650
And I know, using basic
geometry you could figure out--

11
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:30,370
you know, just multiply the
width times the height times

12
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,340
the depth and you'd
have the volume.

13
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,280
But I want to do this example,
just so that you get used to

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,700
what a triple integral looks
like, how it relates to a

15
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,180
double integral, and then later
in the next video we could do

16
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,290
something slightly
more complicated.

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,040
So let's just draw
that, this volume.

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:51,780
So this is my x-axis, this is
my z-axis, this is the y.

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,330
   

20
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,795
x, y, z.

21
00:00:55,795 --> 00:00:59,600
   

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,080
OK.

23
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,910
So x is between 0 and 3.

24
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,070
So that's x is equal to 0.

25
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:09,120
This is x is equal to--
let's see, 1, 2, 3.

26
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,570
y is between 0 and 4.

27
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,180
1, 2, 3, 4.

28
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,450
So the x-y plane will look
something like this.

29
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,520
The kind of base of our cube
will look something like this.

30
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,770
And then z is between 0 and 2.

31
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,350
So 0 is the x-y plane,
and then 1, 2.

32
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,130
So this would be the top part.

33
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,600
And maybe I'll do that in a
slightly different color.

34
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,520
So this is along the x-z axis.

35
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,360
You'd have a boundary
here, and then it would

36
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,316
come in like this.

37
00:01:38,316 --> 00:01:41,850
You have a boundary here,
come in like that.

38
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,810
A boundary there.

39
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,600
So we want to figure out
the volume of this cube.

40
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,370
And you could do it.

41
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:51,540
You could say, well, the depth
is 3, the base, the width is 4,

42
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,920
so this area is 12
times the height.

43
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,170
12 times 2 is 24.

44
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,980
You could say it's 24
cubic units, whatever

45
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,630
units we're doing.

46
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,990
But let's do it as
a triple integral.

47
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,640
So what does a triple
integral mean?

48
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,110
Well, what we could do is we
could take the volume of a very

49
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,670
small-- I don't want to say
area-- of a very small volume.

50
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:14,770
So let's say I wanted to take
the volume of a small cube.

51
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,810
Some place in this-- in the
volume under question.

52
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,160
And it'll start to make more
sense, or it starts to become a

53
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,860
lot more useful, when we have
variable boundaries and

54
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,050
surfaces and curves
as boundaries.

55
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,840
But let's say we want to
figure out the volume of this

56
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,780
little, small cube here.

57
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,590
That's my cube.

58
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,630
It's some place in this larger
cube, this larger rectangle,

59
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,460
cubic rectangle, whatever
you want to call it.

60
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,540
So what's the volume
of that cube?

61
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,930
Let's say that its width is dy.

62
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,320
   

63
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,010
So that length
right there is dy.

64
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,810
It's height is dx.

65
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,660
Sorry, no, it's
height is dz, right?

66
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,840
The way I drew it,
z is up and down.

67
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,860
And it's depth is dx.

68
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,940
This is dx.

69
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,750
This is dz.

70
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,720
This is dy.

71
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,260
So you can say that a small
volume within this larger

72
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,830
volume-- you could call that
dv, which is kind of the

73
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,750
volume differential.

74
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,290
And that would be equal to,
you could say, it's just

75
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,990
the width times the
length times the height.

76
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,950
dx times dy times dz.

77
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,760
And you could switch the
orders of these, right?

78
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,010
Because multiplication is
associative, and order

79
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,920
doesn't matter and all that.

80
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,540
But anyway, what can you
do with it in here?

81
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,290
Well, we can take the integral.

82
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:32,520
All integrals help us do is
help us take infinite sums of

83
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,080
infinitely small distances,
like a dz or a dx or

84
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,240
a dy, et cetera.

85
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,620
So, what we could do is we
could take this cube and

86
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,110
first, add it up in, let's
say, the z direction.

87
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:48,330
So we could take that cube and
then add it along the up and

88
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,230
down axis-- the z-axis--
so that we get the

89
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,410
volume of a column.

90
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,550
So what would that look like?

91
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,930
Well, since we're going up and
down, we're adding-- we're

92
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,670
taking the sum in
the z direction.

93
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,610
We'd have an integral.

94
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,655
And then what's the
lowest z value?

95
00:04:04,655 --> 00:04:08,310
Well, it's z is equal to 0.

96
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,280
And what's the upper bound?

97
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,070
Like if you were to just take--
keep adding these cubes, and

98
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,190
keep going up, you'd run
into the upper bound.

99
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:14,770
And what's the upper bound?

100
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,100
It's z is equal to 2.

101
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,580
   

102
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:25,010
And of course, you would
take the sum of these dv's.

103
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,130
And I'll write dz first.

104
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,170
Just so it reminds us
that we're going to

105
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,430
take the integral with
respect to z first.

106
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,010
And let's say we'll do y next.

107
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,200
And then we'll do x.

108
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,430
So this integral, this value,
as I've written it, will

109
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:42,020
figure out the volume of a
column given any x and y.

110
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,240
It'll be a function of x and y,
but since we're dealing with

111
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,130
all constants here, it's
actually going to be

112
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,600
a constant value.

113
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,160
It'll be the constant value
of the volume of one

114
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,890
of these columns.

115
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,580
So essentially, it'll
be 2 times dy dx.

116
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,330
Because the height of one
of these columns is 2,

117
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:03,710
and then its with and
its depth is dy and dx.

118
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,570
So then if we want to figure
out the entire volume-- what

119
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,270
we did just now is we figured
out the height of a column.

120
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,300
So then we could take those
columns and sum them

121
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,730
in the y direction.

122
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,710
So if we're summing in the y
direction, we could just take

123
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:20,340
another integral of this
sum in the y direction.

124
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:25,650
And y goes from 0 to what?
y goes from 0 to 4.

125
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,180
I wrote this integral a
little bit too far to the

126
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,300
left, it looks strange.

127
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,000
But I think you get the idea.

128
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,390
y is equal to 0, to
y is equal to 4.

129
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:37,420
And then that'll give us the
volume of a sheet that is

130
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,290
parallel to the zy plane.

131
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:44,250
And then all we have left to do
is add up a bunch of those

132
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,570
sheets in the x direction, and
we'll have the volume

133
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,210
of our entire figure.

134
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,190
So to add up those sheets,
we would have to sum

135
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,750
in the x direction.

136
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:57,060
And we'd go from x is equal
to 0, to x is equal to 3.

137
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,660
And to evaluate this
is actually fairly

138
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,690
straightforward.

139
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,020
So, first we're taking the
integral with respect to z.

140
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,090
Well, we don't have anything
written under here, but we

141
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,740
can just assume that
there's a 1, right?

142
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,160
Because dz times dy times
dx is the same thing as

143
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,940
1 times dz times dy dx.

144
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,500
So what's the value
of this integral?

145
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,760
Well, the antiderivative
of 1 with respect to

146
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,650
z is just z, right?

147
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,700
Because the derivative
of z is 1.

148
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:27,640
And you evaluate
that from 2 to 0.

149
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,210
So then you're left with--
so it's 2 minus 0.

150
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,580
So you're just left with 2.

151
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,390
So you're left with 2, and you
take the integral of that from

152
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:38,080
y is equal to 0, to y is equal
to 4 dy, and then

153
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,060
you have the x.

154
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:45,280
From x is equal to 0,
to x is equal to 3 dx.

155
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,440
And notice, when we just took
the integral with respect to

156
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,210
z, we ended up with
a double integral.

157
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,830
And this double integral is the
exact integral we would have

158
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:56,440
done in the previous videos on
the double integral, where you

159
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,510
would have just said, well,
z is a function of x and y.

160
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,880
So you could have written, you
know, z, is a function of x

161
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,230
and y, is always equal to 2.

162
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,180
It's a constant function.

163
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,980
It's independent of x and y.

164
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,210
But if you had defined z in
this way, and you wanted to

165
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,985
figure out the volume under
this surface, where the surface

166
00:07:11,985 --> 00:07:15,370
is z is equal to 2-- you
know, this is a surface, is z

167
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,580
is equal to 2-- we would
have ended up with this.

168
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,130
So you see that what we're
doing with the triple

169
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,030
integral, it's really,
really nothing different.

170
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,060
And you might be wondering,
well, why are we

171
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:22,840
doing it at all?

172
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,730
And I'll show you
that in a second.

173
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,320
But anyway, to evaluate
this, you could take the

174
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,070
antiderivative of this with
respect to y, you get 2y-- let

175
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,760
me scroll down a little bit.

176
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,530
You get 2y evaluating
that at 4 and 0.

177
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,150
And then, so you get 2 times 4.

178
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,540
So it's 8 minus 0.

179
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:46,070
And then you integrate
that from, with respect

180
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,340
to x from 0 to 3.

181
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,430
So that's 8x from 0 to 3.

182
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,430
So that'll be equal to
24 four units cubed.

183
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:59,780
So I know the obvious question
is, what is this good for?

184
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:05,420
Well, when you have a kind
of a constant value within

185
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,400
the volume, you're right.

186
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,230
You could have just done
a double integral.

187
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:11,610
But what if I were to tell you,
our goal is not to figure out

188
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,670
the volume of this figure.

189
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,550
Our goal is to figure out
the mass of this figure.

190
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:21,660
And even more, this volume--
this area of space or

191
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,670
whatever-- its mass
is not uniform.

192
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:28,190
If its mass was uniform, you
could just multiply its uniform

193
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:31,240
density times its volume,
and you'd get its mass.

194
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,040
But let's say the
density changes.

195
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,340
It could be a volume of some
gas or it could be even some

196
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,070
material with different
compounds in it.

197
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:42,370
So let's say that its density
is a variable function

198
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,240
of x, y, and z.

199
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,650
So let's say that the density--
this row, this thing that looks

200
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,720
like a p is what you normally
use in physics for density-- so

201
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,390
its density is a function
of x, y, and z.

202
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,710
Let's-- just to make it
simple-- let's make

203
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:59,840
it x times y times z.

204
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:06,020
If we wanted to figure out the
mass of any small volume, it

205
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,440
would be that volume times
the density, right?

206
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,190
Because density-- the units of
density are like kilograms

207
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,590
per meter cubed.

208
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,400
So if you multiply it times
meter cubed, you get kilograms.

209
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,260
So we could say that the mass--
well, I'll make up notation, d

210
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,730
mass-- this isn't a function.

211
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,230
Well, I don't want to write it
in parentheses, because it

212
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,230
makes it look like a function.

213
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:30,490
So, a very differential mass,
or a very small mass, is going

214
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:35,860
to equal the density at that
point, which would be xyz,

215
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,810
times the volume of that
of that small mass.

216
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,780
And that volume of that small
mass we could write as dv.

217
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:48,790
And we know that dv is the
same thing as the width times

218
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,670
the height times the depth.

219
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,350
dv doesn't always have to
be dx times dy times dz.

220
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,000
If we're doing other
coordinates, if we're doing

221
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,670
polar coordinates, it could be
something slightly different.

222
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,160
And we'll do that eventually.

223
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,280
But if we wanted to figure out
the mass, since we're using

224
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,550
rectangular coordinates, it
would be the density function

225
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:07,030
at that point times our
differential volume.

226
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:11,330
So times dx dy dz.

227
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:13,870
And of course, we can
change the order here.

228
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,386
So when you want to figure out
the volume-- when you want to

229
00:10:16,386 --> 00:10:19,000
figure out the mass-- which I
will do in the next video, we

230
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,290
essentially will have to
integrate this function.

231
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:27,400
As opposed to just
1 over z, y and x.

232
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,690
And I'm going to do that
in the next video.

233
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,050
And you'll see that it's really
just a lot of basic taking

234
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,700
antiderivatives and avoiding
careless mistakes.

235
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,280
I will see you in
the next video.

236
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:37,900
