1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
   

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,090
So I've been requested to do
the proof of the derivative of

3
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:06,300
the square root of x, so I
thought I would do a quick

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,300
video on the proof of the
derivative of the

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,370
square root of x.

6
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,680
So we know from the definition
of a derivative that the

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:22,280
derivative of the function
square root of x, that is equal

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,520
to-- let me switch colors, just
for a variety-- that's equal to

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:33,080
the limit as delta
x approaches 0.

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,595
And you know, some people
say h approaches 0,

11
00:00:35,595 --> 00:00:36,360
or d approaches 0.

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,450
I just use delta x.

13
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,450
So the change in x over 0.

14
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,830
And then we say f of x
plus delta x, so in this

15
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:42,910
case this is f of x.

16
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:52,260
So it's the square root of x
plus delta x minus f of x,

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,640
which in this case it's
square root of x.

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,140
All of that over the change
in x, over delta x.

19
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,040
   

20
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,580
Right now when I look at that,
there's not much simplification

21
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,945
I can do to make this come out
with something meaningful.

22
00:01:04,945 --> 00:01:09,940
   

23
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,540
I'm going to multiply the
numerator and the denominator

24
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,790
by the conjugate of the
numerator is what

25
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,200
I mean by that.

26
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,480
Let me rewrite it.

27
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,740
Limit is delta x approaching
0-- I'm just rewriting

28
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,280
what I have here.

29
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,650
So I said the square root
of x plus delta x minus

30
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,610
square root of x.

31
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,200
All of that over delta x.

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,490
And I'm going to multiply
that-- after switching colors--

33
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:41,840
times square root of x plus
delta x plus the square root of

34
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:48,260
x, over the square root of x
plus delta x plus the

35
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,250
square root of x.

36
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,420
This is just 1, so I could of
course multiply that times-- if

37
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,110
we assume that x and delta x
aren't both 0, this is a

38
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,090
defined number and
this will be 1.

39
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,010
And we can do that.

40
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,130
This is 1/1, we're just
multiplying it times this

41
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:10,900
equation, and we get limit
as delta x approaches 0.

42
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,510
This is a minus b
times a plus b.

43
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,360
Let me do little aside here.

44
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,880
Let me say a plus b times
a minus b is equal to a

45
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,150
squared minus b squared.

46
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,600
So this is a plus b
times a minus b.

47
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,410
So it's going to be
equal to a squared.

48
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,010
So what's this quantity squared
or this quantity squared,

49
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,180
either one, these are my a's.

50
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,450
Well it's just going
to be x plus delta x.

51
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:39,430
So we get x plus delta x.

52
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,050
And then what's b squared?

53
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:46,380
So minus square root of
x is b in this analogy.

54
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,640
So square root of x
squared is just x.

55
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,760
And all of that over delta
x times square root of x

56
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:04,210
plus delta x plus the
square root of x.

57
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,900
Let's see what
simplification we can do.

58
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,580
Well we have an x and
then a minus x, so those

59
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,480
cancel out. x minus x.

60
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,460
And then we're left in the
numerator and the denominator,

61
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,690
all we have is a delta x here
and a delta x here, so let's

62
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,770
divide the numerator and the
denominator by delta x.

63
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:22,822
So this goes to 1,
this goes to 1.

64
00:03:22,822 --> 00:03:26,350
And so this equals the limit--
I'll write smaller, because I'm

65
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:34,920
running out of space-- limit as
delta x approaches 0 of 1 over.

66
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,780
And of course we can only do
this assuming that delta--

67
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,220
well, we're dividing by delta
x to begin with, so we know

68
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,420
it's not 0, it's just
approaching zero.

69
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:50,320
So we get square root
of x plus delta x plus

70
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,860
the square root of x.

71
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,550
And now we can just
directly take the limit

72
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,410
as it approaches 0.

73
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,440
We can just set delta
x as equal to 0.

74
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,140
That's what it's approaching.

75
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:04,260
So then that equals one
over the square root of x.

76
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,790
Right, delta x is 0, so
we can ignore that.

77
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,120
We could take the limit
all the way to 0.

78
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,000
And then this is of course just
a square root of x here plus

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,160
the square root of x,
and that equals 1 over

80
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,350
2 square root of x.

81
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:24,890
And that equals 1/2x
to the negative 1/2.

82
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,900
So we just proved that x to the
1/2 power, the derivative of it

83
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:35,220
is 1/2x to the negative 1/2,
and so it is consistent with

84
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:41,700
the general property that the
derivative of-- oh I don't

85
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:50,850
know-- the derivative of x to
the n is equal to nx to the n

86
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:55,150
minus 1, even in this case
where the n was 1/2.

87
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,100
Well hopefully
that's satisfying.

88
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,960
I didn't prove it for all
fractions but this is a start.

89
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,120
This is a common one you
see, square root of x, and

90
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,770
it's hopefully not too
complicated for proof.

91
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,180
I will see you in
future videos.

92
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,900
