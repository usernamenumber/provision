1
00:00:04,512 --> 00:00:08,737
We're looking at Turner's great painting Rain, Steem and Speed

2
00:00:08,737 --> 00:00:12,171
The Great Western Railway which dates from 1844.

3
00:00:12,171 --> 00:00:15,756
A time when the railway was really criss crossing

4
00:00:15,756 --> 00:00:20,594
the British landscape. It was a really brand new way of travelling

5
00:00:20,594 --> 00:00:23,270
and connecting cities and people to each other.

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,587
It would really changed not only the landscape but changed society incredibly, dramatically.

7
00:00:27,587 --> 00:00:31,505
It was probably the most potent symbol of industrialization.

8
00:00:31,505 --> 00:00:36,009
Tuner really captures that feeling of the speed of the train

9
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:40,029
coming toward the us, the rain pounding at the train

10
00:00:40,029 --> 00:00:43,177
and the bridge as it moves towards us. I can almost feel

11
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:47,477
the wetness of this day and hear the sound of the train.

12
00:00:47,477 --> 00:00:51,589
Well the carriages were open and so people really would have felt that. You think

13
00:00:51,589 --> 00:00:54,477
about what the speed of the train meant.

14
00:00:54,477 --> 00:00:57,418
And of course the trains there in 1844 didn't move the speed

15
00:00:57,418 --> 00:00:59,090
the trains move now.

16
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,307
But think about the speed which people have travelled

17
00:01:02,307 --> 00:01:06,594
through history up to this point. People have either walked or they had

18
00:01:06,594 --> 00:01:10,373
taken a horse and if you're lucky to take a carriage with multiplehorses

19
00:01:10,373 --> 00:01:14,087
and could go a little bit faster. But a little bit faster so that

20
00:01:14,087 --> 00:01:17,085
means you might have gone 15 miles/h and for the first time

21
00:01:17,085 --> 00:01:22,364
people had been able to be transported mechanically. I think it's hard

22
00:01:22,364 --> 00:01:26,428
for us to recognize the radicalness of the railway

23
00:01:26,428 --> 00:01:30,085
and the kind of impact it must have had on the landscape. I mean part of this is

24
00:01:30,085 --> 00:01:33,255
kind of nostalgia for what's lost, the notion of the

25
00:01:33,255 --> 00:01:37,541
the violence of this hulking iron monster ripping through the landscape

26
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:41,040
and it must have been loud. Surrounded by agricultural fields

27
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,259
perhaps, the way that Turner shows us a farmer

28
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:45,808
on the right edge there.

29
00:01:45,808 --> 00:01:48,968
I think you look at the landscape and you saw those

30
00:01:48,968 --> 00:01:52,594
contrasts between the old, rural England and the new, industrial England.

31
00:01:52,594 --> 00:01:56,670
That's absolutely right. I mean on the left you see the bridge as well. On extreme left

32
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,238
you see an old, stone bridge. Here, on the right you have a modern, industrial

33
00:02:00,238 --> 00:02:03,673
brick bridge meant to carry this railway. But so much of this is

34
00:02:03,673 --> 00:02:07,590
about the subject but it's also about the way Turner painted it.

35
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,174
The atmosphere that we associate with Turner, this kind of gold and

36
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:15,029
blue and brown coloring and

37
00:02:15,029 --> 00:02:19,740
this thick impasto of paint that we can tell it has been applied with a palet knife, it's

38
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,464
particularly thick toward the sort of center line of the painting

39
00:02:24,464 --> 00:02:28,347
and then the upper right. It's so abstract that much of the painting

40
00:02:28,347 --> 00:02:31,708
is actually unreadable as in terms of anything specific

41
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:37,342
and it's atmospheric and it's atmospheric almost in an operatic way.

42
00:02:37,342 --> 00:02:40,007
Three quarters of this painting is nothing but

43
00:02:40,007 --> 00:02:43,372
the variations of color and tone of the sky, of the atmosphere,

44
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,792
of the rain and the way which in the sense of the rain creates a kind of unity

45
00:02:48,212 --> 00:02:50,633
and dissolves any kind of hard form.

46
00:02:50,633 --> 00:02:55,162
Any kind of specific reading and forms. The only one really comes through

47
00:02:55,162 --> 00:02:58,740
any clarity is the black iron of the chimney of that train.

48
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:03,424
That's true, it's only the chimney, the rest of the train itself kind of dissolves

49
00:03:03,424 --> 00:03:05,937
in the painting as well. That idea of confrontation

50
00:03:05,937 --> 00:03:08,979
between the industrial power of men and nature

51
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:14,692
is probably most sort of oddly juxtaposed by the train steaming towards

52
00:03:14,692 --> 00:03:17,177
a small rabbit in the lower right hand corner

53
00:03:17,177 --> 00:03:19,511
that seems to be hopping away as quickly as possible

54
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:21,924
and of course the rabbit is a symbol of the speed itself.

55
00:03:21,924 --> 00:03:29,091
I'm reminded that it's the power of paint that communicates to us more than the subject.

56
00:03:29,091 --> 00:03:32,425
That it is really about the textures and the colors

57
00:03:32,425 --> 00:03:36,684
and the globe of paint and the dissolution of form here that

58
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:42,230
communicate this idea of rain and atmosphere and speed and sound.

59
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,592
It would have been a very different painting had it been painted differently.

60
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:49,512
This painting is extensively about industrialisation

61
00:03:49,512 --> 00:03:52,715
about this powerful new thing, this train.

62
00:03:52,715 --> 00:03:56,965
But the painting really is about the act of painting itself and it is

63
00:03:56,965 --> 00:03:59,970
about the portrayal of this much more complex and

64
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:03,030
much more subtle relationship between nature and men.

65
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,170
Because of Turners ability to handle tone and form

66
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,355
with a kind of abstraction that is incredibly

67
00:04:09,355 --> 00:04:10,611
brave for this early period.

68
00:04:10,611 --> 00:04:11,749
It really is.

69
00:04:11,749 --> 00:04:12,931
I mean it is supposed to you know

70
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:14,113
the abstraction of the twentieth century

71
00:04:14,113 --> 00:04:15,295
in many ways
