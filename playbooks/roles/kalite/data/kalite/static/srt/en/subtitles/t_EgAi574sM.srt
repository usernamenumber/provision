1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
What I wanna do on this video, for some triangle we're gonna focused

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:07,680
on this larger triangle over heretriangle ABC

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:11,690
What I wanna do is prove that circumcenter,

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,020
remember the circumcenter is the intersection

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,820
of it's perpendicular bisectors

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,920
The circumcenter for this triangle, the centroid of this triangle,

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,040
the centroid is the intersection of it's medians,

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:28,720
and the orthocenter, that's the intersection of it's altitudes

9
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:35,460
all sit on the same line, or that OI right over here really a line segment

10
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:39,200
Or that OG and GI are really just 2 segments

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,810
that make up these 2 line segments which is part of the euler line

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,900
And to do that, I've set up a medial triangle right over here,

13
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:53,130
triangle FED, or actually I should say, triangle DEF,

14
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,760
whch is the medial triangle for ABC

15
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,670
And there's already a bunch of things

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,670
that we know about medial triangle

17
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,640
and we've proven this in previous videos

18
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:07,010
One thing we know, is the medial triangle DEF,

19
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,300
DEF is going to be similar to the larger triangle

20
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,410
the triangle that is a medial triangle of,

21
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,000
it is of, and ratio from the larger triangle to the smaller triangle

22
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,760
it's a 2 to 1 ratio

23
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,780
And this is really important to proof

24
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,630
When two triangles are similar with the given ratio,

25
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,360
that means if you take the distance between any 2 corresponding parts

26
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:32,690
of the two similar triangles that ratio will be 2 to 1

27
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,920
Now the other relationship that we've already shown,

28
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,350
the other relationship between the medial triangle,

29
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,440
and the triangle that is the medial triangle

30
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,590
of is that we've shown the orthocenter

31
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:52,130
of the medial center of the larger triangle

32
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,110
So one way to think about it is Point O,

33
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,810
we already mentioned is the circumcenter of the larger triangle

34
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:05,560
It is also the, it is also the orthocenter of the smaller triangle,

35
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:06,880
we actually wrote it of here

36
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:12,110
so Point O noticed it is on this perpendicular bisector,

37
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,880
you know, I should do a bunch of other ones of this dark grey color

38
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,640
but I didn't wanna make this diagram too messy

39
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,220
But this is the circumcenter of the larger triangle

40
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:04,560
Now in order to prove that OG and I all sit on the same line

41
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,030
or the same segment in this case

42
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,860
What I'm going to do, I wanna prove,

43
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:16,100
I'm going to prove that triangle FOG,

44
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,360
I'm going to prove that triangle FOG,

45
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:25,420
is similar to, is similar to triangle CIG,

46
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,180
is similar to triangle CIG

47
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,090
Because if I can prove that, then their corresponding angles

48
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,290
are going to be equivalent,

49
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,690
you could say this is angle is going to be equal

50
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,940
to those angle over here

51
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,760
And so OI would have to be a transversal,

52
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,270
cause we're goiong to see these two lines here are parallel

53
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,390
or if these two triangles are similar,

54
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,830
just remember that someone's look at our triangle here

55
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,330
and this triangles over there

56
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,400
If they truly are similar then this angle

57
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,780
is going to be equal to that angle

58
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,740
which would mean that,

59
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,180
so these are really would be vertical angles

60
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,970
and so this really would be real line

61
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,270
So let's go the actual proof

62
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,550
So maybe, I don't need those to highlight it over here

63
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,620
So one thing and I've hinted about this already,

64
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:12,390
we know that this line over here, we can call this like XC

65
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,580
we know this is perpendicular like AB

66
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:20,290
it is an altitude, and we also know that FY right over here

67
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:25,320
is perpendicular to AB, it is a perpendicular bi-sector

68
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,390
So they both form the same angle with a transversal

69
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,950
you can view AB as a transversal

70
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,240
so they must be parallel, so we know that FY,

71
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:39,110
FY is parallel to XC, to XC

72
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,350
segment FY is parallel to XC,

73
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,980
segment FY is parallel to segment XC

74
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:46,740
And we can write it; this guy is parallel to that guy there

75
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,490
And that's useful because we know that alternate interior angles

76
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,700
of a transversal, when a transversal intersects two parallel

77
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,070
lines are congruent

78
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,670
So we know, we know that this angle, so we know that FC is a line

79
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,740
it is a median of this larger triangle, triangle ABC

80
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,900
So you have a line intersecting two parallel lines,

81
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,860
alternate interior angels are congruent

82
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,890
So that angle is gonna be congruent to that angle

83
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:24,160
So you could say angle OFG is congruent to angle,

84
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:27,720
so it's OFG, it's congruent to angel ICG,

85
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:34,140
to ICG, now the other, the other thing we know,

86
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:38,280
this is a property, this is a property of medians is that

87
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,910
a median splits up or should I say the centroid,

88
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,690
splits the median in to two segments that have a ratio of two to one

89
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,360
or another way to think about this is a centroid

90
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,830
is two thirds along the median

91
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,590
So we know we've proven this on a previous video

92
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:02,330
We know that CG, CG is a equal to 2 times GF, 2 times GF

93
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,610
and I think you see where you are going,

94
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,710
we have an angle, I've shown you that the ratio of this side

95
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,480
to this side is 2 to 1 and that's just the property

96
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:10,830
of centroids and medians

97
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:16,850
And now if we can show you the ratio of his side CI is FO is 2 to 1

98
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,240
that we have two corresponding sides where the ratio is 2 to 1,

99
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,100
and we have the angle and between this congruent,

100
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,920
and we have the SAS singularity to show that these two triangles

101
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,570
are actually similar, so let's actually think about that

102
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:34,180
CI is the distance between, CI is the between the larger triangle's

103
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:40,210
point C orthocenter of the larger triangle

104
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,830
Well what is FO?

105
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,220
Well F is a corresponding point to point C on the medial triangle

106
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:51,630
and we make sure that we specify the similarity with the right, F,

107
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,040
F corresponds to point C

108
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:59,370
So FO is the distance between F on the smaller medial triangle

109
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,130
and the smaller medial triangle's orthocenter

110
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,810
So this is the distance between C

111
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,740
and the orthocenter of the larger triangle

112
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,560
This is the distance between the corresponding

113
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,990
side of the medial triangle

114
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,070
and the smaller medial triangle and it's orthocenter

115
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,190
So this is the same corresponding distance

116
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,740
on the larger triangle and the medial triangle,

117
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,820
and we already know that they're similar with the ratio of 2 to 1

118
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,820
And so the corresponding distances between any 2 points

119
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,560
on the two same triangle are gonna have the same ratio

120
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:32,750
So because of that similarity, because of the similarity

121
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:39,500
we know that CI, CI is gonna be equal to 2 times FO

122
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:43,440
I wanna emphasize this; C is the corresponding point to F,

123
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:46,080
when we look at both of these similar triangles,

124
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,600
I is the orthocenter of the larger triangle,

125
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,560
O is the orthocenter of the smaller triangle

126
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,470
You're taking a corresponding point

127
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,270
to the orthocenter of the larger triangle,

128
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,320
corresponding point of the smaller triangle

129
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,710
The triangles are similar to the ratios of 2 to 1

130
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,930
so the ratio of this length to this length is going to be 2 to 1

131
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,910
So we've shown, we've shown the ratio

132
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,380
of this side to this side is 2 to 1

133
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:17,730
We've shown the ratio if this side to side is also to 2 to 1

134
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,370
We've shown the angle in between are,

135
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:24,080
the angle between them is congruent

136
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,950
So we have proven by SAS similarity,

137
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:33,540
so it goes down a little bit, so by, by SAS similarity,

138
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:40,110
not congruency, similarity we've proven that triangle FOG

139
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,360
is similar to CIG

140
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:46,350
And so we know corresponding triangles are congruent,

141
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,910
we know that angle CIG correspond to angle FOG

142
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,450
so those are going to be congruent, and we also know that angle CGI,

143
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,660
angle CGI, let me do this a new color,

144
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:04,460
angle CGI corresponds to angel OGF

145
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,270
so they're also going to be congruent

146
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,360
So you can look at the different ways of these angle

147
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:12,140
and this angle are the same you can now view OI

148
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,670
as a true line as a transversal of these two parallel lines

149
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,390
So that let's you know that's a one line

150
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,920
or you can look these two over here,

151
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,240
so look these two angles are equivalent

152
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,070
so these must be vertical angles,

153
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,800
so this must actually be, this actually must be the same line

154
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:29,290
The angle that this is approaching, this,

155
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,290
this median is the same angle that is leaving

156
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,840
So these are all, these are definitely on the same line

157
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,310
So it's a very simple proof, once again,

158
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,260
