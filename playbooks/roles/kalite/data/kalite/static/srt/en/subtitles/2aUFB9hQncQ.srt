1
00:00:04,597 --> 00:00:10,915
So one theme that I´m starting to appreciate more is that there´s been some pieces where you just look at it,

2
00:00:10,915 --> 00:00:16,876
you just experience it and I think this Monet is kind of like that. Even if no one knew this was a great work of art

3
00:00:16,876 --> 00:00:24,091
or they just saw it for the first time in their life and they knew nothing about Monet, they´d say "Well that's pretty. That's interesting and it really captures something nice."

4
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:31,908
And then you have pieces like this which are clearly abstract and, not that one can't appreciate it,

5
00:00:31,908 --> 00:00:42,685
I think one can, but it feels that the piece of art by itself - you're like "OK, that's nice, it's white on white. Which is it's name.

6
00:00:42,685 --> 00:00:50,123
It's a square at an angle inside of another square." I can see how that might look aesthetically nice above my sofa or something

7
00:00:50,123 --> 00:00:54,962
but there's not quite that same, at least at a superficial level, of appreciation.

8
00:00:54,962 --> 00:00:59,127
Here you can appreciate all the brush strokes not even knowing this was Monet.

9
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:07,165
I think you're absolutely right. I think that now for us in the early 21st century, it is in some ways much easier to get a quick meaning

10
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:13,907
that can feel satisfying when we look at the Monet. What's ironic though, is when Monet first painted Impressionism,

11
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:18,226
people didn't feel that way. In fact this kind of art broke rules and boundries.

12
00:01:18,226 --> 00:01:24,508
It challenged people in ways that I think we have a very hard time understanding. Critics made terrible fun of this.

13
00:01:24,508 --> 00:01:30,161
They called it unfinished. In fact, the very word "Impressionism" comes from criticism in a newspaper

14
00:01:30,161 --> 00:01:34,580
that was making fun of Monet; saying this isn't real painting, this is a mere impression.

15
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,904
Something you dashed off quickly, huh?

16
00:01:36,904 --> 00:01:40,459
Yeah, because back then a "real painting" you'd carefully -

17
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:47,135
every brush stroke you are trying to mimic reality. This clearly looks quicker.

18
00:01:47,135 --> 00:01:52,490
But Monet was trying to do something that he felt was really important which was to register on the canvas

19
00:01:52,490 --> 00:02:02,167
not what his mind knew an umbrella or a woman on a cliff looked like, but rather what light actually looked like at that moment.

20
00:02:02,167 --> 00:02:09,333
And so we have the sense of the wind, we have the sense of the flickering of color and the way it might change a second later or a second before.

21
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:16,649
What I'm hearing is is that Monet kind of did both. When we really cite these great moments in art

22
00:02:16,649 --> 00:02:23,167
he was able to do something that was a huge transition and influential of things that came after him.

23
00:02:23,167 --> 00:02:29,384
I suspect that he wasn't saying "I'm going to be Avant-Garde and I'm going to break all the rules,"

24
00:02:29,384 --> 00:02:33,293
he just wanted to do something that he thought would be compelling.

25
00:02:33,293 --> 00:02:34,135
I think that that's right.

26
00:02:34,135 --> 00:02:36,849
He wanted to capture a certain emotive state or a certain way of perceiving the world.

27
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:38,862
And that he felt was visually true.

28
00:02:38,862 --> 00:02:45,902
And that's why someone like me, not an expert, connects with it not even knowing the historical context.

29
00:02:45,902 --> 00:02:50,668
I would argue that we connect with it because we live in very much the same culture that Monet lived in.

30
00:02:50,668 --> 00:02:58,294
Middle class culture, one of leisure, one where you work and then when you don't work you take a vacation

31
00:02:58,294 --> 00:03:04,379
and you go to a vacation by the seaside and you spend time with your family. I think our world is his world

32
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:09,950
so it's an easy painting for us to relate to. But when we get to something like the Malevich,

33
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:15,941
we go into a world that's very different from our world - a world of Russia during the revolution.

34
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:20,977
When I see a painting like that, if you didn't tell me anything I would say this was done in the '50s or '60s. When was this done?

35
00:03:20,977 --> 00:03:25,949
So this is done in 1918 and it was done in Russia by Kasimir Malevich.

36
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:30,599
Think about what was happening in Russia at this moment. This was the Bolshevik Revolution.

37
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:41,198
So these are very close together in time. Thirty-six years, which is nothing, it's a generation. I guess one thing that pops out at me

38
00:03:41,213 --> 00:03:46,390
when I see this is that it's 1918. I mean, we've looked at other modern pieces that at least on a superficial level look

39
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:53,798
similar; they are abstract, they are not trying to show something in reality. The painting is itself, it's not trying to show

40
00:03:53,798 --> 00:03:59,806
a scene of people at a cliff having a nice picnic or whatever like that. So one thing is when I see this,

41
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:05,306
I start to think that all these other folks in the 50s and 60s are a bit derivative. I mean, he did this in 1918!

42
00:04:05,306 --> 00:04:12,344
Well yes, but this had a very different kind of meaning. Malevich understood this kind of abstraction, what he called "Supremitism,"

43
00:04:12,344 --> 00:04:15,982
actually having an important political, almost spiritual message actually.

44
00:04:15,982 --> 00:04:19,744
Let me see if I can give you some sense of really what he was after.

45
00:04:19,744 --> 00:04:20,873
Did he make up that word "Supremitism?"

46
00:04:20,873 --> 00:04:22,174
He did.

47
00:04:22,174 --> 00:04:23,961
Is that a word now in the English language, or the Russian language?

48
00:04:23,961 --> 00:04:28,512
Well it's a word that refers to an art movment that he led.

49
00:04:28,512 --> 00:04:29,738
I see, "Suprematist."

50
00:04:29,738 --> 00:04:38,276
Exactly. Malevich was absolutely for the Russian Revolution. Russia was this deeply corrupt culture that had had a tzar.

51
00:04:38,276 --> 00:04:48,327
There was a terribly destabilized society, desperate poverty, so there was real need for change. The idea that Russia could produce a

52
00:04:48,327 --> 00:04:53,945
kind of new utopia was something that he was absolutely swept up by. He tried to create

53
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:59,652
an art that would express that. In fact, that wouldn't just express that but would help make that happen.

54
00:04:59,652 --> 00:05:03,798
So I want to go back to the experience of seeing these two paintings in the museum.

55
00:05:03,798 --> 00:05:09,858
You walk up, you see the Monet, and you get it, and you love it and you are right there with it.

56
00:05:09,858 --> 00:05:17,279
But you get to the Malevich and it's coming from a different world and you need all this art history.

57
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,891
You need history to get it.

58
00:05:18,891 --> 00:05:23,769
That's right because if you just went up to the Malevich at the museum you would say, "That's nice,"

59
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:30,093
I mean after some of our conversations I think I'm already starting to appreciate it more than I would have in the past,

60
00:05:30,093 --> 00:05:36,859
and I would have started thinking about "Oh, this is abstract, it's just white." But you are right, you appreciate it

61
00:05:36,859 --> 00:05:43,926
much more when you think about it. My brain keeps going back and forth as to "Is this good?"

62
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:48,178
Should the art be able to stand on its own? Which is how I've personally traditionally viewed art.

63
00:05:48,178 --> 00:05:55,437
The art should stand on its own and how I react to it is what matters. That's what I'm taught, too. Just what you think,

64
00:05:55,437 --> 00:06:04,269
that's right versus all the context. It is true that all the context does make it far more interesting and gives a lot more

65
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:10,288
texture and understanding to what the piece is but then I feel like the piece itself isn't necessarily the focal point.

66
00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:17,238
I think we maybe too much want the artist to be a hero. We want the artist to have succeeded in some way.

67
00:06:17,238 --> 00:06:22,837
Maybe the artist is, to a large extent, an accumulation of a culture at a particular moment

68
00:06:22,837 --> 00:06:24,828
and giving voice and vision to that culture.

69
00:06:24,828 --> 00:06:31,318
That's actually a fascinating way of thinking about it. Any student of history might look at a newspaper clipping from 1918

70
00:06:31,318 --> 00:06:35,425
or might read a book and have to capture a little bit of how people are thinking at that time,

71
00:06:35,425 --> 00:06:42,152
or what their fears or their hopes are. What I'm appreciating more is that a piece of art like this

72
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:49,256
gives you a core subjective feeling of how, at least what some people in the artistic community were feeling.

73
00:06:49,256 --> 00:06:50,453
It gets worse though.

74
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:51,268
It gets worse?

75
00:06:51,268 --> 00:06:57,473
It does get worse. Take a look at this. You called it white-on-white but in fact it's this cool, internal square

76
00:06:57,473 --> 00:07:04,171
and this warmer white square outside it. Notice that he has not aligned those squares. So the smaller square-

77
00:07:04,171 --> 00:07:05,602
It's like titanium-on-off-white or something.

78
00:07:05,602 --> 00:07:11,839
Exactly. So he's tipped that inner square a bit. That's not arbitrary, he spent a lot of time thinking about that.

79
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:18,934
There is a reason for this. At first when we look at this canvas, it couldn't be more flat. It couldn't be more two-dimensional, could it?

80
00:07:18,934 --> 00:07:19,789
No.

81
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:26,851
You have a square against a square. What could be less volumetric? But then, those are two different whites.

82
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:34,774
Maybe we're actually seeing that darker, cooler white as deeper in space. Or maybe it's in front of that

83
00:07:34,774 --> 00:07:37,615
warmer white. So all the sudden now we have a three-demensional relationship.

84
00:07:37,615 --> 00:07:39,307
How much is that reading into it?

85
00:07:39,307 --> 00:07:44,203
Well he actually wrote about this. He wrote a good deal about it and he taught. He was really interested

86
00:07:44,203 --> 00:07:51,809
in art as a way to push society forward, that is, art itself had agency. It could have political power.

87
00:07:51,809 --> 00:07:57,882
This is interesting because - and I'm appreciating this more because once again, we saw this work in 1918

88
00:07:57,882 --> 00:08:03,206
in someone's grandpa's garage, and you asked the grandpa "What is this?" he's like,

89
00:08:03,206 --> 00:08:07,168
"Well I had some titanium paint and some off-white paint and I felt like painting a square inside of another square,"

90
00:08:07,168 --> 00:08:14,750
not so interesting. But all the sudden when you have someone who, to some degree, has a voice in their time

91
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:20,665
and is able to articulate this, it's interesting not because of it's technical sophistication or anything like that

92
00:08:20,665 --> 00:08:25,450
but because society at that point in time thought it was important and gave him a voice.

93
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:28,847
He was trying to voice what he thought was important.

94
00:08:28,847 --> 00:08:30,636
That's why it transcends just this aesthetic or its technical.

95
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:36,705
I think it does. Although I think he would be disappointed if he heard you say that. Because interestingly,

96
00:08:36,705 --> 00:08:43,490
I think he wanted it to stand up by itself. Here was the Russian Revolution. He wanted to separate himself from

97
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:49,997
Bourgeois culture of the 19th century. He did not want to do what Monet was doing because that was a culture of privilege and of wealth.

98
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:57,253
Instead he wanted to create a kind of art that was so essential, that had worn down to its pure roots, so that anybody,

99
00:08:57,253 --> 00:09:02,557
no matter how little education they had, could actually understand it and be moved by it.

100
00:09:02,557 --> 00:09:06,946
We might say it failed. But nevertheless, that was very much part of his intent.

101
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:13,902
One question- I asked this about the Picasso as well, and even Malevich - he lived in a time that was fairly modern.

102
00:09:13,902 --> 00:09:19,449
It sounds like his intentions were really to get to this purity and not this overly intellectual - or I guess he

103
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:27,084
was trying to raise people up - but why did he chose this medium? Why didn't he do it as a big titanium sculpture?

104
00:09:27,084 --> 00:09:31,268
Why didn't he put radio waves in it? Why didn't he do something else with it?

105
00:09:31,268 --> 00:09:37,848
Well certain artists that were at that moment actually tried to do that. You might think of people like Tatlin - constructivists.

106
00:09:37,848 --> 00:09:44,421
Malevich really did stick with painting but this was a period in Russia which was quite poor and they didn't

107
00:09:44,421 --> 00:09:49,253
have the money to pull this off. They could create models, but there was a terrible civil war in Russia right after

108
00:09:49,253 --> 00:09:54,298
the revolution right after the First World War and the country was deeply impoverished.

109
00:09:54,298 --> 00:09:57,853
I get the sense that some artists would have done that if they could have -

110
00:09:57,853 --> 00:10:01,402
Malevich definitely would have. I mean, he was interested in technology.

111
00:10:01,402 --> 00:10:07,519
Deeply interested, absolutely. He was in love with the airplane, he was in love with the idea of movement, of speed,

112
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:15,765
of that new technology. He was trying to find a language that he felt was as utopian and as pure as the world he was hoping to create.
