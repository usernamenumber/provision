00:00:00,836 --> 00:00:07,600
Express the area of a rectangle with length 4y and width 2y as a monomial.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,533
So the area of a rectangle is just the width times the height.

3
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:13,333
Or, the base times the height (base x height)

4
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:16,649
Now here, the base is 4y, so let me just write it down.

5
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:20,400
Area is going the be equal to the width, or the base, times by the height.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,800
The width is 4y, and the height here is 2y.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,067
So the area is going to be 4y times by 2y.

8
00:00:29,067 --> 00:00:31,200
Now here we can just use the associative,

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,600
and the commutative properties of multiplication

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,333
So just swap the order that we do this multiplying in.

11
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:39,533
Instead of multiplying 4 times y times 2 times y,

12
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:45,800
We can say that this is the same thing as 4 times 2 times y times y

13
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,414
And of course, 4 times 2, that part over there,

14
00:00:48,414 --> 00:00:50,267
Is just equal to 8.

15
00:00:50,267 --> 00:00:53,081
And then y times y, well that's just y squared,

16
00:00:53,081 --> 00:00:54,933
Or it's y to the first, times y to the first,

17
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:56,750
which is also y squared.

18
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,333
So it becomes 8yÂ²

19
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:02,415
So that's the area and it's a monomial.

20
00:01:02,415 --> 99:59:59,999
This is a polynomial with only one term.
