00:00:00,783 --> 00:00:04,087
I have four statements here and I want you to think about which of

2
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:08,990
of these statements are true and the first statement is an object in motion will slow down

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:14,237
unless it is acted on by an unbalanced force in the direction of motion - interesting

4
00:00:14,237 --> 00:00:18,821
second statment, an object in motion will maintain it's speed and direction

5
00:00:18,821 --> 00:00:24,810
forever, unless acted on by an unbalanced force- also very interesting.

6
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:31,252
Third statement, an object at rest will stay at rest, unless acted on by an unbalanced

7
00:00:31,252 --> 00:00:36,917
force. And then the fourth statement, an object acted on an by a unbalanced force will always

8
00:00:36,917 --> 00:00:41,426
acclerate in the direction of the unbalanced force

9
00:00:41,426 --> 00:00:44,303
So, i'll leave you to think about those statements, and figure out

10
00:00:44,303 --> 00:00:46,392
which of those statements are actually true.

11
00:00:46,392 --> 00:00:50,471
It might be none of them, it might be all of them, or some combination of them.

12
00:00:53,056 --> 00:00:55,730
Now that's try to think about each of these statements.

13
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,955
So first of all an object in motion will slow down, unless it is acted on

14
00:00:58,955 --> 00:01:03,407
by an unbalanced force in the direction of motion. Well this, at least, on a first cut

15
00:01:03,407 --> 00:01:07,598
kind of seems consistant with our everyday experience. If i'm pushing some furniture

16
00:01:07,598 --> 00:01:12,122
across the room, so let's say that this is, that this is the carpet of my house,

17
00:01:12,122 --> 00:01:17,274
and i'm pushing a television set -let's say it's one of those old school heavy television set-

18
00:01:17,274 --> 00:01:21,661
(so i'm pushing a television set), the only way that I can keep it in motion is that I keep

19
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:26,120
pushing on it. So let me draw my force of pushing (my force of pushing). So let's call

20
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:33,402
that right there the force of Sal pushing the television set. So the only way that

21
00:01:33,402 --> 00:01:38,784
I can keep (the only way that I can keep) my television set moving seems like if I keep applying

22
00:01:38,784 --> 00:01:44,221
this pushing force on it. And I were to stop doing that, it seems like it will slow down.

23
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:49,367
So on a first cut everday experience, this seems like it would actually maybe be true.

24
00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:55,489
It only seems that way, because i'm actually not accounting all of the forces in this situation.

25
00:01:55,489 --> 00:02:00,096
There is not just the force of me pushing. There is also the force of friction.

26
00:02:00,096 --> 00:02:02,597
(There is also the force of friction.)

27
00:02:02,597 --> 00:02:08,098
So i'll call that, there is also the force of friction. And if I want to keep this

28
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:14,090
TV moving at a constant veloctiy, my force of pushing (that make that the vectors look

29
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,772
about the same magnitude, becuase they need to be the same magnitude)

30
00:02:17,772 --> 00:02:22,285
If I want to keep my television set at a constant velocity in the direction that i'm

31
00:02:22,285 --> 00:02:27,744
pushing, I have to exactly offset the force of (the force of) friction.

32
00:02:27,744 --> 00:02:34,173
If my force of pushing is less than the force of friction, then the TV set will to decelerate.

33
00:02:34,173 --> 00:02:39,247
If my force of pushing is larger than the force of friction, then my TV set will start to decelerate.

34
00:02:39,247 --> 00:02:44,210
But in the scenario right now, I have an object in motion, but there's actually a

35
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:48,279
balanced force. My pushing is completely balanced by the force of friction.

36
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:52,603
Another scenario, if we were to go to deep space (i'm not even thinking about air resistance

37
00:02:52,603 --> 00:02:58,173
right here), but if we were to go into space, where, especailly deep space, no planets around, complete

38
00:02:58,173 --> 00:03:04,077
vacuum, if an object is in motion (if an object is in motion), and there is absolutely

39
00:03:04,077 --> 00:03:09,146
no forces balanced or otherwise, there are absolutely no forces acting on it,

40
00:03:09,146 --> 00:03:13,996
then that object is going to stay in motion. The only way it might change its direction

41
00:03:14,873 --> 00:03:18,281
or decelerate or accelerate is if there is a net force on it.

42
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:22,594
And just by going back to this example, the only reason why it will slow down, if I

43
00:03:22,594 --> 00:03:27,567
were to stop pushing, is becuase there is a net force on it, the force of friction.

44
00:03:27,567 --> 00:03:30,937
And if you want to think about it, there would probably be very minor amount of

45
00:03:30,937 --> 00:03:36,295
air resistance. So this actually isn't true. An object in motion does not have to slow down

46
00:03:36,295 --> 00:03:39,237
,unless it is acted on by an unbalanced force.

47
00:03:39,237 --> 00:03:47,448
An object in motion can stay in motion, as long it is being acted on either by a balanced force, or (i guess)

48
00:03:47,448 --> 00:03:50,446
a set of forces that balance each other, or no forces at all.

49
00:03:50,446 --> 00:03:57,261
So this is not (that is not) true. An object in motion will maintain it's speed and direction forever

50
00:03:57,261 --> 00:04:00,290
unless acted on by an unbalanced force.

51
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:06,939
This is true! This is exactly what's happening right over here in the case of a (I guess) a block

52
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:13,323
moving through space in a vacuum. If there are no forces acting on it (no net forces acting on it)

53
00:04:13,323 --> 00:04:18,247
it is not going to change its velocity. Similarly, you could have this situation,

54
00:04:18,247 --> 00:04:21,951
where you actually have forces acting on it, but they balance each other out.

55
00:04:21,951 --> 00:04:27,896
In this situation, as long as I can keep pushing forever, and the floor doesn't change, and so the

56
00:04:27,896 --> 00:04:34,030
friction doesn't change, this thing will keep moving in that direction, theoretically forever.

57
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:38,416
The only way to change its direction or accellerate in one direction or another direction, would

58
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:43,187
be to have an unbalanced force. Maybe if my force of pushing were larger than the force

59
00:04:43,187 --> 00:04:46,869
of friction, or the force of friction were larger than my force of pushing.

60
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:51,091
So this right over here is absoluely true.

61
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:56,668
Third statement, an object at rest will stay at rest unless acted on by an unbalanced

62
00:04:56,668 --> 00:05:01,425
force. And this is actually pretty intuative, I think, for people. If you just leave

63
00:05:01,425 --> 00:05:05,100
something alone (if you just leave something alone) it's just going to stay alone.

64
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,447
It's not going to start spontaneously moving.

65
00:05:07,447 --> 00:05:13,075
And so, this is true. It's not just the situation where there is no forces; it could also be

66
00:05:13,075 --> 00:05:17,696
the situation that's it's going to stay at rest, if there are balanced forces acting on it.

67
00:05:17,696 --> 00:05:22,290
And so the only way you can actually get this thing to come out of that rest position

68
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,223
is if you have a net force, an unbalanced force.

69
00:05:25,223 --> 00:05:30,875
If, let's say, this force right here is (is) any amount larger than this force

70
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:35,961
right over here, if they don't completely balance out. So this, once again, is true.

71
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:44,062
Last statement, an object acted on by an unbalanced force will always accelerate in the direction

72
00:05:44,062 --> 00:05:49,841
of the unbalanced force. So if I have an object, and there's an unbalanced force, and if we

73
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:55,446
net out all the forces, let's say, the direction is in the force's net out and we get a force

74
00:05:55,446 --> 00:06:00,214
acting in this direction. This is actually true! The object will always accelerate

75
00:06:00,214 --> 00:06:05,565
if it has an unbalanced force acting on it in that direction, it will accelerate if there's

76
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:09,542
a net force in that direction. And there's another way of thinking about it.

77
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:15,417
If you see an object that is not accelerating, like my TV that's moving at a constant velocity or this thing

78
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:19,822
that's just traveling through space, if you see something that is not accelerating, that

79
00:06:19,822 --> 00:06:25,361
means that there must not be an unbalanced force acting on it.

80
00:06:25,361 --> 00:06:29,159
So could have balanced forces acting on it, or you could have no forces on it at all,

81
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:32,385
but you can't have an unbalanced force. So if you have an unbalanced force, the thing will

82
00:06:32,385 --> 99:59:59,999
be accelerating.
