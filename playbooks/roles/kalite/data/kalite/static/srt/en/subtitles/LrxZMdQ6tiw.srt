1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,060
We're told that A B C D E F is a regular hexagon

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,870
And this regular part hexagon obviously tells us

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,150
That we're dealing with six sides and you could just count that

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,940
You didn't have to be told it's a hexagon

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,740
But the regular part lets us know all of the sides

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,840
All six sides have the same length

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,390
and all of the interior angles have the same measure

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,490
Fair enough

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,570
And then they give us the length of one of the sides

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,030
And since this is a regular hexagon

11
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,770
They're actually giving us the length of all of the sides

12
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,590
They say its two square roots of three

13
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,450
So this side right over here is two square roots of three

14
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,010
This side right over here is two square roots of three

15
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,300
And I could just go around hexagon,

16
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,270
every one of their sides is two square roots of three

17
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,110
They want us to find the area of this hexagon

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,590
Find the area of A B C D E F

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,120
And the best way to find the area especially of regular polygons,

20
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,680
Is to try to spilt up into triangles

21
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,450
And hexagons are a bit of special case

22
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,160
Maybe in the future videos,

23
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,230
we'll think about the more general case of any polygon

24
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,770
With the hexagon, what you can think about is if we

25
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,120
If we take this point right over here and let's call this point G

26
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,830
Now let's say it's the center of the hexagon

27
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,750
And when I'm talking about a center of a hexagon

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,240
I'm talking about a point it can't be equidistant

29
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,900
From everything over here coz this isn't a circle [1:08 7]

30
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,390
But we could say it's equidistant from all of the vertices

31
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,720
So GD is the same thing as GC is the same thing as GB,

32
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,690
Which is the same thing as GA, which is the same thing as GF,

33
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,510
which is the same thing as GE

34
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,820
So I'm gonna draw some of those that I just talked about

35
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,280
So that is GE

36
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,230
There's GD

37
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,950
There's GC

38
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,390
All of these lines are going to be the same

39
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,000
So there's a point G which we can call the center

40
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,970
The center of this polygon

41
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,810
And we know that this length is equal to that length,

42
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,310
which is equal to that length,

43
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,090
Which is equal to that length,

44
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:39,810
which is equal to that length,

45
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,760
Which is equal to that length

46
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,770
We also know that if we add

47
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,900
if we go all the way around the circle;

48
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,160
If we go all the way around the circle like that,

49
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,810
We've gone 360 degrees

50
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,750
And we know that these triangles,

51
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,640
these triangles are all going to be congruent to each other

52
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,550
and there's multiple ways if we could show it;

53
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,260
But the easiest way is look they have two sides

54
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,550
All of them have this side and this side be congruent to each other

55
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,820
Coz G is in the center and they all have this third common side

56
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,680
Of two square roots of three

57
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,220
So all them by side-side-side they are all

58
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,310
They're all congruent

59
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,240
What that tells us is if they're all congruent

60
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,350
Then this angle, this interior angle right over here

61
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,480
Is going to be the same;

62
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,960
is going to be the same for all six of these

63
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,670
all six of these triangles over here

64
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,840
And maybe we'll call that X

65
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:32,220
That's angle X, that's X, that's X, that's x, that's x;

66
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,020
And if you'd add them all up we've gone around the circle

67
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,020
We've gone 360 degrees and we have six of these Xs

68
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,540
So you get six X is equal to 360 degrees

69
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,840
you divide both sides by six, you get X is equal to

70
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,700
X is equal to 60 degrees

71
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,840
X is equal to 60 degrees

72
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,610
All of these are equal to 60 degrees

73
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,730
Now there's something interesting

74
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,990
We know that these triangles-

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,800
for example triangle GBC

76
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,160
And we could do that for any of these six triangles

77
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,790
It looks kind of a trivial pursuit piece

78
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,350
But we know that they're definitely isosceles triangle

79
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,810
That this distance is equal to this distance

80
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,570
So we can use that information to figure out,

81
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,700
To figure out what the other angles are

82
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,000
Because these two base angles-

83
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,420
it's an isosceles triangle; the two legs are the same

84
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,580
so are two base angles

85
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,730
This angle is going to be congruent to that angle

86
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,320
And we could call that Y right over there

87
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:26,320
So you have Y+Y which is 2Y+60 degrees, plus 60 degrees

88
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,260
is going to be equal to 180

89
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,240
because the interior angles of any triangle,

90
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,550
They add up to 180

91
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,050
And so subtract 60 from both sides,

92
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,370
You get 2Y is equal to 120;

93
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:40,180
divide both sides by 2, you get Y is equal to 60 degrees

94
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,100
Now this is interesting

95
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,650
I could've done this with any of these triangles

96
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,180
All of these triangles are 60-60-60 triangles,

97
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,900
which tells us and we've proven this earlier on

98
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,200
When we first started studying equilateral triangles

99
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:55,620
We know that all of the angles of a triangle are 60 degrees

100
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,490
And we're dealing with an equilateral triangle！

101
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,620
Which means that all the sides have the same length

102
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,680
So this is two square roots of three

103
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,740
then so is This is also two square roots of three

104
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,380
And this is also two square roots of three

105
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,240
So pretty much all of these green lines are two square roots of three

106
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,410
And we already knew because it's a regular hexagon

107
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,290
That the every out

108
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,740
each side of the hexagon itself is also two square roots of three

109
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,750
So now we can essentially use that information

110
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,860
We can use that information to figure out;

111
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,950
Actually we don't really have to figure this part out

112
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,000
I'll show you in a second

113
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,040
To figure out the area of any one of these triangles

114
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,780
And then we can just multiply it by six

115
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,450
So let's focus on let me focus on this triangle right over here

116
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,010
Think about how we can find its area

117
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,880
We know that length of DC is two square roots of three

118
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,980
We can drop an altitude over here

119
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:42,420
We can drop an altitude just like that

120
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,690
And then we if we drop an altitude,

121
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,940
we know that this is

122
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,230
we know that this is an equilateral triangle

123
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,230
And we can show very easily

124
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,640
That these two triangles are symmetric

125
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:53,850
These are both 90 degree angles

126
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,490
We know that these two are 60 degree angles already

127
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,330
And then you just

128
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,840
if you look at each of these two independent triangles

129
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,750
You'd have to just say well they have to add up to 180

130
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,930
So this has to be 30 degrees; this have to be 30 degrees

131
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,630
All the angles are the same

132
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,530
They also share a side in common

133
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,080
So these two are congruent triangles

134
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:14,250
So if we wanna find the area of this broader

135
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,990
Of this little slice of the pie right over here,

136
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,930
We can just find the area of this slice or this sub slice

137
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,230
And then multiply it by two

138
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,360
Or we could just find this area and multiply by 12

139
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,720
For the entire hexagon

140
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,960
So how do we figure out the area of this thing?

141
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,180
Well this is going to be half of this base length

142
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,950
So this length right over here-- let me call this point H

143
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,430
DH is going to be the square root of three

144
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,290
And we are or hopefully we already recognized

145
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,010
this is a 30-60-90 triangle

146
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,190
Let me draw it over here

147
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:48,920
So this is a 30-60-90 triangle

148
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,150
We know that this length over here is square root of three

149
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,010
We know and we already actually did calculate it

150
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,670
This is two square root of three or we don't really need it

151
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,460
What we really need to figure out is this altitude height

152
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,330
And from 30-60 degree 90 30-60-90 triangles

153
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,660
we know that side opposite the 60 degree side is square root of three

154
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,700
Is a square root of three

155
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,560
Times the side opposite the 30 degree side

156
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,820
So this is going to be square root of three

157
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,200
Times the square root of three,

158
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,610
times the square root of three

159
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,310
Square root of three times square root of three

160
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,830
Is obviously just 3

161
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,360
So this altitude right over here is just going to be three

162
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:29,660
So if we want the area of this triangle right over here,

163
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,120
Which is this triangle right over here

164
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,270
Is just one half base times height

165
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,540
So the area of this little sub slice

166
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,770
is just one half times our base;

167
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,110
Just the base over here

168
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,960
Actually let's take a step back

169
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,520
We don't even have to worry about this thing

170
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:46,270
Let's just go straight to the larger triangle GDC

171
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,960
So let me let me rewind this a little bit

172
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,990
Coz now we have the base and the height of the whole thing

173
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,760
If we care about, if we care about the area triangle GDC

174
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,470
So now I'm looking at

175
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,130
Now I'm looking at this entire triangle right over here

176
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,960
This is equal to one half times base times height

177
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,870
Which is equal to one half

178
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,660
What's our base?

179
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,010
Our base we already know

180
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,530
It's one of the sides of our hexagon！

181
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,930
it's two square roots of three

182
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,140
So it's this whole thing right over here

183
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,940
So times two square roots of three

184
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,250
And then we wanna multiply that times our height

185
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,840
And that's what we just figure out using 30-60-90 triangles

186
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,440
Our height is three

187
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:27,180
So times three One half and two cancel out

188
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,000
We're left with three square roots of three

189
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:33,310
That's just the area of one of these little wedges right over here

190
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,820
If we wanna find the area of the entire hexagon

191
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,390
We just have to multiply that by six

192
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,370
Coz there are six of these triangles there

193
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:45,680
So this is going to be equal to six times three square roots of three

194
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:49,880
Which is 18 square roots of three and we're done
