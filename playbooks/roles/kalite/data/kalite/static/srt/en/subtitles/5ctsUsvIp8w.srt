1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:06,803
Plot the ordered pair (6, -8) into the coordinate plane.

2
00:00:06,803 --> 00:00:09,311
So this is the coordinate plane over here:

3
00:00:09,311 --> 00:00:12,237
This is the horizontal axis over here is the x axis

4
00:00:12,237 --> 00:00:16,463
The vertical axis here is the y axis

5
00:00:16,463 --> 00:00:21,804
and the convention when we get an ordered pair like this

6
00:00:21,804 --> 00:00:24,961
is the first coordinate is the x coordinate

7
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:28,119
and the second coordinate is the y coordinate

8
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:31,463
So they're telling us we have an x coordinate of 6

9
00:00:31,463 --> 00:00:33,135
x coordinate of 6.

10
00:00:33,135 --> 00:00:36,897
that means we count up 6 on the x axis

11
00:00:36,897 --> 00:00:40,054
So let's count up 1, I can even write down 1

12
00:00:40,054 --> 00:00:42,655
then we have 2, that's right there

13
00:00:42,655 --> 00:00:46,695
then we have 3, then we have 4, then we have 5

14
00:00:46,695 --> 00:00:50,467
and then we have moved up 6 along the x axis

15
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:53,150
we started at the origin

16
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,472
at (0,0), that's the origin

17
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,051
then we moved 6 to the right

18
00:00:57,051 --> 00:00:59,466
that's this part right over here [indicating 6 in (6,8)]

19
00:00:59,466 --> 00:01:02,485
Now our y coordinate is -8

20
00:01:02,485 --> 00:01:05,867
that means we move down 8 in the vertical direction

21
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:09,126
so we can see it right over here

22
00:01:09,126 --> 00:01:10,565
I'll just do every 2.

23
00:01:10,565 --> 00:01:12,795
So this is down 1, this right here is -2

24
00:01:12,795 --> 00:01:16,138
-3, this right here is -4

25
00:01:16,138 --> 00:01:19,900
-5, -6, -7, -8

26
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:26,448
So we move to the right 6 and down 8

27
00:01:26,448 --> 00:01:28,584
we move to the right 6

28
00:01:28,584 --> 00:01:32,810
then we move down 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8

29
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,897
and we are right over there

30
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:42,377
so that is the point (6, -8)

31
00:01:42,377 --> 00:01:46,371
you can also move at it this way

32
00:01:46,371 --> 00:01:47,717
so you move 6 there

33
00:01:47,717 --> 00:01:49,111
so we will be along this line here

34
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:51,804
and then you can go and then the y coordinate is -8

35
00:01:51,804 --> 00:01:55,705
and you say we will be along this line over here

36
00:01:55,705 --> 00:01:56,820
and the place they intersect is this coordinate

37
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,488
the way i like to think of it move 6 to the right

38
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:02,067
move along the x axis

39
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:05,132
and then move along in the y axis

40
00:02:05,132 --> 99:59:59,999
so you go down 8
