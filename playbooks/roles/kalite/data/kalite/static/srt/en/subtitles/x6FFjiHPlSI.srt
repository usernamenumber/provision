1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,399
We're asked to multiply and express as a simplified rational.

2
00:00:04,399 --> 00:00:08,297
So when you multiply any rational expressions, it's just like multiplying any fractions.

3
00:00:08,297 --> 00:00:11,796
You multiply the numerators times each other, and the denominators times each other.

4
00:00:11,796 --> 00:00:14,779
So if we multiply the numerators here, and when you multiply--

5
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:18,378
When you're just multiplying a bunch of numbers, it doesn't matter what order you do them in.

6
00:00:18,378 --> 00:00:20,479
So we want to multiply in an order that makes it a little bit clearer.

7
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,713
We can multiply the coefficients first.

8
00:00:22,713 --> 00:00:25,249
We can multiply 3 times 14.

9
00:00:25,249 --> 00:00:27,916
3 times 14 gives us

10
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:29,832
-3 times 10 is thirty-

11
00:00:29,832 --> 00:00:31,781
-3 times 4 is 12-

12
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,965
It gives us 42.

13
00:00:33,965 --> 00:00:36,765
So that's the 3 and the 14.

14
00:00:36,765 --> 00:00:41,748
Then we have an a-squared, 42a-squared.

15
00:00:41,748 --> 00:00:45,632
Then we have a b.

16
00:00:45,632 --> 00:00:48,116
I'll write these in the order that the letters in the alphabet-- alphabetical order.

17
00:00:48,116 --> 00:00:51,799
And then we have an x-squared -and then we have an x-squared.

18
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:55,348
So I just changed the order, but I just multiplied all of these things in both numerators.

19
00:00:55,348 --> 00:00:58,081
That's the numerators multiplied.

20
00:00:58,081 --> 00:00:59,899
Let's do the same thing for the denominators.

21
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:03,490
So I'll first do the constant -or I should say the coefficients-

22
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,116
I'll multiply 2 times 18, which is 36.

23
00:01:06,116 --> 00:01:12,167
And then I have an a over here - just one a- 36a

24
00:01:12,167 --> 00:01:16,984
Then I have a just one b over here -times b-

25
00:01:16,984 --> 00:01:21,250
Then I just have one x over here -times x-

26
00:01:22,173 --> 00:01:25,682
So we've multiplied the two, and now we just need to simplify them.

27
00:01:25,682 --> 00:01:28,237
Let's just think about this a little bit.

28
00:01:28,237 --> 00:01:30,770
Both 42 and 36 are divisible by 6.

29
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,487
That's their greatest common divisor.

30
00:01:32,487 --> 00:01:33,986
Let's divide both of them by 6.

31
00:01:33,986 --> 00:01:36,738
42 divided by 6 is 7.

32
00:01:36,738 --> 00:01:39,422
36 divided by 6 is 6.

33
00:01:40,591 --> 00:01:43,844
Both a-squared and a are divisible by a, so let's divide them both by a.

34
00:01:43,844 --> 00:01:46,396
a-squared divided by a is a.

35
00:01:46,396 --> 00:01:48,895
a divided by a is one.

36
00:01:48,895 --> 00:01:50,664
And just remember, I'm just dividing in both

37
00:01:50,664 --> 00:01:54,812
--in any of these steps I'm just dividing the numerator and the denominator by the same number.

38
00:01:54,812 --> 00:01:57,862
And that's not changing the overall value of the expression.

39
00:01:59,216 --> 00:02:01,443
Then I have a b divided by a b

40
00:02:01,443 --> 00:02:04,526
-well I can divide the numerator and the denominator by b-

41
00:02:05,711 --> 00:02:09,551
And so, those two characters will cancel out.

42
00:02:09,551 --> 00:02:11,801
To just 1 and 1.

43
00:02:11,801 --> 00:02:13,751
You don't even have to write it when you multiply by 1.

44
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:15,018
It doesn't change the value.

45
00:02:15,018 --> 00:02:16,968
And then I have an x-squared divided by x.

46
00:02:16,968 --> 00:02:18,468
They're both divisible by x.

47
00:02:18,468 --> 00:02:20,551
x-squared divided by x is x.

48
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:22,951
x divided by x is 1.

49
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:29,236
So, in the numerator we are left with 7ax.

50
00:02:29,236 --> 00:02:32,002
We can ignore the b, because it's just multiplying by 1 now.

51
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:36,301
We have 7 -let me do that same shade of green-

52
00:02:37,947 --> 00:02:44,324
We have 7 times a times x, in the numerator.

53
00:02:44,324 --> 00:02:48,306
And then in the denominator, we 6 times 1 times 1 times 1.

54
00:02:48,306 --> 00:02:53,306
We have all sixes.

55
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:57,741
Now I want to be a little bit careful here, because if we want this expression.

56
00:02:57,741 --> 00:03:02,306
So we have done what they've asked us to do, but this begs a little bit of a question here.

57
00:03:02,306 --> 00:03:09,724
If we want this expression to truly be the same expression as the product of these two things,

58
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:12,207
we have to constrain its domain.

59
00:03:12,207 --> 00:03:15,156
We have to constrain the variable values here.

60
00:03:15,156 --> 00:03:17,391
Because this expression right over here.

61
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:19,474
This is defined for any a's or x's.

62
00:03:19,474 --> 00:03:22,706
You could put any a or x here, and you will get a value here.

63
00:03:22,706 --> 00:03:26,958
But this product over here, this was not defined for any a's or x's.

64
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:30,508
The b's cancel out, but it was not defined for any a's or x's.

65
00:03:30,508 --> 00:03:38,842
In this situation, if either a or x equal to 0, this expression right over here would be undefined.

66
00:03:38,842 --> 00:03:42,453
In fact if b was equal to 0, this expression would also be undefined.

67
00:03:42,453 --> 00:03:46,404
So if you really this to be the exact same expression.

68
00:03:46,404 --> 00:03:48,088
Say this was a function definition.

69
00:03:48,088 --> 00:03:54,537
If you want it to be the exact same function definition as this over here, you would have to have the same domain.

70
00:03:54,537 --> 00:03:56,203
So I'll just write down the domain here.

71
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:57,590
They have to have the same domain.

72
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,195
If you want them to be the exact same function.

73
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:02,362
If you don't care about that, then you could just say, ok let's just go with this.

74
00:04:02,362 --> 00:04:07,203
But you should constrain it if you want it to be an equivalent expression.

75
00:04:07,203 --> 00:04:16,686
And so in either case, you should constrain the domain to be all real numbers.

76
00:04:16,686 --> 00:04:17,757
And this is a bit different, because

77
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,659
-- this is essentially like a two variable function.

78
00:04:20,659 --> 00:04:23,492
If you view a as a possible variable here.

79
00:04:23,492 --> 00:04:41,126
So, all real numbers for a, b and x, except (when) a, b or x is equal to 0.

80
00:04:41,126 --> 00:04:44,425
So we're just saying that a, b and c can be anything other than 0.

81
00:04:44,425 --> 00:04:47,625
We're getting it from our original expression, after we multiplied.

82
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:50,808
We're saying it has to be the same, it has to have the same domain.

83
00:04:50,808 --> 00:04:54,258
Most algebra classes, they wont make you be this particular about it.

84
00:04:54,258 --> 00:04:56,636
They'll just say, simplify the expression.

85
00:04:56,636 --> 00:04:58,270
And you'll just simplify it, and you'll give this answer.

86
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:03,172
But if you really want it to be the exact same expression, you would really have to have the same domain.
