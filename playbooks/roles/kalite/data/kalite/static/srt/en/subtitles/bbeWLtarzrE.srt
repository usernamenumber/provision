In the last video, we figured out how to figure out the

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
sum of the roots of a polynomial, and what we're

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
going to try to attempt to do in this video

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is think about the sum of the squares of the roots

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of a polynomial. So lets think about that for a

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
little bit. So let's say that I have a 2nd degree

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
polynomial that looks like this:
