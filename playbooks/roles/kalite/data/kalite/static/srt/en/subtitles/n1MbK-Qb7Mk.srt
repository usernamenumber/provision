1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,250
We're on problem 145.

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:20,760
It says, is 1/p greater than r/r squared plus 2.

3
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,380
That's their question.

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,090
Statement number one-- I realize I go on these tangents

5
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,210
before even looking at the statement;

6
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,250
I should look at the statements first--p is equal to r.

7
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,340
So let's see if we can simplify this.

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,820
So if p is equal to r, then we get 1/r-- instead of a p,

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:44,210
right?-- is greater than r/r squared plus 2.

10
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,740
Let's multiply both sides of this equation by r.

11
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:53,730
Well, we don't know that r is necessarily greater than 0.

12
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,340
That's the problem.

13
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,390
So if r is greater than 0-- well,

14
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,400
it's going to change the inequality one way or the other.

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,290
So let's just assume r is greater than 0.

16
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,970
So if we multiply both sides of the equation by r,

17
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,430
then we don't have to switch the inequality,

18
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,300
because we're assuming r greater than 0.

19
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,020
That's an assumption.

20
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,040
Then you get 1 is greater than

21
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,710
r squared over r squared plus 2.

22
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,490
And then if r is greater than 0, then r squared plus 2--

23
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:23,800
actually,

24
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,780
r squared plus 2 is always going to be greater than 0,

25
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,060
because r squared is positive.

26
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,850
Let's multiply both sides of this equation

27
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,160
by r squared plus 2.

28
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,110
And you get r squared plus 2 is greater than r squared.

29
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,170
You could subtract r squared from both sides,

30
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,240
and you get 2 is greater than 0,which is true.

31
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,200
But remember, I had to make this assumption that

32
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,230
r is greater than 0.

33
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,690
If you assume that r less than 0,

34
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,130
then all of this is going to break down.

35
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,790
Because when you multiply both sides by r,

36
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,970
you have to switch the inequality to get 1

37
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,470
is less than r squared over r squared plus 2.

38
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:59,270
And then, eventually, you're going to end up with

39
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,230
r squared plus 2 is less than r squared.

40
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,640
Or that 2 his less than 0, which is false.

41
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,350
So this statement alone isn't enough.

42
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,840
We have to know whether or not r is greater 0.

43
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,650
Statement two-- well, there you go;

44
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,700
I really should look at the statements first--r is greater 0.

45
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,190
And just so you know,statement two by itself is insufficient,

46
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,640
because if you know that r is greater than 0,

47
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,050
you have no idea what p is.

48
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,510
So you can't answer it yet.

49
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,840
But both statements combined are sufficient

50
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,220
to answer this question.

51
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:40,960
Next question. 146. Is n an integer?

52
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,230
Statement one says n squared is an integer.

53
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,540
Well, that doesn't help us.

54
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,200
I mean, what if n was equal to the square root of 2?

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,750
And then n squared would be equal to 2, which is an integer.

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,680
But this is clearly not an integer.

57
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,670
But on the other hand, n could be equal to 2,

58
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,890
in which case n squared would be an integer.

59
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,700
So whether or not n squared is an integer,

60
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,750
both of these are cases where n squared are integers,

61
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,970
but one ends up where n is an integer,

62
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,640
one is where n isn't an integer.

63
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,750
So this, by itself, is not enough to tell me

64
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,550
whether n is an integer.

65
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:38,980
Statement two tells us, the square root of n is an integer.

66
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,930
OK. So that essentially tells us that n

67
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:50,950
is equal to some integer squared, right?

68
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,290
You could take the square root of both sides.

69
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,180
You'd get the square root of n is equal to some integer.

70
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,660
So you take any integer, you square it,

71
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,930
you're going to get an integer.

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,400
So statement two alone is sufficient to answer this question.

73
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,430
That was a strangely easy question.

74
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,550
They they were getting a little bit hairy and confusing,

75
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:13,070
but that was a nice little rest question, I think.

76
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,400
147.

77
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,550
If n is a positive integer--so n is a positive integer.

78
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,080
Well, n is greater than 0. It's an integer.

79
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,100
Well, I didn't write that down.

80
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:32,250
Is n to the third minus n divisible by 4?

81
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,730
Fascinating. Let's see.

82
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,430
So my initial reaction is to see if I can

83
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,390
simplify this as a product of simpler expressions.

84
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,910
I look already at statement number one.

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,240
Let me look at statement number one.

86
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,660
Statement number one says, n is equal to 2k plus 1,

87
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,500
where k is an integer.

88
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,370
I don't feel like taking 2k plus 1 and cubing it.

89
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,250
That's not an easy thing to do. It'll take some time.

90
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,470
So my intuition is that

91
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,240
maybe we should simplify this a little bit.

92
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,670
So if we factor out an n,

93
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:06,310
that's equal to n times n squared, minus 1.

94
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,740
And that's equal to n times--what's n squared minus 1?

95
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,450
That's n plus 1, times n minus 1.

96
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,380
And now this is something

97
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,850
that's much easier to substitute this into.

98
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,070
So let's do that.

99
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,410
Let's substitute n equals 2k plus 1 into this.

100
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:26,500
So if n is equal to 2k plus 1,you get 2k plus 1,

101
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,080
times 2k plus 1, plus 1.

102
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,610
So that's 2k plus 2. That's this one.

103
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,120
And then you have 2k plus 1, minus 1.

104
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,210
So that's just 2k.

105
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:43,320
And then what does that simplify to? You get 2k plus 1.

106
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,190
Remember, in the back my mind, I want a 4 to show up,

107
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,970
because I want this thing to be divisible by 4.

108
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:57,790
2k plus 1, times 4k squared plus 4k. Interesting.

109
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,530
So now I can factor out a 4.

110
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:07,340
So it's 2k plus 1, times k squared plus k, times 4.

111
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,350
And we know that this is an integer,

112
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,950
because they told us that k is an integer.

113
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,840
We know that this is an integer,

114
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,010
because k is an integer.

115
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,100
And we know 4 is an integer.

116
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,590
So we've essentially kind of factored n cubed minus n.

117
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,830
And 4 is one of it's factors.

118
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,510
So it's definitely divisible by 4.

119
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,490
I mean, we can divide it by 4 right now.

120
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,960
If we divide it by 4, we'd be left with this,

121
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,800
which is clearly an integer, because k is an integer.

122
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,790
So n to the third minus n is divisible by 4

123
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,900
if we can assume that n is equal to 2k plus 1,

124
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,540
where k is some integer.

125
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,530
Now, what do they tell us in statement two?

126
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:57,830
Statement two tells us,n squared plus n is divisible by 6.

127
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,920
Well, I don't see how that's helpful at all.

128
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,910
n squared plus n is divisible by 6.

129
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,220
You can't even relate that to that.

130
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,770
I mean, n squared--I could try to do something fancy here.

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,270
No. This is so different than this.

132
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,550
n squared plus n is so different from n to the third.

133
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,980
I could factor out an n.

134
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:29,840
I could say n times n plus 1 is divisible by 6.

135
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,170
Well, I guess that's interesting.

136
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:37,120
That tells us that this part is divisible by 6.

137
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,330
n times n plus 1 is divisible by 6.

138
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,450
Do they tell us that n is a positive integer?

139
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,780
Yeah, they do tell us that n is a positive integer.

140
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,550
So this could be 2 and 3.

141
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:00,390
If this is 2 and 3, then this would be 1.

142
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,380
This could be 2 and 3.

143
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,430
In fact-- well, this could be 2 and 3,

144
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,180
but it could also be-- well, actually,

145
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,890
that's the only numbers it could be.

146
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,230
It could be 2 and 3, in which case this is 1,

147
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,140
in which case this whole thing--

148
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,240
if you say this, then n could be 2.

149
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:25,680
n is equal to 2. n plus 1 is equal to 3.

150
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,240
And then n minus 1 would be equal to 1.

151
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,620
And let me see. Is that the only case?

152
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,030
I'm looking at the answer right now,

153
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:36,980
just because I want to make sure.

154
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,570
They say that this isn't sufficient.

155
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:41,770
But, once again, kind of like problem 142, actually--

156
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,720
because if you say that n is a positive integer

157
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:52,900
and that n times n plus 1 is divisible by 6,

158
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,630
I can't think of any other numbers

159
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,150
where you multiply one number times the next number,

160
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:02,910
and their integers, where you get a multiple of 6.

161
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,550
No, I take that back. It could be 3 and 4.

162
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,770
There could be 3 and 4.

163
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,820
It could be-- yeah, there's actually a bunch of them.

164
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,080
This could be 3, this could be 4,

165
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,560
because it's a multiple 6, and then this would be 2.

166
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,470
So that's right. This is not enough information.

167
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,140
So that's good.

168
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,880
Because by this information, n could be 2,

169
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,680
n plus 1 could be 3, in which case,

170
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,300
this number would be actually 6.

171
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,390
But that still doesn't help us,

172
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,890
because 6 isn't divisible by 4.

173
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,590
But then I could come up with the situation

174
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:39,310
where this number right here, where n is 3,n plus 1 is 4,

175
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,660
and n minus 1 is 2,

176
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,400
where this does become divisible by 4.

177
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,430
So this doesn't give us enough information.

178
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,770
Not useful. And I'm out of time.

179
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,820
I'll see you in the next video.
