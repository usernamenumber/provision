00:00:00,633 --> 00:00:05,016
At my house, no Thanksgiving dinner is complete, without mathed potatoes.

2
00:00:05,016 --> 00:00:09,626
To make mathed potatoes, start by boiling the potatoes until they soft, which will take

3
00:00:09,626 --> 00:00:10,498
about 15 to 20 minutes.

4
00:00:10,498 --> 00:00:14,480
After you drain them and let them cool slightly, you're ready for the math.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,907
Take one potato and divide it evenly to get half a potato plus half a potato.

6
00:00:18,907 --> 00:00:22,832
Then divide the halves into fourths and the fourths into eighths and so on.

7
00:00:22,832 --> 00:00:26,536
Eventually you'll have a completely mathed potato that looks like this.

8
00:00:26,536 --> 00:00:31,535
Once you have proven this result for one potato you can apply to other potatoes without going through the entire process.

9
00:00:31,535 --> 00:00:33,185
That's how math works.

10
00:00:33,185 --> 00:00:36,598
While I prefer refined and precise methods for mathing a potato,

11
00:00:36,598 --> 00:00:39,315
many people just apply brute force algorithms.

12
00:00:39,315 --> 00:00:42,729
You can also add other variables like butter, cream, garlic, salt and pepper.

13
00:00:42,729 --> 00:00:48,318
Place in the hemisphere and garness with a organic hyperbolic plain and your mathed potatoes are ready for the table.

14
00:00:48,318 --> 00:00:51,905
Together with a cranberry cylinder and a nice basket of bread spheres

15
00:00:51,905 --> 00:00:57,639
with butter prism, you'll be well on your way to create a delicious and engaging Thanksgiving meal.

16
00:00:57,639 --> 00:01:03,658
Here's a serving tip: When arranging mathed potatoes on your plate, it is important to do it in a way that holds gravy.

17
00:01:03,658 --> 00:01:06,245
If you just make a mound the gravy will fall off.

18
00:01:06,245 --> 00:01:11,635
It's best to create a choc or pool, but what shape will maximize the amount of gravy it can hold?

19
00:01:11,635 --> 00:01:14,478
Due to the structural properties of mathed potatoes,

20
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:18,155
this can essentially be reduced to a 2 dimensional gravy pool problem.

21
00:01:18,155 --> 00:01:22,064
Where you want the most gravy area given a certain potato perimeter.

22
00:01:22,064 --> 00:01:24,922
When I think of this question I like to think about inflating shapes.

23
00:01:24,922 --> 00:01:29,037
Say you inflated a triangle. It would add more area and round out into a circle.

24
00:01:29,037 --> 00:01:31,632
And then if the perimeter can't change then it would pop!

25
00:01:31,632 --> 00:01:35,326
In fact all 2D shapes inflate into circles.

26
00:01:35,326 --> 00:01:37,959
And in 3D it's spheres, which is why bubbles like to be round.

27
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:42,150
And turkeys are spheroid because that optimizes for maximum stuffing.

28
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,191
The limited 3 dimensional capacity of mathed potatoes may confuse things a little

29
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:51,318
but since a mathed potato sphere can't support itself, you're really stuck with extrusion to 2D shapes.

30
00:01:51,318 --> 00:01:55,973
So what's better: A deep mathed potato cylinder or a shallow but wider one?

31
00:01:55,973 --> 00:01:59,683
Well think of it like this: If you slice the deep version in half,

32
00:01:59,683 --> 00:02:04,833
you'll see it has equivalent gravy holding capacity to 2 separate shallow cylinders.

33
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:09,986
And the perimeter of 2 circles would be more efficient if combined into one bigger circle.

34
00:02:09,986 --> 00:02:14,202
So the solution is to create the biggest, roundest, shallowest gravy pool you can.

35
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:18,112
In fact maybe you should just skip the mathed potatoes and get a bowl.

36
00:02:18,112 --> 00:02:22,378
Anyway I hope this simple recipe helps you have an optimal Thanksgiving experience.

37
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:25,585
Advanced chefs in kitchens may which to try Banic Starkey potatoes

38
00:02:25,585 --> 00:02:31,053
where in after you cut a potato in a particular way, you put the pieces back together and get 2 potatoes.

39
00:02:31,053 --> 00:02:35,053
Stay tuned for more delicious and extremely practical Thanksgiving recipes this week.
