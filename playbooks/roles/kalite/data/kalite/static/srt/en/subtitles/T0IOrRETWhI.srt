1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,530
   

2
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,640
A carpet measures 7 feet long
and has a diagonal measurement

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,530
of square root of 74 feet.

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,845
Find the width of the carpet.

5
00:00:09,845 --> 00:00:12,630
So let's draw ourselves
a carpet here.

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,080
So let's draw a carpet.

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,410
It has a length of 7 feet, so
let's say that that is 7 feet,

8
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,350
right there.

9
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,620
And it's going to be a rectangle
of some kind.

10
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,450
So let's say that we're
looking down on

11
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,350
the carpet like that.

12
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,340
That's our carpet.

13
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,280
And then it has a diagonal
measurement of

14
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,590
square root of 74 feet.

15
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,570
So that means that this
distance, right here-- draw it

16
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,280
a little bit neater than that
--this distance right here,

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,000
the diagonal of the carpet, is
the square root of 74 feet.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,850
And what they want to know is
the width of the carpet.

19
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,580
Find the width of the carpet.

20
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,640
So let's say that this is
the width of the carpet.

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,220
That is w, right there.

22
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,300
Now, you might already realize
that what I have drawn here is

23
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,520
a right triangle.

24
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,310
Let me make sure
you realize it.

25
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,910
This is a 90 degree
angle here.

26
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:08,660
And since that is a triangle
that has a 90 degree angle,

27
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,050
it's a right triangle.

28
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:14,520
The side opposite the right
angle, or the 90 degrees, is a

29
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,370
hypotenuse, or the
longest side.

30
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,520
It is the square root of 74.

31
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,710
And the shorter sides
are w and 7.

32
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,830
And the Pythagorean Theorem
tells us that the sum of the

33
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,980
squares of the shorter side will
be equal to the square of

34
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,930
the hypotenuse, so the square
of the longer side.

35
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,930
So we get w squared,
this side squared.

36
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:41,640
plus 7 squared, this other side
squared, is going to be

37
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,790
equal to the hypotenuse
squared,

38
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:47,890
square root of 74 squared.

39
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:54,912
And then we get w squared plus
49 is equal to the square root

40
00:01:54,912 --> 00:01:56,600
of 74 squared.

41
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,415
Well, that's just
going to be 74.

42
00:01:58,415 --> 00:02:00,880
It is equal to 74.

43
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,930
We can subtract 49 from both
sides of this equation.

44
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,790
So we have just a w squared
on the left-hand side.

45
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,940
Subtract 49 from both sides.

46
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,470
The left side-- these guys are
going to cancel out, we're

47
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,800
just going to be left with a w
squared --is equal to-- What's

48
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,900
74 minus 49?

49
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,270
74 minus 49, well, we can do a
little bit of regrouping or

50
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,140
borrowing here, if we don't
want to do it in our head.

51
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,250
We can make this a 14.

52
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,810
This becomes a 6.

53
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,640
14 minus 9 is 5.

54
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,850
6 minus 4 is 2.

55
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,070
And we have w squared
is equal to 25.

56
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,810
So w is going to be equal to
the square root of 25, the

57
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,260
positive square root.

58
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,200
So let's take the square root
of both sides, the positive

59
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:49,870
square root, and we will
get w is equal to 5.

60
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,210
Because we obviously we don't
want it to be negative 5.

61
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,130
That wouldn't be a realistic
distance.

62
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,330
So the width of the
carpet is 5.

63
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,820
And we're done.

64
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,400
