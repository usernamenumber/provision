1
00:00:03,135 --> 00:00:06,734
We define the equation of the plane containing the straight line that goes the equation, right over here

2
00:00:06,734 --> 00:00:16,000
and this plane has to be perpendicular to the plane containing the straight lines x/3 = y/4 = z/2 and

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,223
also it has the line x/4 = y/2 = z/3.

4
00:00:21,223 --> 00:00:30,667
Now just to visualize this properly, let me draw the planes. So the first plane in question that we

5
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:37,407
defined the equation of, let me draw it, let me draw it like this.

6
00:00:37,407 --> 00:00:42,133
I am going to try and do this problem using vector notations

7
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:45,467
because it is easier in my mind to manipulate vectors in a way that you can find

8
00:00:45,467 --> 00:00:49,400
perpendicular vectors and equations of planes...There's other ways that you can do this problem.

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,467
SO we define the equation of this plane right here.

10
00:00:52,467 --> 00:01:01,333
Now we know this plane contains this line and this line, if we look over here, contains this point (0,0,0)

11
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:09,219
If x, y and z all equal to 0 then all sides of this equation are zero. So it contains

12
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:15,813
the point (0,0,0) or you can view it as if it contains the position vector (0,0,0)

13
00:01:15,813 --> 00:01:23,011
and it also contains the point (2,3,4) because if x=2, y=3 and z=4

14
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:24,800
then all of these are going to be equal to 1.

15
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:34,482
So it also contains the point where the position vector, we can say, (2,3,4)

16
00:01:34,482 --> 00:01:40,067
So if we wanted to draw this line, 2 points specify the line so this line would look

17
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:48,298
like that. But if wanted to look at a vector that this plane contains, it would be the vector

18
00:01:48,298 --> 00:01:55,728
that goes from (0,0,0,) to (2,3,4) which really is the position vector (2,3,4)

19
00:01:55,728 --> 00:01:59,333
and I am gonna write it in the (i,j,k) notation just to make it clear that this is a vector.

20
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:13,143
So this vector that lies in the plane in question is the vector 2i +3j + 4k, i just wrote it

21
00:02:13,143 --> 00:02:17,867
in the unit vector notation and will call this the vector a. Vector a is equal to that

22
00:02:17,867 --> 00:02:24,219
and I will write a over here. Now we need to figure out the equation of this line

23
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:33,554
and the best way to do it, is if I can find another vector in this plane

24
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:39,312
then I can find a normal vector in this plane and then using a normal vector

25
00:02:39,312 --> 00:02:42,400
and some arbitrary other vector in this plane, I can then figure out the equation of this line

26
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,800
because the normal vector dotted that arbitrary other vector has to be equal to zero.

27
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,267
Now if none of that makes sense, maybe as we go through this problem, it will make more sense.

28
00:02:53,267 --> 00:03:01,557
Now what I am gonna do is use these other vectors that are implicitly defined by these lines to

29
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:07,733
figure out another vector in this plane over here. So let me draw

30
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:13,733
what I am talking about. So let me draw this other plane and I will draw it in white. And this other

31
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:18,867
plane also contains (0,0,0). Actually both of these lines contain (0,0,0).

32
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:26,611
So let me draw it over here. I think what I just said, if I do step by step

33
00:03:26,611 --> 00:03:33,229
it will make a lot more sense. So the other plane, that one comes vertically over this plane and it

34
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:40,334
goes vertically below as well. And we see here that the plane that contains these two lines

35
00:03:40,334 --> 00:03:47,067
is perpendicular to this, they are perpendicular to each other. Now this blue line over here contains

36
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:53,467
the point (0,0,0) and the point (3,4,2), same logic that we took to get to this point over here.

37
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:57,800
If this is (3,4,2) they all equal 1, the equality holds.

38
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:03,733
So let me just draw some arbitrary place, so (3,4,2). Now let me be clear,

39
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:09,533
we havent even defined the coordinate axes, we do not really know what angle we are looking at it from,

40
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:11,600
this is only for visualization purposes. So this line right over here,

41
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,400
I can draw will look something like this. It would look something like that.

42
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,410
It sits on that white plane. Let me do the same thing for this magenta line.

43
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:28,400
The magenta line also contains the point (0,0,0) but it also contains the point (4,2,3)

44
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,071
SO let me just draw it over here.

45
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:36,550
SO, (4,2,3), so that's the magenta line.

46
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:44,133
You wouldn't even see it if this was transparent, it would just keep going down like that.

47
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:47,200
Now, I am gonna try to explain how I am gonna tackle this problem again.

48
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:53,533
I am going to use vectors to find, that are implicitly defined by this blue line and this magenta line.

49
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:59,200
I am gonna take a cross product of those two vectors to find a vector that is normal to this entire

50
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,600
white plane and that vector has to sit in this perpendicular plane, and then I can

51
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:10,637
use that vector and vector a to figure out a normal vector for this plane and then I will be able to

52
00:05:10,637 --> 00:05:13,144
figure out the equation of this plane.

53
00:05:13,144 --> 00:05:16,867
So let me just do it. So what's a vector?

54
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:19,808
What are the two vectors that sit in this white plane? Well the point (0,0,0)

55
00:05:19,808 --> 00:05:24,545
the position vector (0,0,0) and the position vector (4,2,3) is in this plane

56
00:05:24,545 --> 00:05:41,542
so the vector p = 4i + 2j + 3k is also in this white plane.

57
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:48,648
I am really just subtracting this position vector from that position vector to get this

58
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:51,200
position vector, which clearly sits in this plane.

59
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,067
This vector starts from origin, goes to (4,2,3), this plane contains the origin

60
00:05:55,067 --> 00:06:02,138
is clearly sitting in this plane, and by that same logic, I can figure out a vector, actually the position

61
00:06:02,138 --> 00:06:13,733
vector itself that sits on this plane. I will call that c= 3i + 4j +2k. The

62
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:15,815
fact that everything is at the origin kinda simplifies everything.

63
00:06:15,815 --> 00:06:18,733
The position vectors themselves sit on the plane.

64
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:24,197
If this wasnt sitting on the origin, we wouldn't have been able to do that.

65
00:06:24,197 --> 00:06:26,933
We would have had to subtract between these two vectors or between two other points

66
00:06:26,933 --> 00:06:32,719
to actually get vectors on this plane. But with that out of the way, I could take the cross

67
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:47,557
product of b and c and that will give us some vector that is perpendicular to both b and c

68
00:06:47,557 --> 00:06:52,333
which means it is perpendicular or it is normal to this entire white plane

69
00:06:52,333 --> 00:07:00,560
which means it must sit in this yellow plane. So I am gonna find a normal vector in the yellow plane,

70
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,333
just like that.

71
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:11,067
Lets call that vector d. SO the cross product of b and c is just, this is how I remember it.

72
00:07:11,067 --> 00:07:18,200
the determinant, you take i, j, k, it has been discussed in a lot more depth in linear algebra.

73
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:27,216
playlist. The determinant of that. The next row is the determinant of vector b so it 4, 2 and 3. And

74
00:07:27,216 --> 00:07:33,555
then the next row is that of vector c, so it is 3,4 and 2

75
00:07:33,555 --> 00:07:42,936
and so this is going to be equal to, let's think about that.

76
00:07:42,936 --> 00:07:49,043
So for i, cross out that column and that row. SO its 2 times 2 minus 3 times 4

77
00:07:49,043 --> 00:08:00,200
SO that's 4 minus 12. So its -8i minus, remember we have to swap signs, plus-minus-plus

78
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,884
when you are taking the determinant.

79
00:08:01,884 --> 00:08:11,467
So you ignore the j, so its 4 times 2 = 8 minus 3 times 3 which is -1.

80
00:08:11,467 --> 00:08:21,333
So this would be a -1 here but there is already a negative here so its a +1j.

81
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,933
And then finally the k, you cross out that column.

82
00:08:24,933 --> 00:08:39,067
4 times 4 is 16. 16 -6 =10. So plus 10. Let me be sure I got that correct.

83
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:46,814
So the first one, I always have to make sure, so i I got yup, 4-12 = -8 and negative j ...

84
00:08:46,814 --> 00:08:53,548
4 times 2 is 8 minus 9 = -1 but j has a negative so that's right.

85
00:08:53,548 --> 00:09:04,333
And then k, 4 times 4 is 16. 16 -6 = 10. So that looks right. So plus...plus 10k.

86
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:07,294
So this vector right here is the vector d.

87
00:09:07,294 --> 00:09:14,144
I just figured it out. Now if we take the cross product of d with vector a

88
00:09:14,144 --> 00:09:19,647
the vector that was....you can kinda view it as lying along this line over here, then we will

89
00:09:19,647 --> 00:09:23,333
get a vector that is normal to this plane.

90
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:33,301
We can call that vector n, for normal, that is normal to this yellow plane

91
00:09:33,301 --> 00:09:36,064
that will actually sit on this white plane.

92
00:09:36,064 --> 00:09:39,800
So lets figure it out, we will see in a few steps, probably in the next video why is that

93
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:48,649
actually useful. So lets take, lets find what is d cross a...

94
00:09:48,649 --> 00:10:06,800
this is equal to our normal vector which is = same thing. i..j...k. We are gonna take d

95
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:17,133
which is -8, 1, 10 and take the cross of that and vector a which is 2,3,4.

96
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:23,967
and we will get, actually, I will continue this in the next video so that I do not make these videos

97
00:10:23,967 --> 99:59:59,999
too long.
