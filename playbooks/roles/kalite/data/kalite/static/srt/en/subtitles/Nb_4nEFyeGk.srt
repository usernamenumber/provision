1
00:00:04,554 --> 00:00:10,355
We're at the Musee d'Orsay,
in front of Manet's famous painting,

2
00:00:10,355 --> 00:00:13,326
"Le dejeuner sur l'herbe,"
or "Luncheon on the Grass,"

3
00:00:13,326 --> 00:00:17,909
which was exhibited 
at the Salon des Refuses in 1863.

4
00:00:17,909 --> 00:00:21,759
It was exhibited there
because the painting was rejected

5
00:00:21,759 --> 00:00:25,110
when the artist submitted it
to the traditional salon.

6
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,443
In fact, that year there were so many artists
who were rejected

7
00:00:28,443 --> 00:00:33,976
that Napoleon III opened something called
the "Salon des Refuses,"

8
00:00:33,976 --> 00:00:37,860
or the salon of refused or rejected works.

9
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:44,398
And this work was the focal point
of the Salon des Refuses for the critics.

10
00:00:44,398 --> 00:00:47,933
This is a painting that is very much
a kind of taunt.

11
00:00:47,933 --> 00:00:52,182
And very much, I think, an attempt to
break as many rules as the artist can.

12
00:00:52,182 --> 00:00:55,565
It breaks formal rules.
It breaks compositional rules.

13
00:00:55,565 --> 00:00:58,200
It breaks rules of subject.

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,681
The composition was borrowed
from a print after Raphael.

15
00:01:02,681 --> 00:01:05,649
There was a tapestry by Raphael
that was lost.

16
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:09,015
So the composition is borrowed
from a traditional source.

17
00:01:09,015 --> 00:01:14,265
And the subject matter, nude women
with clothed men, in an idyllic landscape,

18
00:01:14,265 --> 00:01:18,949
is borrowed from a painting
by Giorgione in the Louvre.

19
00:01:18,949 --> 00:01:21,849
The problem is that this
is not a Venus.

20
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:24,149
The problem is this is not
a classical context.

21
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:26,666
The problem is this
is modern France,

22
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:29,263
perhaps a park,
perhaps the Bois de Boulogne.

23
00:01:29,263 --> 00:01:32,968
Not only is she not a goddess,
but she is a specific person.

24
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:39,046
Manet's model, Victorine Meurent, 
and she looks very much like a real person

25
00:01:39,046 --> 00:01:41,863
that you would see walking down
the streets of Paris fully clothed.

26
00:01:41,863 --> 00:01:44,295
And worse, she's looking at us.

27
00:01:44,295 --> 00:01:50,552
That is to say, that she is not even in a sense
giving us the sort of opportunity to gaze on her

28
00:01:50,552 --> 00:01:52,136
with a kind of coyness.

29
00:01:52,136 --> 00:01:55,069
But she is actually confronting
us directly.

30
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:59,735
The men who she sits with who are fully clothed
don't look at her and don't look at us at all.

31
00:01:59,735 --> 00:02:06,435
So there is this assumption of sexuality,
but in a non-classicizing manner,

32
00:02:06,435 --> 00:02:09,420
and yet at the same time 
it's so matter of fact

33
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,552
that it feels totally desexualized.

34
00:02:11,552 --> 00:02:14,319
On the other hand there are all these clues
about sensuality and sexuality.

35
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:21,032
We have in the lower left a very
sensual still life of fruit and bread

36
00:02:21,032 --> 00:02:23,530
and a flask with some alcoholic beverage in it.

37
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:28,630
And that lies on top of the clothing
that she's discarded.

38
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,430
The original title of this painting was
"The Bath."

39
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:36,280
So she's not a nymph that lives in 
a mythological forest who's always naked.

40
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,680
But she's a modern woman who's
taken off her dress.

41
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,247
She's not nude.
She's naked.

42
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:43,697
This painting is breaking lots of rules
when it comes to subject.

43
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:49,197
But it is also breaking lots of rules when it comes
to the way in which the painting was actually made.

44
00:02:49,197 --> 00:02:56,613
If you look at the very bright flesh of the female figure,
she is so bright and so heavily outlined,

45
00:02:56,613 --> 00:02:58,330
and I shouldn't say outlined.

46
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,213
But she is surrounded by darker tones.

47
00:03:01,213 --> 00:03:04,330
So that she actually seems 
somewhat flattened, doesn't she?

48
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:09,397
And the internal modulation of tone that you
would expect to see in a 19th century painting

49
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:10,830
of this sort is absent.

50
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:15,370
So that some might have looked at this and seen her
almost as a kind of two-dimensional cutout.

51
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,286
And worse than that, there are other ways in which Manet is in a sense breaking the rules

52
00:03:20,286 --> 00:03:23,303
that one followed at that point 
to create naturalism.

53
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:29,003
For instance, look at the way the ribbon in her hair
which is so dark, and the darkness of the hair itself,

54
00:03:29,003 --> 00:03:33,670
mesh with the darkness of the bush that is 
many feet in back of her

55
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,020
and kind of collapse that space.

56
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:40,170
We really have no sense of the distance 
between the figure we see in the background

57
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,353
who is emerging from the water.

58
00:03:42,353 --> 00:03:43,338
The other female figure.

59
00:03:43,338 --> 00:03:45,237
She almost seems too large.

60
00:03:45,237 --> 00:03:48,487
Well, especially since her hands,
which are so small,

61
00:03:48,487 --> 00:03:53,204
because of the distance, seems to
actually be reaching down to the man's thumb.

62
00:03:53,204 --> 00:03:55,487
And there is this terrible kind of disjunction.

63
00:03:55,487 --> 00:03:57,238
Right, a kind of collapsing of space.

64
00:03:57,238 --> 00:04:01,709
Yeah, and scale, and in a sense,
of the rules of illusionism

65
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:04,597
that Manet seems to be inviting
the destruction of.

66
00:04:04,597 --> 00:04:09,996
He seems to be sort of willfully and playfully
undermining the very rules of the academy.

67
00:04:09,996 --> 00:04:15,563
And at the same time, there is all
of this pleasure that one senses in paint,

68
00:04:15,563 --> 00:04:20,096
in applying paint in this kind
of very loose brushwork

69
00:04:20,096 --> 00:04:24,779
that is very sensual,
especially the blue of her clothing

70
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:28,328
and the still life or the gray
pants and white pants

71
00:04:28,328 --> 00:04:29,946
worn by the male figures.

72
00:04:29,946 --> 00:04:33,013
Manet had been looking at people
like Velazquez and others

73
00:04:33,013 --> 00:04:38,960
where the brush becomes critically important
and he's very interested clearly in us

74
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,213
not only seeing what is being depicted,
but seeing the means by which it was depicted.

75
00:04:44,213 --> 00:04:49,246
Seeing the paint itself refusing to give us
that perfect illusion that had been really

76
00:04:49,246 --> 00:04:52,847
the foundation of western painting
since the time of the Renaissance.

77
00:04:52,847 --> 00:04:57,328
The other thing that is so odd about it, right,
is you have all of this loose Velazquez

78
00:04:57,328 --> 00:04:59,686
handling of paint,

79
00:04:59,686 --> 00:05:02,153
but then you move into the background
and you get paint that seems like

80
00:05:02,153 --> 00:05:08,751
it's been very diluted and applied in a way
that's very much like a wash or a stain,

81
00:05:08,751 --> 00:05:14,302
especially where the trees and field 
behind that female figure.

82
00:05:14,302 --> 00:05:17,352
And then on the other hand there is clumps
of paint in the trees.

83
00:05:17,352 --> 00:05:21,621
So there is all these kinds of different
handling of the paint itself.

84
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:28,138
It is, in a sense, a dismantling of the
expectations of art at this moment.

85
00:05:28,138 --> 00:05:32,706
And it's reminding me of Baudelaire's
talking about the painting of modern life

86
00:05:32,706 --> 00:05:35,073
and the painting of the modern nude.

87
00:05:35,073 --> 00:05:36,840
Let's forget about Venuses.

88
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,540
We don't live in Ancient Greece.

89
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,340
Let's paint life today.

90
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,657
Where does one find the female nude?

91
00:05:43,657 --> 00:05:47,371
Well, sort of Manet made up a theme
for modern female nudes.

92
00:05:47,371 --> 00:05:52,739
But in a sense it sort of underscores the absurdity
of the classical tradition,

93
00:05:52,739 --> 00:05:56,855
of the way in which we have clothed the nude
in those traditions to make it acceptable.

94
00:05:56,855 --> 00:06:00,823
Manet is saying, does this make sense?

95
00:06:00,823 --> 00:06:05,590
The illogic of this painting, and the way
in which it sort of pushes at social norms

96
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:10,506
is also underscoring the way in which the art
that we so readily accept from this period

97
00:06:10,506 --> 00:06:11,855
makes no sense.

98
00:06:11,855 --> 00:06:17,105
Exactly.
