1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,943
I want to add one super fast addendum

2
00:00:02,943 --> 00:00:05,340
to the video on Friedel-Crafts acylation.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,831
In the last step of the mechanism,

4
00:00:06,831 --> 00:00:09,750
I had this chlorine swipe the electron,

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,203
or essentially that electron that was with the aluminum.

6
00:00:12,203 --> 00:00:14,513
It was given to the hydrogen proton.

7
00:00:14,513 --> 00:00:16,040
So the hydrogen was nabbed away.

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,350
Its electron was allowed to go back into the benzene ring.

9
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,320
So the aluminum lost a chlorine.

10
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,350
This benzene ring lost a proton.

11
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,320
It was able to take back that electron.

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,330
And I forgot to draw the hydrogen and the chlorine.

13
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,619
So then that results in hydrogen chloride.

14
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:35,609
So you have the hydrogen proton bonded.

15
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:39,787
It took this electron from the aluminum.

16
00:00:39,787 --> 00:00:41,740
And it is bonded to the chlorine.

17
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,320
I didn't want to forget that in that last step

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,820
of the Friedel-Crafts acylation.

19
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,153
We also get some hydrogen chloride.
