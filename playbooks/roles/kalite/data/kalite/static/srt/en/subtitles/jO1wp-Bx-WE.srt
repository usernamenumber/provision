99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This sculpture's not usaully up, but it's a great Hesse

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's wonderfully awful

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What do you mean by wonderfully awful?

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, now

99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999

perfection in the physical world that represepented a kind of

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
