1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,970
We're asked to prove that if the orthocenter and centroid

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,350
Of a given triangle are the same point

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,580
Then the triangle is equilateral

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,790
So I have a triangle over here and we're going to assume

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,110
That its orthocenter and its centroid are the same point

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,510
And just so to review the orthocenter is the point where

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,750
The three altitude of a triangle intersect

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,020
And the centroid is the point where the three medians

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,740
So we can do it is we could assume

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,940
these three lines right over here

11
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,520
that these are both altitude and median

12
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,660
And that this point right over here

13
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,190
is both the orthocenter and the centroid

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,830
So if we assume that these lines are altitudes

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,540
And that tells us that they are perpendicular to the opposite sides

16
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,040
So that is a 90 degree angles those are both 90 degree angles

17
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,500
These are both 90 degree angles

18
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,280
These are both 90 degree angles

19
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,530
And the fact that it's a centroid means

20
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,940
That each of these lines bisect the opposite side

21
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:55,120
So it tells us that this length is equal to length

22
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,250
That this length let me just use a different color

23
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,530
This length is equal to that length

24
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:06,280
And it tells us that this length this length is equal to that length

25
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,740
And you might also say

26
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:11,170
Well gee each of these line are also then the perpendicular

27
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,530
Bisectors of each of the sides

28
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,140
So not only is this the orthocenter in the centroid

29
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,340
It is also the circumcenter of this triangle right over here

30
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,210
For that out of the way we kind of

31
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,430
Marked up everything that we can assume given that

32
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,410
This is an orthrocenter and a center

33
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,060
Although the other things other properties of this

34
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,490
Especially centroids that we know

35
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,490
But now let's prove that this has to be an equilateral triangle

36
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,930
So the first thing that you might see

37
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,390
And let me label some letters here

38
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,420
So we can refer to things a little bit better

39
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:47,020
So let's call that A B C D E and F

40
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,680
And we could label in the centroid right over here G

41
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,520
So the first thing let's look at triangle AFG

42
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,040
And triangle this is E and triangle EFG

43
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:02,500
So let's compare triangle AF triangle AFG

44
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:09,570
Let's compare that to triangle EFG triangle EFG

45
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,740
So they definitely have one side

46
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:16,400
Side EF is congruent to side AF these are both the same

47
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,150
And we have angle EFG as the same as angle AFG

48
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,260
They're both 90 degrees

49
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,420
And then they both clearly share the side FG

50
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,460
They both share this side right over here

51
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,540
So they have a congruent side an angle

52
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,000
A corresponding angle in between in another congruent side

53
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,280
And they're all so congruent side congruent corresponding angle

54
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,380
And another congruent corresponding side

55
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,990
So by side angle side these two characters

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,650
Are going to be congruent by side angle side congruency

57
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,670
Now can you make the exact same argument

58
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,140
We can make the exact same argument to say

59
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,570
That all of these pairs that have the kind of share this

60
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,740
That both have these, these 90 degree angles next to each other

61
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,740
Are going to be congruent

62
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,340
Triangle we can by the same exact argument

63
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:09,210
We can see triangle EDG triangle EDG

64
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,530
Is going to be congruent to triangle CDG

65
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,700
Triangle CDG same exact thing side angle

66
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,980
And then we have a side right over here

67
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,240
And then we can use the exact same argument

68
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,640
For this one right over here triangle C looks like an A

69
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:33,760
Triangle CBG is congruent to triangle ABG

70
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,990
So that by itself is interesting

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,750
But we know that if two triangles are congruent

72
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,310
All of their corresponding sides and angles

73
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,180
Are going to be congruent

74
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,110
So for example if we know

75
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,930
That the measure of this angle is blue

76
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,050
The corresponding angle on this triangle

77
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,840
Is also going to have the same measure

78
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,760
I'll just make it with that same blue angle

79
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,800
And we know if this angle right over here is magenta

80
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,470
The corresponding angle on triangle AFG

81
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,230
Is also going to have that same measure

82
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,370
And I'll just mark it with that magenta again

83
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,030
Now we also know from our properties of vertical angles

84
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,050
That whatever an angle measure of AFG is

85
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,380
DGC is going to have the same measure

86
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,140
Because they are vertical angles

87
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,240
But we know whatever angle measure this is

88
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:21,100
This triangle, triangle CDG is congruent to triangle EDG

89
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,170
So corresponding angles have to be congruent

90
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,500
So this angle is this magenta measure

91
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,300
Then this angle also has to be the magenta measure

92
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,130
And then once again you can see vertical angles

93
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,230
That this is magenta then this is also gonna have

94
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,180
That same measure

95
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,530
And if this has a measure then

96
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,100
That is also going to have that same measure

97
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,950
So by using a little bit of argument of congruent triangles

98
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,200
Corresponding angles are going to be congruent

99
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,490
And vertical angles we can see that all of these inner angles

100
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,710
Right over here are gonna have to be the same measure

101
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,430
They're all and I'm using that with this little magenta arc

102
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,300
Right over there

103
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,950
Now all of these triangles if we split this triangle in two

104
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,210
They all have a 90 degree angle they all have a magenta arc

105
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,270
So whatever's left over is going to be

106
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,730
180 minus 90 minus magenta

107
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,590
Or it's really 90 minus this magenta angle right over here

108
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,240
And that's what this blue angle must be

109
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,310
This blue angle is essentially 90 minus the magenta angle

110
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,310
The blue angle is 90 minus the magenta angle

111
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,300
And so that blue angle must be the third angle for all of these

112
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,390
So once again this blue angle is going to be

113
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,850
90 minus magenta angle

114
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,430
Or a 180 minus magenta minus the 90

115
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,750
So that's gonna be the blue angle

116
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,420
If you, essentially what we're saying is

117
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,720
If you know two angles of a triangle

118
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,160
that forces with the other triangle

119
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,840
What the other triangle is going to be

120
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,940
We already know that all 6 of these triangles

121
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,150
Have two angles in common

122
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,950
The 90 degree angle and the magenta angle

123
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,470
So they all the third angle must be the same as well

124
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,680
And we're specifying that with this blue angle

125
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,450
This blue angle right over here

126
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,860
And now we see if we're to look at angle

127
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:48,030
If we we're to look at angle E EAC

128
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,950
So angle EAC we see that that's just two of these blue angles

129
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:59,380
That is congruent to angle ACE, ACE

130
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,920
Which just two of those blue angles

131
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:06,570
Which is congruent to angles CEA, angles CEA

132
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,290
Which is once again just two of those blue angles

133
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,780
So we have a triangle here where the three angles

134
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,070
In that triangle all are congruent

135
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,220
So it is an equilateral triangle

136
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,290
It is a 60 degree we've proven before

137
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,770
If all three of your angles are the same

138
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,320
The lengths of all three sides are the same as well
