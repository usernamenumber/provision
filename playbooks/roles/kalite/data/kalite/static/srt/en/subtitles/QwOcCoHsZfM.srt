1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,730
   

2
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,350
We're on problem 43.

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,440
Which statement describes
the graph of

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,330
the following equation?

5
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:17,710
They write x squared plus y
squared plus 4x minus 6y minus

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,250
3 is equal to 0.

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,330
Essentially you want to get
this into standard conic

8
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,800
square format-- I don't know
what it's officially called--

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,560
and you do that by completing
the square on both the x and

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,330
the y I guess you could call
it sub-polynomial.

11
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,240
Then you should be able
recognize what kind of conic

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,190
section it is.

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,660
So let's separate out the x
and the y terms. So the x

14
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:43,485
terms-- I'll do that in blue--
you get x squared plus 4x.

15
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:46,480
   

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,910
Then we're going to add
something that makes it a

17
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,000
perfect square.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,600
You can already guess what
we're going to add.

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,660
Let's say we're going to add 4,
because x squared plus 4x

20
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,310
plus 4 is x plus 2 squared.

21
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,320
So I'm going to write that in
magenta just so we remember

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,620
that we added it.

23
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,450
This came out of nowhere
right now.

24
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,350
So if I added plus 4 here,
I'm going to have to add

25
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,550
plus 4 on this side.

26
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,480
This is the equals sign.

27
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,760
All right, then let me do the
y terms. I'll do it in this

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,860
brown color.

29
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:18,490
Plus y squared minus 6y.

30
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:19,340
Then what would add here?

31
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,680
Half of minus 6 is mine 3.

32
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,380
Then if I were to square that,
minus 3 squared-- I'll do it

33
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:31,050
in this magenta color
again-- is plus 9.

34
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,900
So I want to add plus 9 to the
right-hand side as well.

35
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,410
   

36
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,920
Of course this is y minus 3
squared, this whole thing

37
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,150
right here.

38
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:46,080
Then I have that minus
3 right over here.

39
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,650
All right now let's rewrite
this term right here.

40
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,310
I added this plus 4 here for a
reason so that I could make

41
00:01:53,310 --> 00:02:00,690
this into x plus 2 squared, then
plus-- and I added this

42
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,640
plus 9 here for a reason,
so I could make

43
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,755
this y minus 3 squared.

44
00:02:05,755 --> 00:02:08,930
   

45
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,600
Let me just keep the minus
3 there for now.

46
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,280
Minus-- let me do it in the
other color-- minus 3 is equal

47
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,910
to 4 plus 9.

48
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,530
4 plus 9 is equal to 13.

49
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,570
Let's add the 3 to both sides
of that equation.

50
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:29,360
So you get x plus 2 squared
plus y minus 3 squared is

51
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,960
equal to 16.

52
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,720
Now if you think about it, this
is the form of a circle.

53
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,850
   

54
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:47,390
x minus a squared plus y minus
b squared is equal to r

55
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:51,550
squared, where the center of
the circle is at where?

56
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:55,360
Whatever the x-value is what
makes this equal to 0.

57
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,640
So it's x, it's minus 2.

58
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,810
Then the y-value of its center
is what makes this equal to 0.

59
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,830
Minus 2 comma 3, that's
its center.

60
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,580
It's radius is the square
root of 16.

61
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,310
So the radius is equal to 4.

62
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,480
It can't be negative 4.

63
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,720
You can't have a negative
radius.

64
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,530
So the answer is a circle with
radius at minus 2 comma

65
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,590
3 and radius 4.

66
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,770
That's choice D.

67
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,720
Problem 44.

68
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,390
What is the solution to
the equation 5 to the

69
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:33,230
x is equal to 17?

70
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:39,560
OK so that means that we if we
take the log base, so five to

71
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,010
the x power is equal to 17.

72
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,040
We could rewrite this
in log format.

73
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:52,960
That means that log base 5 of
seventeen is equal to x.

74
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,630
You could read this exactly the
same way you read that.

75
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,680
5 to the x is equal to 17.

76
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,810
Of course that's not one of
our choices, and this is

77
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,510
fairly useless on your
calculator because you don't

78
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,440
have a log base 5 button.

79
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,560
Let me write it this way, x is
equal to-- I'm just switching

80
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,260
it-- log base 5 of 17, just
because it's easier

81
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:19,600
for me to deal with.

82
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,025
I prove it in previous Khan
Academy logarithm videos, but

83
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:24,850
there's just a general
property.

84
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,060
I'll write the property here.

85
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:35,320
If x is equal to log base, I
don't know, base b of a, that

86
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:44,260
is equal to log base 10 of a,
lowercase a, divided by log

87
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,030
base 10 of b.

88
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,760
You just have to pick
the same base.

89
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,800
You could have the base, you
could have the natural log of

90
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,370
a divided by the natural
log of b.

91
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:55,510
You could do whatever log you
want, but log base 10 is on

92
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,030
your calculator.

93
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,840
So that's why this
is convenient.

94
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:05,090
So we could say this is equal
to the log base 10 of 17

95
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:10,290
divided by the log
base 10 of 5.

96
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,420
That should be a choice.

97
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,850
Yep, that's choice D.

98
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,440
   

99
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,690
Next question.

100
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:21,740
   

101
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,472
This problem 45.

102
00:05:23,472 --> 00:05:27,370
I'll write it down, 45.

103
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:34,450
They say if log base 10 of x is
equal to minus 2, what is

104
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,840
the value of x?

105
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,910
So that essentially --
10 to the minus 2

106
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,160
power is equal to x.

107
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:45,680
   

108
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,090
All a logarithm is, it tells you
what exponent do I have to

109
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,170
raise the base to to get
whatever I'm inputting into

110
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,250
the logarithm function.

111
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:58,000
Right So if I raise 10 to
the minus 2, I get x.

112
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,740
10 to the minus 2, that's 1 over
10 squared is equal to x,

113
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,380
which is 1 over 100
is equal to x.

114
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,630
That's choice C.

115
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,730
   

116
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:13,530
I think I could do problem
46 right here.

117
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,610
46.

118
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:23,820
Which equation is equivalent
to log base 3 of

119
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:31,140
1/9 is equal to x?

120
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:35,750
OK, read it the exact same
way we read question 45.

121
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,515
This is just saying that 3 to
the x power is equal to 1/9.

122
00:06:39,515 --> 00:06:40,910
Let's write that.

123
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:44,910
3 to the x power is
equal to 1/9.

124
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,370
Is that one of the choices?

125
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:46,810
Yeah.

126
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,060
That's choice C.

127
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,260
   

128
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,070
That was suspiciously
easy, I think.

129
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,426
You just have to know
the definition of

130
00:06:54,426 --> 00:06:56,080
what a logarithm is.

131
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,360
OK problem 47.

132
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,130
I'll clear the screen.

133
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,380
Let me switch colors.

134
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,470
   

135
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,350
47.

136
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,000
Oh I'll cut and paste this one
because this is interesting.

137
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,960
Let me pull it up a little bit
so you can definitely read it.

138
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,240
Because they want us to identify
an incorrect step.

139
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,270
   

140
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,520
OK let me go here.

141
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,250
   

142
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:28,110
OK they ask us, which is the
first incorrect step in

143
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,220
simplifying log base
4 of 4 over 64.

144
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:35,010
All right step 1, they said log
base 4 4/64 is equal to

145
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,330
log base 4 4 minus
log base 4 64.

146
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,690
That's right.

147
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,690
When you divide within the
logarithm function or when

148
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,290
you're inputting into the
logarithm function, that's

149
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:50,230
equivalent of taking the log of
the top one and subtracting

150
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:53,920
from that the log
of the bottom.

151
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,300
Actually when you divide two
numbers of the same base, you

152
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,920
subtract their exponents.

153
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,220
We've proved that in
previous videos.

154
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,410
But that's just good enough
that you need to know that

155
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:05,000
that's the correct
step right now.

156
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,460
So what's the log base 4 of 4?

157
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,030
4 to what power is equal to 4?

158
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:13,190
Yeah sure, that's equal to 1.

159
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,660
4 to what power is
equal to 64?

160
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,180
Let's see, 4 squared is 16.

161
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,060
4 to the 1 is equal to 4.

162
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,910
4 squared is equal to 16.

163
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:27,110
4 to the third is 4 times
16, which is 64.

164
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,350
So 4 to the third power is 64.

165
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,450
So this is 3.

166
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:40,620
So this should be-- let's see,
log of 4 minus 16-- right,

167
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,970
this should be a 3 here.

168
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,990
This should be a minus 3.

169
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,430
So this step 2 was the
first incorrect step.

170
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,070
They mis-evaluated
log base 4 of 64.

171
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,820
They through it was 16
for some reason.

172
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,840
I guess they divided 64 by 4.

173
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,615
But it's actually 4 to the third
power of 16, sorry, 4 to

174
00:08:57,615 --> 00:08:58,950
the third power of 64.

175
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,175
So the answer there is 3.

176
00:09:00,175 --> 00:09:02,960
So step 2 is the first
incorrect step.

177
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,170
   

178
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,420
Next question.

179
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:13,590
   

180
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,840
All right let me see.

181
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,270
   

182
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:22,365
All right, clear image,
invert colors.

183
00:09:22,365 --> 00:09:24,920
   

184
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,300
Let me copy and paste this
one too because this is

185
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,040
interesting.

186
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,570
I'll try to copy and paste
as many of the

187
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,820
word problems as possible.

188
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,650
   

189
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,430
This is problem 48.

190
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,390
Let me write that down
in the corner.

191
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,770
48, right in that corner.

192
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,920
Jeremy, Michael, Shanan, and
Brenda each worked the same

193
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,180
math problem of the
chalkboard.

194
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,970
Each student's work
is shown below.

195
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,460
Their teacher said that while
two of them had the correct

196
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,210
answer, only one of them had
arrived at the correct

197
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,560
conclusion using
correct steps.

198
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,640
OK they want to which is the
completely correct solution.

199
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,100
OK let me just copy
and paste those.

200
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:09,500
So the completely correct
solution, OK so let's just

201
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,410
think about what everyone
did here.

202
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,690
It looks like this is it
dealing with exponents.

203
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,840
All right he had x to third
times x to the minus 7.

204
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,050
OK this is already wrong.

205
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:24,610
Because x to the minus 7
is 1 over x to the 7.

206
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:25,880
This is one over x to the 7.

207
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,760
So this should be a
plus right here.

208
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,920
So he's wrong.

209
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,960
OK Shanan, x to the third
times x to the minus 7.

210
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,830
Yep that equals x to the third
over x to the positive 7.

211
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:41,000
Then let's see, 1
over x to the 4.

212
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,940
That is right, right?

213
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,380
Because this is equal to
x to the 3 minus 7.

214
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,420
So that's x to the minus 4.

215
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,800
x to the minus 4 is
1 over x to the 4.

216
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,470
So as far as I can tell,
Shanan's work

217
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,730
looks pretty good.

218
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,020
Although this was a little weird
how she went straight to

219
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,740
1 over x to the 4.

220
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,310
She may just skipped a step.

221
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,090
Michael's work, x to the
over x to the minus 7.

222
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,165
OK, he made the same
mistake as Jeremy.

223
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,710
X to the minus 7 when you put it
in the denominator becomes

224
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,460
x to the positive 7.

225
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,790
Not right.

226
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:15,560
Then Brenda's work got
this step right.

227
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,150
But then this should be
x to the minus 4, x

228
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,960
to the minus 4 power.

229
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,140
So this is not correct.

230
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,320
So the only person who got
it right was Shanan.

231
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,920
What choices is that?

232
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,970
Shanan is choice C.

233
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,510
   

234
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,045
Out of time.

235
00:11:33,045 --> 00:11:35,240
See you in the next video.

236
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:35,900
