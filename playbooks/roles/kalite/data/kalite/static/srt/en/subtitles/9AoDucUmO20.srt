1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710
   

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,400
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:04,330
Well, in the last video we
took the Maclaurin series for

4
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,650
cosine of x, the Maclaurin
series representation.

5
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,660
So I guess we might as well
do the same for sine of x.

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,270
And I'm sounding very
nonchalant, but I have a reason

7
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,520
behind why I'm doing this, and
you'll see in a few videos from

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,760
now, when we come up with
the grand conclusion.

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,540
So anyway, let's
just set up f of x.

10
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,660
And you might just want to do
this yourself instead of

11
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,100
watching me do it, because it
should be pretty

12
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,870
self-explanatory now that you
saw cosine of x.

13
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,340
And then you could
check your work.

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,290
You can pause right now, and
then you can check to see

15
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,260
that we got the same answer.

16
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,670
You'll probably be right
and I probably made

17
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:40,980
a careless mistake.

18
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,650
So f of x is equal
to sine of x.

19
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:43,710
First of all, let's just
figure out all of the

20
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,610
derivatives of sine of x.

21
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,640
We can already guess that it
probably cycles similar to

22
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,350
cosine of x, with
slight variation.

23
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,340
So what's the derivative
of sine of x?

24
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,220
Well, that's just cosine of x.

25
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,670
What's the second derivative?

26
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,160
I'm just going to stop
putting parentheses

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,778
around these numbers.

28
00:01:02,778 --> 00:01:05,490
The second derivative, well,
that's just derivative of that.

29
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:08,770
It's minus sine of x.

30
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,430
The third derivative of x.

31
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,930
Well, I guess I'll put the
parentheses so you don't think

32
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,250
it's f to the third times x.

33
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,090
The third derivative, well,
that's just going to be the

34
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,620
minus cosine, rightu0008?

35
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,570
Because the derivative of sine
is cosine, but then we have

36
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,700
that minus sine there.

37
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,440
And the fourth derivative.

38
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,640
The derivative of cosine is
minus sine, but we have a minus

39
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,620
there, so we get back to sine.

40
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,670
And then the cycle continues.

41
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:40,100
So the fifth derivative is just
going to be cosine of x, or

42
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,610
just the derivative
of the sine of x.

43
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,120
And then the cycle
continues, right?

44
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,550
All right.

45
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,740
So we know the derivatives,
and we can just keep going.

46
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,700
So let's evaluate the
derivatives of our function

47
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,360
of sine of x at x equals 0.

48
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,095
f of 0.

49
00:01:55,095 --> 00:01:57,610
   

50
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:58,790
Well, that's sine of zero.

51
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,740
What's sine of 0?

52
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,630
Well, sine of 0 is 0.

53
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:08,390
f prime of 0 is equal
to cosine of 0.

54
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,150
That's equal to 1.

55
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:12,160
   

56
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,380
The second derivative at 0,
that's minus sine of 0.

57
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,440
Well, sine of 0 is still 0.

58
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,230
So that's 0.

59
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,505
You can see it's a very similar
pattern to what we saw in the

60
00:02:20,505 --> 00:02:23,390
Maclaurin series
for cosine of x.

61
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:28,040
And then the third
derivative evaluated at 0.

62
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,120
That's cosine of 0 is 1.

63
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,410
But we have a minus sine,
so that's minus 1.

64
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,210
This you already know.

65
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,490
The fourth derivative is 0.

66
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,660
Sine of 0 is 0.

67
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,470
And then it starts
to cycle again.

68
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,410
The fifth derivative,
0 equal to 1.

69
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,540
So we start with 0, then
positive 1, then 0, then minus

70
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,800
1, then 0, then positive 1.

71
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,980
Every other number is a 0.

72
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,090
Every other, I guess you could
say, coefficient in the

73
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,500
Maclaurin series is a 0.

74
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,000
The coefficient when you don't
include the factorial term.

75
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,660
And then the ones in between
oscillate between positive

76
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,790
1 and negative 1.

77
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,990
So what would be the Maclaurin
series for sine of x?

78
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,900
The Maclaurin series
representation?

79
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,850
So we could say that sine of x
-- And remember, I haven't

80
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,170
proven to you that the
Maclaurin series representation

81
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:17,020
of sine of x or cosine of x or
e to the x really is equal to

82
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,270
those functions over
the entire domain.

83
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,480
I might do that later.

84
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,510
Frankly, I've been thinking
about the proof myself.

85
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,580
It hasn't been completely
intuitive how to do that proof.

86
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,680
Although if you test them
out, it does seem to

87
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,500
make a lot of sense.

88
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,190
But you shouldn't just
take my word for it.

89
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,870
I'm going to look up the
proof and I will prove

90
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,240
it to you, eventually.

91
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,650
But for now, you just have to
take it as a bit of a leap of

92
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,410
faith that the Maclaurin series
representations just don't

93
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,840
approximate those functions
around 0, that when you take

94
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,770
the infinite series, it
actually equals the function.

95
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:48,770
So sine of x.

96
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,490
The Maclaurin series
representation is going to be

97
00:03:52,490 --> 00:04:01,510
equal to -- well, f of 0,
that's 0 plus f of -- so the

98
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:08,340
first derivative, it's going to
be 1 times x to the 1 over 1

99
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,620
factorial, which is just 1.

100
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,680
This is just 1.

101
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,540
And then we have -- this is
just plus 0 -- and then we have

102
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,250
minus -- and now this is the
third derivative -- so, minus 1

103
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:26,530
times x to the third
over 3 factorial.

104
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,150
And then you have a 0.

105
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,440
Then we have a plus 1.

106
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,640
And this is now the fifth
derivative, so x to the

107
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,430
fifth over five factorial.

108
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,770
And we'll just keep going, but
I think you see the pattern

109
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,080
as we write and rewrite it.

110
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:46,530
Sine of x is equal to 0, so we
get x to the first, so that's

111
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:57,850
just x minus x to the third
over 3 factorial plus x to

112
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,330
the fifth over 5 factorial.

113
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,650
And then you can
imagine the pattern.

114
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,320
We'd go minus -- we're just
taking the odd numbers -- x to

115
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:11,140
the seventh over 7 factorial
plus x to the ninth over 9

116
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:16,930
factorial minus x to the
eleventh over 11 factorial,

117
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,220
and we'll just keep going.

118
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:26,500
And so we'll just keep
oscillating in sine -- that's

119
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,360
a bit of a pun -- and we use
all of the odd exponents.

120
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,272
So if I were to write that in
sigma notation, and sigma

121
00:05:33,272 --> 00:05:36,080
notation often is
the hard part.

122
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,360
Well once again, the first
term, when the term is 0 --

123
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,990
this is the first term, right
-- we get a positive sine.

124
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,730
   

125
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:48,710
Because we're going to
oscillate in sine, we're

126
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,430
probably going to take
negative 1 to some power.

127
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:56,180
It'll be negative 1
to the n plus 1.

128
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,780
So let's see if that works.

129
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:03,760
If this is the first term,
this will be a -- no,

130
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,670
no, no, that won't work.

131
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,030
It'll be to the 2n plus 1.

132
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,810
Actually, I think I should
have done that in the

133
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:10,980
previous video, too.

134
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,190
I think it should have been
negative 1 to the 2n,

135
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,090
not negative 1 to the n.

136
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,420
I'm sorry for that mistake.

137
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:30,090
So it's negative 1 to the 2n
plus 1 times x to the 2n.

138
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,010
Oh, no, no, sorry, I was
right in the previous video.

139
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:35,000
See, I'm confusing
myself, because I don't

140
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,815
count the 0 terms.

141
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:41,000
It would probably help me to
write the sigma down first.

142
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,800
So this is equal to -- as you
can see I do all of this in

143
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:52,010
real time -- infinity
from n is equal to 0.

144
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,490
And so, the first term is
positive, so it'll be

145
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,100
negative 1 to the n, right?

146
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,690
Because negative 1 to the
0 power is 1, right?

147
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,660
So that's positive and then the
second term is negative, then

148
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,080
positive, negative, right?

149
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:14,620
And so, the zeroth term is x,
so it has to be x to the --

150
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,480
let me see -- 2n plus 1.

151
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,080
Does that work?

152
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,300
Right, because the first
term would then be 3.

153
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:31,120
Right. x to the 2n plus 1
over 2n plus 1 factorial.

154
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,050
It's almost easier when you
just write it out like that.

155
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,205
Well, that's pretty
interesting.

156
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,180
But what's even more
interesting is if you see the

157
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,830
similarity between the
Maclaurin series representation

158
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,590
for sine of x, and then the
representation we figured

159
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:48,650
out for cosine of x in
the previous video.

160
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:55,780
We figured out that cosine of x
is equal to 1 minus x squared

161
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:03,930
over 2 factorial plus x to the
fourth over 4 factorial minus x

162
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:12,310
to the sixth over six factorial
plus x to the eighth

163
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,790
over 8 factorial.

164
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:17,030
So they're almost the
opposite, right?

165
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,430
They almost complement
each other.

166
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:22,410
The cosine, these are all of
the even exponents, right?

167
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,870
And even factorials.

168
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,590
And sine is all of the odd
exponents, because this

169
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,350
is x to the 0, right?

170
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,640
So that's why you get 1 here.

171
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,540
And in sine, it's all of the
odd exponents and all of the

172
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,660
odd factorials in
the denominator.

173
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:40,080
So that by itself, I
think, is pretty neat.

174
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,240
What is especially neat, just
another fodder for thought, is

175
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,410
that we know from trigonometry
that sine is just a shifted

176
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,870
cosine function or that cosine
is just a shifted

177
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,040
sine function.

178
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,310
But what's neat is by shifting
it by pi over 2 -- which is all

179
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,560
they are, right, if you were to
graph it, they're just shifted

180
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,980
90 degrees to the left or the
right of each other -- you can

181
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,490
actually represent them
differently by essentially

182
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:13,160
picking the odd or even terms
of this factorial polynomial

183
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,600
series, whatever you
want to call it.

184
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,440
But anyway.

185
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,900
Doesn't matter if you didn't
understand what I said at

186
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,600
the end, as long as you
appreciate how cool this is.

187
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,030
I will see you in
the next video.

188
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,900
