1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,560
   

2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,520
Let's think about what might
happen if we had a molecule of

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,010
butanoyl chloride.

4
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:09,170
So one, two, three,
four carbons.

5
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,190
That's where the but-
comes in, and then

6
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,180
it's a butanoyl chloride.

7
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,015
So it's an acyl halide or
it's an acyl chloride.

8
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:17,710
Let me write this down
just to give us some

9
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,780
practice with namings.

10
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:24,260
This is butanoyl chloride.

11
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,810
We saw a couple of videos ago
that acyl halides, you just

12
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,130
count the main number
of carbons.

13
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,020
One, two, three, four carbons.

14
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,410
That's where butan-
comes from.

15
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,880
And then this is an acyl
chloride, so the acyl chloride

16
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,770
part, this part, gives
us the -oyl.

17
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,590
Or I guess you could look
at even the carbonyl.

18
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,190
We could even say this whole
part over here, we know it's a

19
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,790
carboxylic acid derivative.

20
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,690
It's in an acyl chloride.

21
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,340
So that's why we have the -oyl
here and the chloride.

22
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,420
So let's think about what would
happen if we have a

23
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,020
molecule of butanoyl chloride or
if we had a solution, even

24
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,340
better, of butanoyl chloride,
and for every molecule of

25
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:09,870
butanoyl chloride, we had two
molecules of dimethylamide, or

26
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,600
sorry, dimethylamine.

27
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,440
Let me draw that.

28
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,390
So dimethyl, so two
methyl groups.

29
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:20,875
One, two, and then we have one
hydrogen, and then we're going

30
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:23,490
to have two molecules of this
for every one molecule of our

31
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,585
butanoyl chloride.

32
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:27,110
So let me copy and paste this.

33
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,840
So edit, copy.

34
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,990
And edit, paste.

35
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,810
So let's think about what would
happen in a solution

36
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:36,190
with these reactants in
this ratio right here.

37
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:39,830
And just as a bit of review,
this right here is dimethyl.

38
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:44,050
   

39
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,980
We kind of have a tie for our
longest chain attached to the

40
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,230
nitrogen: dimethylamine.

41
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:51,010
   

42
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,950
You could pick one of these as
the longest chain and then it

43
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,600
would actually be
N-methylmethylamine.

44
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,840
Either one, this is the
one that you're

45
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,880
more likely to see.

46
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,710
But this video isn't about
naming, this video is to think

47
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,080
about what's likely to happen.

48
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,870
So what are we dealing with?

49
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:09,280
We have amine here and then
we have an acyl chloride.

50
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,790
And if we look at our hierarchy
of stability that we

51
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,800
looked at in the last video,
we saw that when an amine

52
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,470
reacts or a carboxylic
derivative from an amine,

53
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,060
which is an amide, is
much more stable

54
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,340
than an acyl chloride.

55
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,860
This is the least stable.

56
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,310
So if we're starting with an
acyl chloride and we have the

57
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:35,090
ingredients for an amide, this
reaction will probably end up

58
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:35,940
with amide.

59
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,470
So let's see how we
can get there.

60
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:43,430
What we know from previous
videos when we studied amines,

61
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,610
that they are pretty good
nucleophiles, so they could

62
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,840
have a nucleophile attack
on this carbonyl

63
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,260
carbon right over here.

64
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,650
So you can imagine this amine
right here, this nitrogen,

65
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,480
gives an electron to this
carbonyl carbon.

66
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,980
This carbonyl carbon can then
let go of this electron to

67
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,960
this top oxygen over here.

68
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,920
It was already hogging
it to begin with.

69
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,110
And so the next step of our
reaction would look like this.

70
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:11,260
What was the butanoyl chloride
will now look like one, two,

71
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,660
three, four carbons.

72
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,570
Now you only have
a single bond.

73
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,240
This oxygen up here now
has a negative charge.

74
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,920
Since it took an electron from
this central carbon right over

75
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,900
here, you are still bonded
to this chlorine.

76
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,570
And actually let me do that in
a different color so we can

77
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,010
keep track of it.

78
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:32,790
You are still bonded to this
chlorine atom and then the

79
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,440
nitrogen has been bonded.

80
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,850
So this bond I'll drawn green
because we're giving this

81
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:41,270
green electron to form the bond,
and then the rest of the

82
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,260
dimethylamine is still
over there.

83
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,250
Let me do it in that
same color.

84
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:51,460
The rest of the dimethylamine,
so you have CH3, CH3 and then

85
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,950
you just have your hydrogen.

86
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:56,420
And then this nitrogen gave away
an electron, so it has a

87
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,390
positive charge.

88
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:04,410
Now, the next step, and this
is chlorine, it's fairly

89
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,350
electronegative.

90
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,540
It's a not-so-bad
leaving group.

91
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,430
It will want to hog this
electron that is on the

92
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,480
central carbon.

93
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,080
So you can imagine in the next
step that this oxygen gives

94
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,120
back an electron to reform the
carbonyl group at the exact

95
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,010
same time that this chlorine
takes an electron and forms a

96
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,370
chloride anion.

97
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,050
So the next step in this will
look like-- so the molecules

98
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,670
will now look like--
you have there one,

99
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,960
two, three, four carbons.

100
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,990
That's one of the bonds to that
oxygen, but now you've

101
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,005
now formed another bond.

102
00:04:37,005 --> 00:04:39,660
That electron was given back to
that central atom and now

103
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,180
you have the bond to the
nitrogen, this bond right

104
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,940
here, and then the nitrogen is
bound to one methyl group, two

105
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,930
methyl groups, and a hydrogen.

106
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,330
And it had given away an
electron so it has a positive

107
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:58,870
charge, and the chloride anion
has been bumped off.

108
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,800
The chloride anion, it took an
electron from that central

109
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,260
carbon, so now it has
a negative charge.

110
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:10,480
Now, we still have that other
dimethylamine molecule, or for

111
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,310
every one of these, we should
have two of these.

112
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:15,140
We've only use one of them, so
let me bring the other one

113
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,150
into the mix, and this one could
just be in the mix to

114
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:22,850
make this other molecule neutral
now, and this could go

115
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,660
in either direction.

116
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,600
This part right here could
go in either direction.

117
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:34,400
This guy's not so weak or it's
not a bad base, so this guy

118
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,750
could give an electron to this
hydrogen proton, and then the

119
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,260
hydrogen proton's electron, or
that hydrogen atom's electron,

120
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:46,680
can be taken back by this
nitrogen to make it neutral.

121
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,760
And I'll make this go
in both directions.

122
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,870
So this could go in
both directions.

123
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:56,750
So then this molecule over here
will look like one, two,

124
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,040
three, four carbonyl group.

125
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,120
And let me color code it the
same way just so we know what

126
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,030
parts are which parts.

127
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,590
We have this green bond to this
nitrogen, which has now

128
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,640
lost a proton.

129
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,730
It was able to take
back an electron,

130
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,410
so it is now neutral.

131
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:18,170
It is bonded to one,
two methyl groups.

132
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:22,500
This dimethylamine
took a hydrogen.

133
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,290
So let me draw it over here.

134
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:31,010
So it's nitrogen one, two, and
then it already had one

135
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,700
hydrogen and now it's gaining
another hydrogen.

136
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,090
It's gaining this hydrogen
right over here.

137
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,240
So now it's bound to
that hydrogen.

138
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,000
It gave an electron to get that
hydrogen nucleus so it

139
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,120
now has a positive charge.

140
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,190
And, of course, we can't forget
about that chloride

141
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,440
anion that's floating around.

142
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,240
   

143
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,860
And these might be attracted
to each other.

144
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,290
One's positive, one's negative,
form a salt.

145
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,930
So what are we left with?

146
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,320
And then once again, this
is a little bit

147
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,220
of practice of naming.

148
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,980
We started with an acyl chloride
and we ended with an

149
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,490
amide because we now have this
nitrogen group attached.

150
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,720
So what is this?

151
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:16,880
This has one, two, three, four
carbons so it's butan-, but

152
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,200
it's an amide.

153
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,390
So this part tells us that we're
dealing with an amide.

154
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,610
   

155
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,210
It's butanamide, but to specify
what type of amide, we

156
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,990
see that we have two methyl
groups attached to the

157
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,420
nitrogen there, so we would call
this-- let me put another

158
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:34,910
color here.

159
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:38,790
We have one, two methyl groups
attached to the nitrogen, so

160
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,500
we would call this N comma
N-dimethylbutanamide.

161
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,670
   

162
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:49,760
This N comma N let's us know
that the methyl groups are

163
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:55,880
attached here as opposed to on
the butyl group, I guess we

164
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,550
could view it this way.

165
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:00,280
So we end up with
N,N-dimethylbutanamide, which

166
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,520
is an amide, one of the most
stable carboxylic acid

167
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,340
derivatives.

168
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,160
And then this right here,
this salt, what is this?

169
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:17,520
This right here is dimethyl,
and this is now no longer

170
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,000
dimethylamine.

171
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,670
We now are a positively charged
cation, so this is

172
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,920
dimethylammonium.

173
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:29,050
   

174
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,100
We get that from the fact
that we have four bonds.

175
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,419
We have a positive charge.

176
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:35,330
This dimethylammonium, and then
we have this negative

177
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,669
anion, dimethylammonium
chloride.

178
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:39,970
I'll just go to the next line.

179
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,620
Dimethylammonium chloride.

180
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,140
But I really just wanted to show
you a mechanism here of

181
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,680
how you could go from a less
stable or one of the least

182
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,150
stable carboxylic acid
derivatives to one of the most

183
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:55,210
stable, going from an acyl
chloride, which butanoyl

184
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:58,310
chloride was, to an amide.

185
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,267
