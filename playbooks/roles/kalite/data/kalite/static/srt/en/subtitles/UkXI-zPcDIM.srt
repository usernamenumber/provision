1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:05,975
On the same day, police have made two at first unrelated arrests.

2
00:00:05,975 --> 00:00:08,896
They arrest a gentleman named Alan.

3
00:00:08,896 --> 00:00:11,407
They caught him red-handed selling drugs.

4
00:00:11,407 --> 00:00:13,079
So it's an open-and-shut case.

5
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:17,011
And in the same day they catch a gentleman named Bill,

6
00:00:17,011 --> 00:00:20,323
and he is also caught red-handed dealing drugs.

7
00:00:20,323 --> 00:00:22,925
And they bring them separately to the police station

8
00:00:22,925 --> 00:00:25,669
and they tell them, "look, this is an open-and-shut case

9
00:00:25,669 --> 00:00:28,017
you're going to get convicted for drug dealing

10
00:00:28,017 --> 00:00:29,396
and you`re going to get two years."

11
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,123
And they tell this to each of them individually.

12
00:00:31,123 --> 00:00:33,506
They are selling the same type of drugs, just happened to be that.

13
00:00:33,506 --> 00:00:35,387
But they were doing it completely independently.

14
00:00:35,387 --> 00:00:39,651
Two years for drugs is what's going to happen,

15
00:00:39,651 --> 00:00:41,597
assuming nothing else.

16
00:00:41,597 --> 00:00:43,720
But then the District Attorney has the chance

17
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,376
to chat with each of this gentlemen separately.

18
00:00:46,376 --> 00:00:49,047
And while he's chatting with them, he reinforces the idea that

19
00:00:49,047 --> 00:00:51,061
this is an open-and-shut case for the drug dealing.

20
00:00:51,061 --> 00:00:54,048
They're each going to get 2 years if nothing else happens.

21
00:00:54,048 --> 00:00:56,079
But then he starts to realize that

22
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,551
these 2 characters look like.

23
00:00:58,551 --> 00:01:00,854
He starts to have a suspicion for whatever reason

24
00:01:00,854 --> 00:01:03,194
that these were the 2 characters that actually committed

25
00:01:03,194 --> 00:01:05,560
a much more serious offence, that they had committed

26
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,150
a major armed robbery a few weeks ago.

27
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,344
And all the District Attorney has to go on

28
00:01:13,344 --> 00:01:17,617
is his hunch, his suspicion. He has no hard evidence.

29
00:01:17,617 --> 00:01:20,129
So what he wants to do is try to get a deal

30
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:22,720
with each of these guys, so that they have an incentive

31
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,068
to, essentially, snitch on each other.

32
00:01:25,068 --> 00:01:27,390
So what he tells each of them is

33
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,323
"look, you're gonna get two years for drug dealing,

34
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:32,989
that's kind of guaranteed". But he says

35
00:01:32,989 --> 00:01:44,610
"look, if you confess, and the other doesn't,

36
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:50,235
then you will get 1 year

37
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:56,449
and the other guy will get 10 years".

38
00:01:56,449 --> 00:02:00,963
So he's telling Al, "look, we caught Bill too just randomly today,

39
00:02:00,963 --> 00:02:04,565
if you confess that it was you and Bill who performed that armed robbery,

40
00:02:04,565 --> 00:02:07,603
your term is actually going down from 2 years to 1 year.

41
00:02:07,603 --> 00:02:11,014
But Bill is obviously going to have to spend a lot more time in jail,

42
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:14,215
especially because he's not cooperating with us,

43
00:02:14,215 --> 00:02:15,808
he's not confessing".

44
00:02:15,808 --> 00:02:18,918
But then the other statement is also true:

45
00:02:18,918 --> 00:02:28,184
If you deny and the other confesses

46
00:02:28,184 --> 00:02:29,879
now it switches around.

47
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:33,255
You will get 10 years because you're not cooperating,

48
00:02:33,255 --> 00:02:38,190
and the other, your co-conspirator will get a reduced sentence,

49
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,808
will get the 1 year. So this is like telling Al

50
00:02:40,808 --> 00:02:43,357
"look, if you deny that you were the armed robber

51
00:02:43,357 --> 00:02:45,388
and Bill snitches you out,

52
00:02:45,388 --> 00:02:47,837
then you're gonna get 10 years in prison

53
00:02:47,837 --> 00:02:50,394
and Bill is only going to get 1 year in prison".

54
00:02:50,394 --> 00:02:57,738
And if both of you essentially confess, both confess,

55
00:02:57,738 --> 00:03:02,521
you will both get 3 years.

56
00:03:02,521 --> 00:03:06,418
So this scenario is called "The Prisoner's Dilemma".

57
00:03:06,418 --> 00:03:07,867
Because we'll see in a second

58
00:03:07,867 --> 00:03:10,466
there is a globally optimal scenario for them

59
00:03:10,466 --> 00:03:15,100
where they both deny, and they both get 2 years.

60
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,262
But we'll see, based on their incentives,

61
00:03:17,262 --> 00:03:20,487
assuming they don't have any unusual loyalty to each other,

62
00:03:20,487 --> 00:03:22,379
and these are, you know, these are hardened criminals here.

63
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,461
They're not brothers or related to each other in any way.

64
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:26,339
They don't have any kind of loyalty pack.

65
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:29,813
We'll see that they will rationally pick a non,

66
00:03:29,813 --> 00:03:33,491
or they might rationally pick a non-optimal scenario.

67
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:35,443
And to understand that I'm going to draw something

68
00:03:35,443 --> 00:03:39,279
called the "pay-off matrix", a pay-off matrix.

69
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:42,106
So let me do it right here for Bill.

70
00:03:42,106 --> 00:03:49,642
So Bill has two options, he can confess to the armed robbery

71
00:03:49,642 --> 00:03:52,450
or he can deny that he had anything,

72
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,163
that he knows anything about the armed robbery.

73
00:03:55,163 --> 00:03:57,469
And Al has the same two options.

74
00:03:57,469 --> 00:04:03,820
Al can confess and Al can deny.

75
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,121
And since it's called the pay-off matrix,

76
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:10,559
let me draw some grids here.

77
00:04:10,559 --> 00:04:12,979
And let's think about all of the different scenarios

78
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:14,603
and what the pay-offs would be.

79
00:04:14,603 --> 00:04:18,860
If Al confesses and Bill confesses then they're in scenario 4,

80
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:25,567
they both get 3 years in jail, they both would get

81
00:04:25,567 --> 00:04:29,591
3 for Al, and 3 for Bill.

82
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:35,505
Now, if Al confesses and Bill denies

83
00:04:35,505 --> 00:04:38,847
then we are in scenario 2, from Al's point of view,

84
00:04:38,847 --> 00:04:43,115
Al is only going to get 1 year,

85
00:04:43,115 --> 00:04:47,800
but Bill is going to get 10 years.

86
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,435
Now if the opposite thing happens,

87
00:04:49,435 --> 00:04:51,189
that Bill confesses and Al denies

88
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:52,857
then it goes the other way around.

89
00:04:52,857 --> 00:04:55,438
Al is going to get 10 years for not cooperating and

90
00:04:55,438 --> 00:04:59,484
Bill is going to have a reduced sentence of 1 year for cooperating.

91
00:04:59,484 --> 00:05:05,987
And if they both deny, they're in scenario 1, where

92
00:05:05,987 --> 00:05:09,139
they're both just going to get their time for the drug dealing.

93
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:15,719
So Al would get 2 years and Bill would get 2 years.

94
00:05:15,719 --> 00:05:18,211
Now I alluded to this earlier in the video:

95
00:05:18,211 --> 00:05:21,673
what is the globally optimal scenario for them?

96
00:05:21,673 --> 00:05:23,043
Well, it's this scenario, where

97
00:05:23,043 --> 00:05:25,718
they both deny having anything to do with the armed robbery,

98
00:05:25,718 --> 00:05:28,544
then they both get 2 years.

99
00:05:28,544 --> 00:05:31,317
But what we'll see is that it is actually somewhat rational,

100
00:05:31,317 --> 00:05:34,481
assuming that they don't have any strong loyalties to each other,

101
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:36,327
a strong level of trust with the other party,

102
00:05:36,327 --> 00:05:39,744
to not go there, it's actually rational for both of them to confess.

103
00:05:39,744 --> 00:05:43,185
And a confession is actually a "Nash equilibrium".

104
00:05:43,185 --> 00:05:44,815
And we'll talk more about this.

105
00:05:44,815 --> 00:05:49,175
But a Nash equilibrium is where each party has picked a choice

106
00:05:49,175 --> 00:05:52,347
given the choices of the other party.

107
00:05:52,347 --> 00:05:55,764
So when we think of, or each party's picked the optimal choice

108
00:05:55,764 --> 00:06:00,580
given the choices of, or given whatever choice the other party picks.

109
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,963
And so from Al's point of view he says, well look,

110
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:06,799
I don't know whether Bill, or Bill is confessing or denying,

111
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:10,020
so let me, let's say he confesses, what's better for me to do?

112
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,169
If he confesses and I confess, then I get 3 years.

113
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:16,045
If he confesses and I deny, I get 10 years.

114
00:06:16,045 --> 00:06:19,175
So if he confesses it's better for me to confess as well.

115
00:06:19,175 --> 00:06:23,178
So this is a preferable scenario to this one down here.

116
00:06:23,178 --> 00:06:25,723
Now I don't know that Bill confessed, he might deny.

117
00:06:25,723 --> 00:06:29,781
If I assume Bill denied, is it better for me to confess

118
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:32,710
and get 1 year, or deny and get 2 years?

119
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,563
Well once again, it's better for me to confess.

120
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:38,963
And so, regardless of whether Bill confesses or denies,

121
00:06:38,963 --> 00:06:42,538
so this once again, the optimal choice for Al to pick,

122
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:46,419
taking into account Bill's choices, is to confess.

123
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:48,699
If Bill confesses, Al's better off confessing,

124
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,125
If Bill denies, Al's better off confessing.

125
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,861
Now we look at it from Bill's point of view,

126
00:06:52,861 --> 00:06:54,414
and it's completely symmetric.

127
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:58,959
If Bill, Bill says, well I don't know if Al's confessing or denying.

128
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,990
If Al confesses, I can confess and get 3 years,

129
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,176
or I can deny and get 10 years.

130
00:07:04,176 --> 00:07:06,071
Well, 3 years in prison is better than 10,

131
00:07:06,071 --> 00:07:09,013
so I would go for the 3 years.

132
00:07:09,013 --> 00:07:10,761
If I know Al is confessing.

133
00:07:10,761 --> 00:07:14,240
But I don't know that Al's definitely confessing, he might deny.

134
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,773
If Al's denying, I could confess and get 1 year,

135
00:07:17,773 --> 00:07:19,836
or I could deny and get 2 years.

136
00:07:19,836 --> 00:07:24,219
Well, once again, I would want to confess and get the 1 year.

137
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:28,099
So Bill, taking into account each of the scenarios that Al might take,

138
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:33,085
it's always better for him to confess.

139
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,072
And so this is interesting.

140
00:07:35,072 --> 00:07:38,605
They're rationally deducing that they should get to this scenario,

141
00:07:38,605 --> 00:07:40,741
this Nash equilibrium state,

142
00:07:40,741 --> 00:07:43,640
as opposed to this globally optimal state.

143
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,531
They're both getting 3 years by both confessing

144
00:07:46,531 --> 00:07:49,417
as opposed to both of them getting 2 years by both denying.

145
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:54,329
The problem with this one is this is an unstable state.

146
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:57,641
If one of them assumes that the other one has,

147
00:07:57,641 --> 00:07:58,729
if one of them assumes that

148
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,796
they're somehow in that state temporarily.

149
00:08:00,796 --> 00:08:04,529
They say "well, I can always improve my scenario

150
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:07,707
by changing my, by changing what I wanna do".

151
00:08:07,707 --> 00:08:10,425
If Al thought that Bill was definitely denying

152
00:08:10,425 --> 00:08:13,551
Al can improve his circumstance by moving out of that state

153
00:08:13,551 --> 00:08:16,037
and confessing and only getting 1 year.

154
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:20,121
Likewise, if Bill had thought that maybe Al is likely to deny

155
00:08:20,121 --> 00:08:23,965
he realizes that he can optimize by moving in this direction

156
00:08:23,965 --> 00:08:25,679
instead of denying and getting 2 and 2

157
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:28,413
he could move in that direction right over there.

158
00:08:28,413 --> 00:08:31,317
So this is an ustable optimal scenario,

159
00:08:31,317 --> 00:08:34,292
but this Nash equilibrium, this state right over here

160
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:36,762
is actually very, very, very stable.

161
00:08:36,762 --> 00:08:40,811
If they assume... this is, it's better for each of them to confess

162
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:43,489
regardless of what the other one does,

163
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:47,375
and assuming all of the other actors have chosen their strategy,

164
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,187
there's no incentive for Bill.

165
00:08:50,187 --> 00:08:53,327
So... if assuming everyone else has changed the strategy

166
00:08:53,327 --> 00:08:57,654
you can only move in that direction, if you're Bill you can either...

167
00:08:57,654 --> 00:09:01,380
you can go from the Nash equilibrium of confessing to denying,

168
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,615
but you're worse off, so you won't wanna do that.

169
00:09:03,615 --> 00:09:05,567
Or you could move in this direction,

170
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:07,692
where it would be Al changing his decision.

171
00:09:07,692 --> 00:09:10,794
But once again that gets a worse outcome for Al

172
00:09:10,794 --> 00:09:12,916
you're going from 3 years to 10 years.

173
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,788
So this is the equilibrium state, the stable state,

174
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,569
that both people would pick something

175
00:09:17,569 --> 00:09:20,181
that it's not optimal globally.
