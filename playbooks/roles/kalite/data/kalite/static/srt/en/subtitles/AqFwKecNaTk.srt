1
00:00:01,867 --> 00:00:06,600
A line has a slop of negatave 3/4ths, and goes through the point (0,8).

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,600
What is the equation of this line in slope-intercept form?

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:20,800
So any line can be represented in slope-intercept form as y=mx+b.

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,267
Where this 'm' right over here, that is the slope of the line, and this

5
00:00:26,267 --> 00:00:32,533
'b' over here, this is the y-intercept of the line.

6
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:37,667
Let me draw a quick line here just so that we can visualize that a little bit.

7
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:42,867
So that is my y-axis, and then that is my x-axis.

8
00:00:42,867 --> 00:00:48,852
And let me draw a line, and since our line here has a negative slope,

9
00:00:48,867 --> 00:00:52,200
I'll draw a downwards sloping line.

10
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,267
So let's say our line looks something like that.

11
00:00:56,267 --> 00:00:59,200
So, hopefully we're a little familiar with the slope already,

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,200
the slope essentially tells us, look start at some point on the line,

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,133
and go to some other point on the line,

14
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:09,467
measure how much you have to move in the x-direction, that is your run,

15
00:01:09,467 --> 00:01:13,600
and measure how much you have to move in the y-direction, that is your rise,

16
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:20,600
and our slope is equal to rise over run. And you go see over here, it will be

17
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,133
downward sloping, because if you move in the positive x-direction,

18
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:28,933
we have to go down. If our run is positive, our rise here is negative.

19
00:01:28,933 --> 00:01:32,000
So this will be a negative over positive, and will get a negative number

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Which makes sense, because we're downward sloping.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,333
The more we go down in this situation, for every step we move to the right,

22
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:43,267
the more downward sloping we'll be; the more negative of a slope we'll have.

23
00:01:43,267 --> 00:01:46,267
so that's slope. That's slope right over here.

24
00:01:46,267 --> 00:01:51,267
The y-intercept just tells us where we intercept the y-axis.

25
00:01:51,267 --> 00:01:56,000
So the y-intercept, this point right over here, this is where the line intersects

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,333
with the y-axis. This will be the point (0,b).

27
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:04,200
And this actually just falls straight out of this equation.

28
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,800
Let's evaluate this when x=0.

29
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:28,267
y=m*0+b, well anything times zero is zero, so y=0+b or y=b, when x=0, so this is

30
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:30,533
the point (0,b)

31
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:34,841
Now, they tell us what the slope of this line is.

32
00:02:34,841 --> 00:02:41,267
They tell us a line has a slope of -3/4 so we know that our slope is -3/4

33
00:02:41,267 --> 00:02:45,333
And they tell us that the line goes through the point (0,8)

34
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:50,133
They tell us we go through the, let me just do this in a new color

35
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:52,600
I've already used orange, let's use this green color.

36
00:02:52,600 --> 00:03:00,267
They tell us that we go through the point (0,8) notice x is 0, so we're on the y-axis

37
00:03:00,267 --> 00:03:04,667
when x is zero, we're on the y-axis, so this is our y-interecept

38
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:12,533
so b, we could say, we could do a couple of-- our y-intercept is the point (0,8),

39
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:18,000
or we could say b, remember, it's also (0,b) we could say b=8

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,867
So we know m=-3/4, and b is equal to 8, so we can write the equation of this line.

41
00:03:24,867 --> 00:03:26,800
in slope-intercept form.

42
00:03:26,800 --> 99:59:59,999
It's y=-3/4 times x, plus b, plus 8. And we are done, we are done.
