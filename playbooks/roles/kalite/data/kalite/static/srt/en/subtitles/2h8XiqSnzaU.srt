00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:08,546
Identify 15 eights, or 15 over 8, as a proper or an improper fraction.

2
00:00:08,546 --> 00:00:10,048
or an improper fraction.

3
00:00:10,048 --> 00:00:13,012
So this is actually just a good review of proper and improper fractions.

4
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:15,676
And there's a pretty easy way to identify them.

5
00:00:15,676 --> 00:00:18,800
You have a proper fraction if your numerator --

6
00:00:18,943 --> 00:00:22,408
so this right here is your numerator -- the number on top.

7
00:00:22,408 --> 00:00:24,125
if your numerator ...

8
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:26,272
Let me just label them

9
00:00:26,272 --> 00:00:31,990
numerator and denominator ... de nom in a tor

10
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,706
You have a proper fraction if your numerator

11
00:00:35,706 --> 00:00:39,272
if your numerator is less than your denominator

12
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:41,789
if your numerator is less than your denominator

13
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:43,824
and if you don't have a proper fraction

14
00:00:43,824 --> 00:00:45,540
you have an improper fraction.

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,657
Improper fraction is if your numerator is greater

16
00:00:50,657 --> 00:00:53,473
than or equal to your denominator

17
00:00:53,473 --> 00:00:56,324
And over here, actually, all the numbers are positive,

18
00:00:56,324 --> 00:00:58,806
But if you had some negative numbers here, you would actually say

19
00:00:58,806 --> 00:01:00,628
the absolute value of numerator is lesser than

20
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:03,973
the absolute value of the denominator, for a proper fraction

21
00:01:03,973 --> 00:01:06,993
And the absolute value of numerator is greater than or equal

22
00:01:06,993 --> 00:01:09,943
to the absolute value of the denominator for an improper fraction

23
00:01:09,943 --> 00:01:12,226
So let me just write that down

24
00:01:12,226 --> 00:01:15,275
just to be a little bit more particular here.

25
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:19,246
Because we could have negative numbers in either the numerator or the denominator.

26
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,401
Anyway, let's go back to this problem

27
00:01:21,401 --> 00:01:25,986
15 is clearly greater than or equal to 8

28
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:32,332
So 15 is greater than or equal to 8,

29
00:01:32,344 --> 00:01:40,756
so we are dealing with an improper fraction.
