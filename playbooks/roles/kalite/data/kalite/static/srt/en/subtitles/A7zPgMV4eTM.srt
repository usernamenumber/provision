1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,811
So we've got two figures right over here,

2
00:00:02,811 --> 00:00:04,072
and I want to think about

3
00:00:04,072 --> 00:00:07,545
how much space they take up on your screen.

4
00:00:07,545 --> 00:00:13,296
And this idea of how much space something takes up on a surface

5
00:00:13,296 --> 00:00:15,001
is area.

6
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:16,603
So, right when you look at it,

7
00:00:16,603 --> 00:00:19,162
it looks pretty clear that this purple figure

8
00:00:19,162 --> 00:00:21,672
takes up more space on my screen

9
00:00:21,672 --> 00:00:23,341
than this blue figure,

10
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:25,139
but how do we actually measure it?

11
00:00:25,139 --> 00:00:28,861
How do we actually know how much more area

12
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:30,631
this purple figure takes up

13
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:32,553
than this blue one?

14
00:00:32,553 --> 00:00:33,922
Well, one way to do it

15
00:00:33,922 --> 00:00:37,131
would be to define a unit amount of area.

16
00:00:37,131 --> 00:00:41,681
So, for example, I could create a square over here,

17
00:00:41,681 --> 00:00:44,347
This square, whatever units we're using,

18
00:00:44,347 --> 00:00:46,213
we could say its [area is] one unit,

19
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:49,306
Its width right over here is one unit,

20
00:00:49,306 --> 00:00:54,103
and its height over here is one unit.

21
00:00:54,103 --> 00:00:59,647
We could call this a unit square.

22
00:00:59,647 --> 00:01:03,330
So, one way to measure the area of these figures

23
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:08,074
is to figure out how many unit squares I could cover this thing with

24
00:01:08,074 --> 00:01:11,553
without overlapping and while staying in the boundaries.

25
00:01:11,553 --> 00:01:12,562
So let's try to do that.

26
00:01:12,562 --> 00:01:13,967
Let's try to cover each of these

27
00:01:13,967 --> 00:01:14,978
with unit squares,

28
00:01:14,978 --> 00:01:17,968
and then essentially, we'll have a measure of area.

29
00:01:17,968 --> 00:01:20,655
So I'll start with this blue one.

30
00:01:20,655 --> 00:01:21,444
So we could put

31
00:01:21,444 --> 00:01:26,038
1, 2

32
00:01:26,038 --> 00:01:31,764
3, 4

33
00:01:31,764 --> 00:01:33,161
5

34
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:35,542
5 unit squares.

35
00:01:35,542 --> 00:01:36,919
Let me write this down.

36
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:38,666
So we [have] got

37
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:43,684
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 unit squares --

38
00:01:43,684 --> 00:01:44,560
and I could draw the boundary

39
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,726
between those unit squares

40
00:01:45,726 --> 00:01:47,804
a little bit clearer --

41
00:01:47,804 --> 00:01:51,169
so we have 5 unit squares.

42
00:01:51,169 --> 00:01:53,146
And so we could say that this figure

43
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:55,795
right over here has an area -

44
00:01:55,795 --> 00:01:57,769
the area is five.

45
00:01:57,769 --> 00:01:59,249
We could say five unit squares,

46
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:00,558
but the more typical way of saying it

47
00:02:00,558 --> 00:02:07,143
is that you have 5 square units.

48
00:02:07,143 --> 00:02:08,511
That's the area over here.

49
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:11,290
Now let's do the same thing with this purple figure.

50
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,888
So with the purple figure, I could put

51
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:20,053
1, 2, 3

52
00:02:20,053 --> 00:02:27,140
4, 5, 6

53
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:35,602
7, 8, 9,

54
00:02:35,602 --> 00:02:38,837
10. 10 of these unit squares I can cover.

55
00:02:38,837 --> 00:02:40,018
They're not overlapping,

56
00:02:40,018 --> 00:02:41,115
or I'm trying pretty close

57
00:02:41,115 --> 00:02:42,273
to not make them overlap,

58
00:02:42,273 --> 00:02:43,666
but you see you can fit ten of them,

59
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,739
and let me draw the boundary between them,

60
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:48,659
so you can see a little bit clearer.

61
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:53,794
So, that's the boundary between my unit squares.

62
00:02:53,794 --> 00:02:56,522
Between my unit squares.

63
00:02:56,522 --> 00:02:57,800
So, there you go,

64
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,068
and we can count them.

65
00:02:59,068 --> 00:03:03,736
1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7

66
00:03:03,736 --> 00:03:06,351
8 , 9 , 10

67
00:03:06,351 --> 00:03:07,293
So we could say the area --

68
00:03:07,293 --> 00:03:09,779
and let me divide these with the black boundary too,

69
00:03:09,779 --> 00:03:12,160
it makes things a little bit clearer than blue --

70
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,651
So the area here for the purple figure

71
00:03:15,651 --> 00:03:25,907
we could say is equal to 10 square units.

72
00:03:25,907 --> 00:03:26,817
So what we have here -

73
00:03:26,817 --> 00:03:28,792
we have an idea of how much space

74
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:32,611
something takes up on a surface,

75
00:03:32,611 --> 00:03:33,520
and you could eyeball it, say,

76
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,589
"Hey this takes up more space."

77
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,941
But now we've come up with a way of measuring it.

78
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:39,504
We can define a unit square

79
00:03:39,504 --> 00:03:41,235
-- here it's a 1 unit by 1 unit --

80
00:03:41,235 --> 00:03:43,268
in the future we'll see that it could be

81
00:03:43,268 --> 00:03:48,180
a unit centimeter, a 1 centimeter by 1 centimeter square;

82
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,331
it could be a 1 meter by 1 meter square;

83
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:53,397
it could be a 1 foot by 1 foot square;

84
00:03:53,397 --> 00:03:54,858
but then we can use that

85
00:03:54,858 --> 00:03:57,653
to actually measure the area of things.

86
00:03:57,653 --> 00:04:00,273
This thing has an area of 5 square units;

87
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,403
this thing has an area of 10 square units.

88
00:04:02,403 --> 00:04:04,141
So this one we can actually say

89
00:04:04,141 --> 00:04:06,485
has twice the area -

90
00:04:06,485 --> 00:04:08,961
the purple figure had twice the area -

91
00:04:08,961 --> 00:04:10,048
it's 10 square units -

92
00:04:10,048 --> 00:04:11,680
as the blue figure.

93
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,221
It takes up twice the amount of space on the screen.
