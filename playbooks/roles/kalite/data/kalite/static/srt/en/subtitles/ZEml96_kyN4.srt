1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,790
   

2
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:06,230
Solve the absolute value of 3x
minus 9 is equal to 0 and

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,180
graph the solution
on a number line.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,380
So let me just rewrite it.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,880
We have the absolute value of
3x minus 9 is equal to 0.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,970
So if the absolute value of
something is equal to 0, what

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,550
can that something be?

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,120
Well the only thing that you
could take the absolute value

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,830
of and get 0 is 0.

10
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,610
So that something has to be 0.

11
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:32,180
So it has to be a 0 inside of
the absolute value sign.

12
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:38,500
So we know that 3x minus
9 must be equal to 0.

13
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,530
If this was any other
non-negative value, you would

14
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:42,390
have two values.

15
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,670
If this was a positive 2, you
would say 3x minus 9 could be

16
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,860
positive 2 or negative 2.

17
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,030
But when you're dealing with 0,
3x minus 9 has to equal 0.

18
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,050
That's the only way when you
take the absolute value,

19
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,520
you're going to get 0.

20
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,980
So then we just solve this.

21
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,625
We add 9 to both sides
of this equation.

22
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,570
   

23
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:05,200
You get 3x is equal to 9.

24
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:11,140
Divide both sides by 3 and you
get x is equal to 9/3 or x is

25
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,140
equal to 3.

26
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,090
And you're done.

27
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,530
And then we just do
the second part.

28
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,790
Graph the solution
on a number line.

29
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,400
So let's graph.

30
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,770
We have a number line here.

31
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:21,730
Let me draw one.

32
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:22,950
It's a number line.

33
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,130
I'll put some negative values.

34
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:32,890
Maybe we'll start negative 2,
negative 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

35
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,190
Could keep going on.

36
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,290
But the solution is
x is equal to 3.

37
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,950
   

38
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,720
So just graphing that on a
number line, we just put a

39
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,380
little dot at 3.

40
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,533
