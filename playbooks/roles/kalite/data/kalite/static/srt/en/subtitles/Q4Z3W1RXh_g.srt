00:00:08,062 --> 00:00:12,772
In September 2012 the British Museum's most famous natural mummy

2
00:00:12,772 --> 00:00:16,829
was taken out of the building for the first time in over a hundred years.

3
00:00:19,599 --> 00:00:24,571
One of the Museum's oldest humans was about to be examined with the newest technology.

4
00:00:26,154 --> 00:00:28,207
An the results would be a revelation.

5
00:00:29,561 --> 00:00:33,039
Gebelein man is one of a small group,

6
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:37,244
6 or 7 bodies of this kind which are in the British Museum.

7
00:00:38,151 --> 00:00:42,583
All of these came from the site of Gebelein in the 1890s.

8
00:00:44,368 --> 00:00:48,283
Gebelein man himself was put on display staight away.

9
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:50,850
He's always attracted tremendous attention.

10
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:58,022
We're about to take Gebelein man to the Cromwell Hospital to have him CT-scanned

11
00:00:58,022 --> 00:01:03,260
and we hope to find a lot more about his past biology, his past health,

12
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,155
how old he was when he died,

13
00:01:05,155 --> 00:01:10,752
to get a better understanding of what it was liked to live and die in Predynastic Egypt.

14
00:01:13,537 --> 00:01:17,789
His preservation is entirely due to natural processes.

15
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,477
We would call a body like this a natural mummy.

16
00:01:22,047 --> 00:01:25,842
This is the area where you can see the scapula.

17
00:01:25,842 --> 00:01:27,190
And there's a dent in it.

18
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,195
In the medial border.

19
00:01:29,195 --> 00:01:31,022
And I'm not sure what's happening here.

20
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:33,854
That'd be and area maybe to have a closer look.

21
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:37,791
I won't have to talk to him. I won't have to ask him questions

22
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,607
and won't have to give him injections

23
00:01:39,607 --> 00:01:42,710
and also hopefully he won't be clastrophobic.

24
00:01:47,433 --> 00:01:49,173
As far as I'm aware

25
00:01:49,173 --> 00:01:53,063
predynsatic mummies have never been CT-scanned before.

26
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,459
Is it possible to look at the left scapula?

27
00:01:58,213 --> 00:02:01,726
We found out that most of his bones appear to have just fused.

28
00:02:01,726 --> 00:02:06,318
The head of his humerus and the head of his femur,

29
00:02:06,318 --> 00:02:09,230
both of which suggest he's just finished growing

30
00:02:09,522 --> 00:02:13,459
and he's probably and he's probably died between the ages of 18 and 21.

31
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:16,365
In the more traditional Egyptian mummy,

32
00:02:16,365 --> 00:02:20,532
all the internal organs have been taken out during embalming,

33
00:02:20,532 --> 00:02:23,361
sometimes put back in after they were preserved,

34
00:02:23,361 --> 00:02:27,405
but you will not ever see the brain because they didn't keep that.

35
00:02:27,405 --> 00:02:29,461
In the case of Gebelein man

36
00:02:29,507 --> 00:02:34,054
we would hope to see all these organs preserved just by drying.

37
00:02:35,484 --> 00:02:39,105
We have teams excavating in Egypt and in Northern Sudan

38
00:02:39,105 --> 00:02:40,919
every year for months at a time

39
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:43,348
excavating both the towns people lived in

40
00:02:43,502 --> 00:02:45,385
and also the places they burried their dead.

41
00:02:45,616 --> 00:02:48,284
There's a real focus at the moment into trying to investigate

42
00:02:48,284 --> 00:02:50,903
what life was like for the ordinary Egyptians.

43
00:02:51,688 --> 00:02:55,453
This looks structural to me, see the way there's a line there?

44
00:02:55,453 --> 00:02:58,029
So much of the study of Ancient Egypt has been

45
00:02:58,029 --> 00:03:00,247
about the temples and the tombs of kings,

46
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:04,308
and the golden masks you have on the burrials of pharaoh and so on,

47
00:03:04,308 --> 00:03:07,020
but that really was a very small part of the population,

48
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,682
maybe less than 1%.

49
00:03:08,682 --> 00:03:12,318
What about all the ordinary people, the farmers that lived along the Nile,

50
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:15,175
what was their health like, what was their life like?

51
00:03:19,683 --> 00:03:24,528
A month later, the British Museum team has come to the Natural History Museum

52
00:03:24,558 --> 00:03:27,745
to see the first results of the scans of Gebelein man.

53
00:03:28,252 --> 00:03:29,824
Thanks very much for coming everyone.

54
00:03:29,824 --> 00:03:34,098
This was a little tête-à-tête,

55
00:03:34,098 --> 00:03:36,454
a sort of a scientist to scientist sort of thing,

56
00:03:36,655 --> 00:03:40,152
but it's sort of xxx a little bit which is great

57
00:03:40,368 --> 00:03:43,046
and I'm very pleased that you could all make it here.

58
00:03:43,308 --> 00:03:48,088
Ground-breaking real-time visualization technology developed in Sweden

59
00:03:48,088 --> 00:03:51,326
is now installed on a new authopsy table

60
00:03:51,326 --> 00:03:52,938
which can be used by the public.

61
00:03:54,554 --> 00:03:57,222
If we actually took a slice from this direction,

62
00:03:58,576 --> 00:04:03,480
now look down inside the body and see a lot of the soft tissue.

63
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,303
Well, I think this will be a fantastic tool to bring it to the galleries.

64
00:04:08,303 --> 00:04:11,781
Our visitors will be able to explore this mummy

65
00:04:11,795 --> 00:04:15,080
who's been known in our gallery for over a century.

66
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,514
And as we all learn at school,

67
00:04:16,514 --> 00:04:19,041
the Egyptians took the brain out through the nose

68
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:22,146
as part for that articifial mumification process.

69
00:04:22,577 --> 00:04:27,158
So this fantastic tool which is like a virtual surgeon's knife

70
00:04:27,404 --> 00:04:29,657
taking away the dome of the skull

71
00:04:29,842 --> 00:04:32,114
and then the ability to see inside

72
00:04:32,114 --> 00:04:35,890
and the preservation of the brain that's over 5 thousand years old?

73
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,712
Six thousand.

74
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:42,242
Based on the way he's been treated, he should date to about 3600 B.C.

75
00:04:42,242 --> 00:04:45,882
maybe 3700, so ... he's old.

76
00:04:45,882 --> 00:04:51,057
And it's so neat to apply this new technology to something just his old.

77
00:04:51,888 --> 00:04:53,998
And to get these results to see potentially

78
00:04:53,998 --> 00:04:55,573
what he might what he might have eaten

79
00:04:55,573 --> 00:04:57,037
on his last day.

80
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:59,462
It's really very exciting.

81
00:04:59,585 --> 00:05:02,921
But what did happen on Gebelein man's last day?

82
00:05:03,475 --> 00:05:08,461
He was young and robust, so what or who killed him?

83
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:13,851
The skeleton and soft tissue now revealed with digital technology

84
00:05:14,175 --> 00:05:18,697
provide evidence for how this man died thousands of years ago.

85
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:23,121
A lot of the ribs have been broken all down kind of a line.

86
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,280
You can see that the one below this area is quite interesting.

87
00:05:27,295 --> 00:05:31,582
In fact you've got fragments which are still floating in soft tissue.

88
00:05:32,474 --> 00:05:35,695
His shoulder bone had a big indentation in it,

89
00:05:35,695 --> 00:05:39,932
so the rib immediately below also looks like it's been punctured,

90
00:05:39,932 --> 00:05:44,341
shattered into fragments which have emebeded themselves into the muscle tissue

91
00:05:44,341 --> 00:05:46,523
and they're still embeded there today.

92
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:51,317
The fracure pattern suggests that this was just done when the bone was fresh.

93
00:05:51,471 --> 00:05:55,474
All o which points to him being stabbed in the back.

94
00:06:02,243 --> 00:06:05,892
It's very likely that what we've had on display in the galleries

95
00:06:05,892 --> 00:06:10,089
for many, many years was the victim of a murder.

96
00:06:10,335 --> 00:06:11,971
And it's only now

97
00:06:12,156 --> 00:06:14,899
that we're trully finding out

98
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:16,331
who this person was.
