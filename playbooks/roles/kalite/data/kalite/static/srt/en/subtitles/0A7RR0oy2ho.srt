1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:02,680
Let's see if we can learn
a thing or two about

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,070
conic sections.

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,240
So first of all, what are
they and why are they

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,630
called conic sections?

5
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,480
Actually, you probably
recognize a few of them

6
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,130
already, and I'll
write them out.

7
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:22,070
They're the circle, the
ellipse, the parabola,

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:22,760
and the hyperbola.

9
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:29,970
That's a p.

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,040
Hyperbola.

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,750
And you know what
these are already.

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,590
When I first learned conic
sections, I was like, oh,

13
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:36,540
I know what a circle is.

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,660
I know what a parabola is.

15
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,120
And I even know a little bit
about ellipses and hyperbolas.

16
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,710
Why on earth are they
called conic sections?

17
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,450
So to put things simply because
they're the intersection

18
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,760
of a plane and a cone.

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,150
And I draw you
that in a second.

20
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,260
But just before I do that it
probably makes sense to just

21
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,360
draw them by themselves.

22
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,610
And I'll switch colors.

23
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,360
Circle, we all know
what that is.

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,540
Actually let me see if
I can pick a thicker

25
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,010
line for my circles.

26
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,620
so a circle looks
something like that.

27
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,420
It's all the points that are
equidistant from some center,

28
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,610
and that distance that they
all are that's the radius.

29
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:17,130
So if this is r, and this is
the center, the circle is all

30
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,460
the points that are exactly
r away from this center.

31
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,480
We learned that early in our
education what a circle

32
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,280
is; it makes the world
go round, literally.

33
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,270
Ellipse in layman's terms is
kind of a squished circle.

34
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:33,110
It could look
something like this.

35
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,810
Let me do an ellipse
in another color.

36
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,300
So an ellipse could
be like that.

37
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,710
Could be like that.

38
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,680
It's harder to draw using the
tool I'm drawing, but it could

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,500
also be tilted and
rotated around.

40
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,530
But this is a general sense.

41
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:48,050
And actually, circles are a
special case of an ellipse.

42
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,010
It's an ellipse where it's not
stretched in one dimension

43
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:51,730
more than the other.

44
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,560
It's kind of perfectly
symmetric in every way.

45
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,070
Parabola.

46
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,610
You've learned that if you've
taken algebra two and you

47
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,580
probably have if you care
about conic sections.

48
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:07,610
But a parabola-- let me draw a
line here to separate things.

49
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:12,300
A parabola looks something like
this, kind of a U shape and you

50
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,650
know, the classic parabola.

51
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,080
I won't go into the
equations right now.

52
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,550
Well, I will because you're
probably familiar with it.

53
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,370
y is equal to x squared.

54
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,570
And then, you could shift it
around and then you can even

55
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,170
have a parabola that
goes like this.

56
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,520
That would be x is
equal to y squared.

57
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,590
You could rotate these things
around, but I think you know

58
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,090
the general shape
of a parabola.

59
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,100
We'll talk more about how do
you graph it or how do you know

60
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,780
what the interesting points
on a parabola actually are.

61
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,730
And then the last one,
you might have seen this

62
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,500
before, is a hyperbola.

63
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,520
It almost looks like two
parabolas, but not quite,

64
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,500
because the curves look a
little less U-ish and

65
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,520
a little more open.

66
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,010
But I'll explain what
I mean by that.

67
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,170
So a hyperbola usually
looks something like this.

68
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:02,900
So if these are the axes,
then if I were to draw-- let

69
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,610
me draw some asymptotes.

70
00:03:07,512 --> 00:03:13,740
I want to go right through
the-- that's pretty good.

71
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,230
These are asymptotes.

72
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,130
Those aren't the
actual hyperbola.

73
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,970
But a hyperbola would look
something like this.

74
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,280
They get to be right here
and they get really

75
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,090
close to the asymptote.

76
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,020
They get closer and closer to
those blue lines like that and

77
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,430
it happened on this side too.

78
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,860
The graphs show up here and
then they pop over and

79
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,000
they show up there.

80
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,580
This magenta could be one
hyperbola; I haven't done

81
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,840
true justice to it.

82
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,290
Or another hyperbola could be
on, you could kind of call

83
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,060
it a vertical hyperbola.

84
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,720
That's not the exact word, but
it would look something like

85
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,160
that where it's below
the asymptote here.

86
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,160
It's above the asymptote there.

87
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,060
So this blue one would be
one hyperbola and then the

88
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,670
magenta one would be a
different hyperbola.

89
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,050
So those are the
different graphs.

90
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:03,525
So the one thing that I'm sure
you're asking is why are

91
00:04:03,525 --> 00:04:04,790
they called conic sections?

92
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,430
Why are they not called
bolas or variations of

93
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,810
circles or whatever?

94
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,740
And in fact, what's
even the relationship.

95
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,180
It's pretty clear that
circles and ellipses

96
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,330
are somehow related.

97
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,430
That an ellipse is just
a squished circle.

98
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,250
And maybe it even seems that
parabolas and hyperbolas

99
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,680
are somewhat related.

100
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,340
This is a P once again.

101
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,670
They both have bola in their
name and they both kind

102
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,110
of look like open U's.

103
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,930
Although a hyperbola has two of
these going and kind of opening

104
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,380
in different directions,
but they look related.

105
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,020
But what is the connection
behind all these?

106
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,390
And that's frankly where
the word conic comes from.

107
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:42,800
So let me see if I can draw
a three-dimensional cone.

108
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,200
So this is a cone.

109
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,900
That's the top.

110
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,640
I could've used an
ellipse for the top.

111
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,910
Looks like that.

112
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,130
Actually, it has no top.

113
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,690
It would actually keep going
on forever in that direction.

114
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,080
I'm just kind of slicing it
so you see that it's a cone.

115
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,920
This could be the
bottom part of it.

116
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,760
So let's take different
intersections of a plane with

117
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,930
this cone and see if we can at
least generate the different

118
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,830
shapes that we talked
about just now.

119
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,650
So if we have a plane that goes
directly-- I guess if you call

120
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,030
this the axis of this
three-dimensional cone,

121
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,460
so this is the axis.

122
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,150
So if we have a plane that's
exactly perpendicular to that

123
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,660
axis-- let's see if I can
draw it in three dimensions.

124
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,265
The plane would look
something like this.

125
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,940
So it would have a line.

126
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,410
This is the front line that's
closer to you and then they

127
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:43,370
would have another
line back here.

128
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,370
That's close enough.

129
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,443
And of course, you know these
are infinite planes, so it

130
00:05:47,443 --> 00:05:50,060
goes off in every direction.

131
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,930
If this plane is directly
perpendicular to the axis

132
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,400
of these and this is where
the plane goes behind it.

133
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,010
The intersection of this
plane and this cone is

134
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,230
going to look like this.

135
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,790
We're looking at it from an
angle, but if you were looking

136
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,170
straight down, if you were
listening here and you look at

137
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,660
this plane-- if you were
looking at it right above.

138
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,300
If I were to just flip this
over like this, so we're

139
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,290
looking straight down on this
plane, that intersection

140
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,700
would be a circle.

141
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:23,070
Now, if we take the plane and
we tilt it down a little bit,

142
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:27,810
so if instead of that we
have a situation like this.

143
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:31,250
Let me see if I can
do it justice.

144
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,690
We have a situation
where it's-- whoops.

145
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,190
Let me undo that.

146
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:37,570
Edit.

147
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,870
Undo.

148
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:44,940
Where it's like this and has
another side like this,

149
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,900
and I connect them.

150
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,950
So that's the plane.

151
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:54,890
Now the intersection of this
plane, which is now not

152
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,710
orthogonal or it's not
perpendicular to the axis of

153
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,240
this three-dimensional cone.

154
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,650
If you take the intersection of
that plane and that cone-- and

155
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,280
in future videos, and you
don't do this in your

156
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:04,870
algebra two class.

157
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,470
But eventually we'll kind of
do the three-dimensional

158
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,940
intersection and prove that
this is definitely the case.

159
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,760
You definitely do get the
equations, which I'll show you

160
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,880
in the not too far future.

161
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,510
This intersection would
look something like this.

162
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,400
I think you can
visualize it right now.

163
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,490
It would look
something like this.

164
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:24,120
And if you were to look
straight down on this plane, if

165
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,200
you were to look right above
the plane, this would look

166
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,440
something-- this figure I
just drew in purple-- would

167
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,410
look something like this.

168
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,290
Well, I didn't draw
it that well.

169
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,290
It'd be an ellipse.

170
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,800
You know what an
ellipse looks like.

171
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,250
And if I tilted it the other
way, the ellipse would

172
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,430
squeeze the other way.

173
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,890
But that just gives you a
general sense of why both of

174
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,330
these are conic sections.

175
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,350
Now something very interesting.

176
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:52,020
If we keep tilting this plane,
so if we tilt the plane so

177
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,420
it's-- so let's say we're
pivoting around that point.

178
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:59,870
So now my plane-- let me
see if I can do this.

179
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,710
It's a good exercise in
three-dimensional drawing.

180
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,730
Let's say it looks
something like this.

181
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:09,310
I want to go through
that point.

182
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,070
So this is my
three-dimensional plane.

183
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:16,330
I'm drawing it in such a way
that it only intersects this

184
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:20,920
bottom cone and the surface
of the plane is parallel to

185
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,760
the side of this top cone.

186
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,630
In this case the intersection
of the plane and the cone

187
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,110
is going to intersect
right at that point.

188
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,900
You can almost view that I'm
pivoting around this point, at

189
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,850
the intersection of this point
and the plane and the cone.

190
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,750
Well this now, the
intersection, would look

191
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,470
something like this.

192
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,230
It would look like that.

193
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,490
And it would keep going down.

194
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,980
So if I were to draw it,
it would look like this.

195
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,840
If I was right above the
plane, if I were to

196
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,390
just draw the plane.

197
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,050
And there you get
your parabola.

198
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:51,860
So that's interesting.

199
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,830
If you keep kind of tilting--
if you start with a

200
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,530
circle, tilt a little bit,
you get an ellipse.

201
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,695
You get kind of a more
and more skewed ellipse.

202
00:09:00,695 --> 00:09:04,350
And at some point, the ellipse
keeps getting more and

203
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,160
more skewed like that.

204
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,660
It kind of pops right when you
become exactly parallel to

205
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,990
the side of this top cone.

206
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,260
And I'm doing it all very
inexact right now, but I

207
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,060
think I want to give
you the intuition.

208
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,400
It pops and it turns
into a parabola.

209
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,190
So you can kind of view
a parabola-- there is

210
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,470
this relationship.

211
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,550
Parabola is what happens when
one side of an ellipse pops

212
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,580
open and you get this parabola.

213
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:30,240
And then, if you keep tilting
this plane, and I'll do it

214
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,520
another color-- so
it intersects both

215
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,140
sides of the cone.

216
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,490
Let me see if I can draw that.

217
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:42,620
So if this is my new
plane-- whoops.

218
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,820
That's good enough.

219
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,550
So if my plane looks like
this-- I know it's very hard to

220
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:50,550
read now-- and you wanted the
intersection of this plane,

221
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,700
this green plane and the cone--
I should probably redraw it

222
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,950
all, but hopefully you're not
getting overwhelmingly

223
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:59,190
confused-- the intersection
would look like this.

224
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,490
It would intersect the bottom
cone there and it would

225
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:04,760
intersect the top
cone over there.

226
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,320
And then you would have
something like this.

227
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,230
This would be intersection of
the plane and the bottom cone.

228
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,200
And then up here would be
the intersection of the

229
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,090
plane and the top one.

230
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:18,810
Remember, this plane goes off
in every direction infinitely.

231
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,920
So that's just a general sense
of what the conic sections are

232
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,850
and why frankly they're
called conic sections.

233
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,580
And let me know if this got
confusing because maybe I'll do

234
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,350
another video while I redraw
it a little bit cleaner.

235
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,650
Maybe I can find some kind of
neat 3D application that can do

236
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,890
it better than I can do it.

237
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,750
This is kind of just the reason
why they all are conic

238
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,730
sections, and why they really
are related to each other.

239
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,720
And will do that a little
more in depth mathematically

240
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,860
in a few videos.

241
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,080
But in the next video, now that
you know what they are and why

242
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,340
they're all called conic
sections, I'll actually talk

243
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,680
about the formulas about these
and how do you recognize

244
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,370
the formulas.

245
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:54,060
And given a formula, how do
you actually plot the graphs

246
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,020
of these conic sections?

247
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,820
See you in the next video.
