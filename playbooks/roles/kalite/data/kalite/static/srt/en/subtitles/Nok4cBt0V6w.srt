1
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,306
Man: On the back of a US dollar bill,

2
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:08,551
there is an emblem of an eagle.

3
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:11,094
In its talons, you have arrows --

4
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,379
of course a symbol of war,

5
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:15,208
but on the other side, you have an olive branch --

6
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:16,277
a symbol of peace.

7
00:00:16,277 --> 00:00:18,726
Woman: That's not so different than this object we are looking at

8
00:00:18,726 --> 00:00:20,980
that's nearly 4500 years old,

9
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,588
an object known as the Standard of Ur

10
00:00:23,588 --> 00:00:26,550
which comes from the city-state of Ur

11
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,095
which is now in present-day Iraq.

12
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:32,413
Man: In Mesopotamia, really the birthplace of civilization,

13
00:00:32,413 --> 00:00:35,253
and Ur is one of the great early cities.

14
00:00:35,253 --> 00:00:37,331
The word "standard" is a little misleading

15
00:00:37,331 --> 00:00:38,817
because the standard is really a flag

16
00:00:38,817 --> 00:00:40,429
that's often brought into battle,

17
00:00:40,429 --> 00:00:44,226
and the original excavator of this hypothesized that

18
00:00:44,226 --> 00:00:48,190
perhaps this was on a pole originally and was brought into battle.

19
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,146
But in truth, we have no idea.

20
00:00:50,146 --> 00:00:52,405
Woman: So often when we are in the museum,

21
00:00:52,405 --> 00:00:54,482
and we are talking about ancient objects,

22
00:00:54,482 --> 00:00:56,494
we are talking about objects that had been buried

23
00:00:56,494 --> 00:00:59,541
but buried just because of the passage of time.

24
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:03,527
And here we are looking at objects that were intentionally buried.

25
00:01:03,527 --> 00:01:08,115
They were part of what seems to have been an elaborate burial ritual.

26
00:01:08,115 --> 00:01:11,623
These were excavated in the 20s and the early 30s

27
00:01:11,623 --> 00:01:13,384
by a man named Leonard Woolley

28
00:01:13,384 --> 00:01:17,467
who discovered about 16 tombs that he called "royal" tombs.

29
00:01:17,467 --> 00:01:19,627
Man: Again, we really don't know.

30
00:01:19,627 --> 00:01:23,582
But what we do know is we see fabulously expensive objects.

31
00:01:23,582 --> 00:01:25,567
Woman: And one of those valuable objects

32
00:01:25,567 --> 00:01:28,786
was the object we call today "The Standard of Ur"

33
00:01:28,786 --> 00:01:33,061
which is small, but quite beautiful and elaborately decorated.

34
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:35,050
Man: Historians have thought that perhaps this is

35
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,963
a sound box for a musical instrument.

36
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:39,704
Others have thought it might have contained something important,

37
00:01:39,704 --> 00:01:43,047
perhaps even the currency that was used to pay for warfare.

38
00:01:43,047 --> 00:01:44,054
But we simply don't know.

39
00:01:44,054 --> 00:01:46,367
Woman: So that's one of the wonderful things about this object,

40
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:48,703
is that it tells us so much,

41
00:01:48,703 --> 00:01:50,941
and at the same time, it tells us so little.

42
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:53,477
Man: So let's start off with just a simple description.

43
00:01:53,477 --> 00:01:55,499
So we have this object that is small enough

44
00:01:55,499 --> 00:01:57,082
so that it could easily be carried.

45
00:01:57,082 --> 00:02:01,242
Woman: One long side seems to represent a scene of peace and prosperity.

46
00:02:01,242 --> 00:02:03,643
Man: It's divided into three registers

47
00:02:03,643 --> 00:02:05,665
and it's framed with beautiful pieces of shell.

48
00:02:05,665 --> 00:02:08,164
Now this is important because it really does show us

49
00:02:08,164 --> 00:02:10,847
the long distance trade that this culture was involved with.

50
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:14,622
You've got blue lapis lazuli that came from mines in Afghanistan.

51
00:02:14,622 --> 00:02:17,137
You have a red stone that would have come from India.

52
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,417
And you've got the shells

53
00:02:18,417 --> 00:02:19,838
which would have come from the gulf

54
00:02:19,838 --> 00:02:21,838
just to the south of what is now Iraq.

55
00:02:21,838 --> 00:02:24,885
And it reminds us that these first great cities were possible

56
00:02:24,885 --> 00:02:27,340
because agriculture had been successful.

57
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,222
In the river valley between the Tigris and the Euphrates,

58
00:02:30,222 --> 00:02:33,537
it was possible to grow a surplus of food

59
00:02:33,537 --> 00:02:36,357
that allowed for an organization of society

60
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:39,455
where not everybody had to be in the fields all the time.

61
00:02:39,455 --> 00:02:41,707
Once there was enough food,

62
00:02:41,707 --> 00:02:44,122
some people could devote their lives to being rulers

63
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,918
and some to becoming artists or artisans.

64
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:48,356
Woman: And some to priests, right?

65
00:02:48,356 --> 00:02:51,021
You had a whole organization of society

66
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:52,956
with different people performing different roles.

67
00:02:52,956 --> 00:02:54,279
That was suddenly possible.

68
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:58,598
Man: And you can see that organization represented in the three registers here.

69
00:02:58,598 --> 00:03:02,221
The most important, wealthiest, most powerful figures are towards the top,

70
00:03:02,221 --> 00:03:05,440
and then we have the common laborers down at the bottom.

71
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,586
Woman: And it's really typical in Ancient Near Eastern art

72
00:03:07,586 --> 00:03:10,051
for us to see scenes divided into registers.

73
00:03:10,051 --> 00:03:12,240
Man: So let's start down at the bottom and move up.

74
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,302
I see a human figure bearing a heavy bag

75
00:03:16,302 --> 00:03:19,380
Woman: And that's really what we have along the entire bottom register.

76
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,773
Figures who seem to be bringing things to a destination.

77
00:03:23,773 --> 00:03:26,467
We see animals, figures carrying things

78
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:29,440
across their shoulders or on their backs.

79
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,928
Man: Just above that, you can see a number of people

80
00:03:31,928 --> 00:03:34,436
leading more clearly identifiable animals.

81
00:03:34,436 --> 00:03:35,805
You can see somebody herding along

82
00:03:35,805 --> 00:03:37,932
what looks like a sheep or a ram.

83
00:03:37,932 --> 00:03:41,779
You see a bull in front of that being led by two people.

84
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:44,345
And then perhaps goats, perhaps sheep,

85
00:03:44,345 --> 00:03:46,440
ahead of that, and another bull.

86
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,812
These are people that might be bringing these animals to sacrifice

87
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,896
They might be bringing them as a kind of taxation.

88
00:03:51,896 --> 00:03:54,928
We really don't know, but people have hypothesized

89
00:03:54,928 --> 00:03:57,529
that this is showing a kind of collection

90
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:59,368
perhaps for the king, for the city.

91
00:03:59,368 --> 00:04:01,937
The register at the top clearly shows one figure

92
00:04:01,937 --> 00:04:03,563
that's more important than the rest.

93
00:04:03,563 --> 00:04:06,279
The king is larger. In fact, so large

94
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:09,307
that his head breaks into the pictorial frame.

95
00:04:09,307 --> 00:04:11,169
Woman: And he also wears different clothing

96
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:12,794
that helps to identify him.

97
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:16,740
Man: He's seated on a chair that is interesting

98
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,433
because it's got three straight legs

99
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:21,480
and one leg that seems to be the leg of an animal.

100
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,721
Woman: Some of the objects that we see here

101
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:27,194
are objects that were also found in the burials.

102
00:04:27,194 --> 00:04:30,106
But I don't think they found a chair that resembles that.

103
00:04:30,106 --> 00:04:31,207
That would be fun to see.

104
00:04:31,207 --> 00:04:33,096
Man: One of the objects that has been found; however,

105
00:04:33,096 --> 00:04:37,011
are the cups that so many of the figures here are holding.

106
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:42,100
So, clearly these figures are joining the king in some libation.

107
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,985
They are drinking perhaps beer perhaps wine.

108
00:04:43,985 --> 00:04:44,735
We are not sure.

109
00:04:44,735 --> 00:04:46,963
Woman: There is some kind of celebration going on

110
00:04:46,963 --> 00:04:50,348
some festivity, or perhaps a religious ceremony.

111
00:04:50,348 --> 00:04:53,488
Man: It's worth noting that even the secondary figures here

112
00:04:53,488 --> 00:04:56,877
that is the figures who are seated but are not the king,

113
00:04:56,877 --> 00:04:58,883
are larger than the servants

114
00:04:58,883 --> 00:05:00,878
that surround them, that are standing.

115
00:05:00,878 --> 00:05:03,967
And so even within the register, you have a hierarchy

116
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:08,084
that shows the relative importance of three levels of society.

117
00:05:08,084 --> 00:05:10,370
Woman: And then we have two figures at the far end

118
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,600
who seem to be entertaining the seated figures who are drinking.

119
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,028
One is playing a harp,

120
00:05:16,028 --> 00:05:18,966
and another figure on the far right, perhaps singing.

121
00:05:18,966 --> 00:05:21,824
Man: Let's go to the other side. It's a very different story.

122
00:05:21,874 --> 00:05:25,641
Woman: So again we have a scene divided into three registers,

123
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:29,547
but here we see terrible scenes of violence.

124
00:05:29,547 --> 00:05:33,457
Man: We see a rendering of what is pretty clearly warfare.

125
00:05:33,457 --> 00:05:35,697
There are four chariots that are pulled

126
00:05:35,697 --> 00:05:38,357
by what seems to be four male donkeys.

127
00:05:38,357 --> 00:05:39,927
On the back of each chariot

128
00:05:39,927 --> 00:05:42,442
seem to be a driver as well as a warrior.

129
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,002
The figure towards the rear, you will notice,

130
00:05:45,002 --> 00:05:48,852
is holding either a spear or an axe.

131
00:05:48,852 --> 00:05:51,122
And then being trampled by the horses

132
00:05:51,122 --> 00:05:54,767
perhaps felled by those weapons are the enemy.

133
00:05:54,767 --> 00:05:56,729
If you look closely, you can see some extraordinary detail.

134
00:05:56,729 --> 00:05:59,791
Look at one of the men that has been felled under the horse.

135
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,558
You can see his wounds,

136
00:06:01,558 --> 00:06:03,596
you can see blood flowing.

137
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:05,587
And if you look closely, you can notice

138
00:06:05,587 --> 00:06:10,020
the mechanism of the actual wheels of the chariots.

139
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,099
There is kind of specific engineering that's being rendered here.

140
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:17,083
Woman: One of the most interesting things about the bottom panel

141
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:21,695
is a kind of naturalism in the battle that seems to be taking place.

142
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,295
Man: You seem to move from a walk

143
00:06:23,295 --> 00:06:26,403
to a kind of canter, to a full gallop.

144
00:06:26,403 --> 00:06:29,044
Woman: On the other hand some elements are really symbolic.

145
00:06:29,044 --> 00:06:32,728
Like the felled enemies that you were talking about before.

146
00:06:32,728 --> 00:06:34,934
I don't think were meant to assume that

147
00:06:34,934 --> 00:06:37,934
there were actually just four people who died in this battle--

148
00:06:37,934 --> 00:06:38,996
that's the number we see,

149
00:06:38,996 --> 00:06:42,386
but clearly that's symbolic of many more.

150
00:06:42,386 --> 00:06:46,729
Man: The middle register shows a line of soldiers readied for battle.

151
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:48,021
They are in full garb.

152
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:49,620
They are wearing helmets and

153
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,911
these helmets have again been found in the so called "Royal" tombs.

154
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:56,502
Woman: What's wonderful about these soldiers is their regular placement

155
00:06:56,502 --> 00:06:59,479
that gives you a real sense of an army that is sort of marching along.

156
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:00,731
Man: Well you get a sense of order

157
00:07:00,731 --> 00:07:01,676
you get a sense of structure,

158
00:07:01,676 --> 00:07:03,540
you get a sense of real discipline.

159
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,943
But towards the middle of that register

160
00:07:04,943 --> 00:07:07,650
you see the actual battle taking place

161
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:12,771
and you see these soldier victorious slaying their enemies.

162
00:07:12,771 --> 00:07:14,446
On the right side of that middle register

163
00:07:14,446 --> 00:07:17,866
you see soldiers that are perhaps being captured.

164
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:20,014
Woman: And our eye in the top register goes immediately to

165
00:07:20,014 --> 00:07:22,075
the large figure at the center

166
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:24,268
which is obviously once again the king.

167
00:07:24,268 --> 00:07:28,800
His head, again, breaks the decorative border along the top.

168
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,869
On the left, a chariot and soldiers,

169
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:35,323
and on the right, other soldiers or attendants

170
00:07:35,323 --> 00:07:38,229
bringing to the king prisoners of war.

171
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:40,483
And we can tell these are prisoners of war

172
00:07:40,483 --> 00:07:42,983
because they are naked, they've been stripped

173
00:07:42,983 --> 00:07:45,037
and they are wounded and bleeding.

174
00:07:45,037 --> 00:07:48,424
Man: So there is a sense of their humiliation, their enslavement,

175
00:07:48,424 --> 00:07:51,967
and the great victory of the king.

176
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:54,003
It's interesting to look closely at

177
00:07:54,003 --> 00:07:57,491
the stylistics conventions of the rendering of the figures.

178
00:07:57,491 --> 00:08:01,105
Just about everybody is seen in perfect profile,

179
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:04,496
we see one eye, and that one eye is not so much

180
00:08:04,496 --> 00:08:06,301
looking forward as looking out.

181
00:08:06,301 --> 00:08:08,577
Woman: Right it's sort of frontal on the side of the face.

182
00:08:08,577 --> 00:08:11,233
Man: That's right, in a way that is familiar from Egyptian art.

183
00:08:11,233 --> 00:08:14,737
We see the shoulder squared with the picture plane

184
00:08:14,737 --> 00:08:18,037
and we see feet pushing in one direction

185
00:08:18,037 --> 00:08:20,366
rather than being seen in perspective.

186
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:22,919
Woman: So we can use our visual detective work,

187
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,032
but there still so much that is a mystery.

188
00:08:25,032 --> 00:08:26,702
Man: What it does tell us though,

189
00:08:26,702 --> 00:08:28,366
is that the way that we tell a story,

190
00:08:28,366 --> 00:08:30,983
the way that we tell one over time,

191
00:08:30,983 --> 00:08:32,959
the way that we organize our society.

192
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:35,292
Even now, in the twenty-first century

193
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:39,010
has a lot in common with the 3rd millennium BCE.

194
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:52,656
(piano music)
