1
00:00:05,304 --> 00:00:09,905
Steven: We're at the Museum of Modern Art looking at a really famous collage.

2
00:00:09,905 --> 00:00:14,225
It's Jean Arp's, sometimes known as "Hans" Arp, Untitled Object,

3
00:00:14,225 --> 00:00:18,629
but it's always known as Collage with Squares Arranged According to the Laws of Chance.

4
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:20,226
And That's exactly what it is.

5
00:00:20,226 --> 00:00:23,904
It's a gray piece of paper, construction paper,

6
00:00:23,904 --> 00:00:33,783
It's got some cream colored and almost denim colored squares that have been ripped into these shapes.

7
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:36,303
And then scattered on to the surface.

8
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:41,383
Beth:What strikes me is right here we're at 1916-17.

9
00:00:41,383 --> 00:00:43,630
Steven: Right in the middle of the World War.

10
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,063
Beth: right in the middle to the end of the first world war.

11
00:00:46,063 --> 00:00:49,380
But what strikes me is how far we've come from the

12
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,143
Les Demoiselles d'Avignon which is 1907.

13
00:00:52,143 --> 00:00:54,263
And really how radical

14
00:00:54,263 --> 00:01:02,713
Dada was. Completely abstract work.

15
00:01:02,713 --> 00:01:08,381
it's not arranged with any kind of artistic intention.

16
00:01:08,381 --> 00:01:10,879
Steven: It really gives to play fast

17
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:12,797
and loose with the definition of what a work of art is.

18
00:01:12,797 --> 00:01:14,583
Beth: Yes! Absolutely.

19
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:16,583
Steven: It sort of rips at the heart of what

20
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:17,582
our definition is historically

21
00:01:17,582 --> 00:01:20,023
Beth: It's not self expression, it's not still.

22
00:01:20,023 --> 00:01:23,743
It's not expression of the unconscience,

23
00:01:23,743 --> 00:01:26,463
like Surrealism would claim later.

24
00:01:26,463 --> 00:01:31,022
Steven: So it's actually, in some ways it's still challenging.

25
00:01:31,022 --> 00:01:32,504
Beth: It is.

26
00:01:32,504 --> 00:01:36,144
Steven: In that we look at paintings as a decision by the artist.

27
00:01:36,144 --> 00:01:38,583
And here that's just been given up.

28
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:40,983
It is a kind of real anti-art.

29
00:01:40,983 --> 00:01:42,503
Beth: It is anti art.

30
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:43,797
Steven: It is a real destruction

31
00:01:43,797 --> 00:01:45,380
of the very foundation with which we understand

32
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,104
how to deal with art.

33
00:01:47,104 --> 00:01:48,064
Beth: It is.

34
00:01:48,064 --> 00:01:51,463
Steve: So how do we understand this in the

35
00:01:51,463 --> 00:01:54,380
context of the war? You mentioned that this

36
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,823
was 1916, 1917, the war is raging,

37
00:01:56,823 --> 00:01:58,380
it's unprecedented.

38
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,382
But this is being made in Zurich.

39
00:02:00,382 --> 00:02:02,380
Arp was one of founders of the

40
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,223
Zurich DADA movement.

41
00:02:05,223 --> 00:02:09,742
Switzerland is a neutral country.

42
00:02:09,742 --> 00:02:12,797
And so I'm just wondering

43
00:02:12,797 --> 00:02:15,712
where is the relationship between this kind

44
00:02:15,712 --> 00:02:17,880
of aggression against the traditions

45
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,505
of art and the violence taking place

46
00:02:20,505 --> 00:02:22,065
across Europe.

47
00:02:22,065 --> 00:02:24,783
Beth: I think the answer that's usually given

48
00:02:24,783 --> 00:02:27,584
to that is that a sort of emphasis on the rational

49
00:02:27,584 --> 00:02:30,879
and human reason was part of the bourgeois culture

50
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,824
that had created the violence and irrationalness

51
00:02:34,824 --> 00:02:36,344
of World War I.

52
00:02:36,344 --> 00:02:39,421
But what strikes me is that the irrationality -

53
00:02:39,421 --> 00:02:44,024
created according to the laws of chance.

54
00:02:44,024 --> 00:02:46,797
And people are being called to the war

55
00:02:46,797 --> 00:02:49,583
they're drafted, being sent to the front lines

56
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:52,063
They live, they die, they suffer.

57
00:02:52,063 --> 00:02:55,063
You get legs and limbs amputated.

58
00:02:55,063 --> 00:02:57,943
All basically on a roll of the dice.

59
00:02:57,943 --> 00:03:00,879
Steven: Arp would have seen that.

60
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,304
The number of veterans who came

61
00:03:02,304 --> 00:03:07,063
back who were deformed and exposed to gas, disfugured.

62
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:09,783
Beth: Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

63
00:03:09,783 --> 00:03:11,223
Steven: It was extraordinary,

64
00:03:11,223 --> 00:03:12,223
and then those who came back unscathed.

65
00:03:12,223 --> 00:03:14,663
Beth: What rules are there then in Life?

66
00:03:14,663 --> 00:03:18,064
Where is the rationality for what happens to who?

67
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:20,344
What reasons?

68
00:03:20,344 --> 00:03:23,184
Steven: It actually makes the absurdity of this object

69
00:03:23,184 --> 00:03:25,213
somehow much more profound.

70
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:29,213
Beth: Yes.
