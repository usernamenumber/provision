1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,030
Let's draw a bunch of parabolic mirrors

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:08,170
In this video, I want to do a bunch of examples of objects in front of parabolic mirrors

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,600
and think about what the images of those objects will be

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,820
based on how far those objects are

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,340
Besides just giving us a better understanding of parabolic mirrors

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:25,580
this will hopefully also gives us a sense of how to conceptualize this light rays

7
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:31,020
which will be pretty useful tool when we tackle other types of reflective or refractive devices

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,310
like lenses

9
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:37,110
So that's a parabolic mirror. I've drawn its principal axis right over here

10
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,170
Let me just copy and paste this. Let me draw the focal point too

11
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:46,090
So this is the focus right over here

12
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:51,470
And this is the center of curvature, twice the distance from this point as the focus

13
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:57,610
So that is the center of curvature right over there

14
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:03,630
Let me copy and paste it so we can reuse it later on in the video

15
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,840
Alright, so I have copied that

16
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,880
Now let's put an object. I think we did this in the last video

17
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,500
Let's put an object beyond the center of curvature

18
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,260
So let's put an object here

19
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,470
The convention is to use upward pointing arrow

20
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,870
This isn't a light ray. It's used to show an object

21
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:23,320
And we use the tip of the arrow to really show the top of the object

22
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,120
and that's usually where we trace our light rays from

23
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,630
but it doesn't have to be there. You can do the middle; you can do the bottom

24
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,330
and you can figure out what the image of the object's going to be. So let me do that

25
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,900
We're dealing with parabolic mirrors

26
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,480
It's easiest to have just 2 light rays

27
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,860
one that goes parallel to the principal axis

28
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,450
and one that goes through the focus

29
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,800
because you know what's going to happen at each of those when they reflect

30
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,550
You don't have to do any math there

31
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,900
Let's have the parallel ray

32
00:01:50,910 --> 00:02:00,080
That's the parallel incident ray. When it reflects, it'll go through the focus

33
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:05,830
And Let's have an incident ray that goes through the focus

34
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,400
And when it reflects, it will be parallel

35
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,890
This is the example we actually saw in the last video

36
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,970
And so whatever light is being emitted from this point over here in that direction

37
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,650
it will come back and converge again at this point

38
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:23,870
We could actually do it at every point along the--we could do it halfway

39
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,100
This halfway point of the arrow, just to make it clear. It's the same thing

40
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:36,540
You have a parallel incident ray. It will reflect through the focus

41
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,450
And I'll just do it for this one right over here. It will reflect through the focus

42
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:48,710
And if you have an incident ray that goes through the focus, it will reflect parallel

43
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,380
So this point will correspond to this point over here

44
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,730
I think that makes it clearer that

45
00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:02,420
the image of this object was reflected by this parabolic mirror will look just like that

46
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:10,030
So it'll actually form a real image that is smaller than this original one

47
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,910
It's not so clear the way I did it over here but you can further back out

48
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:18,880
and it will be clear that this is going to be a smaller real image than that right over there

49
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,600
Now let's do a couple of more examples. So let me just paste my drawing

50
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,060
So I don't have to redraw it

51
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,740
Let's see what happens. So let me write it just so we can keep track of things

52
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:39,480
So here the image is real and smaller than the actual object

53
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,790
when the actual object is beyond the center of curvature

54
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,050
Let me make it a little bit clear by drawing another example like that

55
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:52,410
I'll do something big and way out here just to make it clear

56
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,240
So once again, we go parallel

57
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:00,290
reflect through the focus

58
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:06,530
and then we can go through the focus and then reflect out like that

59
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,980
And there you see. Now it's much clearer that the image is going to be much smaller

60
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,630
and of course inverted relative to the actual object

61
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,300
Now let's do this again

62
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:28,350
But this time, let's place the object at the center of curvature right over here

63
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:35,520
So right at that distance that's twice the distance from the vertex of the parabola to focus

64
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:43,770
So we'll do a parallel line, parallel incident ray, parallel to the principal axis

65
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,940
This is the principal axis right here

66
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,940
That's what this line is right over here. Kind of the line of symmetry of the parabola

67
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:57,930
When it reflects, it will reflect through the focus

68
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,890
and then let's take another incident ray that goes through the focus

69
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:07,560
and when it reflects, it will reflect parallel

70
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:13,290
My drawing isn't the neatest drawing on the planet. Actually let me draw it a little bit better

71
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,330
than that. Well that's pretty good. Let me just--

72
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,680
That's the incident ray that's parallel

73
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:28,540
and then an incident ray that goes through the focus

74
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,880
will then come out and reflect right over there

75
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:35,970
And they'll converge. My drawing isn't ideal

76
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,630
but the reality is that they'll converge so that the image will just be a

77
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:45,610
inverted same size version of this thing up here because it's symmetric

78
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,740
Let me see if I can redraw this whole thing so it comes out neater

79
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,660
So far, that looks good

80
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:59,240
Then you want to reflect like that, coming through the focus

81
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,880
Then you have another ray that goes through the focus

82
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,670
and this whole thing should be symmetric and then it would reflect

83
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,690
It comes back out like that. So that makes it a little bit clear

84
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:16,490
So this is the object. And its image is just an inverted version of this object

85
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:23,350
The ray converge at the same distance from the actual mirror as the actual object

86
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,090
And it's going to be the same size, just inverted

87
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:36,710
So here the image is real and the same size as the object

88
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,730
Let's just do a couple more of this

89
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,810
I think you've got the hang of it

90
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,880
You might want to try them out. You might want to pause the video and try them out on paper

91
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,980
Really nothing deep practice

92
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:53,460
So let's stick our object between the center of curvature and the focus, or the focal point

93
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,450
So if we put our object there, we could

94
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:58,220
have a light ray that goes parallel to the principal axis

95
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,960
And then it will reflect out through the focus

96
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:07,980
And then you could have another ray that goes through the focus

97
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:16,430
And then it will reflect out

98
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:22,690
Let me do it better than that. I should probably have used a more precise tool when I did all this

99
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,850
So let me draw it right over here

100
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,960
So I have the parallel one

101
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:34,040
Then it goes through the focus just like that when it gets reflected

102
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,600
Maybe I should have had a line tool for this to have neater drawings

103
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:47,590
And then a ray that goes through the focus will be reflected out parallel

104
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:52,830
At least for the light that comes from that tip, they will reconverge at that tip

105
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,850
And if you did it for every point on this arrow

106
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:59,410
the image would have been inverted arrow that is bigger than the original

107
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:03,430
And it is beyond--it's almost the opposite of the first example that we showed

108
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,590
So now the image is bigger than the original

109
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:11,590
So the image is real and it is bigger

110
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:20,650
And the image will converge beyond the center of curvature

111
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,130
And you can imagine if this was the object right here

112
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,430
then this would be the image of it, if you just trace the lines backwards

113
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:31,610
So there's some symmetry here between this example and the first one we did up here

114
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:36,450
Let's just do a couple more. Let's imagine that the object is actually at the focal point

115
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,560
Is actually at the focus

116
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,820
Let's draw an object there. Think about what would happen

117
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,050
So if we're at the focus

118
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:52,990
a ray that comes out parallel will go through the focal point, just like that

119
00:08:53,210 --> 00:09:03,700
And then here we can't have a ray that just goes into the object

120
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,990
So here I'll do a slightly different ray that intersects the parabolic mirror right over there

121
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,820
The reason why I want to do it there is because

122
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,510
there the parabolic mirror is essentially flat and essentially vertical

123
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,970
So you can kind of imagine that the incident ray is gonna be the same thing as a reflected ray

124
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:25,180
Let me draw a ray that comes in like that. This is a departure from what we did before

125
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,930
The reflected ray will come out like that

126
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:31,190
So what happens when the object is at the focal point

127
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:39,620
is that all of the light that's coming off of this object in any direction

128
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,820
will all be made parallel. So it won't converge

129
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,820
So it won't converge. So it won't be able to form a real image

130
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:53,240
And it does not look like it is diverging from some point in the mirror

131
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,430
So it even won't form a virtual image

132
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,560
So here, there will actually be no image

133
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,660
No image when the object is actually at the focal point

134
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:07,870
And then the last case as you can imagine is if an object is closer than the focal point

135
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,910
Let's draw that

136
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,300
Let's put the object at the focal point

137
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,140
So right over here

138
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:21,670
And here just for the sake of argument, I can always draw a parallel

139
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,410
Anything that's parallel will then look

140
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:32,120
to come out in a direction that would go through the focal point

141
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:36,020
Although the object itself is blocking, it will look to go in that direction

142
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,960
it will be reflected in that direction

143
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,190
And then you can imagine a ray of light that would have been coming from the focal point

144
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:48,260
or would've been coming from the same direction as a focal point

145
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:55,570
would be reflected in a parallel direction to that principal axis

146
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,660
Now these two light rays are not converging

147
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:06,980
but they look like they're diverging from some point behind the mirror

148
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:15,300
So in this case, we're forming a virtual image

149
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,160
And the virtual image will actually look something like this

150
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,830
And so it will be larger than the original

151
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,180
Virtual image

152
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:30,780
So it's kind of a magnifying. If you were to go to a fun house or amusement park, whatever

153
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,130
if you were to get close enough to a parabolic mirror

154
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:39,650
it would show a magnified version of you

155
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:43,650
Actually, let me draw that a little bit bigger just because it might not be clear

156
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,100
This is the mirror

157
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,430
That is the focal point

158
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:51,320
This right here is the principal axis

159
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:55,360
This is maybe you, maybe whatever object

160
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,510
You could draw a ray that goes parallel

161
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:01,820
It will reflect in the direction of the focal point; it will reflect out like that

162
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,350
It'll be blocked by the object though

163
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,440
And then something that looks like it would've come from the focal point

164
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,130
from the same direction as a focal point

165
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,640
would then be reflected parallel to the principal axis

166
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:17,280
So these two rays once again they're diverging, but they look like

167
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:22,220
to the human brain, to the human eye, they look like they came from that point over there

168
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,970
And so this would correspond to that point on the virtual image

169
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,520
that point on the virtual image

170
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,170
So hopefully, that gives you some practice

171
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,860
But the most important thing, it gives you some practice dealing with these

172
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,000
arbitrary ray we're showing emanating from the tip of the arrow

173
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,150
For the whole arrow, the reason we're picking these rays and these directions

174
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:45,030
is they're easy to work with. If they go through the focus, they'll come out parallel

175
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,980
If the incident ray's parallel, it'll come out through the focus
