1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,940
   

2
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:01,970
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:05,000
We'll now try to see what
trigonometric identity we can

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:15,490
come up with if we start off
with cosine of alpha plus beta.

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,880
   

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,520
Let's see if we can rewrite
this as another combination

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,170
of cosines and sines
of alpha and beta.

8
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,310
So let's get started.

9
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:30,660
And if you've already watched
the sine equivalent of this,

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,320
this proof will be pretty
similar in how we operate.

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,670
And we get a kind
of similar answer.

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,870
And something interesting is to
kind of compare the difference

13
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,385
between sine of alpha plus beta
and cosine of alpha plus

14
00:00:40,385 --> 00:00:41,900
beta after we're done.

15
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,460
So just like that last proof,
let's say that this angle-- no,

16
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,182
that color isn't bright enough.

17
00:00:47,182 --> 00:00:48,580
Let's do yellow.

18
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:53,450
Let's say that this angle
right here is alpha, and this

19
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:59,400
angle right here is beta.

20
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,160
Right?

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,340
We want to know cosine
of alpha plus beta.

22
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:07,560
So alpha plus beta is this
large angle right here.

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,140
Right?

24
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,550
So what's the cosine of that?

25
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,890
SOH, CAH, TOA.

26
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,930
So cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse.

27
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:15,160
Right?

28
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,390
SOH, CAH, TOA.

29
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:16,830
CAH.

30
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,240
   

31
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:28,980
So cosine is equal to
adjacent over hypotenuse.

32
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,730
So for this large angle,
what's the adjacent?

33
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,570
It's line AC.

34
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,350
So that equals-- line AC,
that's the adjacent.

35
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,120
   

36
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,890
The length of line AC over
the length of line--

37
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,790
what's the hypotenuse?

38
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,270
AB, right?

39
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:50,810
All right.

40
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:56,400
AC over AB.

41
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,670
Now let's see what we
can do with this.

42
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:02,640
AC-- adjacent over hypotenuse.

43
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,100
Now can we write AC in any
other interesting way-- a

44
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:12,290
combination of some of the
other lines on this very

45
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,070
fortunately designed graph?

46
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,230
Let's see.

47
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:20,640
Well isn't AC the same thing
as AF, this big line,

48
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,660
minus-- what is this?

49
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,610
This is a D, right?

50
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:23,805
OK.

51
00:02:23,805 --> 00:02:25,020
That's a D.

52
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,920
Let me rewrite that as a D.

53
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,770
D as in dog.

54
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:30,440
There you go.

55
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,570
So AF minus DE.

56
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,210
Right?

57
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,090
Oh, I forgot to
draw some things.

58
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,330
We assume that this line is
perpendicular to that line.

59
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,790
We assume this line is
perpendicular to that line.

60
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:43,060
We assume that line is
perpendicular to that line.

61
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:43,450
Right?

62
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,470
And then by definition, that is
because we drew it that way.

63
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,610
But anyway.

64
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,720
So now you know that this line
is parallel to this line and

65
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,730
this line is perpendicular.

66
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:59,770
So we know that AF, this long
line, minus DE is equal to AC.

67
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,560
Does that make sense?

68
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:08,800
AF, this big line, minus
the shorter line is

69
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,070
the same thing as AC.

70
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,600
Right?

71
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,570
So let me write that down.

72
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:25,850
That equals AF minus DE,
all of that over AB.

73
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:29,720
   

74
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,935
And then, of course, we can
rewrite that as-- and I'm going

75
00:03:32,935 --> 00:03:43,080
to switch to some different
colors-- as AF over AB.

76
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,940
   

77
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,650
Let me switch to maybe green.

78
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:58,100
Minus DE over AB.

79
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:07,600
So we have now AF over
AB minus DE over AB.

80
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,320
And those are kind of
nonsensical ratios to me.

81
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,300
Wouldn't it be great if
we could express it

82
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,640
somehow as AF over AE?

83
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,300
Because then we could say well
that's cosine of alpha, and

84
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,050
do something from there.

85
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:20,850
Well let's try.

86
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,960
So let's try to rewrite
this first expression.

87
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,720
So I'll switch back to
the purple just so you

88
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,890
know where this first
expression is coming from.

89
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:31,690
Let's see if we can break
this down as AF over AE

90
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:32,690
times something else.

91
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,710
Well, we could just
algebraically do it.

92
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:41,760
That's equivalent to AF over--
I might run out of space--

93
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:52,170
over AE times AE over AB.

94
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,370
And you're saying, Sal where
did you get that from?

95
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,870
Well, you can kind of say my
motivation was to have AF

96
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,540
as a ratio of over AE.

97
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:04,330
And I just set it up so that
the multiplication would cancel

98
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,310
out, because the AE's would
cancel out and you'd be

99
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,550
left with AF over AB.

100
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:07,810
Right?

101
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,490
So this is a reasonable
thing to do.

102
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,200
I hope you see.

103
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,520
And let me switch to the green
and do something similar.

104
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,310
DE over AB doesn't
make much sense.

105
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:24,680
But if I could maybe do DE over
BE, then if this angle I can

106
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,670
see is similar to alpha or
beta then maybe I can

107
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,060
make some progress.

108
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:45,420
So let's say DE over BE times--
and we'll do the same thing.

109
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:50,245
You just have to multiply
times BE over AB.

110
00:05:50,245 --> 00:05:53,390
   

111
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:56,790
And just like in that sine
proof, and we'll do the same

112
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,760
thing here, let's figure out
what this angle up here is.

113
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,040
Right?

114
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,950
Because if we know that then
these ratios become useful.

115
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,730
So if this angle is an alpha,
then we know that this

116
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,860
angle right here is alpha.

117
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,140
Right?

118
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,800
Because DE-- because this
line-- is parallel to AF.

119
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,100
You learned that in geometry.

120
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,395
And if this angle is alpha we
know that this angle right here

121
00:06:17,395 --> 00:06:21,850
is 90 minus alpha, because
it's complementary.

122
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:22,110
Right?

123
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,020
Because this whole angle
is 90 degrees, so this

124
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,730
is 90 minus alpha.

125
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:29,670
And since this angle 90 minus
alpha, this angle 90, and this

126
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:34,580
angle add up to 180, we could
figure out that this is alpha.

127
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:39,030
And if you don't believe me add
up alpha plus 90 plus 90 minus

128
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,190
alpha, and you will
get 180 degrees.

129
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:46,022
So this angle up here,
angle DBE, is alpha.

130
00:06:46,022 --> 00:06:47,860
So that's very interesting.

131
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:53,450
So can we rewrite these ratios
as the sines or cosines

132
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,360
of alpha's or beta's?

133
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,230
Well, let's try.

134
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,970
Let me switch back to purple.

135
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:02,330
So that equals--
what is AF over AE?

136
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:06,340
   

137
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,880
Well if we look at this right
triangle, that's the adjacent

138
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,820
over the hypotenuse for alpha.

139
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,760
Right?

140
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,000
Adjacent over hypotenuse,
that's cosine.

141
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,200
So it's cosine of alpha.

142
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:22,290
   

143
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,030
And what's AE over AB?

144
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:28,300
   

145
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,920
Well, they're similar.

146
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,840
If we look at this big right
triangle right here that is the

147
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,950
adjacent over the hypotenuse
for beta, so it's

148
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,930
cosine of beta.

149
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:42,790
   

150
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,970
Switch my colors.

151
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:49,515
Minus DE over BE.

152
00:07:49,515 --> 00:07:52,930
   

153
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,570
Well this is alpha, right?

154
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,440
Now there's a little smudge.

155
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,420
You probably can't read it.

156
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:56,980
But that was alpha.

157
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,420
We showed that that was alpha.

158
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,310
So DE is the opposite and
BE is the hypotenuse.

159
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,540
Opposite over hypotenuse
is sine, right?

160
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,880
So that's sine of alpha.

161
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,780
   

162
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,780
And what is BE over AB?

163
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,710
   

164
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,900
Look at this triangle again.

165
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,000
Well, for beta that is
BE is the opposite and

166
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,250
AB is the hypotenuse.

167
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,280
So opposite over
hypotenuse for beta.

168
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,170
So it's the sine of beta.

169
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,240
Times the sine of beta.

170
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,860
I'm running out of space.

171
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,660
I have to go to another line.

172
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:32,330
   

173
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,390
Pretty neat.

174
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:39,255
I'll rewrite everything in
a new and exciting color.

175
00:08:39,255 --> 00:08:44,230
   

176
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,620
OK.

177
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,860
Let me do it in light blue.

178
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:55,340
So we now know that the cosine
of alpha plus beta is equal to

179
00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:00,970
the cosine of both of them
multiplied-- so cosine of

180
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:10,070
alpha, cosine of beta-- minus
the sine of both of

181
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,880
them multiplied.

182
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:17,140
Minus sine of alpha
times sine of beta.

183
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,850
I hope you found that
as satisfying as I do.

184
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,080
See you in the next
presentation.
