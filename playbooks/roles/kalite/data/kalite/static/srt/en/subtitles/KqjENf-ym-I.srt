A functional group is a group of atoms and bonds that possess a predictable chemical behaviour.

2
00:00:05,967 --> 00:00:13,026
We're gonna cover the most common functional groups that you will see in a college organic chemistry class

3
00:00:13,026 --> 00:00:24,530
And you can group them into 3 categories. The first category will have carbon with multiple bonds

4
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:29,966
So lets look at an example where carbon has more than 1 bond.

5
00:00:29,966 --> 00:00:35,883
Well if carbon is bonded to one other carbon atom, we've already referred to this as an alkene.

6
00:00:35,883 --> 00:00:44,216
If i were to complete my dot structure over here, I would know that i need two more bonds on my carbons like that

7
00:00:44,216 --> 00:00:54,933
And those could be connected to just not anything, so we're gonna put an R group here to represent the fact that there could be just anything attached to the carbons

8
00:00:54,933 --> 00:01:03,413
And R stands for the rest of the molecule, or the remainder of the molecules.

9
00:01:03,413 --> 00:01:10,277
Usually we are talking about carbons and hydrogens here but could be 1 carbon, 2 carbons or 5 carbons

10
00:01:10,277 --> 00:01:14,277
It doesnt really matter. It just allows us to focus on the alkene functional group

11
00:01:16,213 --> 00:01:20,992
So if I were to draw an example of an alkene I could put my double bond in here.

12
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:25,015
And then on either side of double bond I could put just about anything, right?
