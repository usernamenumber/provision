1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,140
   

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,910
In the last video, I said that
we started off with the change

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,119
in distance, so we
said that we know

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:09,369
the change in distance.

5
00:00:09,369 --> 00:00:11,490
   

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,350
These are the things
that we are given.

7
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,610
We're given the acceleration,
we're given the initial

8
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,910
velocity, and I asked you how
do we figure out what the

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,070
final velocity is?

10
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,290
In the last video-- if you don't
remember it, go watch

11
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:28,960
that last video again-- we
derived the formula that vf

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,640
squared, the final velocity
squared, is equal to the

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,180
initial velocity squared
plus 2 times

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,680
the change in distance.

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,320
You'll sometimes just see it
written as 2 times distance,

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,570
because we assume that the
initial distance is at point

17
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,470
0, so the change in distance
would just

18
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,540
be the final distance.

19
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,620
We could write it either way,
and hopefully, at this point,

20
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,600
you see why I keep switching
between change in

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,060
distance and distance.

22
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,740
It's just so you're comfortable
when you see it

23
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,630
either way.

24
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,330
This is for the situation
when we didn't

25
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,230
know what the vf was.

26
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:11,330
Let's say we want to solve
for time instead.

27
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,470
Once we solve for the final
velocity, we could actually

28
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,620
solve for time, and I'll show
you how to do that, but let's

29
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,460
say we didn't want to go through
this step-- how can we

30
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,560
solve for time directly, given
the change in distance, the

31
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,140
acceleration, and the
initial velocity?

32
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:27,620
Let's go back once again to
the most basic distance

33
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,040
formula-- not the distance
formula, but how distance

34
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,290
relates to velocity.

35
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:36,010
We know that-- I'll write it
slightly different this time--

36
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:44,130
the change in distance over the
change in time is equal to

37
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,520
the average velocity.

38
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:56,030
We could have rewritten this as
the change in distance is

39
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:00,780
equal to the average velocity
times the change in time.

40
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,130
This is change in time and
change in distance.

41
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:07,510
Sometimes we'll just see this
written as d equals-- let me

42
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,440
write this in a different
color, so we have some

43
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:16,640
variety-- velocity times time,
or d equals rate times time.

44
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,010
The reason why I have change in
distance here, or change in

45
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,310
time, is that I'm not assuming
necessarily that we're

46
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,920
starting off at the point
0 or at time 0.

47
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,340
If we do, then it just turns out
to the final distance is

48
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,920
equal to the average velocity
times the final time, but

49
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,950
let's stick to this.

50
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:37,720
We want to figure out time
given this set of inputs.

51
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:45,090
   

52
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,200
Let's go from this equation.

53
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,670
If we want to solve for time,
or the change in time, we

54
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,730
could just could divide both
sides by the average

55
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,600
velocity-- actually, no,
let's not do that.

56
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,180
Let's just stay in terms
of change in distance.

57
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,266
   

58
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:08,740
I've wasted space too fast,
so let me clear

59
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,670
this and start again.

60
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:23,750
We're given change in distance,
initial velocity,

61
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,780
and acceleration, and we want
to figure out what the time

62
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,810
is-- it's really the change in
time, but let's just assume

63
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,070
that we start time 0, so it's
kind of the final time.

64
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:37,150
   

65
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,230
Let's just start with the simple
formula: distance, or

66
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:44,790
change in distance-- I'll use
them interchangeably, with a

67
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,990
lower case d this time-- is
equal to the average velocity

68
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,320
times time.

69
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,570
What's the average velocity?

70
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:56,600
   

71
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,730
The average velocity is just the
initial velocity plus the

72
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,230
final velocity over 2.

73
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:07,565
The only reason why we can just
average the initial and

74
00:04:07,565 --> 00:04:09,410
the final is because we're
assuming constant

75
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:12,240
acceleration, and that's very
important, but in most

76
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,840
projectile problems, we do have
constant acceleration--

77
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,890
downwards-- and that's
gravity.

78
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,899
We can assume, and we can do
this-- we can say that the

79
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:22,070
average of the initial and the
final velocity is the average

80
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,080
velocity, and then we multiply
that times time.

81
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,050
   

82
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,700
Can we use this equation
directly?

83
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,310
No. we know acceleration, but
don't know final velocity.

84
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,040
If we can write this final
velocity in terms of the other

85
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,060
things in this equation, then
maybe we can solve for time.

86
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:47,960
Let's try to do that: distance
is equal to-- let me take a

87
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,250
little side here.

88
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,870
What do we know about
final velocity?

89
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:57,850
We know that the change in
velocity is equal to

90
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,620
acceleration times time,
assuming that time

91
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,900
starts a t equals 0.

92
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:09,040
The change in velocity is the
same thing is vf minus vi is

93
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,860
equal to acceleration
times time.

94
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,250
We know that the final velocity
is equal to the

95
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,860
initial velocity plus
acceleration times time.

96
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,550
Let's substitute that
back into what I was

97
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,890
writing right here.

98
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:28,170
We have distance is equal to the
initial velocity plus the

99
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,530
final velocity, so let's
substitute this expression

100
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,435
right here.

101
00:05:32,435 --> 00:05:36,835
The initial velocity, plus, now
the final velocity is now

102
00:05:36,835 --> 00:05:41,910
the initial velocity, plus
acceleration times time, and

103
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:48,000
then we divide all of that
by 2 times time.

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,610
We get d is equal to-- we have
2 in the numerator, we have 2

105
00:05:53,610 --> 00:06:02,510
initial velocity, 2vi's plus
at over 2, and all

106
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,600
of that times t.

107
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,730
Then we can simplify this.

108
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:12,380
This equals d is equal to-- this
2 cancels out this 2, and

109
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:16,260
then we distribute this t across
both terms-- so d is

110
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:24,820
equal to vit plus-- this term
is at over 2, but then you

111
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,300
multiply the t times here, too--
so it's at squared over

112
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:34,190
2 plus at squared over 2.

113
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,480
We could use this formula
if we know the change in

114
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,490
distance, or the distance-- this
actually should be the

115
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,190
change in distance, and the
change in time-- is equal to

116
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:47,030
the initial velocity times time
plus acceleration times

117
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,860
squared divided by 2.

118
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,860
Let me summarize all of the
equations we have, because we

119
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,630
really now have in our arsenal
every equation that you really

120
00:06:55,630 --> 00:07:00,400
need to solve one dimensional
projectile problems-- things

121
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,080
going either just left, right,
east, west, or north, south,

122
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,000
but not both.

123
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,340
I will do that in
the next video.

124
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,060
Let's summarize everything
we know.

125
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,820
   

126
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:19,970
We know the change in distance
divided by the change in time

127
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,730
is equal to velocity-- average
velocity, and it would equal

128
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,830
velocity if velocity's not
changing, but average when

129
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,597
velocity does change-- and we
have constant acceleration,

130
00:07:29,597 --> 00:07:31,700
which is an important
assumption.

131
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,870
We know that the change in
velocity divided by the change

132
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:40,500
in time is equal to
acceleration.

133
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:47,300
We know the average velocity is
equal to the final velocity

134
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,650
plus the initial velocity
over 2, and this assumes

135
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:52,900
acceleration is constant.

136
00:07:52,900 --> 00:08:01,870
   

137
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,870
If we know the initial velocity,
acceleration, and

138
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:09,540
the distance, and we want to
figure out the final velocity,

139
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:20,300
we could use this formula: vf
squared equals vi squared plus

140
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:25,603
2a times-- really the change in
distance, so I'm going to

141
00:08:25,603 --> 00:08:27,500
write the change in distance,
because that sometimes matters

142
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,890
when we're dealing with
direction-- change in

143
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,299
distance, but so you'll
sometimes just

144
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:34,919
write this as distance.

145
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,970
Then we just did the equation--
I think I did this

146
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:40,440
in the third video, as well,
early on-- but we also learned

147
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:47,870
that distance is equal to the
initial velocity times time

148
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:53,230
plus at squared over 2.

149
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:56,230
In that example that I did a
couple of videos ago, where we

150
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,160
had a cliff-- actually,
I only have a minute

151
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,890
left in this video.

152
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,880
I will do that in the
next presentation.

153
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,270
I'll see you soon.

154
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:03,900
