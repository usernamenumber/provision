1
00:00:06,372 --> 00:00:07,481
We’re in S G M

2
00:00:07,481 --> 00:00:10,633
across the Grand Canal from S M in Venice.

3
00:00:10,633 --> 00:00:13,823
And we’re looking at Tintoretto’s 'Last Supper.'

4
00:00:13,823 --> 00:00:16,944
It’s located in the sanctuary of the church –

5
00:00:16,944 --> 00:00:18,184
on the right wall

6
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,383
And it’s huge.

7
00:00:19,383 --> 00:00:21,663
This is such an untraditional version

8
00:00:21,663 --> 00:00:23,817
of this subject – very mannerist.

9
00:00:23,817 --> 00:00:26,306
We’re so used to looking at Leonardo da Vinci’s

10
00:00:26,306 --> 00:00:28,060
Last Supper in Milan.

11
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,414
That’s a painting where the table

12
00:00:29,414 --> 00:00:31,503
is drawn across horizontally –

13
00:00:31,503 --> 00:00:33,518
which is such a high Renaissance example

14
00:00:33,518 --> 00:00:35,005
of the use of linear perspective –

15
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:36,908
with Christ as the vanishing point –

16
00:00:36,908 --> 00:00:38,319
at the very center of the painting –

17
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:40,112
at the very center of the table.

18
00:00:40,112 --> 00:00:42,397
And here, everything is askew.

19
00:00:42,397 --> 00:00:46,690
And Leonardo uses natural light – without halos.

20
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,355
Christ is framed by a window.

21
00:00:48,355 --> 00:00:52,774
But here, the figure of Christ actually glows from within –

22
00:00:52,774 --> 00:00:56,013
in a return to spiritual symbolism.

23
00:00:56,013 --> 00:00:59,371
And the spiritual permeates the entire space of this painting

24
00:00:59,371 --> 00:01:01,736
in a very evident way.

25
00:01:01,736 --> 00:01:04,305
Light is central to understanding this painting.

26
00:01:04,305 --> 00:01:06,279
There are really only two light sources here

27
00:01:06,279 --> 00:01:08,369
in this very dark painting

28
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:09,945
Closer to us, on the upper left,

29
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:11,174
you have a lantern,

30
00:01:11,174 --> 00:01:13,060
which just dances with light

31
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,831
and flame and smoke.

32
00:01:14,831 --> 00:01:17,288
And then there’s the divine emanation.

33
00:01:17,288 --> 00:01:20,117
And from that lamp, in the upper left,

34
00:01:20,117 --> 00:01:21,926
angels are illuminated.

35
00:01:21,926 --> 00:01:24,622
And we see them floating all over the ceiling.

36
00:01:24,622 --> 00:01:27,213
It’s not that high Renaissance way of

37
00:01:27,213 --> 00:01:31,159
indicating the spiritual through the natural –

38
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,516
through reality.

39
00:01:32,516 --> 00:01:35,910
Here, Tintoretto is not afraid to paint angels.

40
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,073
There is a kind of divine revelation.

41
00:01:38,073 --> 00:01:39,799
The light that emanates

42
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:43,140
from Christ’s halo seems quite strong.

43
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,263
If you look at the woman

44
00:01:44,263 --> 00:01:45,989
who kneels in the foreground –

45
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:47,145
slightly to the right –

46
00:01:47,145 --> 00:01:48,506
you’ll see that, in Christ’s light,

47
00:01:48,506 --> 00:01:50,819
her head casts a deep shadow

48
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,555
that [creates] a diagonal that points us towards Christ.

49
00:01:53,555 --> 00:01:55,657
And then the apostles around the table

50
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,409
also have halos of light –

51
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:00,278
although smaller than the light from Christ.

52
00:02:00,278 --> 00:02:02,407
But this painting is all about energy.

53
00:02:02,407 --> 00:02:03,515
It’s all about drama.

54
00:02:03,515 --> 00:02:06,603
Look at the way the primary diagonal of the table

55
00:02:06,603 --> 00:02:09,107
moves us back with incredible speed

56
00:02:09,123 --> 00:02:10,522
back to a vanishing point

57
00:02:10,522 --> 00:02:12,295
in the upper right corner of the painting.

58
00:02:12,295 --> 00:02:13,448
And actually, I’m not even sure

59
00:02:13,448 --> 00:02:16,090
that it’s a correct use of linear perspective.

60
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,166
That table tilts forward –

61
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,101
So that he’s playing fast and loose

62
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:23,789
with those very ideas that were so critical

63
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:25,723
to the high Renaissance –

64
00:02:25,723 --> 00:02:27,354
like linearperspective.

65
00:02:27,354 --> 00:02:29,728
Pictorial spaces seem literally up ended.

66
00:02:29,728 --> 00:02:33,011
The space rises so steeply, and so dramatically,

67
00:02:33,011 --> 00:02:33,923
and so quickly.

68
00:02:33,923 --> 00:02:37,239
And form itself seems to have dissolved

69
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:40,427
under the power of his line and color.

70
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:41,841
Tintoretto said that his goal

71
00:02:41,841 --> 00:02:44,949
was to unite the two different traditions

72
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:46,429
of the Florentine Renaissance

73
00:02:46,429 --> 00:02:47,539
and the Venetian Renaissance –

74
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:51,372
the line of the Tuscan tradition of Michelangelo

75
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:52,766
and the color of Titian.

76
00:02:52,766 --> 00:02:55,637
He had a sign written on his studio wall

77
00:02:55,652 --> 00:02:57,177
that said exactly that.

78
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,267
When I look at this painting

79
00:02:58,267 --> 00:03:00,091
I feel pulled in different directions.

80
00:03:00,091 --> 00:03:02,426
I feel pulled by the velocity

81
00:03:02,426 --> 00:03:05,017
of the orthogonals of the table.

82
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:08,202
And then I feel pulled by the light around Christ.

83
00:03:08,202 --> 00:03:11,025
And then I also feel pulled to anecdotal details

84
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:13,114
that are around the periphery.

85
00:03:13,114 --> 00:03:15,735
The figure serving food on the right, for example.

86
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:17,142
or in the foreground.

87
00:03:17,142 --> 00:03:20,802
Or the apostles reacting and talking to each other,

88
00:03:20,802 --> 00:03:22,084
after Christ’s words,

89
00:03:22,084 --> 00:03:23,975
”Take this bread, for this is my body,” and,

90
00:03:23,975 --> 00:03:25,786
“Take this wine, for this is my blood"

91
00:03:25,786 --> 00:03:28,369
and Christ has stood up [and] turned.

92
00:03:28,369 --> 00:03:29,186
[And] seems to be offering the bread.

93
00:03:29,186 --> 00:03:31,369
And so we have the literal enactment

94
00:03:31,369 --> 00:03:32,306
of the Eucharist.

95
00:03:32,306 --> 00:03:33,592
It’s much more active.

96
00:03:33,592 --> 00:03:35,594
I want to go back to that idea of the anecdotal.

97
00:03:35,594 --> 00:03:36,688
Yes, the woman's serving food.

98
00:03:36,688 --> 00:03:39,274
But notice that she’s reaching into a basket.

99
00:03:39,274 --> 00:03:42,499
And a cat happens to be looking in that basket, as well.

100
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:44,869
There is this very solemn event that's taking place.

101
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:46,858
And yet, at the same time, it's surrounded

102
00:03:46,858 --> 00:03:48,725
by elements that are simply not important.

103
00:03:48,725 --> 00:03:51,004
and make this a human event.

104
00:03:51,004 --> 00:03:54,980
That's right. Make it, in a way, more real

105
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,851
than the pared down, harmonious, balanced image

106
00:03:57,851 --> 00:04:00,372
that Leonardo gives us of the Last Supper.

107
00:04:00,372 --> 00:04:02,310
And that's what I find so incongruous

108
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,494
about this dark painting.

109
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,832
and all of its solemnity – yes – but all of its energy

110
00:04:07,832 --> 00:04:10,515
within this very staid environment

111
00:04:10,515 --> 00:04:14,240
of the church by P – S G M.

112
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,650
We are in a pristine, white building.

113
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:20,718
And yet this painting is so dark and so mysterious.

114
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:23,764
And yet Paladio has made everything evident of us.

115
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:27,588
with its classicism, its order, its precision, its logic,

116
00:04:27,588 --> 00:04:29,178
its rationality.

117
00:04:29,178 --> 00:04:31,607
And then, in this Tintoretto, we enter into

118
00:04:31,607 --> 00:04:34,409
the realm of the spiritural – the supernatural.

119
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:36,473
This is not the realm of the rational at all.

120
00:04:36,473 --> 00:04:39,868
We move from the high Renaissance

121
00:04:39,868 --> 00:04:45,196
classicism of Paladio into the mannerism of a Tintoretto.
