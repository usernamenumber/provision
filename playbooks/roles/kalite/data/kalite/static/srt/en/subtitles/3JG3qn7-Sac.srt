1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,670
   

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,190
So where we left off in the
last video, we kept trying to

3
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:07,900
approximate this purple f
of x with a polynomial.

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,510
And we at first said we'll just
make the polynomial a constant

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:16,190
and set it -- it's just going
to intersect f of 0

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,880
at x is equal to 0.

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,940
So that's a first -- you can
kind of all think of it as a

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,590
0 of order approximation
of the function.

9
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,230
Then we said, oh, what if not
only do they intersect at x is

10
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,920
equal to 0, but let's say that
their slope is the same as x is

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,140
equal to 0, and that's
that approximation?

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,470
And that's about as good as
you're going to do with a

13
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,020
line, especially as
you get close to 0.

14
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,820
And we said, OK, that's good,
but what if their second

15
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:37,650
derivative is the same?

16
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,380
And that's where we ended
up with -- we added

17
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,690
this term here.

18
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,360
And I hinted that we'll just
keep doing this process.

19
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:50,360
   

20
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,880
And so you could imagine, if I
want the third derivative to be

21
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,910
the same, I could add another
term right here, plus, where I

22
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:03,310
know what the value of f of
x's third derivative is at 0.

23
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:07,860
So I'll write that as f to
the third derivative at

24
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,130
0 times x to the third.

25
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,280
Now what do you think is
going to be down here?

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,490
What's going to be
he denominator?

27
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:22,690
You might be tempted to say
that we'll put a 3 down here.

28
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,000
But it turns out you're going
to put a 3 times a 2, which

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,910
is a 6, or 3 factorial.

30
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,700
Now why is that?

31
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,560
Let me just take a little
departure here and I think

32
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,700
you'll start to understand
why you put a 6 down here.

33
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,510
Why this isn't a 3
and you put a 6.

34
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,370
Here you put a 2, but 2 is
also 2 factorial, right?

35
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,000
2 factorial is 2
times 1, right?

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,480
Hopefully you remember what
factorial -- actually, let

37
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,140
me tell you what factorial
is just in case.

38
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,610
10 factorial is equal to 10
times 9 times 8 times 7, dah,

39
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,510
dah, dah, dah, times 2 times 1.

40
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,870
So you're multiplying all of
the numbers up to that number.

41
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:01,380
4 factorial -- and the numbers
get big very, very fast -- is

42
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,670
4 times 3 times 2 times 1.

43
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,960
2 factorial is equal
to 2 times 1.

44
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,060
1 factorial is equal to 1.

45
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,290
Now this is kind of
a weird definition.

46
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,820
It comes out of combinatorics.

47
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,100
Actually it works for what
we're doing is, well, 0

48
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,850
factorial is also equal to 1.

49
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,470
I know that might be a
little un-intuitive.

50
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,700
This is just a definition.

51
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,280
It's like saying that i squared
is equal to negative 1.

52
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,450
It is a definition that it
makes formulas be more

53
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,720
general, I guess is a
simple way to put it.

54
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,790
But let me erase all of this
because that was just a

55
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,580
divergence just because I
realized I was going to use

56
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,100
factorial, so you should
know what a factorial is.

57
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,825
But I think that's a fairly
straightforward concept.

58
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,850
   

59
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,820
So going back to
what we were doing.

60
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:49,030
I was asking you why do I put
a 6 down here instead of a

61
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,810
3, like we put a 2 here?

62
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,840
Well, let's just take
this term alone and take

63
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,770
its third derivative.

64
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:02,840
So if I have the term and it's
f, the third derivative at 0, x

65
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,280
to the third over -- and
let me just write 6 as

66
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,240
3 times 2 or 2 times 3.

67
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,210
That'll make it a
little more clear.

68
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,500
What's the first
derivative here?

69
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,010
What happens when I take
the derivative once?

70
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,080
Well, I'm going to multiply the
whole thing by the 6 exponent

71
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,230
and decrement the
exponent, right?

72
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,660
So I'm going to multiply the
whole thing times 3 times f,

73
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,660
the third derivative, x
squared over 2 times 3.

74
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,600
So that first time I did
it, this 3 and this

75
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,100
3 cancel out, right?

76
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,850
That red's looking a
little bit too demonic.

77
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,630
Let me pick another color.

78
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,150
And then when I take the
second derivative what

79
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,110
am I going to get?

80
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:46,390
Well, the 3's gone, now I just
have a 2 in the denominator, so

81
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:52,760
I multiply the whole thing by 2
times f prime prime prime of 0

82
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,830
times, and I decrement the
exponent, x to the 1 over 2.

83
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,390
Well, now the 2's
cancel out, right?

84
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,580
So the reason why you're
putting a factorial there is

85
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,645
every time you take a
derivative you're decrementing

86
00:04:01,645 --> 00:04:04,360
the exponent 1, and multiplying
the whole expression

87
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,010
by the exponent.

88
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,460
So if you're going to take n
derivative, you're essentially

89
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:14,070
going to be multiplying this
expression times n factorial.

90
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,130
So you don't want an n
factorial out here.

91
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,560
You put an n factorial
at the bottom.

92
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,380
Hopefully that makes sense.

93
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,300
Play around with it yourself
and it should start to make

94
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,290
a little bit more sense.

95
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,970
So in general, if we just
kept doing this process

96
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,350
forever, what would the
function look like?

97
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:36,200
   

98
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,580
The reason why I'm covering
this is because going this way

99
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,390
we're going to be able to prove
what I think is the most

100
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:47,090
mind-bending concept
in mathematics.

101
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:51,590
And it will make you love
mathematics, hopefully.

102
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,490
Some people actually --
well, I won't go into the

103
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,570
spiritual aspects of it.

104
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,990
So what would be this, if I
just kept saying that I'm

105
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,710
just going to keep taking
derivatives and adding them to

106
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,730
this term, this polynomial?

107
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:11,290
Well, the polynomial would
become p of x is equal to f

108
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:18,440
of 0 plus f prime of 0 x.

109
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,010
And let's just divide it by 1
factorial, just to make it

110
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,640
clear that that's a
1 factorial, right?

111
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,690
And that's an x
to the 1, right?

112
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,060
That's just this term,
but I just wrote it a

113
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,980
little differently.

114
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,250
This term right here, this
is f of 0 times x to the 0.

115
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,650
I know that's really
messy, but hopefully you

116
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,270
see what I'm saying.

117
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,640
And that's over 0
factorial, right?

118
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,920
0 factorial is 1, x to the 0
is 1, so it's just f of 0.

119
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:46,740
And then plus the second
derivative at 0 times x squared

120
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,570
over 2 factorial plus --
and we just keep adding.

121
00:05:51,570 --> 00:06:00,170
The third derivative at x is
equal to 0 of x to the third

122
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,970
over 3 factorial, and
we just keep going on.

123
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,430
So we could do
this to infinity.

124
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,810
And actually we will do
it, and this is called

125
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,240
the Maclaurin Series.

126
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,570
So if we just wanted to
approximate this as hard as we

127
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:18,410
can, essentially take the
infinite derivatives of it, we

128
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,090
get the Maclaurin Series.

129
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:24,340
So we are going to define
this polynomial p of x.

130
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:29,120
It's going to be the infinite
series, the infinite sum.

131
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,260
Let's start with n is equal
to 0, and we're going

132
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,415
to go to infinity.

133
00:06:33,415 --> 00:06:36,450
   

134
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,580
What is each term?

135
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,180
It's going to be f of -- well
it's going to be f, the nth

136
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:57,220
derivative of f evaluated at
0 times x to the n

137
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,950
over n factorial.

138
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,260
This is the Maclaurin Series.

139
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:07,730
We're later learn that the
Maclaurin Series is a specific

140
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:12,070
example of the Taylor Series,
which is a specific example

141
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:15,150
of a power series.

142
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,140
But anyway, this might seem
very complicated to you.

143
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,350
I have all the sigma notation.

144
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,830
Just remember, this is
essentially just that and I

145
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,240
just keep going to infinity.

146
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,030
And if you play around with
it it should make sense.

147
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,580
But I think this will become a
lot more concrete when I do

148
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,200
this with a specific f of x.

149
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,230
This is where it gets cool.

150
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:36,910
In case you don't think
it's already cool.

151
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:41,470
So let's pick f of x to be,
to me, the most amazing

152
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,010
function of them all.

153
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:47,420
If I ever built a shrine or
a church or something or

154
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:51,100
skyscraper, I would somehow
make this function show up all

155
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,220
over the place, and then years
from now people would be awed

156
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,960
by the mysticism of it all.

157
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,280
But anyway, let's try to
approximate e to the x

158
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,690
with a Maclaurin Series.

159
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,120
You know that sigma thing,
that's hard to memorize.

160
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,020
Just remember you want all the
derivatives to be the same.

161
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,590
So let's make the
approximation of this.

162
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,960
   

163
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,795
Actually, I won't prove it.

164
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:16,820
It's out of the scope of
what we're doing right now.

165
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,030
But the approximation, even
when it's centered at 0,

166
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:22,660
actually equals the function
when you take the infinite sum.

167
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,470
But let's just see
what it looks like.

168
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,890
Because this is pretty cool.

169
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,940
Before we start building the
polynomial, let's just figure

170
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,550
out a couple of things.

171
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:35,590
So what is f prime of x?

172
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,470
That's also e to the x, right?

173
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:40,540
What's f prime prime of x?

174
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,170
Well that also
equals e to the x.

175
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:45,140
We have learned and actually
recently did a proof that

176
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,050
the derivative of e to
the x is e to the x.

177
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,720
But that also needs a second
derivative and the third and

178
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,946
the fourth and the nth
derivative of e to the x

179
00:08:50,946 --> 00:08:52,600
is equal to e to the x.

180
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,040
I could take an arbitrary
number of derivatives of e

181
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,700
to the x and it equals e to
the x, which is amazing.

182
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,300
The rate of change of the
function at any point is

183
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,360
equal to the function.

184
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,360
The rate of change of the rate
of change of the function at

185
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,660
any point is equal
to the function.

186
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,570
I mean that's -- I want to just
go some place and ponder it,

187
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,400
but I'm too busy making videos.

188
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,320
But anyway, back to
what we were doing.

189
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,040
So what is f of 0?

190
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,230
f of 0 is equal to e to the 0,
which is equal to 1, right?

191
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,390
Well that's also going
to be f prime of 0.

192
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,560
That's also e to the 0,
which is equal to 1.

193
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:37,350
So all of the derivatives, the
nth derivative at 0 is going to

194
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:41,522
equal 1 for this specific case
of f of x, for e to the x.

195
00:09:41,522 --> 00:09:43,990
And this is why
this is so cool.

196
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:47,130
But actually, it actually
gets even more amazing.

197
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:50,450
   

198
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:54,240
So, you hopefully realize
that f of 0 and all of

199
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,320
its derivatives at
0 are equal to 1.

200
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,530
So now we can do the powers
of the Maclaurin Series

201
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,530
in the next video.

202
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,032
See you soon.
