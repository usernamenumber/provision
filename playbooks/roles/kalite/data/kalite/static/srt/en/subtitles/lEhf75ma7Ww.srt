1
00:00:01,009 --> 00:00:05,538
In the following table, is y a function of x?

2
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:08,411
In order for y to be a function of x

3
00:00:08,411 --> 00:00:13,002
for any x that we input into our little function box,

4
00:00:13,002 --> 00:00:15,840
let's say this is y as a function of x,

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,873
it needs to spit out only one value of y.

6
00:00:19,873 --> 00:00:22,603
If it spit out multiple values of y, then it might be a relationship

7
00:00:22,603 --> 00:00:25,144
but it's not going to be a function.

8
00:00:25,144 --> 00:00:28,512
So this is a function.

9
00:00:28,512 --> 00:00:31,545
If we have a situation where we input x into a box,

10
00:00:31,545 --> 00:00:34,430
and it could be multiple possible y's,

11
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:38,139
then this is not a function.

12
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:41,093
So let's think about this table right over here.

13
00:00:41,093 --> 00:00:44,941
When x is equal to 1, we get y is equal to 1.

14
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:47,098
but when x is equal to 1 again

15
00:00:47,098 --> 00:00:50,144
all of a sudden y is equal to 2.

16
00:00:50,144 --> 00:00:53,138
So here we have a situation where we input 1

17
00:00:53,138 --> 00:00:55,764
into our little relationship box,

18
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,141
and when we input 1 into our relationship box

19
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:02,349
we could get a 1 or we could get a 2 for y.

20
00:01:02,349 --> 00:01:05,347
So this is definitely not a function.

21
00:01:05,347 --> 00:01:07,694
For any input into a function it has to map

22
00:01:07,694 --> 00:01:09,541
to exactly one output.

23
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,762
Here it is mapping to two outputs,

24
00:01:11,762 --> 00:01:14,834
so this is not a function.
