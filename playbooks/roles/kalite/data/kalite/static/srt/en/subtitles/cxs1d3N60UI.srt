2
00:00:04,425 --> 00:00:10,194
We're in the Louvre and we're looking at The Seated Scribe, which is an Old Kingdom sculpture that's not life-size

3
00:00:10,194 --> 00:00:17,092
from about 2600 B.C.E. or let's say about 4600 years old.

4
00:00:17,092 --> 00:00:20,295
Right, so it's from the Necropolis at Saqqara.

5
00:00:20,295 --> 00:00:23,498
Where the the step pyramid is, the Djoser step pyramid.

6
00:00:23,498 --> 00:00:26,394
So it's an important Old Kingdom site.

7
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:29,580
The sculpture is important for a whole bunch of reasons.

8
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:38,780
Not only what it tells us about Egyptian society, but also because it's a remarkably distinct sculpture in what is often a very rigid, pictorial tradition.

9
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:46,468
In that he looks very informal. He is cross-legged, seated on the ground. He's holding a papyrus scroll.

10
00:00:46,468 --> 00:00:49,885
He would have been holding, of course, originally some sort of reed pen.

11
00:00:49,885 --> 00:00:58,250
And he does look very human, very natural, compared to the more hieratic way that we usually see Egyptian figures.

12
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:05,168
And that has to do with the fact that he's not of kingly divine pharonic status.

13
00:01:05,168 --> 00:01:09,952
He's a scribe. He's important, extremely important in the hierarchy of Egyptian society.

14
00:01:09,952 --> 00:01:12,279
He can write, which was a very important skill.

15
00:01:12,279 --> 00:01:16,829
And was obviously of a very high class because he had a sculpture made of him.

16
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:22,787
But still he's not a divine figure, and so he can be represented in this more naturalistic fashion.

17
00:01:22,787 --> 00:01:28,111
You know it's interesting you said that he was very important, and I think that's expressed in a number of subtle ways.

18
00:01:28,111 --> 00:01:32,403
Not only was he literate and entrusted in a sense with the writing of the state, presumably.

19
00:01:32,403 --> 00:01:39,167
But there's a little bit of fat around his middle, and archaeologists believe that that's actually a signifier for his wealth.

20
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:46,625
You can also tell that he's middle aged because, you know not only from his fat, but he looks like he's lost some muscle tone in his arms and his chest.

21
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:49,960
And he has a sense of wisdom to him.

22
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:58,329
A little bit individualized, kind of thin lips and big ears and these inset eyes that make him look incredibly alive.

23
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:03,172
The iris is a rock crystal. It's been drilled and there's a bit of color behind them.

24
00:02:03,172 --> 00:02:07,934
And they're really exceptional. There's some copper that actually surrounds the eye, which is really very beautiful.

25
00:02:07,934 --> 00:02:13,592
And he's painted with red ochre and also a color black for his hair.

26
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:23,096
And if we think about the color, the inset eyes, his individuality, his relaxed informal pose, he's very natural.

27
00:02:23,096 --> 00:02:28,231
And I say that, but at the same time he's really not right because he's meant only to be seen from the front.

28
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:36,303
He is a funerary sculpture and so there is also something meant to be transcendent here.

29
00:02:36,303 --> 00:02:43,515
Well it's interesting you said meant to be seen from the front - yes, but since this is for the interior of a tomb - no one was meant to see it at all.

30
00:02:43,515 --> 00:02:50,081
That's right it really is meant for the afterlife. And it's so interesting that here is sculpture that truly transcends human life

31
00:02:50,081 --> 00:02:54,609
and that was meant for the afterlife, meant for this sort of eternal existence.

32
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:58,270
