1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,570
   

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,880
In the last video, we used a
set of parametric equations to

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,240
describe the position of a car
as it fell off of a cliff, and

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,660
the equations were x as a
function of t was-- and I will

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,480
write that-- x as a function of
t was equal to 10, I believe.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,180
I did this a couple of
hours ago, so I think

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:18,670
that's what I said.

8
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:21,570
10 plus 5t.

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:30,360
And y as a function of t was
equal to 50 minus 5t squared.

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,790
And the graph looks
something like this.

11
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:33,950
Let me redraw it.

12
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,200
It never hurts.

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,180
That was the y-axis.

14
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,470
That's the x-axis.

15
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:45,480
And we saw that at t equals 0,
and we could try t equals 0

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,690
here, and we'll get the
point 10 comma 50.

17
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,300
So the point 10 comma
50 was right there.

18
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,990
That was at t equal to 0,
and then we plotted a few

19
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,880
points in the last video.

20
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,010
I think t equals 1 was there.

21
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,510
t equals 2 was, like, there,
and t equal 3 looked something

22
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,910
like that, and this was the
path of the actual car as

23
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,600
it hurtled to the ground.

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,130
But this parametric equation
actually doesn't just describe

25
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,470
this part of the curve.

26
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:22,120
It describes a curve that goes
in both directions forever.

27
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,190
So it describes a curve that
does something like this.

28
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:30,900
If you actually plot t equals
minus 1, what do you get here?

29
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,920
You get minus 5.

30
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,140
So 10 minus 5 is 5.

31
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:39,290
If you put a minus 1 here,
this becomes a plus 1.

32
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,260
So minus 1, so you get 5, 45.

33
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,510
So you get that
point right there.

34
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,280
And if you did minus 2, you're
going to get a point that

35
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,330
looks something like that.

36
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,690
And minus 3, you're
going to get a point

37
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,630
something like that.

38
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,280
So the whole curve described by
this parametric equation will

39
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,340
look something like this.

40
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,140
Let me do it in a
different color.

41
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,500
It looks something like this.

42
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,990
And the direction as x
increases-- sorry, as

43
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,260
t increases, looks
like this, right?

44
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:11,920
This is t is equal to minus 3,
minus 2, minus 1, 0, 1, 2,

45
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,510
and so forth and so on.

46
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,480
So, in the last example, our
path was actually just a subset

47
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,400
of the path described by
this parametric equation.

48
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,840
And I'm saying all of this
because sometimes it's useful

49
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,180
to just bound your parametric
equation and say this is a path

50
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,410
only for certain values of t.

51
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,870
And in our example, it was when
we leave this point, which is

52
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,490
at t equals 0, all the way
to when we hit the ground.

53
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,780
So if we want to know those
boundaries, well, we know the

54
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,470
first boundary is t equals 0,
so this in the last example,

55
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,600
for when we actually talked
about a car careening off of a

56
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,410
cliff, it was between 0, so t
is greater than or

57
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:49,850
equal to zero.

58
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,940
And then we have to figure
out what t-value makes

59
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,940
us hit the ground?

60
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,670
Or when does y equal 0?

61
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,980
Because when y equals 0-- y is
our altitude, so when y equals

62
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,100
0, we've hit the ground.

63
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,590
So if we say what t-value
makes y equal 0?

64
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,090
We just say 0 equals
50 minus 5t squared.

65
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,290
So let's do that.

66
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:13,220
0 is equal to 50
minus 5t squared.

67
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,930
I just took this and set y
equal to 0 because that's

68
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,570
when we're going to
be hitting the floor.

69
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,440
Add 5t squared to both sides.

70
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,340
You get 5t squared
is equal to 50.

71
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,500
Divide both sides by 5. t
squared is equal to 10.

72
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,070
t is equal to the
square root of 3.

73
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,110
And you can actually say plus
or minus square root of 3

74
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:36,770
because this is-- we hit the
ground right at t is equal to

75
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,660
square root of-- oh, sorry.

76
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,010
t is equal to
square root of 10.

77
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,470
t is equal to
square root of 10.

78
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,975
My brain did 3 because I
immediately said, oh, square

79
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:48,300
root of 10, that's 3 point
something, something.

80
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,850
So this is t equals square root
of 10, which is approximately

81
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:54,800
equal to 3 point--
I don't know.

82
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,580
I don't know what it is.

83
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,770
I should probably get my
calculator going, but that's

84
00:03:58,770 --> 00:03:59,780
not important for this.

85
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,700
And if we actually took the
positive and negative square

86
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,720
root, this would be t is
equal to the negative

87
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,530
square root of 10.

88
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,930
Out here there's a negative
sign right there, and if you

89
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,500
could go backwards in time,
you would have kind of

90
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,490
hit the ground there.

91
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,420
But remember, in our
example, we weren't

92
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,510
going backwards in time.

93
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,440
If we went backwards in time at
t minus 1, we were actually on

94
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,780
a plateau, and then there would
have been a different set of

95
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,110
parametric equations that would
have described the car when it

96
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,220
was just driving
on the plateau.

97
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,840
So if we really want to
describe the path of the car,

98
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,710
we should have bounded it and
said that between time is equal

99
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:40,460
to 0 and time being less than
the square root of 10,

100
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,990
this would have been our
parametric equations.

101
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,580
Fair enough.

102
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,000
Now, the next thing that's
interesting is, you know, we

103
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,215
took these parametric
equations, and we generalized

104
00:04:49,215 --> 00:04:51,270
it, and we just said what
it would look like if

105
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,110
we didn't bound it.

106
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:54,490
If this wasn't the case, then
the parametric equation would

107
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,860
just keep going like that, and
it would have this kind

108
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,780
of direction, right?

109
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,420
It would move in
that direction.

110
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:06,020
But can we express the set of
parametric equations as just a

111
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:11,180
normal equation where y is
expressed as a function of x,

112
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,490
or x is expressed as
a function of y?

113
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,930
And let's try.

114
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:20,010
So the easiest thing to do is
let's just rewrite them, just

115
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,120
so we clean up our board.

116
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:30,760
So if you have x is equal to 10
plus 5t and y is equal to 50

117
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:38,020
minus 5t squared, if we want to
write this system as just an

118
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,460
equation with just y and x,
what we can do is we could just

119
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,810
solve for t in terms of either
x or y and then substitute

120
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,860
back into the other equation.

121
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,630
So the easier one to solve is
this top equation because

122
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,570
it's a linear equation.

123
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,820
This is a little
more complicated.

124
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,720
We'll have, you know, t is
equal to the square root of y,

125
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,350
and it becomes a lot more
complicated, so let's

126
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,680
just use this.

127
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,680
So if we want to solve
for t, let's subtract

128
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,960
10 from both sides.

129
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,700
You get x minus 10
is equal to 5t.

130
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,400
Divide both sides by 5.

131
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,650
You get x over 5
minus 2, right?

132
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,240
10 divided by 5 is equal to t.

133
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,860
And now, we can take
this and substitute it.

134
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,190
This is t, right?

135
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,720
So we can take this and
substitute it back here

136
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,700
for t because we say
this is equal to t.

137
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:33,710
So our equation becomes y is
equal to 50 minus 5 times x

138
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:39,230
minus x over 5 minus 2 squared.

139
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,260
Now, let's simplify this.

140
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,750
This is equal to--
let's switch colors.

141
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:50,780
50 minus 5 times x squared
over 25 minus-- let's see,

142
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:58,310
2/5, so it's 4/5x plus 4.

143
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,870
And then if you multiply--
and this is a y out here.

144
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,970
So you get y is equal to 50.

145
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:08,610
And let's see, minus 5 times--
minus 5 over 25 is minus 1/5,

146
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,820
so minus x squared over 5.

147
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:17,020
Minus 5 times minus
4/5, that's plus 4x.

148
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,490
And then minus 5
times 4 is minus 20.

149
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,250
We're almost there.

150
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:28,740
We can add the 50 to the
negative 20, and we get y--

151
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:34,430
that's too dark-- y is equal
to minus x squared over

152
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,440
5 plus 4x plus 30.

153
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,250
And we're done.

154
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,630
We just, I guess we could
say, simplified this set of

155
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:49,340
parametric equations to this
one equation, where y

156
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,670
is a function of x.

157
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,690
And so you might be saying,
Sal, why didn't we just

158
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,200
always have it this way?

159
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,170
This is so much more simple,
and we can just graph this, and

160
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:00,460
you know how to deal with it,
and it's just one equation

161
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,470
with just y and x.

162
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,550
We don't have this
third variable t.

163
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,180
And that might be OK if
you just want to know

164
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,140
the shape of the path.

165
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,900
So if you took this equation,
and if I told you to graph it,

166
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,700
you would indeed get a
parabola, kind of a

167
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,320
downward-opening parabola that
looks something like that.

168
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,730
But when you go from these two
equations to this one equation,

169
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,520
you lose information.

170
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,470
If I told you that this
describes the path of an

171
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,650
object, some object, it
doesn't have to be the car.

172
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,510
We've progressed beyond that.

173
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,630
It describes a path
of some object.

174
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:37,970
Just with this equation alone,
you don't know if the object

175
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,500
is-- is the object
going this way?

176
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,830
Is it going like that?

177
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,850
Or is the object going
in the other direction

178
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:44,580
like our car did.

179
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,790
Is the object going that way?

180
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,600
We don't know because we
don't know how it moves

181
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,140
according to time.

182
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:53,920
Likewise, if I told you this
was the path of the object and

183
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,610
then I asked you where is the
object after 5 seconds,

184
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,670
you don't know.

185
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,890
Because this just tells you
what the shape-- where x is

186
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,580
relative to y or where
y is relative to x.

187
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,040
It doesn't tell you where you
are after 5 seconds, so we've

188
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,890
lost all of that information.

189
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:12,500
We've lost information that
this is t equals 0, this is t

190
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,520
equals 1, this is t equals 2,
this is t equals 3, this is t

191
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,880
equals the square root of 10.

192
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,350
And that's why parametric
equations are useful.

193
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:23,840
But anyway, I wanted to do this
example mainly to show you that

194
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,850
you can express the same shape
this way and also to show you

195
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:32,820
how to express a parametric
equation in terms of a y and an

196
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,230
x, but also for you to
appreciate that the parametric

197
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:39,210
equation is useful and that it
does contain information

198
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:42,430
that this just single
equation won't contain.

199
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:45,020
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
