99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We now live in a culture where the new is sought after,

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where the new is something that we want. But in Victorian culture,

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the new was something that was not always trusted. Ruskin

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
referred to all the new furnishings in the picture that we are looking at

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
within Holman Hunt's 'Awakening Conscience' having a fatal

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
newness. The newness of the piano, the newness of the table,

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the newness of the rug. All of this was meant to suggest a kind of

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
falseness actually. And it is a perfect example of the

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
concerns of Victorian culture in this fabulous Pre-Raphaelite

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
image. So we are looking at a kept woman and we see her

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with her lover. We are in a space that is her apartment, filled with

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
brand-new furniture, and new wallpaper and prints on the wall... that he

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
has bought for her - yes - in order to create a pied a terre place that he can

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
escape to. She is probably of lowly origin. I mean this is

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
all standard narrative that Victorians knew and it had been

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
repeated over and over again of a girl who came from the countryside and became a

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
fallen woman, or a kept woman, in the city, who is compromised by a class

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
above her. She has been sitting on the lap of her lover who has been playing the

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
piano. But unbeknownst to him he plays a song that

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
reminds her of her childhood and at that moment

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
she remembers her past innocence and experiences

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a spiritual awakening, an awakening of her

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
conscience. So she is a subject that we see often in Victorian paintings. She is a

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
fallen woman but at a moment of redemption. Look at the way that

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
tha artist has organized the painting. We are looking at her and we are looking at her

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
sconced in all of this luxury of the home that he has created

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
for her but this artificial place that is not real. Where nothing is worn,

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where nothing is used, where nothing has been transformed by the life of a

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
real family. But she is facing almost towards us and we can see

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
her reflection in the mirror and back of her and we can see that she is looking

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
towards the outside. And so here, nature and light take on

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the role of the spiritual, take on the role of the moral that she needs

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to now move towards. That is right. And that is really what interested

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Holman Hunt. He was a very religious man

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and is using this modern life subject to speak to a bigger issue

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of spiritual transformation. And how
