1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
   

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,280
In the last couple of videos
we've been slowly moving

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,580
towards our goal of figuring
out the surface area

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,210
of this torus.

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,880
And we did it by evaluating a
surface integral, and in order

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,300
to evaluate a surface integral
we had to take the

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,530
parameterization-- take its
partial with respect to s and

8
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,830
with respect to t.

9
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,590
We did that in the first video.

10
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,410
Then we had to take
its cross product.

11
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,080
We did that in the
second video.

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,050
Now, we're ready to take the
magnitude of the cross product.

13
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,650
And then we can evaluate it
inside of a double integral and

14
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,120
we will have solved or we would
have computed an actual surface

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,610
integral-- something you see
very few times in your

16
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:38,370
education career.

17
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,570
So this is kind of exciting.

18
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,420
So this was the cross
product right here.

19
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,200
Now, let's take the
magnitude of this thing.

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,710
And you might remember, the
magnitude of any vector is kind

21
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,980
of a Pythagorean theorem.

22
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,380
And in this case it's going
to be kind of the distance

23
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,400
formula to the Pythagorean
theorem n 3 dimensions.

24
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,760
So the magnitude-- this is
equal to, just as a reminder,

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,180
is equal to this right here.

26
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,320
It's equal to the partial of
r with respect to s cross

27
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,250
with the partial of
r with respect to t.

28
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,550
Let me copy it and paste it.

29
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,980
That is equal to
that right there.

30
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,890
Put an equal sign.

31
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,690
These two quantities are equal.

32
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,260
Now we want to figure
out the magnitude.

33
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:29,860
So if we want to take the
magnitude of this thing, that's

34
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,450
going to be equal to-- well,
this is just a scalar that's

35
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:33,570
multiply everything.

36
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,040
So let's just write
the scalar out there.

37
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:42,540
So b plus a cosine of s
times the magnitude of

38
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,310
this thing right here.

39
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,950
And the magnitude of this thing
right here is going to be the

40
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,280
sum, of-- you can imagine,
it's the square root of this

41
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,510
thing dotted with itself.

42
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,500
Or you could say it's the sum
of the squares of each of

43
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,030
these terms to the 1/2 power.

44
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,800
So let me write it like that.

45
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,330
Let me write the sum
of the squares.

46
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:14,160
So if you square this you get
a squared cosine squared

47
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,540
of s, sine squared of t.

48
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,170
That's that term.

49
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,700
Plus-- let me color code it.

50
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,530
That's that term.

51
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:24,930
I'll do the magenta.

52
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,200
Plus that term squared.

53
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:36,230
Plus a squared cosine squared
of s, cosine squared of t.

54
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,500
That's that term.

55
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,580
And then finally-- I'll
do another color--

56
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,450
this term squared.

57
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:47,900
So plus a squared
sine squared of s.

58
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,480
And it's going to be all of
this business to the 1/2 power.

59
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,210
This right here is the same
thing as the magnitude

60
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,310
of this right here.

61
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,170
This is just a scalar
that's multiplying by

62
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,140
both of these terms.

63
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,590
So let's see if we can do
anything interesting here.

64
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,080
If this can be
simplified in any way.

65
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,590
We have a squared
cosine squared of s.

66
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,830
We have an a squared cosine
squared of s here, so let's

67
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:15,360
factor that out from both
of these terms and

68
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,280
see what happens.

69
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,220
I'm just going to rewrite
this second part.

70
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:23,950
So this is going to be a
squared cosine squared of s

71
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:34,100
times sine squared of t-- put
a parentheses-- plus cosine--

72
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,790
oh, I want to do it in that
magenta color, not orange.

73
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,970
Plus cosine squared of t.

74
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,900
   

75
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:50,330
And then you're going to
have this plus a squared

76
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,590
sine squared of s.

77
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:59,810
And of course, all of that
is to the 1/2 power.

78
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:00,790
Now what is this?

79
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,840
Well, we have sine squared of
t plus cosine squared of t.

80
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,180
That's nice.

81
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:08,320
That's equal to 1, the most
basic of trig identities.

82
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,170
So this expression right here
simplifies to a squared cosine

83
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:21,340
squared of s plus this
over here: a squared

84
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,780
sine squared of s.

85
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,450
And all of that to
the 1/2 power.

86
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,250
You might immediately
recognize you can factor

87
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,570
out an a squared.

88
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:34,160
This is equal to a squared
times cosine squared of s

89
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,880
plus sine squared of s.

90
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,660
And all of that to
the 1/2 power.

91
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,340
I'm just focusing on
this term right here.

92
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,810
I'll write this in a second.

93
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:49,520
But once again, cosine squared
plus sine squared of anything

94
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,940
is going to be equal 1 as long
as it's the same anything

95
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,930
it's equal to 1.

96
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,080
So this term is a squared
to the 1/2 power.

97
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,850
Or the square root of a
squared, which is just

98
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,380
going to be equal to a.

99
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,220
So all of this-- all that crazy
business right here just

100
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,340
simplifies, all of that
just simplifies to a.

101
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,580
So this cross product here
simplifies to this times

102
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,260
a, which is a pretty neat
and clean simplification.

103
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,395
So let me rewrite this.

104
00:05:17,395 --> 00:05:21,090
   

105
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:30,040
That simplifies, it
simplifies to a times that.

106
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,100
And what's that? a
times b, so it's ab.

107
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,520
ab plus a squared cosine of s.

108
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,550
   

109
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,020
So already, we've gotten pretty
far and it's nice when you do

110
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,230
something so beastly and
eventually it gets to

111
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:48,590
something reasonably simple.

112
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:51,850
And just to review what we had
to do, what our mission was

113
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,710
several videos ago, is we want
to evaluate what this thing is

114
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:00,110
over the region from s-- over
the region over with the

115
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,090
surface is defined.

116
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:06,460
So s going from 0 to 2 pi
and t going from 0 to 2 pi.

117
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,890
Over this region.

118
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,860
So we want to integrate
this over that region.

119
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:16,720
So that region we're going
to vary s from 0 to 2 pi.

120
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,130
So ds.

121
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:23,870
And then we're going to vary
t from 0 to 2 pi-- dt.

122
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,460
And this is what
we're evaluating.

123
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,370
We're evaluating the magnitude
of the cross product of these

124
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,060
two partial derivatives of our
original parameterization.

125
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,920
So this is what we
can put in there.

126
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,010
Things are getting simple all
of a sudden, or simpler.

127
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:41,180
ab plus a squared cosine of s.

128
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,080
And what is this equal to?

129
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,430
So this is going to be equal
to-- well, we just take

130
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:51,610
antiderivative of the
inside with respect to s.

131
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,800
So the antiderivative--
so let me do the outside

132
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,830
of our integral.

133
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,690
So we're still going to have
to deal with the 0 to 2

134
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,590
pi and our dt right here.

135
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,900
But the antiderivative with
respect to s right here is

136
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,630
going to be-- ab is just a
constant, so it's going to

137
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:11,920
be abs plus-- what's the
antiderivative of cosine of s?

138
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,840
It's sine of s.

139
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,540
So plus a squared sine of s.

140
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,860
And we're going to evaluate
it from 0 to 2 pi.

141
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,270
And what is this going
to be equal to?

142
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:27,900
Let's put our boundaries out
again or the t integral that

143
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:33,800
we're going to have to do in
a second-- 0 the 2 pi d t.

144
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,480
When you put 2 pi here you're
going to get ab times

145
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,240
2 pi or 2 pi ab.

146
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:45,840
So you're going to have 2 pi ab
plus a squared sine of 2 pi.

147
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,670
Sine of 2 pi is 0, so there's
not going to be any term there.

148
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:54,750
And then minus 0 times
ab, which is 0.

149
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,220
And then you're going to
have minus a squared sine

150
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,620
of 0, which is also 0.

151
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,300
So all of the other
terms are all 0's.

152
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,140
So that's what we're left with
it, it simplified nicely.

153
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,140
So now we just have to take
the antiderivative of

154
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:08,710
this with respect to t.

155
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,620
And this is a constant in t, so
this is going to be equal to--

156
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:17,750
take the antiderivative with
respect to t-- 2 pi abt and we

157
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,950
need to evaluate that from 0 to
2 pi, which is equal to--

158
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,570
so we put 2 pi in there.

159
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,340
You have a 2 pi for t, it'll
be a 2 pi times 2 pi ab.

160
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:33,250
Or we should say, 2 pi
squared times ab minus

161
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,400
0 times this thing.

162
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,880
Well, that's just going to
be 0, so we don't even

163
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,230
have to write it down.

164
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:37,860
So we're done.

165
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,640
This is the surface
area of the torus.

166
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,410
This is exciting.

167
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:43,100
It just kind of snuck up on us.

168
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:49,680
This is equal to 4 pi squared
ab, which is kind of a neat

169
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,750
formula because it's
very neat and clean.

170
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,730
You know, it has a 2 pi,
which is kind of the

171
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,720
diameter of a circle.

172
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,860
We're squaring it, which kind
of makes sense because we're

173
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:03,630
taking the product of-- you can
kind of imagine the product

174
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,700
of these 2 circles.

175
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,150
I'm speaking in very abstract,
general terms, but that

176
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,380
kind of feels good.

177
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,910
And then we're taking just
the product of those

178
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,340
two radiuses, remember.

179
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,310
Let me just copy this
thing down here.

180
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,160
Actually, let me copy this
thing because this is our new--

181
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,570
this is our exciting result.

182
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:20,710
Let me copy this.

183
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,110
So copy.

184
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:27,350
So all of this work that we
did simplified to this,

185
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,460
which is exciting.

186
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:33,990
We now know that if you have a
torus where the radius of the

187
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:40,440
cross section is a, and the
radius from the center of

188
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,130
the torus to the middle of
the cross sections is b.

189
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,820
That the surface area of that
torus is going to be 4 pi

190
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,380
squared times a times b.

191
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,690
Which I think is a
pretty neat outcome.

192
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:53,933
