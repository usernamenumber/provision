Part B: Determined the x coordinate of a point in which g has absolute maximum on the interval coordinate

2
00:00:06,931 --> 00:00:15,252
-4 is less then equal to x and less then equal to 3 and justify your answers. Lets think about general term, so think about general terms for interval where x could happen absolute maximum. Lets Draw some axis over here.

00:00:15,252 --> 00:00:21,107
Now speaking in general term first and go back to function of f(g) and draw this function here. Let say we care
