1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,850
We're on problem 148.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,200
What is the lowest integer that is the sum of

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,510
three different primes, each greater than 20?

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,570
So it's the lowest integer,

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,540
so we essentially just have to find the three primes above 20

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,250
So let's see, 21 isn't a prime,

7
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,880
22 isn't a prime, 23 is a prime.

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:24,210
24, no, 25, no, 26,no, 27, 28, nope.

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,350
29, that's prime. 30 isn't, 31 is.

10
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:36,950
31 plus 29 is 60 plus 23 is 83, and that is choice E.

11
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,210
I hope I haven't missed any primes, no, I don't think I have.

12
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:45,540
24, 25, 26, 27, 28,I think I got all the primes in there.

13
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,890
What is the lowest integer of the sum of

14
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,860
three different primes, each greater than 20?

15
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,420
Yep, that's the answer, E. Problem 149.

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,890
The average of 6, 8, and 10 equals-- so the average of 6,

17
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,360
8,and 10,so first of all,what's the average of 6, 8, and 10?

18
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,670
Well, let's just do it. 6 plus 8 plus 10.

19
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,260
You could immediately see the average is going to be 8,

20
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,710
because you have 8 in the middle,

21
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,380
and both of these numbers are 2 away from it.

22
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,940
But that divided by 3 is equal to 24 divided by 3

23
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,210
is equal to 8.

24
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:25,460
And that's equal to the average of 7 plus 9 plus x over 3,

25
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,350
so that tells us to multiply both sides of this equation by 3,

26
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,540
that says that 24 is equal to-- what's 7 plus 9?

27
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,320
That's 16 plus x.

28
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,400
Subtract 16 from both sides,you get x is equal to 8.

29
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,970
Choice C.

30
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:45,900
And you could have said, OK, 7 and 9 or both half--

31
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,000
8 is in the middle, and they have to average 8,

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,130
so you might have just been able to eyeball it and say 8,

33
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,330
but it didn't take that much math,

34
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:55,540
it's not that much of a shortcut. Problem 150.

35
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,050
If x is equal to minus 1,

36
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:08,720
then x to the fourth minus x to the third plus x squared,

37
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,880
all of that over x minus 1 is equal to what?

38
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,480
x to the fourth is 1.

39
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,460
x to the third is minus 1,but then we're going to minus that,

40
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,640
so this whole thing is going to be plus 1,

41
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,850
and x squared is plus 1.

42
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,620
Negative 1 squared is 1.

43
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,500
And you have minus 1 minus 1.

44
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:34,540
So in the numerator you have 1, 2, 3, in the denominator

45
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,550
you have minus 2.

46
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,470
Let's put the minus out front, minus 3/2.

47
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:46,260
That's choice A. Problem 151.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,260
A toy store regularly sells all stock

49
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,640
at a discount of 20% to 40%.

50
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:01,270
If an additional 25% were deducted from the discount price

51
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,400
during a special sale,

52
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,560
what would be the lowest possible price of a toy costing $16

53
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,860
before any discount?

54
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,000
So we want to discount the $16 as much as possible.

55
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,420
So they say they're normally discounting 20% to 40%,

56
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,100
so if you want to discount this as much as possible,

57
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,240
you want to discount this by 40%.

58
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,490
So if you discount this by 40%,that's the same thing as

59
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,560
saying it's going to be equal to 60% of its original price.

60
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,100
So this would be the price after being discounted by 40%,

61
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,930
and then we would discount by another 25%.

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,800
Actually, I think it's easier to go the other way.

63
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,470
Well, let's just do it this way.

64
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,440
So we discount it by another 25%,

65
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,270
so we multiply it by 3/4 again.

66
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,040
If you discount by 25%,

67
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,430
the price is going to be 3/4 of its original price.

68
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,960
Actually, let's do it as fractions.

69
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,050
Fractions are always easier.

70
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,940
60% percent of your price is 3/5.

71
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,310
If you discount by 2/5, or 40%,

72
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,640
that's the same thing as multiplying by 3/5,

73
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,090
and then we're going to multiply by 3/4.

74
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,020
Set 25%.

75
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,370
If you're discounting by 25%,that's the same thing as

76
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,810
being worth 75% of your original price.

77
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,590
So what does that get us?

78
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,400
16 divided by 4, 4, you get a 1,

79
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,360
and then you have 4 times 3 times 3,

80
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:38,640
4 times 9 is 36, over 5, which is equal to--

81
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:45,590
5 goes into 36 7 and 1/5. So $7.20.

82
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:50,780
And that's choice B. Problem 152.

83
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,930
The shaded portion of the rectangular lot

84
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,470
shown above represents a flowerbed.

85
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,930
OK, so let me draw this rectangular lot.

86
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:12,030
They drew this shaded portion something like that,

87
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,350
and I can even color it in.

88
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,100
So they say the shaded portion of the rectangular lot shown

89
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,910
above represents a flowerbed.

90
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,470
If the area of the bed is 24 square yards,

91
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,560
and x is equal to y plus 2,

92
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,450
so they tell us this side right here is x,

93
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,680
which now they're telling us is equal to y plus 2.

94
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:41,160
And this right here is going to be equal to y.

95
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:49,170
Then z equals what? z is this side right there.

96
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,380
So if this area is 24,

97
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,420
that tells us that x times y times 1/2 is 24.

98
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,900
That's the area of that.

99
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:00,900
So 1/2xy is equal to 24.

100
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:05,320
Or you can even say that xy is equal to 48.

101
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,490
We know what xy is.

102
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,860
We can just substitute for x, so we get y plus 2,

103
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,870
that's x, right?

104
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,920
X is equal to y plus 2 times y is equal to 48.

105
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:27,380
And so we get y squared plus 2y is equal to 48.

106
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:35,590
Or y squared plus 2y minus 48 is equal to 0.

107
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,320
We could factor this quadratic.

108
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,940
What two numbers when you multiply is minus 48,

109
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,120
and you add you get plus 2?

110
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:52,530
So y plus 8 times y minus 6 is equal to 0,

111
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:57,370
8 times minus 6 is minus 48, and then 8 minus 6 is plus 2,

112
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:01,780
so y could be equal to minus 8 or plus 6, right?

113
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,460
Whatever numbers make either of these equal to zero.

114
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,180
Well, we can't have a negative distance,

115
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,200
so y is not equal to minus 8, so y is equal to 6.

116
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,180
y is equal to 6, x is equal to 8.

117
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:16,730
Now, we can just confirm,

118
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,840
6 times 8 is 48 times 1/2 is equal to 24.

119
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,610
And now we can use the Pythagorean theorem to figure out z.

120
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,840
So we'll get z squared is equal to 36.

121
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,410
That's y squared plus 64,which is x squared,

122
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,450
so z squared is equal to 100.

123
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:42,800
z is equal to 10. Choice E. Problem 153.

124
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:49,560
Jack is now 14 years older than Bill,

125
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,980
so Jack is equal to Bill plus 14.

126
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:57,460
If in 10 years Jack will be twice as old as Bill,

127
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:06,930
so 2 times Bill's age, how old will Jack be in 5 years?

128
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:10,040
So they want to know j plus 5.

129
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,290
That's how old Jack will be in 5 years.

130
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:15,920
So let's just try to solve for Jack.

131
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,040
This top equation tells us that

132
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:26,040
Bill is equal to Jack minus 14,

133
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,460
and then we can substitute this in for Bill here.

134
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,880
So then this equation will become Jack plus 10

135
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:36,530
is equal to 2 times Jack minus 14.

136
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:42,190
So Jack plus 10 is equal to 2 times Jack minus 28.

137
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,640
If we subtract Jack from both sides,

138
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,220
you get 10 is equal to Jack minus 28.

139
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,680
We can add 28 to both sides, and you get 38 is equal to Jack.

140
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,610
So that's how old Jack is now. He's 38 years old.

141
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,560
So how old is Jack going to be in 5 years?

142
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:07,340
38 plus 5 is equal to 43 years old.

143
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,910
And I've clearly made a mistake,

144
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,390
because that's not one of the options.

145
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,710
So let's see where I'm made an error.

146
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,490
So Jack is now 14 years older than Bill. Fair enough.

147
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,910
So in 10 years, Jack will be twice-- oh, I see my mistake.

148
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,380
He's going to be twice as old as Bill

149
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,770
is going to be in 10 years.

150
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:26,900
That was a bone-headed mistake.

151
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,260
So let me clear all of this.

152
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,330
That was a bad mistake.

153
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,540
I shouldn't have made it.

154
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:38,960
I'm lucky that they didn't have what I put down

155
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,860
as one of the choices, and I would've gotten it wrong.

156
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,270
All right. So we know that in 10 years,

157
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,740
Jack is going to be 2 times

158
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,990
what Bill is going to be in 10 years.

159
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,110
That was my mistake.

160
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,860
So now let's see what we can do.

161
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,000
We'll use that same information up there,

162
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,890
so Bill is equal to Jack minus 14.

163
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,320
Substitute that information here,

164
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:07,140
so we get Jack plus 10 is equal to 2 times Jack minus 14,

165
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,800
instead of Bill, plus 10.

166
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:14,260
So you get Jack plus 10 is equal to 2 times Jack.

167
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,640
Let's see, minus 14 plus 10,that's minus 4,

168
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:22,330
so Jack plus 10 is equal to 2 times Jack minus 8.

169
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,600
Let's subtract Jack from both sides.

170
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,050
10 is equal to Jack minus 8.

171
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,750
Let's add 8 to both sides.

172
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,000
You get 18 is equal to Jack.

173
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,170
So that's how old Jack is right now, he's 18.

174
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:39,780
So in five years, Jack is going to be 18 plus 5,

175
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:44,240
which is 23 years old, choice D.

176
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,000
And I'm out of time. See you in the next video.
