1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,910
I made a slight error
in the electron

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,150
transport chain video.

3
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,040
And I just wanted to correct
it in this one.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,540
And it's also an opportunity for
me to include a little bit

5
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,560
of terminology that I forgot
to include in that video.

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,310
So when I described the electron
transport chain, you

7
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,810
remember, it's just you have
some high-energy electrons in

8
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,520
NADH and they get transferred
from one molecule to another.

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,810
And as they get transferred
they go into lower energy

10
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,870
states and they release
energy.

11
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,540
And then the final electron
acceptor was oxygen.

12
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,200
Oxygen got reduced right here.

13
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,190
But if you look at both sides of
this equation, the mistake

14
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,510
was, I need two hydrogens.

15
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,400
If I have two hydrogens on the
right-hand side of the water,

16
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,710
I need two hydrogens on
the left-hand side.

17
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,330
So there should be
a 2 right there.

18
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,280
So that was what I would
consider to be a minor mistake

19
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,200
in the last video.

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,510
But this also gives me a chance
to introduce you to

21
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,110
some more terminology.

22
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,850
So this whole process, we know
that this is called oxidation.

23
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,690
When NADH loses a hydrogen.

24
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,820
Remember oxidation is losing,
formally electrons.

25
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,770
But when it loses the hydrogen,
it loses the

26
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,640
opportunity to hog that
hydrogen's electrons.

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,210
So this whole process of the
electron transport chain is

28
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,450
one molecule after another
getting oxidized until you

29
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,410
have a final electron
acceptor in water.

30
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,280
So this is-- obviously you could
call this oxidation.

31
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,950
You know, just very generally.

32
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,410
And then the second part of the
electron transport chain--

33
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,810
or maybe we shouldn't even call
this part of the electron

34
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,720
transport chain-- the
process where the

35
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,620
ATP is actually formed.

36
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,365
The adding of a phosphate group
to another molecule is

37
00:01:32,365 --> 00:01:33,615
called phosphorylation.

38
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,000
So the whole process of creating
ATP through the

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,590
electron transport chain.

40
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,390
Remember the electron transport
chain releases

41
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,010
energy that creates this
hydrogen gradient.

42
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,540
It pumps the hydrogens to
the outer compartment.

43
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,640
And then that gradient, those
hydrogens that want to get

44
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,130
back into the matrix,
essentially going back through

45
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,740
this ATP synthase.

46
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,880
This process of generating ATP
this way is called oxidative

47
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,130
phosphorylation.

48
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,120
It's a good word to know.

49
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,440
You might see it on some
standardized tests or on your

50
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,560
exams. And it's called
this because you have

51
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,770
an oxidative part.

52
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,200
Each of these molecules gets
oxidized in the electron

53
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,220
transport chain as they lose
their hydrogens or as they

54
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,500
lose their electrons.

55
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,890
That creates a hydrogen
gradient.

56
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,280
And then that, through
chemiosmosis, allows for

57
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,430
phosphorylation.

58
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,670
So that's another good
word to know.

59
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:47,060
The transfer of these hydrogens,
these kind of going

60
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,740
through this membrane
selectively.

61
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,900
This membrane, this ATP
synthase, wouldn't allow just

62
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,500
any molecule to go through it.

63
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,360
It's allowing these hydrogen
protons to go through it.

64
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,750
This process right here of this
hydrogen going through is

65
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,000
called chemiosmosis.

66
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,900
Another good word to know.

67
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,880
So the entire process
is called oxidative

68
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,060
phosphorylation.

69
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,530
They don't happen at
the same time.

70
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,470
Oxidative generates the energy
because the energy to push the

71
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,140
hydrogens out.

72
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,430
And then the phosphorylation
happens as the hydrogens

73
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,050
experience chemiosmosis and go
back in and turn this little

74
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:27,160
axle and then push the ADP and
the phosphate groups together.

75
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,080
And then you can contrast
that with substrate.

76
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,000
Substrate phosphorylations.

77
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,590
Since I'm in the mood to
introduce you to terminology.

78
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,950
Substrate phosphorylation.

79
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,120
This is actually what happens
when the ATP is produced

80
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,270
directly in glycolysis
in the Krebs cycle.

81
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:54,360
And this is where you have an
enzyme directly helping to

82
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,990
peruse the ATP without
any type of

83
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,620
chemiosmosis or proton gradient.

84
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,480
So if you imagine an
enzyme, some blurb,

85
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,420
some big protein blurb.

86
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:09,110
And let's say it has the
ADP there with its

87
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,510
two phosphate groups.

88
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,890
And then maybe it has another
phosphate group that attaches

89
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,230
at some other part of the
enzyme, this enzyme

90
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,180
facilitates without any kind of
chemiosmosis or oxidation.

91
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,960
It facilitates, probably in
conjunction with other energy

92
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,870
releasing reactions that may be
occurring on other parts of

93
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,500
the enzyme.

94
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,830
So maybe you can imagine a
little spark right there and

95
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,815
then that twists this
entire enzyme.

96
00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:36,560
This isn't exactly how
it might work,

97
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,640
but it's a good idea.

98
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,090
And then these two things maybe
get pushed together.

99
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,780
When it's just an enzyme
without any of this

100
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,830
chemiosmosis that's driven by
oxidation, like we learned in

101
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,870
the electron transport chain,
we call this substrate

102
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,780
phosphorylation.

103
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,350
And the substrates are just the
things that attach to the

104
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,750
enzyme and have something
performed on them.

105
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,260
So anyway, hopefully you
found this little

106
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,710
video mildly useful.
