1
00:00:00,766 --> 00:00:04,024
Twenty teachers were asked about their favorite course.

2
00:00:04,024 --> 00:00:05,532
Seven teachers said language.

3
00:00:05,532 --> 00:00:06,884
Three teachers said history.

4
00:00:06,884 --> 00:00:08,164
Nine teachers said geometry.

5
00:00:08,164 --> 00:00:09,961
One teacher said chemistry.

6
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:12,459
Zero teachers said physics.

7
00:00:12,459 --> 00:00:15,832
Create a bar chart showing everyone's favorite courses.

8
00:00:15,832 --> 00:00:18,072
So we've got the bar chart right over here.

9
00:00:18,072 --> 00:00:19,660
Let’s see what we need to plot.

10
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,034
So it said zero teachers said physics –

11
00:00:22,034 --> 00:00:23,251
which is surprising to me,

12
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:25,554
since physics is arguably my favorite course.

13
00:00:25,554 --> 00:00:27,668
But let’s plot what the data has.

14
00:00:27,668 --> 00:00:28,604
So physics -

15
00:00:28,604 --> 00:00:29,714
Right now looks like

16
00:00:29,714 --> 00:00:31,162
it's halfway between zero and one .

17
00:00:31,162 --> 00:00:33,500
So I just have to bring the “physics” down to zero.

18
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,865
Chemistry... they said –

19
00:00:35,865 --> 00:00:36,430
Let's see.

20
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,486
One teacher said chemistry.

21
00:00:37,486 --> 00:00:40,146
So we've got to bring “chemistry“ up to one.

22
00:00:40,146 --> 00:00:42,737
Now nine teachers said geometry.

23
00:00:42,767 --> 00:00:44,025
So “geometry”...

24
00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:46,368
Let's bring that up to nine.

25
00:00:46,368 --> 00:00:48,220
One teacher said chemistry.

26
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,239
Oh, I already read that.

27
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:50,663
History. History.

28
00:00:50,663 --> 00:00:51,872
Three teachers said history.

29
00:00:51,872 --> 00:00:55,206
So, let’s bring “history” up to three.

30
00:00:55,206 --> 00:00:57,876
And then language - seven teachers said language.

31
00:00:57,876 --> 00:01:00,649
So let's move this up to seven.

32
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:02,608
And I think we --

33
00:01:02,608 --> 00:01:04,855
if I didn’t make any careless mistakes, we should be done.

34
00:01:04,855 --> 00:01:06,430
Yep, very good.
