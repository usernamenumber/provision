1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,210
Let's explore a few
more methods for

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,410
solving systems of equations.

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:12,370
Let's say I have the equation,
3x plus 4y is equal to 2.5.

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:24,788
And I have another equation, 5x
minus 4y is equal to 25.5.

5
00:00:24,788 --> 00:00:28,150
And we want to find an x and y
value that satisfies both of

6
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,220
these equations.

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,260
If you think of it graphically,
this would be the

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,850
intersection of the lines that
represent the solution sets to

9
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,080
both of these equations.

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,930
So how can we proceed?

11
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,520
We saw in substitution,
we like to

12
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,350
eliminate one of the variables.

13
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,030
We did it through substitution
last time.

14
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,720
But is there anything we can add
or subtract-- let's focus

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,690
on this yellow, on this top
equation right here-- is there

16
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,200
anything that we can add
or subtract to both

17
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,330
sides of this equation?

18
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,290
Remember, any time you deal with
an equation you have to

19
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,240
add or subtract the same
thing to both sides.

20
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,590
But is there anything that we
could add or subtract to both

21
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,410
sides of this equation
that might

22
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,069
eliminate one of the variables?

23
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:08,170
And then we would have one
equation in one variable, and

24
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,610
we can solve for it.

25
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,460
And it's probably not obvious,
even though it's sitting right

26
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,050
in front of your face.

27
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,620
Well, what if we
just added this

28
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,190
equation to that equation?

29
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,860
What I mean by that is, what if
we were to add 5x minus 4y

30
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,140
to the left-hand side, and add
25.5 to the right-hand side?

31
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,030
So if I were to literally add
this to the left-hand side,

32
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,830
and add that to the
right-hand side.

33
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,340
And you're probably saying, Sal,
hold on, how can you just

34
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,870
add two equations like that?

35
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:41,830
And remember, when you're doing
any equation, if I have

36
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:45,400
any equation of the form-- well,
really, any equation--

37
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,650
Ax plus By is equal to C, if I
want to do something to this

38
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,460
equation, I just have to add the
same thing to both sides

39
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,470
of the equation.

40
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:58,570
So I could, for example, I could
add D to both sides of

41
00:01:58,570 --> 00:01:59,090
the equation.

42
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,310
Because D is equal to
D, so I won't be

43
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,970
changing the equation.

44
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:09,270
You would get Ax plus By, plus
D is equal to C plus D.

45
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,170
And we've seen that multiple,
multiple times.

46
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,500
Anything you do to one side of
the equation, you have to do

47
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,760
to the other side.

48
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,350
But you're saying, hey, Sal,
wait, on the left-hand side,

49
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,180
you're adding 5x minus
4y to the equation.

50
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,090
On the right-hand side, you're
adding 25.5 to the equation.

51
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,976
Aren't you adding two different
things to both sides

52
00:02:27,976 --> 00:02:28,840
of the equation?

53
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,740
And my answer would be no.

54
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:35,450
We know that 5x minus
4y is 25.5.

55
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:40,160
This quantity and this quantity
are the same.

56
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,630
They're both 25.5.

57
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,660
This second equation is telling
me that explicitly.

58
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,710
So I can add this to
the left-hand side.

59
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,170
I'm essentially adding
25.5 to it.

60
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,150
And I could add 25.5 to
the right-hand side.

61
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,340
So let's do that.

62
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,910
If we were to add the
left-hand side,

63
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:01,580
3x plus 5x is 8x.

64
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,590
And then what is 4y minus 4y?

65
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,660
And this was the whole point.

66
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,080
When I looked at these two
equations, I said, oh, I have

67
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,860
a 4y, I have a negative 4y.

68
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,490
If you just add these two
together, they are going to

69
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,180
cancel out.

70
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,670
They're going to be plus 0y.

71
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,780
Or that whole term is just
going to go away.

72
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:25,540
And that's going to be equal
to 2.5 plus 25.5 is 28.

73
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,800
So you divide both sides.

74
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,530
So you get 8x is equal to 28.

75
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:38,600
And you divide both sides by 8,
and we get x is equal to 28

76
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,760
over 8, or you divide the
numerator and the

77
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,200
denominator by 4.

78
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,900
That's equal to 7 over 2.

79
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,070
That's our x value.

80
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,050
Now we want to solve
for our y value.

81
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:54,930
And we could substitute
this back into either

82
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,550
of these two equations.

83
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,820
Let's use the top one.

84
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,830
You could do it with the
bottom one as well.

85
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:08,280
So we know that 3 times x, 3
times 7 over 2-- I'm just

86
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,510
substituting the x value we
figured out into this top

87
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:17,130
equation-- 3 times 7 over 2,
plus 4y is equal to 2.5.

88
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,589
Let me just write that as 5/2.

89
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:21,410
We're going to stay in
the fraction world.

90
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:28,670
So this is going to be 21 over
2 plus 4y is equal to 5/2.

91
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,510
Subtract 21 over 2
from both sides.

92
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:37,310
So minus 21 over 2,
minus 21 over 2.

93
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,700
The left-hand side-- you're just
left with a 4y, because

94
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,930
these two guys cancel out--
is equal to-- this is 5

95
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,220
minus 21 over 2.

96
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,060
That's negative 16 over 2.

97
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,730
So that's negative 16 over 2,
which is the same thing--

98
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,550
well, I'll write it out
as negative 16 over 2.

99
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:02,030
Or we could write that-- let's
continue up here-- 4y-- I'm

100
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:06,340
just continuing this train of
thought up here-- 4y is equal

101
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,400
to negative 8.

102
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,550
Divide both sides by
4, and you get y is

103
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,010
equal to negative 2.

104
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:21,150
So the solution to this equation
is x is equal to 7/2,

105
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,510
y is equal to negative 2.

106
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,650
This would be the coordinate
of their intersection.

107
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,180
And you could try it out
on both of these

108
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,130
equations right here.

109
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,500
So let's verify that it also

110
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,330
satisfies this bottom equation.

111
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:42,930
5 times 7/2 is 35 over 2 minus
4 times negative 2, so minus

112
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,170
negative 8.

113
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:52,620
That's equivalent to-- let's
see, this is 17.5 plus 8.

114
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,070
And that indeed does
equal 25.5.

115
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,970
So this satisfies
both equations.

116
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,400
Now let's see if we can use
our newly found skills to

117
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,580
tackle a word problem, our
newly found skills in

118
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,440
elimination.

119
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,460
So here it says, Nadia and Peter
visit the candy store.

120
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:16,970
Nadia buys 3 candy bars and 4
Fruit Roll-Ups for $2.84.

121
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:21,700
Peter also buys 3 candy bars,
but can only afford 1

122
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,430
additional Fruit Roll-Up.

123
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,950
His purchase costs $1.79.

124
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:30,030
What is the cost of each candy
bar and each Fruit Roll-Up?

125
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,310
So let's define some
variables.

126
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,650
Let's just use x and y.

127
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:40,720
Let's let x equal cost of candy
bar-- I was going to do

128
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,830
a c and a f for Fruit Roll-Up,
but I'll just stick with x and

129
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,290
y-- cost of candy bar.

130
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:53,020
And let y equal the cost
of a Fruit Roll-Up.

131
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,260
All right.

132
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,310
So what does this first
statement tell us?

133
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:04,060
Nadia buys 3 candy bars, so the
cost of 3 candy bars is

134
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,310
going to be 3x.

135
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,950
And 4 Fruit Roll-Ups.

136
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,570
Plus 4 times y, the cost
of a Fruit Roll-Up.

137
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,340
This is how much Nadia spends.

138
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,480
3 candy bars, 4 Fruit
Roll-Ups.

139
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,960
And it's going to cost $2.84.

140
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,980
That's what this first
statement tells us.

141
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,210
It translates into
that equation.

142
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,390
The second statement.

143
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:35,750
Peter also buys 3 candy bars,
but could only afford 1

144
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,550
additional Fruit Roll-Up.

145
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,300
So plus 1 additional
Fruit Roll-Up.

146
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:46,250
His purchase cost is
equal to $1.79.

147
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,210
What is the cost of each candy
bar and each Fruit Roll-Up?

148
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,040
And we're going to solve
this using elimination.

149
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,270
You could solve this using any
of the techniques we've seen

150
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:56,390
so far-- substitution,
elimination, even graphing,

151
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,650
although it's kind of
hard to eyeball

152
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,020
things with the graphing.

153
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,570
So how can we do this?

154
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:03,200
Remember, with elimination,
you're going to add-- let's

155
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,990
focus on this top equation
right here.

156
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,380
Is there something we could
add to both sides of this

157
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,910
equation that'll help us

158
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,170
eliminate one of the variables?

159
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,240
Or let me put it this way, is
there something we could add

160
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,100
or subtract to both sides of
this equation that will help

161
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,550
us eliminate one of
the variables?

162
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,950
Well, like in the problem we
did a little bit earlier in

163
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:27,860
the video, what if we were to
subtract this equation, or

164
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,500
what if we were to subtract 3x
plus y from 3x plus 4y on the

165
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,799
left-hand side, and subtract
$1.79 from

166
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,030
the right-hand side?

167
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:39,590
And remember, by doing that, I
would be subtracting the same

168
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,909
thing from both sides
of the equation.

169
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:44,059
This is $1.79.

170
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:44,830
How do I know?

171
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:48,170
Because it says this
is equal to $1.79.

172
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,810
So if we did that we would be
subtracting the same thing

173
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,760
from both sides of
the equation.

174
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,320
So let's subtract 3x
plus y from the

175
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,620
left-hand side of the equation.

176
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,550
And let me just do this
over on the right.

177
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:08,550
If I subtract 3x plus y, that is
the same thing as negative

178
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,680
3x minus y, if you just
distribute the negative sign.

179
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,750
So let's subtract it.

180
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:20,820
So you get negative 3x minus
y-- maybe I should make it

181
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,750
very clear this is not a plus
sign; you could imagine I'm

182
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,560
multiplying the second equation
by negative 1-- is

183
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,460
equal to negative $1.79.

184
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm just taking the
second equation.

185
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,090
You could imagine I'm
multiplying it by negative 1,

186
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:37,440
and now I'm going to add the
left-hand side to the

187
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,310
left-hand side of this equation,
and the right-hand

188
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,160
side to the right-hand side
of that equation.

189
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,450
And what do we get?

190
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,010
When you add 3x plus 4y,
minus 3x, minus y,

191
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,540
the 3x's cancel out.

192
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,730
3x minus 3x is 0x.

193
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,080
I won't even write it down.

194
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,650
You get 4x minus-- sorry,
4y minus y.

195
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,630
That is 3y.

196
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:06,940
And that is going to be equal
to $2.84 minus $1.79.

197
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,930
What is that?

198
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:12,980
That's $1.05.

199
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,100
So 3y is equal to $1.05.

200
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,903
Divide both sides by 3.

201
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,700
y is equal to-- what's
$1.05 divided by 3?

202
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,980
So 3 goes into $1.05.

203
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,340
It goes into 1 zero times.

204
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,290
0 times 3 is 0.

205
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,190
1 minus 0 is 1.

206
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,620
Bring down a 0.

207
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,800
3 goes into 10 three times.

208
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,220
3 times 3 is 9.

209
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,380
Subtract.

210
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,170
10 minus 9 is 1.

211
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,360
Bring down the 5.

212
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,170
3 goes into 15 five times.

213
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,740
5 times 3 is 15.

214
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,630
Subtract.

215
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,150
We have no remainder.

216
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,910
So y is equal to $0.35.

217
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,020
So the cost of a Fruit
Roll-Up is $0.35.

218
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,930
Now we can substitute back into
either of these equations

219
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:07,720
to figure out the cost
of a candy bar.

220
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,470
So let's use this bottom
equation right here.

221
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,680
Which was originally, if you
remember before I multiplied

222
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:22,840
it by negative 1, it was 3x
plus y is equal to $1.79.

223
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:29,590
So that means that 3x plus the
cost of a Fruit Roll-Up, 0.35

224
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,090
is equal to $1.79.

225
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:39,470
If we subtract 0.35 from both
sides, what do we get?

226
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,110
The left-hand side-- you're just
left with the 3x; these

227
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,530
cancel out-- is equal
to-- let's see, this

228
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,750
is $1.79 minus $0.35.

229
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:52,000
That's $1.44.

230
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,670
And 3 goes into $1.44, I think
it goes-- well, 3 goes into

231
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:03,250
$1.44, it goes into
1 zero times.

232
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,280
1 times 3 is 0.

233
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,540
Bring down the 1.

234
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,190
Subtract.

235
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,380
Bring down the 4.

236
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,970
3 goes into 14 four times.

237
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:14,130
4 times 3 is 12.

238
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,360
I'm making this messy.

239
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,260
14 minus 12 is 2.

240
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,750
Bring down the 4.

241
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,440
3 goes into 24 eight times.

242
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,820
8 times 3 is 24.

243
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,250
No remainder.

244
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,740
So x is equal to 0.48.

245
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,660
So there you have it.

246
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,760
We figured out, using
elimination, that the cost of

247
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,030
a candy bar is equal to $0.48,
and that the cost of a Fruit

248
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:42,800
Roll-Up is equal to $0.35.
