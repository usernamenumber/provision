1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,770
   

2
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,400
In the last video, I talk about
how there's multiple

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,340
ways to define return
on asset.

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,690
This is given in some textbooks
and maybe some

5
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,490
professors would give this in
a finance class: net income

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,600
divided by assets.

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,410
If you look on Wikipedia, they
say it's net income plus

8
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:19,030
interest minus tax savings
from interest. So notice,

9
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,270
they're not adding back
all of the taxes.

10
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,440
They're still taking taxes
into consideration, but

11
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,350
they're saying you're not
getting any tax deduction from

12
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,770
your interest. So we'll talk
about that in a second.

13
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,860
So this kind of still does
factor in taxes.

14
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,400
This one definitely does
and interest as well.

15
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,280
And then there are these
two other ones.

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,340
One was operating profit divided
by asset, which is

17
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,500
what I gave in the
first video.

18
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,070
It really just is kind of a
simplifying assumption and

19
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,190
really to give you the intuition
in my mind of what

20
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,560
ROA really is about, of how good
is a company at operating

21
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,280
its assets, at actually getting
a return from them.

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,090
And then a slightly more general
definition would be

23
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:58,020
EBIT divided by assets. and we
talk about the fact that EBIT

24
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,730
is just net income plus interest
plus taxes, or

25
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:05,160
another way to think about it,
it's operating profit plus

26
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,010
non-operating profit. so any
other type of profit that the

27
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,880
company might have gotten from
some assets that it owns that

28
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,990
actually aren't essential
to actually

29
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,200
managing the business.

30
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,840
But then in the last part of
the video, I talk about you

31
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,610
have these definitions out here,
but I don't like using

32
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,100
them as much, and then I ran
out of time, and I said I

33
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,090
would cover in this video why I
don't like using it as much.

34
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,510
I think the best way to talk
about it is with an example.

35
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,095
So let's say I have
two companies.

36
00:01:32,095 --> 00:01:40,230
   

37
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,600
I want to do thicker lines.

38
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,100
So I have one company here.

39
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,050
Say they have the same
amount of assets.

40
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,290
That's one company, and then
this is the other company

41
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,140
right here, and I'm drawing the
left-hand side of their

42
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,600
balance sheets.

43
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,850
These are the assets.

44
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:02,790
   

45
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,840
Now let's say that they're the
same amount, so they have $10

46
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,230
million of assets.

47
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:17,620
And let's say that these are the
actual ROA's as the way I

48
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,760
calculated them.

49
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,980
So this is your EBIT divided
by total assets.

50
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,230
So if EBIT is 10% of this, that
means that this guy is

51
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:36,850
spitting out 10%, which would
be $1 million of EBIT.

52
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,840
And in a world where there's no
non-operating profit, this

53
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,930
you could view as operating
profit.

54
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,530
Remember, EBIT is just
Earnings Before

55
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,450
Interest and Taxes.

56
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,300
Let's go back to that income
statement that

57
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,340
we started off with.

58
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,720
EBIT is Earnings Before
Interest and Taxes.

59
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,800
So if you add back interest and
taxes, you essentially get

60
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,310
back to operating profit unless
there's a little bit of

61
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,510
non-operating profit
right here.

62
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,320
So that's the way to
think about EBIT.

63
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,170
For most functional purposes,
unless you're talking about

64
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,080
like a financial statement, most
firms that aren't doing

65
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,160
anything too fancy on their
non-operating side of their

66
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,770
balance sheet, EBIT and
operating profit are pretty

67
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,060
close to each other.

68
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,500
But anyway, in this case
this guy's generating

69
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,690
$1 million of EBIT.

70
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:21,150
And let's say that this company,
Company B-- we'll

71
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,340
label these as Company
A, this is Company B.

72
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:32,470
Company B, it's getting a 15%
EBIT return on its assets, so

73
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:38,490
it's generating $1.5 million
in EBIT per year.

74
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,470
So just when I look at the
left-hand sides of the balance

75
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,940
sheet-- I haven't drawn the
right-hand side yet-- I would

76
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,670
say that this guy is a better
manager of these assets.

77
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,450
He's better at extracting value,
given the amount of

78
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,410
capital that has been put
into this company.

79
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,430
So that's why I like the
definition of EBIT divided by

80
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:02,000
assets, or operating profit
divided by assets.

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,580
Now, let's give a situation
where this guy

82
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,920
has very little debt.

83
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,210
   

84
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:16,350
Let's say he has no debt and
he has all equity, so the

85
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,110
right-hand side of his balance
sheet looks like this.

86
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,460
Let's say he has no liabilities
of significance.

87
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:28,800
   

88
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,910
He has no liabilities
of significance,

89
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,160
so this is all equity.

90
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,370
   

91
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:39,680
So when you want to figure out
this guy's pre-tax income, you

92
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,480
take EBIT minus-- actually, let
me move the window down a

93
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,470
little bit.

94
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:49,880
You take EBIT minus interest
to get pre-tax.

95
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,960
So how much pre-tax
does he have?

96
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,340
Pre-tax earnings?

97
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,580
Well, he has no debt, right?

98
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,420
So he has no interest. So his
pre-tax earnings, or you can

99
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,060
call it, which no one else ever
does, is EBT, which you

100
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,290
don't want to say because it
sounds like EBIT, but Earnings

101
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,400
Before Taxes.

102
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,420
No one ever says EBT.

103
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,110
They always say pre-tax.

104
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,720
But that would also
be $1 million.

105
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,830
And then if you go even further,
and you say, this guy

106
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,840
for some reason, he had a bunch
of tax credits this year

107
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,090
or he had some losses last
year that he was able to

108
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,370
offset to use against his taxes,
so this year, he also

109
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,570
didn't have to pay any taxes.

110
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:36,200
So his earnings or his net
income is also $1 million.

111
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,440
Fair enough.

112
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:44,530
So this guy has a 10% EBIT
return on his assets, but his

113
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,110
earnings or his net income
is also this $1 million.

114
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,790
Now let's say this guy over
here, he has a little bit more

115
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,100
debt on his balance sheet.

116
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,380
Let's say it's similar to the
first example we did, so let

117
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,090
me draw that.

118
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:02,600
So let's say he has $5
million of debt.

119
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,340
But the amount isn't
necessarily the

120
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,000
most important thing.

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,780
So he has $5 million of
debt or liabilities.

122
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,940
Liabilities could be other
things as well.

123
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,370
It could be he owes pension
liabilities or

124
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,740
who knows what else.

125
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,670
So he has $5 million of debt,
but the important thing is he

126
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,790
has interest. So every year,
let's say he has to pay

127
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:22,570
$500,000 in interest.
He's paying 10%

128
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,010
interest on his debt.

129
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,340
10% of $5 million is $500,000.

130
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,865
So his pre-tax-- let's do the
bottom part of his balance

131
00:06:30,865 --> 00:06:36,550
sheet-- his EBIT, his Earnings
Before Interest and Taxes, is

132
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:42,680
$1.5 million, but then if you
want to subtract out interest,

133
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:48,230
you'd subtract out minus $0.5
million, $500,000, and so his

134
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:55,940
pre-tax is going to
be $1 million.

135
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,770
And now this guy also-- so
essentially the equity holder

136
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,420
before paying tax --this
is equity here.

137
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,140
He has $5 million of equity.

138
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,230
This guy had $10 million
right here.

139
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,670
And this is pre-tax.

140
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,800
He has to pay the 30% like we
did in the previous example.

141
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,270
He has to pay 30% on taxes.

142
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:19,500
So his net income will
be $700,000, right?

143
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,490
Because he has $1 million
pre-tax, he has to pay

144
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:25,900
$300,000 in taxes, so he has
a $700,000 net income.

145
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:30,130
Now, let's look at what we would
get in terms of an ROA

146
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:34,340
if we did it using this
definition that some textbooks

147
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,790
will give you.

148
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:40,200
For the first guy, his net
earnings are $1 million and

149
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,760
his assets were $10 million.

150
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:50,760
So by this definition up here,
Company A has a 10% ROA.

151
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,140
By that definition over here,
this guy made $700,000 of net

152
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:58,620
income off of $10 million, so
he is going to be making an

153
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,800
ROA of what? $700,000
divided by 10 is 7%.

154
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,000
So now if you just look
superficially at these numbers

155
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,070
as defined by this ratio right
here, you'll say, oh, this

156
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,610
guy, Company A, has a better
return on asset.

157
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:15,030
He's better at managing
his assets.

158
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,330
And you know that that's
completely false.

159
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,660
Company A was getting
a much lower EBIT

160
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,630
return on his assets.

161
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,790
He was only getting 10%.

162
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,610
This guy was getting 15%.

163
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,960
Company A was just better at,
one, it didn't have any debt,

164
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,140
and it was also better at
maybe this year avoiding

165
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,230
paying taxes.

166
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:36,030
So when you talk about ROA,
there are other ratios that

167
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:41,159
start factoring in how good is
a company at financing its

168
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,990
assets and how good is a
company at paying taxes

169
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,800
efficiently, which is just
another way of evading as many

170
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,510
taxes as possible.

171
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,020
But that's a separate ratio.

172
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:54,940
Return on asset to me says, what
does a company do with

173
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,770
the left-hand side of
the balance sheet?

174
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:00,280
And when you do the net income
version, you're factoring

175
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,760
things in like interest and
taxes, and then you're

176
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,320
muddying up the picture.

177
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,950
You're not telling me which
company is better at actually

178
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,070
giving a return just on its
assets, not how it actually

179
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,430
pays for its assets.

180
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,740
This definition that Wikipedia
gives-- and it's good to be

181
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,470
aware of all of them, because
I don't want you to watch

182
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,840
these videos and say, oh, no.

183
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,860
Sal said it's operating profit
divided by asset, or EBIT

184
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,900
divided by asset.

185
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,830
It's good to know these so that
these aren't unfamiliar

186
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:27,600
terms to you.

187
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,420
What I'm telling you is that
this definition is more of a

188
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,130
real intuitive sense of what
a company's doing with its

189
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,930
assets, while these are kind
of textbook definitions.

190
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:42,950
This one attempts to add back
interest. It adds back

191
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:47,620
interest, so just the interest
part between this company and

192
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,800
this company won't differentiate
between the two.

193
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,490
But this one does take into
account which company is good

194
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,210
or bad at paying taxes.

195
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,660
And I realize I'm out of time.

196
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,780
In the next video, maybe I'll
talk a little bit more in

197
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:03,000
depth about the tax savings from
interest, because it's an

198
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,240
interesting concept
right there.

199
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,110
But I think I'm getting a little
bit into the weeds now,

200
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,550
because I want to kind of get
back high level and give you

201
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,080
an overarching view of how you
can think about investments

202
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,490
and price to earnings
and whatever else.

203
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,780
I'll focus back on that
on the next video.

204
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,200
See you soon.

205
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,700
