00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,100
One last problem in this section.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,120
Let's see, problem number 16.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,410
After the first term, each term in a sequence is

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,010
3 greater than 1/3 the preceding term

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:16,210
So if I were to write that--so if I were to say n of i plus 1

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:25,890
so is equal to the preceding term times 1/3 plus 3.

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,210
And all I'm saying is, if I have a term, right?

8
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:33,430
Say the ith term is n, n sub i--I take 1/3 of it and add 3

9
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,710
to get the next term.

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,770
That's all. This is just fancy notation for that.

11
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,950
If t is the first term of the sequence and t does not equal 0

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,820
so this is t.

13
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,390
I probably didn't even have to write this.

14
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,080
Ignore this if this confuses you. so t is the first term,

15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,410
What's the next term going to be?

16
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,790
It's going to be 1/3 times t plus 3.

17
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,860
So it's going to be t/3 plus 3.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,600
And they're going to say-- and then we could keep going-- but

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,150
they just want to know, what is the ratio of the second

20
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,040
term to the first term?

21
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,080
So what is the ratio of this to this?

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:11,130
Well the ratio is t/3 plus 3, to t. Right?

23
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:22,940
And that's the same thing as t/3 plus 3 times 1/t.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,950
That's the same thing as t/3 times 1/t plus 3 times 1/t.

25
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,040
I just distributed the 1/t. These cancel out.

26
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,040
So that equals 1/3 plus 3 over t.

27
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,600
And that doesn't look like any of the choices I see,

28
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,480
so we probably have to find a common denominator.

29
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,470
So let's say the common denominator is 3t.

30
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,020
Just multiply the two.

31
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:57,700
1/3 is the same thing as t over 3t, and 3/t is the same thing

32
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,110
as 9/3 t, right?

33
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,370
I just multiplied the top and the bottom by 3.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,030
So t plus 9/3 t. t plus 9/3 t is choice C.

35
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,010
And you could even ignore this.

36
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:16,730
Really, the hard part isn't even this.

37
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:17,610
The hard part is actually just,

38
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,000
you might end up with something like this.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,710
And then you're like, well I don't see that choice,

40
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,450
and then you have to realize, oh I have to find a common

41
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:28,010
denominator to get to this. The common denominator is 3t.

42
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,670
Well that's it. That's a very short video.

43
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:35,030
I'll see you in the next SAT test, or on the next SAT test.
