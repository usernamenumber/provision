00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,072
What I want to do in this video is,

2
00:00:02,072 --> 00:00:10,923
I want to prove that segment AC is perpendicular to segment DB

3
00:00:10,923 --> 00:00:15,165
based on the information we have in this diagram over here,

4
00:00:15,165 --> 00:00:17,735
that this side (DC) has the same length as that side (BC),

5
00:00:17,735 --> 00:00:20,958
this side (DA) has the same length as that side (BA),

6
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:26,708
and I'll give you a hint. We're going to use one or more of our congruent postulates.

7
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:29,665
I'll just call them postulates from now on.

8
00:00:29,665 --> 00:00:34,490
And so the ones that we know -- so let me draw a little line here. This is kind of our toolkit;

9
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:40,600
we have the Side-Side-Side postulate, that if the 3 sides are congruent, then the 2 triangles are congruent.

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:47,747
We have Side-Angle-Side. Two sides and the angle in between are congruent, then the two triangles are congruent.

11
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:54,730
We have ASA. Two angles with the side in between. And then we have AAS. Two angles and then a side.

12
00:00:54,730 --> 00:01:00,235
So any of these things we've established are postulates. We're going to assume they imply congruency.

13
00:01:00,235 --> 00:01:05,602
And I'm going to also do this as what we call a "two column proof," and you don't have to do something as a two column proof,

14
00:01:05,602 --> 00:01:11,203
but this is what you'll normally see in introductory geometry class, so I thought it would expose you to it.

15
00:01:11,203 --> 00:01:18,401
But it is a pretty basic idea that you make a statement and you just have to give the reason for your statement.

16
00:01:18,401 --> 00:01:23,495
Which is what we've been doing for any proof, but we haven't always put it in a very structured way.

17
00:01:23,495 --> 00:01:36,270
So I'm just going to do it like this. I'll have 2 columns like this, like that; and I'll going to have a "statement", and I'll give the "reason" for the statement.

18
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,333
And so the strategy that I'm going to try to do is -- it looks like right off the bat,

19
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:50,817
it seems I can prove that triangle CDA is congruent to triangle CBA based on Side-Side-Side.

20
00:01:50,817 --> 00:01:56,265
That's a pretty good starting point because once I can base congruency, then I can have angles be the same.

21
00:01:56,265 --> 00:02:02,737
And the reason I can do that is because this side is the same as that side, this side is the same as that side, and they both share that side.

22
00:02:02,737 --> 00:02:07,902
But I don't want to do it just verbally this time; I want to write it out properly in this two column proof.

23
00:02:07,902 --> 00:02:21,273
So we have the length of segment CD is equal to the length of CB; CD = CB, and that is given.

24
00:02:21,273 --> 00:02:25,124
So these two characters have the same length.

25
00:02:25,124 --> 00:02:41,029
We also know that the length of segment DA is the same as the length of segment BA. So DA = BA. That's also given in the diagram.

26
00:02:41,029 --> 00:02:45,926
And then we also know that CA is equal to CA, I guess we could say.

27
00:02:45,926 --> 00:02:51,329
So CA is equal to itself. And it's obviously in both triangles.

28
00:02:51,329 --> 00:03:00,734
So this is also given or it's obvious from the diagram. It's a bit obvious; both triangles shared that side.

29
00:03:00,734 --> 00:03:08,924
So we have two triangles. Their corresponding sides have the same length, and so we know that they are congruent.

30
00:03:08,924 --> 00:03:21,730
So we know that triangle CDA is congruent to triangle CBA.

31
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:27,517
And we know that by the Side-Side-Side postulate and the statements given up here.

32
00:03:27,517 --> 00:03:33,803
Let me actually number our statements so we can refer back to this. 1, 2, 3, and 4.

33
00:03:33,803 --> 00:03:40,201
And so Side-Side-Side postulate and statements 1, 2, and 3.

34
00:03:40,201 --> 00:03:47,270
So statements 1, 2, and 3 and the Side-Side-Side postulate let us know that these two triangles are congruent.

35
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:56,396
And then if these are congruent, then we know, for example, we know that all of their corresponding angles are equivalent.

36
00:03:56,396 --> 00:04:01,575
So for example, this angle is going to be equal to that angle. So let's make that statement right over there.

37
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:11,055
We know that angle DCE -- so this is going to be statement 5. We know that angle DCE -- that's this angle right over here --

38
00:04:11,055 --> 00:04:14,277
is going to have the same measure -- we can even say they're congruent.

39
00:04:14,277 --> 00:04:23,129
I'll say the measure of angle DCE is going to be equal to the measure of angle BCE.

40
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:33,528
And this comes straight out of statement 4. Congruency. I can put it in parenthesis. Congruency of those triangles.

41
00:04:33,528 --> 00:04:38,274
This applies straight -- because they're both part of this larger triangle, they're the corresponding angles.

42
00:04:38,274 --> 00:04:43,671
So they're going to have the exact same measure. Now it seems like we can do something interesting

43
00:04:43,671 --> 00:04:49,309
with those two smaller triangles (they're kind of at the top left and the top right of this kite-like figure).

44
00:04:49,309 --> 00:04:57,554
Because we have a side -- two corresponding sides are congruent, two corresponding angles are congruent, and they have a side in common.

45
00:04:57,554 --> 00:05:04,071
They have his side in common right over here. So let's first just establish that they have this side in common right over here.

46
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:12,722
So I'll just write statement 6. We have CE -- the length of that line is equal to itself. Once again, this is just obvious.

47
00:05:12,722 --> 00:05:25,727
Obvious from diagram. It's the same line. Obvious from diagram. But now we can use that information -- so we don't have 3 sides,

48
00:05:25,727 --> 00:05:31,560
we haven't proven to ourselves that this side is the same as that side, that DE is the same length as EB,

49
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:41,864
but we do have a side, an angle between the sides, and another side. And so this looks pretty interesting for our Side-Angle-Side postulate.

50
00:05:41,864 --> 00:06:04,669
And so we can say, "By the Side-Angle-Side postulate, we can say that triangle DCE is congruent to triangle BCE."

51
00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:10,058
And when I write the labels for the triangles, I'm making sure that I'm kind of putting the corresponding points.

52
00:06:10,058 --> 00:06:17,935
So I started D, then went to C, then went to E. So the corresponding angle or corresponding point or vertex I could say

53
00:06:17,935 --> 00:06:22,826
for this triangle right over here is B. So if I started with D, I start with B.

54
00:06:22,826 --> 00:06:28,257
C in the middle is the corresponding vertex for either of these triangles, so I put it in the middle, and then they both go to E.

55
00:06:28,257 --> 00:06:32,196
And that's just to make sure that we are specifying what corresponding to what.

56
00:06:32,196 --> 00:06:40,001
And we know this is true by Side-Angle-Side and the information we got from --

57
00:06:40,001 --> 00:06:45,335
so we got this side is established, that these two sides are congruent was from statement 1,

58
00:06:45,335 --> 00:06:53,361
then that these angles are congruent is from statement 5, right over here, and then statement 6 gave us the other side.

59
00:06:53,361 --> 00:07:01,952
Statement 6, just like that. And if we know that these two triangles are congruent, that means that all of their corresponding angles are congruent.

60
00:07:01,952 --> 00:07:07,262
So we know, for example, that this angle right over here is going to be congruent to that angle over there.

61
00:07:07,262 --> 00:07:23,328
So let's write that down. So we know statement 8. The measure of angle DEC is equal to the measure of angle BEC.

62
00:07:23,328 --> 00:07:32,942
And this comes straight from statement 7. Once again, they're congruent. Congruency.

63
00:07:32,942 --> 00:07:43,817
And then we also know -- we'll make statement 9 -- that the measure of angle DEC -- or maybe we should just write this way.

64
00:07:43,817 --> 00:07:56,519
Angle DEC and angle BCE are supplementary. You can just look at that from inspection, but I'll write it decent --

65
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:04,845
are supplementary, which means they add up their measures add up to 180 degrees.

66
00:08:04,845 --> 00:08:20,931
And we know that because they're adjacent and outer sides form straight angle.

67
00:08:20,931 --> 00:08:25,792
And then, we can essentially -- the next step if we know that these two angles are equal to each other,

68
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:33,098
and if we know that they're complementary, our next step means that we can actually deduce that they must be 90 degrees.

69
00:08:33,098 --> 00:08:44,262
So 10, measure of angle DEC equals the measure of angle BEC, which equals 90 degrees.

70
00:08:44,262 --> 00:08:49,060
And then for the reason it might be more involved, we can put these two statements together,

71
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:57,122
so it'll be statements 8 and 9, and then statements 8 and 9 mean that DEC -- so I can write

72
00:08:57,122 --> 00:09:04,414
this measure of angle DEC plus measure of angle -- actually, let me just --

73
00:09:04,414 --> 00:09:09,974
since I don't want to too many steps all at once, let me just take it a little bit by a little bit.

74
00:09:09,974 --> 00:09:22,148
So let me just do it all like this. So let me say, "Measure of angle DEC plus measure of angle BEC is equal to 180,

75
00:09:22,148 --> 00:09:26,951
and this comes straight from point 9 that they are supplementary."

76
00:09:26,951 --> 00:09:33,121
And then we can say statement (I'm taking a lot of space now) 11, we could say,

77
00:09:33,121 --> 00:09:41,074
"Measure of angle DEC plus measure of angle DEC is equal to 180 degrees."

78
00:09:41,074 --> 00:09:49,369
And we know that from statement 9 and statement 8. We essentially just took statement 9

79
00:09:49,369 --> 00:09:54,897
and substituted that the measure of BEC is the same as the measure as DEC.

80
00:09:54,897 --> 00:10:08,930
And so then if we want statement 12, we can say, "Angle DEC is equal to 90, which is equal to the measure of angle BEC."

81
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:15,483
And then, this comes, once again, straight out of point number 11 and 8.

82
00:10:15,483 --> 00:10:19,819
And what you can see is I'm kind of taking a little bit more time, going a little bit more granular to the steps,

83
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:23,875
and some other person would have said, "Oh, obviously, this implies this or that." And then we're done!

84
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:31,474
Because if these are 90 degrees, -- so let me write the last statement -- so statement 13, which is what we wanted to prove.

85
00:10:31,474 --> 00:10:47,520
We wanted to prove that AC is perpendicular to DB. So AC is perpendicular to segment DB,

86
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,767
and it comes straight out of point 12. And we're done!

87
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:59,672
We've done a two column proof, and we've proven that this line segment right over here is perpendicular to that line segment right over there.

88
00:10:59,672 --> 00:11:03,672
We did it with the SSS postulate and the Side-Angle-Side postulate.
