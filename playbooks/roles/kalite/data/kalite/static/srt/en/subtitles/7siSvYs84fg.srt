1
00:00:01,432 --> 00:00:03,015
We've been talking about the law of demand

2
00:00:03,015 --> 00:00:04,663
and how if we hold all else equal,

3
00:00:04,663 --> 00:00:08,764
a change in price, price goes up, the quantity demanded goes down

4
00:00:08,764 --> 00:00:11,258
and the price goes down, the quantity demanded goes up.

5
00:00:11,258 --> 00:00:13,401
So if you hold all else equal,

6
00:00:13,401 --> 00:00:18,107
ceteris paribus, we are just moving alone this curve depending on what price,

7
00:00:18,107 --> 00:00:23,394
but we started talking about what happens when you change some of those we've been holding equal.

8
00:00:23,394 --> 00:00:24,911
How does that change demand?

9
00:00:24,911 --> 00:00:32,645
The last video we talked about the price of related goods(price of related goods)and if the price of related goods change,

10
00:00:32,645 --> 00:00:34,977
both compliments and substitutes,

11
00:00:34,977 --> 00:00:39,546
(how that might change) how that might increase or decrease demand,

12
00:00:39,546 --> 00:00:42,475
the entire curve not just one particular scenario.

13
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:47,893
Now let's talk about another one of those factors that we've been holding constant.

14
00:00:47,893 --> 00:00:51,275
Think about how that would change demand, the entire curve,

15
00:00:51,275 --> 00:00:56,380
if we were to change that and that's expectations of future prices. (Let do that in the screen) So

16
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:04,596
Expectations... Expectations... of future prices. So let's say...

17
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:12,813
So let's talk about our first scenario here,

18
00:01:12,813 --> 00:01:19,409
where let's say this curve, people didn't expect prices to change for my e-book and now all of a sudden,

19
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:22,946
people expect there's a change in expectation.

20
00:01:22,946 --> 00:01:26,799
Now all of the sudden they expect the prices to go up going forward,

21
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:40,214
So now expect the future price to go up. What's going to happen?

22
00:01:40,214 --> 00:01:49,448
If you expect the future price to go up and the good or the product in question is something that you can store, well, depending on how much you expected to go up,

23
00:01:49,448 --> 00:01:51,378
you're probably more likely to buy now

24
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:53,575
buy before the price goes up.

25
00:01:53,575 --> 00:01:59,078
So regardless of what point on this curve, regardless of the price point in any one of those price points,

26
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:03,109
people now, because they wanna, instead of buy it later, they wanna buy now;

27
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:07,699
there are more the current demand will go up in any of these price points.

28
00:02:07,699 --> 00:02:10,895
So at $2 more people would wanna buy 'cause things gonna go up.

29
00:02:10,895 --> 00:02:15,133
At $4, more people would wanna buy 'cause things gonna go up and any of these price points,

30
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:20,695
because now the expectations have gone from being neutral to now expecting prices to go up,

31
00:02:20,695 --> 00:02:23,699
it would shift the entire curve to the right,

32
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:27,211
so this would shift the entire curve to the right,

33
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:33,412
so this right over here is scenario one and depends on how much these changes to say how much these shift to the right,

34
00:02:33,412 --> 00:02:36,769
but it's just a general idea, this is scenario one,

35
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:43,495
and the shifting on the entire curve, you could say they increase demand,

36
00:02:43,495 --> 00:02:44,530
so this is literally demand increasing.

37
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:51,615
And when we talked about demand, remember, and I'm probably tired of me saying this,

38
00:02:51,615 --> 00:02:56,694
I'm not talking about particular quantity, I'm talking about the entire curve shifting to the right

39
00:02:56,694 --> 00:03:01,331
because people expect future prices to go up so the current demand went up,

40
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:04,978
the current demand curve shift to the right,

41
00:03:04,978 --> 00:03:09,932
and now we can just take another side of that, imagine what happens in senario two,

42
00:03:09,932 --> 00:03:18,017
before people were neutral, that was our curve right there they didn't have any opinion about whether future prices would go up or down or maybe they just assumed they would gonna stay the same,

43
00:03:18,017 --> 00:03:33,282
and now they expect the future prices to go down, now expect future prices to go down and this is only gonna happen in consumer electronics all the time,(confused)

44
00:03:33,282 --> 00:03:37,900
you see whenever you buy a laptop or any type of electronic devices,

45
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:48,826
you now assume the price will go down now what we are talking about is the change expectation so you are going from neutrality or let's say you are going from you expected them to go down

46
00:03:48,826 --> 00:03:54,151
but now you expected them to go down even faster and of all you see expected them to go down faster you are even less likely to buy them now.

47
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:57,893
So if you expect if before you thought prices were going to be roughly constant,

48
00:03:57,893 --> 00:04:01,876
and now you expect them to go down, now you are gonna say wow,

49
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:08,632
I didn't give price why don't I just hold off a little bit and wait a little bit so it's going to lower demand

50
00:04:08,632 --> 00:04:17,716
so in this scenario the whole curve will shift to the left at any given price point the quantity demanded will go down at any point of that curve,

51
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:21,716
so the entire demand curve will be shifted to the left, so because of senario two demand was decreased.
