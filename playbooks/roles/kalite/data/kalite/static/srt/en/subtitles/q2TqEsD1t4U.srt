1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800
   

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,310
We're on the last section of the
last test. So this is the

3
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,730
home stretch.

4
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,670
Problem 1.

5
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,040
A restaurant menu lists 8
dinners and 3 desserts.

6
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,220
How many different
dinner-dessert combinations

7
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,400
are possible from this menu?

8
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,940
So you have 8 dinners.

9
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,070
And for each of them you can
have 3 different desserts.

10
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:18,350
Right?

11
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,500
So that's 8 times
3 combinations.

12
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,920
And that's 24.

13
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,350
And you could list them
all out, right?

14
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,420
For dinner 1 you could have
1, 2, 3, desserts.

15
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,200
For dinner 2 you can have
1, 2, 3, desserts.

16
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,740
So you would have 3 for each of
the 8, 3 possible desserts.

17
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,830
So that's how you get to 24.

18
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,030
Problem 2.

19
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:47,410
The sum of 3x and 5 is equal to
the product of x times 1/3.

20
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,630
So I just read it and while
I read it I wrote it out.

21
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:55,960
The sum of 3x and 5 is equal to
the product of x and 1/3.

22
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,090
Which of the following
equations gives the

23
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,830
relationship stated in
the problem above?

24
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:03,690
Well, exactly as I wrote
it, that's choice E.

25
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,560
x times 1/3, that's the
same thing as 1/3 x.

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,010
So that's 1/3 x.

27
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,840
So that's choice E.

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,090
Problem 3.

29
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,190
   

30
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,590
Let me see if I can
do it right here.

31
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,410
A clerk accidentally threw a
valuable document into one of

32
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:21,365
90 trash cans.

33
00:01:21,365 --> 00:01:23,150
All right, 1 of 90 trash cans.

34
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,070
Let's say there are
90 trash cans.

35
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:28,330
It is equally likely that the
document is in any one of

36
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,950
these 90 trash cans.

37
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:34,820
If exactly 15 of these 90 trash
cans are blue, what is

38
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,890
the probability that the
document will be in

39
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,890
a blue trash can?

40
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,030
Well, 15 of these 90 are blue.

41
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,800
So the probability it's going
to be in one of those 15 is

42
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,520
going to be is essentially
15/90.

43
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,050
How do I know that?

44
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:54,690
Well there's 100% probability
it's in 1 of the 90, right?

45
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,090
And so if I want to know, what
is the probability it's in one

46
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,430
of the blue, I take the
fraction of the

47
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,640
blue over the whole.

48
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,650
And that's the probability that
it's in one of the blue

49
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:02,160
trash cans.

50
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,360
And if I divide the top and the
bottom-- let's see 15 goes

51
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,695
into 90-- 15 goes into
30 2 times, so it

52
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:09,600
goes into 90 6 times.

53
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,610
So this is 1/6.

54
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,663
Just divide the numerator and
the denominator by 15.

55
00:02:13,663 --> 00:02:17,750
And that's choice C.

56
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,300
Next problem.

57
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,380
Problem 4.

58
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:28,040
How many different integer pairs
satisfy the equation, x

59
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,480
over y is equal to 1/2?

60
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,680
So another way of writing this,
you could say that x is

61
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,290
equal to 1/2 y.

62
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,870
I just multiply both
sides by y.

63
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,470
Or you can multiply
both sides by 2.

64
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,470
And you say 2x is equal to y.

65
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,350
So how many integer pairs
satisfy this?

66
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:48,200
Well, any integer I've
put in here, I double

67
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,980
it and I get a y.

68
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:49,940
So what of the pairs?

69
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:56,720
1, 2, 2, 4, 3, 6, 4, 8, 5, 10.

70
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,840
They're infinite.

71
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,720
I can keep going.

72
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,150
So the answer is more than 4.

73
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,690
I mean, I listed more
than 4 just in the

74
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,900
span of about 5 seconds.

75
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,320
So the answer is definitely E.

76
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,020
There are infinite integer
pairs that

77
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,230
satisfy that equation.

78
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,790
Next problem.

79
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,840
Problem 5.

80
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,890
Let me see what they're asking
first. According to the graph

81
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:20,170
above, during which of the
following 2 month periods did

82
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,590
Ellen's bookstore sell the
least number of books?

83
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,580
So a 2 month period.

84
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,930
Interesting.

85
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,720
So let's draw the graph.

86
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:35,810
And so this is June,
July, August,

87
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,033
September, October, November.

88
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:46,650
And this is 10, 20, 30, 40 and
I'm going to try to draw as

89
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,750
best as they drew,
as best as I can.

90
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,770
So in June, it looks like they
sold a little under, I don't

91
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,480
know, 10 books.

92
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,915
June looks something
like that.

93
00:03:56,915 --> 00:03:59,000
In July they sold a ton.

94
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,270
They sold 40 books,
it looks like.

95
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,391
July looks something
like that.

96
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:07,685
In August they sold exactly
10 books, it looks like.

97
00:04:07,685 --> 00:04:09,420
I'll just eyeball it.

98
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,096
August. September looks like
30, or a little over 30.

99
00:04:13,096 --> 00:04:16,740
September is like there.

100
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:24,790
October is like 25.

101
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:30,624
And then November is 30.

102
00:04:30,624 --> 00:04:32,750
November looks about 30.

103
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,070
So they say, during which of the
following 2 month periods

104
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,160
did Ellen's bookstore sell the
least number of books?

105
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,670
So let's look at the choices.

106
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:44,280
Choice A is June and July.

107
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,530
Whoops.

108
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,150
   

109
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,660
So how many books did she
sell in June and July?

110
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,840
We can eyeball it.

111
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,260
Let's say that this is
7 and this is 40.

112
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,870
So this is going to be 47.

113
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,890
July and August is
this period.

114
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,770
   

115
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,780
So I can already tell you that
July and August is going to be

116
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,740
higher than June and July.

117
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,920
Why?

118
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,430
Because August is higher
than June.

119
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,720
August looks like 10.

120
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,720
This looks like 40.

121
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,480
So this is going to be 50.

122
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:20,320
And then if we look at August
and September and if we say

123
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,290
that this is 10 and that
looks like about-- I

124
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:27,580
don't know-- 30, 33.

125
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,900
So what's 10 plus 33?

126
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,160
43.

127
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,850
So that's our winner so far.

128
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,755
And then they're asking
September and October.

129
00:05:34,755 --> 00:05:35,860
Let me switch colors.

130
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,782
September and October
would be that.

131
00:05:37,782 --> 00:05:43,655
If that's 33, October
looks like about 25.

132
00:05:43,655 --> 00:05:44,800
So there's a little bit
of approximation here.

133
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,410
So what's 33 plus 25?

134
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,160
That's 58 and that's actually
the most so far.

135
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,520
And then finally October
and November.

136
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,495
November looks like 30.

137
00:05:55,495 --> 00:05:57,240
So what's 30 plus 25.

138
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,450
It's 55.

139
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:02,200
So the smallest is definitely
August and September.

140
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,450
Next problem.

141
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,470
   

142
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,940
Maybe I'll stick with
this white.

143
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,550
Problem 6.

144
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,896
OK, they drew us a line.

145
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:20,730
And they say that this is point
A, this is point B and

146
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,420
this is point C.

147
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:27,750
In the figure above,
AC equals 24.

148
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:32,000
And they tell us that
AB is equal to BC.

149
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,700
So this side, this length has
to equal that length and

150
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,390
combined they add up to 24.

151
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,760
So we know that's going
to be 12 and that's

152
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,180
also going to be 12.

153
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,140
Because they have to add up
to 24 and they're equal.

154
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:49,320
Point D, not shown, is on the
line between A and B-- so

155
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:55,470
point D is someplace here-- such
that AD is equal to DB.

156
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,165
So if we put D here, I'll do
it in a different color.

157
00:06:59,165 --> 00:07:05,210
If this is D, they want us-- so
12 is this whole length and

158
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,930
they're saying AD
is equal to DB.

159
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,780
So what are each of these
smaller lengths

160
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,540
going to be, equal?

161
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,220
This is equal to this, so this
is going to have to be 6 and

162
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,370
this is going to have
to be 6, right?

163
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,970
Because the two sides are equal
and the two lengths are

164
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:18,780
equal and they add up to 12.

165
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,750
Now what are they asking?

166
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,980
What does DC equal?

167
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,090
So what is this distance?

168
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,420
Just to here.

169
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,100
From there to there.

170
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,480
OK.

171
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,600
So we'd have to go
6 to get to B.

172
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,410
And then we'd have to go
12 more to get to c.

173
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,880
6 plus 12 and that gets us 18.

174
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,000
So this distance is 18.

175
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,880
Not too bad.

176
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,320
This problem is that's
answer D.

177
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,570
Problem 7.

178
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:49,100
   

179
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:55,610
If n is a positive integer
then 6 times 10 to the

180
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:05,030
negative n, plus 1 times
10 to the negative

181
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,820
n must equal what?

182
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,740
So let's simplify that.

183
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:13,210
This is essentially-- I mean
they wrote it a little

184
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:16,250
complicated-- but we have six
10s to the negative n here.

185
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,260
And then we have
1 more, right?

186
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,870
I mean 6 times 10 to
the negative n.

187
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,690
You could rewrite this as 10 to
the negative n plus 10 to

188
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:26,040
the negative n plus 10 to the
negative n plus 10 to the

189
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,595
negative n-- not that I'd
recommend you to do this on

190
00:08:27,595 --> 00:08:30,540
the exam-- 10 to the negative
n plus 10 to the negative n.

191
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:30,970
How many have I drawn?

192
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,130
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

193
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:33,360
Right.

194
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,090
That's 6 times 10 to
the negative n.

195
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:40,980
And to that we add 1 more
10 to the negative n.

196
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,010
So how many 10 to the negative
ns do we have?

197
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,440
We have 7 now.

198
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,100
Right?

199
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,470
So it's 7 times 10 to
the negative n.

200
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,890
And that is not a choice.

201
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,860
So what's another way of writing
10 to the negative n?

202
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,870
Well, that's the same thing
as 1 over 10 to the n.

203
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,500
So that's 7 times 1
over 10 to the n.

204
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,600
Which is, of course, equal
to 7 over 10 to the n.

205
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,850
And that is choice B.

206
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,480
   

207
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,840
Next problem.

208
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,170
Actually, I'll do it in the next
video because I have less

209
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,040
than a minute left.

210
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,450
I'll see--
