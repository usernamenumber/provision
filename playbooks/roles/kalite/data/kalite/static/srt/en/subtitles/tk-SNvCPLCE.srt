1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
   

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,030
If I were to draw a hand, and
let me just draw a hand really

3
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:07,500
fast, so I'll draw
a left hand.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,620
It looks something like that.

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,220
That is a left hand.

6
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,970
Now, if I were to take its
mirror image, let's say that

7
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,460
this is a mirror right there,
and I want to take its mirror

8
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,970
image, and I'll draw the
mirror image in green.

9
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,450
So its mirror image would look
something like this.

10
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:26,540
   

11
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,910
Not exact, but you
get the idea.

12
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,590
The mirror image of a left
hand looks a lot

13
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,140
like a right hand.

14
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,780
Now, no matter how I try to
shift or rotate this hand like

15
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,750
this, I might try to maybe
rotate it 180 degrees, so that

16
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,500
the thumb is on the other side
like this image right here.

17
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,260
But no matter what I do, I will
never be able to make

18
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,340
this thing look like
that thing.

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,190
I can shift it and rotate it,
it'll just never happen.

20
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,590
I will never be able to
superimpose the blue hand on

21
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:54,870
top of this green hand.

22
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,110
When I say superimpose,
literally put it exactly on

23
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,490
top of the green hand.

24
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:04,030
So whenever something is not
superimposable on its mirror

25
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:25,040
image-- let me write this down--
we call it chiral.

26
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,540
So this hand drawing
right here is an

27
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,380
example of a chiral object.

28
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,610
Or I guess the hand is an
example of a chiral object.

29
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,750
This is not superimposable
on its mirror image.

30
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,320
And it makes sense that it's
called chiral because the word

31
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,950
chiral comes from the
Greek word for hand.

32
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:52,170
   

33
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,990
And this definition of
not being able to be

34
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,020
superimposable on its mirror
image, this applies whether

35
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,560
you're dealing with chemistry,
or mathematics, or I guess,

36
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,470
just hands in general.

37
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,150
So if we extend this definition
to chemistry,

38
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,110
because that's what we're
talking about, there's two

39
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,259
concepts here.

40
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:17,500
There are chiral molecules,
and then there are chiral

41
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,310
centers or chiral-- well, I call
them chiral atoms. They

42
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,430
tend to be carbon atoms, so
sometimes they call them

43
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,650
chiral carbons.

44
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:31,530
So you have these
chiral atoms.

45
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,350
Now, chiral molecules are
literally molecules that are

46
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,370
not superimposable on
their mirror image.

47
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,550
   

48
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,720
I'm not going to write
the whole thing.

49
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,120
You know, not superimposable--
I'll just

50
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,480
write the whole thing.

51
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:51,310
Not superimposable
on mirror image.

52
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:55,230
   

53
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,300
Now, for chiral atoms, this is
essentially true, but when you

54
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:04,790
look for chiral atoms within a
molecule, the best way to spot

55
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,760
them is to recognize that these
generally, or maybe I

56
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,620
should say usually, are carbons,
especially when we're

57
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,550
dealing in organic chemistry,
but they could be phosphoruses

58
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:24,590
or sulfurs, but usually are
carbons bonded to four

59
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,840
different groups.

60
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,550
   

61
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:34,720
And I want to emphasize
groups, not just four

62
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,250
different atoms. And to kind of
highlight a molecule that

63
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,470
contains a chiral atom or chiral
carbon, we can just

64
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,390
think of one.

65
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,230
So let's say that I have a
carbon right here, and I'm

66
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,700
going to set this up so this
is actually a chiral atom,

67
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,100
that the carbon specific is a
chiral atom, but it's partly a

68
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,230
chiral molecule.

69
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,410
And then we'll see examples
that one or both

70
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,670
of these are true.

71
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:02,780
Let's say it's bonded
to a methyl group.

72
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,660
From that bond, it kind of
pops out of the page.

73
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,990
Let's say there's a
bromine over here.

74
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:12,390
Let's say behind it, there is a
hydrogen, and then above it,

75
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,360
we have a fluorine.

76
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,250
Now if I were to take the mirror
image of this thing

77
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:20,892
right here, we have your carbon
in the center-- I want

78
00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:22,710
to do it in that same blue.

79
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,210
You have the carbon in the
center and then you have the

80
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,750
fluorine above the carbon.

81
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,970
You have your bromine now
going in this direction.

82
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,220
You have this methyl group.

83
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,800
It's still popping out of the
page, but it's now going to

84
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,800
the right instead of to
the left, So CH3.

85
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,720
And then you have the hydrogen
still in the back.

86
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,320
These are mirror images, if you
view this as kind of the

87
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,970
mirror and you can see on both
sides of the mirror.

88
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,240
Now, why is this chiral?

89
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,090
Well, it's a little bit of a
visualization challenge, but

90
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:56,870
no matter how you try to rotate
this thing right here,

91
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,470
you will never make it exactly
like this thing.

92
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:04,660
You might try to rotate it
around like that and try to

93
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,690
get the methyl group over here,
to get it over there.

94
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,160
So let's try to do that.

95
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,260
If we try to get the methyl
group over there, what's going

96
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,510
to happen to the other groups?

97
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,070
Well, then the hydrogen group is
going-- or the hydrogen, I

98
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,340
should say.

99
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,930
The hydrogen atom is going to
move there and the bromine is

100
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,410
going to move there.

101
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,440
So this would be superimposable
if this was a

102
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,130
hydrogen and this was a
bromine, but it's not.

103
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,930
You can imagine, the hydrogen
and bromine are switched.

104
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,110
And you could flip it and do
whatever else you want or try

105
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,120
to rotate it in any direction,
but you're not going to be

106
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,650
able to superimpose them.

107
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:41,350
So this molecule right here is
a chiral molecule, and this

108
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:50,710
carbon is a chiral center, so
this carbon is a chiral

109
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,990
carbon, sometimes called
an asymmetric

110
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,970
carbon or a chiral center.

111
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,360
Sometimes you'll hear
something called a

112
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,265
stereocenter.

113
00:05:59,265 --> 00:06:02,340
A stereocenter is a more general
term for any point in

114
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,470
a molecule that is asymmetric
relative to the different

115
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,000
groups that it is joined to.

116
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,350
But all of these, especially
when you're in kind of in

117
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:13,730
introductory organic chemistry
class, tends to be a carbon

118
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,660
bonded to four different
groups.

119
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,530
And I want to to stress that
it's not four different atoms.

120
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,920
You could have had a methyl
group here and a propyl group

121
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,010
here, and the carbon would still
be bonded directly to a

122
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,740
carbon in either case, but that
would still be a chiral

123
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,790
carbon, and this would still
actually be a chiral molecule.

124
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:37,150
In the next video, we'll
do a bunch of examples.

125
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,810
We'll look at molecules, try
to identify the chiral

126
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,975
carbons, and then try to
figure out whether the

127
00:06:41,975 --> 00:06:44,180
molecule itself is--

128
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,533
