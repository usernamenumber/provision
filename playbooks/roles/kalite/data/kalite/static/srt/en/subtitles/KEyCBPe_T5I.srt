1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,070
OK, we're on problem number 16.

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,040
Let's see, they drew us something here.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,050
From point A to point B, I have a line.

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:15,090
Then I have another, B to C.

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,070
Then I have another, from here to here.

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,000
OK, so what are they telling us?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,040
They tell us, this is a 90 degree angle.

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:29,010
Whoops, not what I wanted to do, edit, undo.

9
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm using the wrong tool.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,430
So they tell us, this is a 90 degree angle.

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,020
this is 90 degree angle.

12
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:44,010
This is A, this is B, this is C, this is D.

13
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:44,630
And they say,

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,880
the figure above shows the route of Diane's tripŁŹ

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,080
from her house to her job.

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:53,060
Diane travels 16 miles from A to B, so this is 16.

17
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,070
15 miles from B to C, so this is 15.

18
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:01,020
And 4 miles from C to D, so this is 4.

19
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,470
If she were to travel from A to D directly,

20
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,040
how much shorter in miles would the trip be?

21
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,040
So what would be the direct route?

22
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,790
I'm assuming,

23
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,000
they're kind of talking if she could fly.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,050
What would be her direct route?

25
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,080
So that would be this route.

26
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,050
I thought I was using the line tool.

27
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,020
Edit, undo.

28
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,010
I'll do it in a better color anyway.

29
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,020
So this is the direct route, right here.

30
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,010
This is we want to figure out, the distance of this.

31
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,010
So how can we figure out the distances?

32
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:30,800
And the trick here is to just realize that

33
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,030
this is going to be the hypotenuse of a right triangle

34
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,600
And you might-- seem confusing,

35
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,370
your initial impulse might have been to say this is x

36
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,070
and this is 15 minus x, and all of this fancy stuff.

37
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,900
Or what you could do, is you can say,

38
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,020
well, this side here,

39
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,070
we know what this is, this length.

40
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,000
Whoops.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,270
Let me draw it a little bit better.

42
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,090
That length, what is that length?

43
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,790
this length is going to be the same as this length

44
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,270
right?

45
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,080
If we assume this is a 90 degree angle.

46
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,010
It's going to be 15.

47
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,670
And then what's this length, right here?

48
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,060
it's going to same as this length up here, right?

49
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,090
I just kind of extended a rectangle.

50
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,010
So this length right here is 4.

51
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:21,000
So what is this entire length?

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,060
It's going to be 16 plus 4, so it's 20.

53
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,040
So now, what we're trying to figure out

54
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,940
her straight line distance is nothing but

55
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,600
the hypotenuse of a rectangle-- of a right triangle

56
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,030
where we know the other two sides.

57
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,310
So we can say,

58
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,790
if this is her straight line distance, x,

59
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,810
we could say x squared is equal to 20 squared,

60
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:51,050
20 squared plus 15 squared.

61
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,250
x squared is equal to--

62
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,050
let's see, this is 400, plus 225, is equal to 625.

63
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:02,060
And the square root of 625 is 25, so x is equal to 25

64
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,080
So her straight line distance is 25.

65
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,080
And how far was she travelling before?

66
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:16,020
Let's see, she was going 16 plus 15 plus 4.

67
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,040
So that's 20-- she was going 35, what is that, miles?

68
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,000
Right, miles.

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,390
She was going 35 miles,

70
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,050
and if she goes straight, she goes 25 miles.

71
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:29,180
So she would save 10 miles if she went straight,

72
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,040
if she was able to fly.

73
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,060
So that's choice C.

74
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,090
Next problem.

75
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:45,050
Problem number 17.

76
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,310
One circle has a radius of 1/2,

77
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,070
and another circle has a radius of 1.

78
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:53,550
What is the ratio of the area of the larger circle

79
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,010
to the area of the smaller circle?

80
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:02,400
Let's see, so the area of circle 1, area 1,

81
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:06,060
is going to be equal to what?

82
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,030
It has a radius of 1/2, right?

83
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,030
So it's pi r squared, is the radius.

84
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:18,010
So it's pi 1/2 squared.

85
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,070
And what's the area of circle 2?

86
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:26,050
The area of circle 2, it's pi times its radius.

87
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,030
And its radius is 1.

88
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,030
So 1 squared.

89
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,830
So the ratio of the area of the larger circle

90
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,330
to the smaller circle --

91
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,020
which one is going to be the larger circle?

92
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,060
This one is, because it has a larger radius, right?

93
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,030
It has a radius of 1.

94
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,900
So the ratio of the larger circle

95
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,060
to the smaller circle--

96
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,440
and that might be where you messed up,

97
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,570
if you flipped the two--

98
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,010
the ratio of the larger circle to the smaller circle

99
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,000
is equal to pi times 1, right?

100
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,040
Well that's just pi.

101
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:59,030
Over pi times 1/2 squared.

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,080
Pi's cancel out, so we have, it equals 1 over 1/4.

103
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,900
Or what we could do is

104
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,060
we could multiply the numerator

105
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:19,040
and the denominator by 4, which equals 4/1.

106
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:25,050
So the ratio is 4:1, and that's choice D.

107
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:30,030
Problem 18.

108
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,010
Clear image.

109
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,090
Problem 18.

110
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,290
If the sum of the consecutive integers

111
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,680
from minus 22 to x inclusive is 72,

112
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,630
what is the value of x?

113
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,480
So this is the number--

114
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,540
we've actually done a problem very,

115
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,290
very similar to this,

116
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,110
so it shows you that people at the SAT,

117
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,030
they think of a lot of creative problems,

118
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,060
but every now and then, they have to repeat.

119
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,940
So they're saying the sum of the consecutive integers

120
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,260
from minus 22 to x is 72.

121
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,050
So let's think about this, let's draw the sum.

122
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:07,920
So it's minus 22, plus minus 21, plus minus 20,

123
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,030
right?

124
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:16,000
Plus-- it keeps going, until it gets to 0-- plus 0.

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,400
And then--

126
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,450
and I'm going to go this way,

127
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:21,050
again, I'm doing that for a reason.

128
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:25,530
And then you can say, plus 1, plus 2, plus--

129
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,490
you keep going,

130
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:39,030
and then you'd have plus 20, plus 21, plus 22, plus 23

131
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:43,090
plus 24, all the way until we get to x, right?

132
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:48,320
What you need to realize is all the way

133
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:53,030
from minus 22 to 22, the sum is 0.

134
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,000
And why is that?

135
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,030
Well, look at the way I drew it.

136
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:57,530
So minus 22--

137
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,050
we're taking the sum of everything, right?

138
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:03,010
So minus 22 is going to cancel out with positive 22.

139
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,080
You add those together, you get 0.

140
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,020
Minus 21 is going to cancel out with positive 21.

141
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,070
Minus 20 is going to cancel out with positive 20.

142
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,070
And so forth, and so on.

143
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,490
So everything--

144
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,050
so the sum from minus 22 plus, bam, bam,

145
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:21,350
bam, bam, all the way to plus 22, that equals 0,

146
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,000
right?

147
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,080
So we only get into the positive sum once

148
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,080
we get to 23, right?

149
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,740
So 23 plus 24 plus something, something, something,

150
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,000
is x, right?

151
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,050
And we have to get to 72.

152
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,010
And here we can just eyeball it.

153
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:44,080
23 plus 24 plus 25, what's that?

154
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,000
Well their average is 24, 24 times 3 is 72.

155
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,030
Or we can just add it up.

156
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:55,090
So 23 plus 24 is 47, 47 plus 25, it equals 72.

157
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:59,060
So the last number that we use in this whole range is 25.

158
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,000
So this is x.

159
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,050
That is x.

160
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,650
And all we did is we said-- think about it,

161
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,370
take the sum from minus 22,

162
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,030
all the way to positive 25.

163
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,010
Everything up to negative 22,

164
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,060
from minus 22 to positive 22,

165
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,040
all of those cancel out with each other.

166
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,040
So the sum is just going to be 23 plus 24 plus 25.

167
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,060
That equals 72, so then x is 25.

168
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,390
Next problem-- I'm running out of time,

169
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,000
so I'd better do it in the next video.

170
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,080
See you soon.
