1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,440
So we're told that AE is equal to twelve that's this side right over

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:11,060
here and EC is equal to 18 EC is equal to 18

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,930
And then they've drawn a bunch of median's here for us

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,200
So we know that they are medians

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,380
Because when they intersect the opposite side

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,260
They're telling us that this length is equal to this length

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,930
So that ED is equal to DC CB is equal to BA

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,390
AF is equal to F here that F B and D are the mid points

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,410
And the G then would be the centroid

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,190
Where the medians intersect

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,670
And so the first thing they ask us is what is the area of B G C?

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,440
So B C G right here that is this triangle right over there

13
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,670
And to figure out that area we just have to remind ourselves

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,500
That the three medians of a triangle divide a triangle to

15
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,830
Divide a triangle into six

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,950
Six triangles that have equal area

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,200
So if we know the area of the entire triangle

18
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,660
And I think we can figure this out

19
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,000
This is a right triangle they're telling us that

20
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,560
AE this entire distance right over here is going to be twelve

21
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:07,610
So this is going to twelve which I'm gonna space

22
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,600
This entire distance right over here is 18 they tell us that

23
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:18,810
So the area the area of AEC, AEC is going to be

24
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,420
For the one half times the base which is 18 times a height

25
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:29,650
Which is 12 which is equals to 9 times 12 which is 108

26
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,860
That's the area of the entire right triangle triangle AEC

27
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,370
If we want the area of BGC

28
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,870
If we lower this little altitude right over here

29
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,290
The ones that are bounded by the medians

30
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,710
Then we just have to divide this by 6

31
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,500
Coz they all have equal area we've that in previous videos

32
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:55,840
So the area of BGC is equal to the area of AEC

33
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:01,280
The entire triangle divided by 6 which is 108 divided by 6

34
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,350
which is what it's 60 we get ten and then 48

35
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,320
This would be 18 it would be 18

36
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:14,530
And that's right coz it would be a 108 is the same as 18 times 6

37
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,640
So we get our first part the area of that right over there is 18

38
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,240
And if we want we can say hey the area of any of these triangles

39
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,260
These the ones that are bounded by the medians

40
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,780
This is gonna be 18, this is gonna be 18

41
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:29,710
This entire FGE triangle is going to be 18

42
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,780
But we did this first part right over there

43
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:37,900
Now they ask us what is the length of AG?

44
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:43,100
So AG is the distance it's the longer part of this median right over

45
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,990
here and to figure out what AG is we just have to remind ourselves

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,290
That the centroid, the centroid is

47
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,080
Always two thirds along the way of the median

48
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,530
Or it divides the median into two segments

49
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,290
That have a ratio of 2 to 1

50
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,430
So if we know the entire length of this median

51
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,050
We can just take two thirds of that

52
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,880
And that will give us the length of AG

53
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,200
And lucky for us this is a right triangle and we know that

54
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,850
We know that F and D are the mid points

55
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,050
So for example we know that this AE is 12 that was given

56
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,090
We know that ED is half of this 18

57
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:21,800
So ED right over here I'm using a new color ED is going to be 9

58
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,950
ED is going to be 9 so then we could just use

59
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,920
A Pythagorean Theorem to figure out what AD is

60
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,060
AD is the hypotenuse of a of this right triangle AD

61
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,620
So we're looking at triangle AED right now

62
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,150
So we know that let me write this down

63
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:42,670
We know that 12 squared 12 squared plus 9 squared

64
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:48,030
Plus 9 squared is going to be equal to AD squared

65
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,770
Is going to be equal to AD, AD squared

66
00:03:53,780 --> 00:04:02,190
12 squared is 144, 144 plus 81 plus, plus 81

67
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,610
And so this is going to be equaled to AD squared

68
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,680
So this is what this is 225

69
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:14,610
So we have 255 is equal to AD squared is equal to AD squared

70
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,980
And 225 you may or may not recognize is 15 squared

71
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:22,320
So AD, AD is equal to 15

72
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,110
You wan to take the principal root the positive root

73
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,800
Coz we're talking about distances or length of sides

74
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,050
We don't care about the negatives

75
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,830
So AD is equal to 15 so this whole thing right over here

76
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,660
Is going to be equal to 15

77
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,740
And AG is going to be two thirds of AD

78
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,190
AG is equal to two thirds of AD

79
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,830
We've proved that in the previous video

80
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,960
That the centroid is two thirds along the way

81
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,940
Of any of these medians or we could do it for any of the medians

82
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:50,940
So it's equals to two thirds times 15 which is equal to

83
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,890
Which is equal to 10

84
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:58,360
So AG right over here, AG right over here is equal to

85
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,600
Is equal to 10 so we did this second part

86
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:08,760
Now this third part what is the area of F of FGH

87
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,300
So let me let me color it in

88
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:17,980
FGH so if we knew this length if we knew HG

89
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,880
And if we knew FH we could easily figure out what that area is

90
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,770
And there's actually multiple ways of figuring out

91
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,450
Either one of those things

92
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,460
So one way one way that we can thing about finding what HG is

93
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,850
Is to remind ourselves, is to remind ourselves

94
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:42,770
That HG is the altitude of either triangle FGE or triangle AFG

95
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,720
And both of them have a base of 6

96
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,810
Both of them have a base of 6

97
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,810
So this is 6 and this is 6 over here

98
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,660
And they have a height equal to GH

99
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,090
And we know what the area is

100
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,230
We know that the area is already equal to 18

101
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,750
So you can say if we just take this triangle up here

102
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:06,310
So we're talking about the area, area of triangle AFG

103
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,590
So we know it's one half times its base

104
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,990
Which is 6 times its height which is GH times GH

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,740
That's as one half base times height

106
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,560
Is equal to the area of this triangle

107
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:21,640
Which is going to be equal to 18

108
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,790
And so then we just have to tell ourselves

109
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,640
Well this is three times GH is equal to 18

110
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,370
GH if we divide both sides of this by

111
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:35,390
If both sides of this by 3 GH is equals to 6

112
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,120
So that is one way to do it GH is equals to 6

113
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,090
You could also made a similarity argument

114
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,060
And you could say look this is this triangle up here

115
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,550
Is similar to this larger triangle over here

116
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,780
This is this hypotenuse is two thirds of the length

117
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,570
Of this entire thing

118
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,320
So this is going to be two thirds of this 9

119
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,340
So that's another way that you could've gotten 6 there

120
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,430
But either way we got this length

121
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,110
Now we just have to figure out what FH is

122
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:07,590
And we could figure out what FH is if we know what AH is

123
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,540
If we know what AH is because we know A to F is 6

124
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:16,090
So FH is gonna be AH minus AF

125
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,530
So let's figure out what AH is

126
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,830
Well once again we can make a similarity argument

127
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,030
And if you wanna do it formally we see

128
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,750
That both of the larger this this larger triangle

129
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,620
And this smaller triangle both have a 90 degree there

130
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,900
They both have this angle in common

131
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,070
So they have two angles in common

132
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,230
They're definitely similar triangles

133
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,590
And so we know the ratio of H we're gonna do it in orange

134
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:46,010
We know that the ratio of AH to AE which is 12

135
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:54,610
Is equal to the ratio of AG which is 10,10 to the ratio of AD

136
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,000
which we already figured out was 15

137
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,580
So one way to think about it is H is gonna be two thirds of 12

138
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,980
We'll we can just work through the math

139
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,540
Just using the similar triangles

140
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,900
So this right hand side over here is just 2 over 3

141
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:09,770
And so AH multiplying both sides by 12

142
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:14,440
Is equal to two thirds times 12 which is just if you do it

143
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:22,100
It is just H so AH here is 8, AH is 8, AF is 6

144
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:27,320
So FH right over here, FH right over here is gonna be 2

145
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,710
So now we have enough information

146
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,460
to figure out the area of FHG

147
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,060
it's going to be one half let me write over here

148
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,580
it's going to be one half times the base

149
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,850
I'll just use FH as the base here although

150
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,710
Or I could just do it either way I can use well FH as the base

151
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,450
One half times 2 times the height times 6

152
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,250
Which is equal to 6 and we are done

153
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,440
And you could keep going you could figure out the length

154
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,580
Of pretty much all of these segments here

155
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,690
Using some of these techniques
