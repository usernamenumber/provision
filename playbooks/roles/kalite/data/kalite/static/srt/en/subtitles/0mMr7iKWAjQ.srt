1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,330
Problem 17.

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,440
The three dimensional figure above

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,660
has 2 parallel bases and 18 edges.

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,400
I could try to draw it, but, well let me draw that.

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:18,680
So their bases are both hexagons, essentially.

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,420
So I have one base that looks like this.

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,460
I have time so let me draw it properly.

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,060
So the base in front looks something like this.

9
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,370
And then the top base is just a small version,

10
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:47,120
or smaller version, that looks like that. Whoops.

11
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,360
And then they draw-- these are the front edges--

12
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,670
look something like this.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,520
Under the rear edges in a darker color, so you know,

14
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,760
that they're in the back.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,390
Rear edge.

16
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,870
I should have drawn that later,

17
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,790
because that's going to switch back to this.

18
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:23,230
And just paint over this,just so you know,these are in front.

19
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,160
OK, good enough.

20
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:34,040
And they tell us that this point up here is v.

21
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,170
I don't know if that even fit on the video,

22
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,220
but hopefully you can see that point up there.

23
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,460
The three dimensional figure above has two parallel bases,

24
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,660
right,this is one base, that's the other base.

25
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,290
Two parallel bases and 18 edges.

26
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,400
Line segments are to be drawn connecting vertex v

27
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,200
with each of the other 11 vertices.

28
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,290
Each of the 11 vertices in the figure.

29
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,470
How many of these segments

30
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:01,670
will not lie on an edge of the figure?

31
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,320
So an edge of the figure is essentially,

32
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,960
well let's see what they're saying.

33
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,740
Line segments should be drawn connecting vertex v

34
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,730
with each of the other 11 vertices.

35
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,230
So what are the other 11 vertices?

36
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:19,080
Let me draw them. Let me do it in a brighter color.

37
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:30,040
There's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

38
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,500
And they want to know, how many of these segments

39
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,830
will not lie on an edge of the figure.

40
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,790
And actually I think this is a little ambiguous,

41
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,390
because if something is on the face of the figure,on a base.

42
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,780
OK, well they're saying the edges.

43
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,570
They're defining the edges as the lines.

44
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:54,400
So there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,

45
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,160
15, 16, 17, 18 edges.

46
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,960
So it can lie on a face and still count.

47
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:04,000
So how many of these line segments can I draw?

48
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:09,570
Well, if I want to draw a line segment with every point

49
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,710
on this base that is not on an edge.

50
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,630
So this one won't count,

51
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,110
because that is on an edge right there. But I can draw 1.

52
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,710
Oh, I should use a different color,

53
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,330
because this is going to get messy.

54
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:26,640
I can draw 1, 2, 3,

55
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,170
because I'm connected to the other 2 with an edge.

56
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,270
So I have three there.

57
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:37,260
And then how many can I draw a line segment to in the other

58
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,680
that I'm not connected already with an edge?

59
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,120
Well the way to think about it is,

60
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,630
this point is connected to this only here.

61
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:49,410
So we can't use this as one of the line segments.

62
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,940
But then there's 5 other points that it can connect to,

63
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,110
where you're not going through an edge.

64
00:03:54,110 --> 00:04:02,620
So you're going 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So there's 5 more.

65
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,290
3 plus 5 is equal to 8.

66
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,780
And if you wanted to do that even without drawing it

67
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,290
you could have said, well, there's two types of vertices.

68
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,060
There's the ones that are on the top base,

69
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,510
and the ones that are on the bottom base.

70
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,010
On the top base, which was the hexagon,

71
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,270
this was our point right here.

72
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,920
On the top base with the hexagon

73
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,570
there are 5 other vertices, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

74
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,150
But you're connected directly to 2 of them.

75
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,860
So there's only going to be 3

76
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,840
that you can go where you're not already connected to them.

77
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,320
And likewise, on the bottom base,

78
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,110
if this was the bottom base,

79
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,560
vertex v was only directly connected to this one,right?

80
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,240
It had an edge directly to that one.

81
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,060
But the other 5, it didn't have a direct edge to.

82
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,510
So all of those would have been fair game for the problem.

83
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,700
So 5 on the bottom it can connect to, and 3 on the top.

84
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,590
And that's where we got our 8 from.

85
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,400
Next problem.

86
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,720
Alright. This looks like something that I need to draw.

87
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:13,640
That's my x-axis, that's my y-axis.

88
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,950
Let me label them, x, y.

89
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,950
And then they drew a rectangle

90
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,710
that I'll do in a different color.

91
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,180
It looked something like this.

92
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,690
It looks like that. And then how do they label it?

93
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:40,910
They said that this point, c, is the point 1/2 comma c.

94
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:52,590
This point b is the point minus 1/2 comma b.

95
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,090
My microphone is hitting my sweatshirt.

96
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:06,630
And then, let's see, this point here, a, is minus 1/2 a.

97
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:12,090
And then finally, this point here, d, is 1/2 comma d.

98
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,780
And then they drew a graph

99
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,170
in between this whole thing that intersects.

100
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,510
It goes from here, then it starts to flatten out.

101
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,770
It's already looking kind like an x cubed graph,

102
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,550
if you're familiar with what an x cubed graph looks like.

103
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,070
And it goes through that point.

104
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,860
Of course there's a point here.OK.

105
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,940
Note, figure not drawn to scale.

106
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,280
In the figure above, abcd is a rectangle.

107
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,800
Points a and c lie on the graph of y equals px cubed.

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,090
This is y, it looks like,y equals px cubed. Fair enough.

109
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:52,640
Where p is a constant, if the area of abcd is 4,

110
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,170
what is the value of p?

111
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,070
So area is base times height,right?

112
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,850
Can we figure out what the base is? Well sure.

113
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,640
We know that this is 1/2,right?

114
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,000
because the coordinates of these two,

115
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,140
the x coordinate is 1/2.

116
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,370
We know that this is minus 1/2,

117
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,120
because the coordinates of these two are,

118
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,790
the x coordinate's minus 1/2.

119
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,650
So if this length is 1/2, and this length is 1/2,

120
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,410
we know this entire base is 1,right?

121
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:26,200
So if we know the area is 4 of this entire rectangle,

122
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,300
what is this height?

123
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:32,350
This distance is going to have to equal 4.

124
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:36,500
Because 4 times 1 is the area,and 4 times 1 equals 4.

125
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,980
So this has to have height 4.

126
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,800
And this is symmetric, right?

127
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,180
Well, do we know that it's a symmetric?

128
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,530
It's a rectangle, points lie on the graph.

129
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,290
Do you know how we know it's symetric?

130
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,630
Because this is y equals px cubed.

131
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,440
And anything that is px cubed would be symmetric like this.

132
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,280
At 1/2, whatever pointed it is at c,

133
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,800
it would be at a similar point down here.

134
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,390
But it would just be on the other side

135
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,660
and in the third quadrant.

136
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,120
So it's kind of like you're flipping it over the origin.

137
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,180
But anyway, so if we assume that that's symetric,

138
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:19,370
then we know that this distance is 2,this distance is minus 2

139
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:24,230
If this distance is 2,then now we know a point on this graph.

140
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,340
We know that c must be equal to 2, right?

141
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,690
because that's the y coordinate.

142
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,740
Now we have a point on the graph,

143
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,130
so we can substitute it back in.

144
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,320
y equals px cubed.

145
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,540
So let's put 2 for our y,

146
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,480
because we know that that's a point of the graph,right?

147
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,970
We know that point 1/2, 2 is on the graph.

148
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,950
So if we put 2 for y,

149
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,560
we get 2 is equal to p times the x value.

150
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,180
p times 1/2 cubed.

151
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,680
So 2 is equal to p over 8.

152
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:01,300
1/3 cubed, oh sorry I can't do math.

153
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:09,380
I did 1/2 over cubed. 1/3 cubed is 27. 3 squared, 9, 27.

154
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:14,560
So p, multiply both sides by 27, is equal to 54.

155
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,200
And all we did here is we just said, well,

156
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,100
let's figure out what this side is.

157
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,440
We know that this side is 1,

158
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,780
because we can look at the minus 1/2 and the 1/2.

159
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,620
So this side has to be 4.

160
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,030
If this side is 4, and it's symmetric,

161
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,170
it goes just as much as above the x-axis as below,

162
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:31,670
and we know that

163
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,420
because this is an x third,x cubed function.

164
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,260
We know that this side must be 2,

165
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,000
or that the y coordinate is 2.

166
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,280
And then we just substitute into y

167
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,640
is equal to px cubed to solve for p.

168
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,410
I'll see you soon.
