1
00:00:00,967 --> 00:00:08,138
We're told that in 40 years, Imran will be 11 times as old as he is right now.

2
00:00:08,138 --> 00:00:12,774
And then we're asked "How old is he right now?"

3
00:00:12,774 --> 00:00:17,637
Alright, so I encouraged you to try this on your own.

4
00:00:17,637 --> 00:00:23,843
Well let's see if we can set this up as an equation. So let's figure out what our unknown is first.

5
00:00:23,843 --> 00:00:26,722
Well, our unknown is "how old he is right now".

6
00:00:26,722 --> 00:00:43,971
So let, an I'm just arbitrarily using x; we like to use x, it could be anything... But let's say x is how old he is right now.

7
00:00:43,971 --> 00:00:49,102
Now, what do we know about how old he will be in 40 years?

8
00:00:49,102 --> 00:00:54,510
Well, he's going to bee how old he is now plus 40. I'll right that down.

9
00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:08,971
In 40 years, Imran is going to be x plus 40. (Plus this 40 right over here.)

10
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:13,503
But they give us another piece of information! This by itself isn't enough to figure out how old he is right now.

11
00:01:13,503 --> 00:01:24,807
But they tell us, "In 40 years, Imran will be 11 times as old as he is right now."

12
00:01:24,807 --> 00:01:31,833
So that's saying that this quantity, right over here, x plus 40, is going to be 11 times x.

13
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:36,435
In 40 years, he's going to be 11 times as old as he is right now.

14
00:01:36,435 --> 00:01:44,973
So this is going to be times 11. You take x and multiply it times 11, you're going to get how old he is in 40 years.

15
00:01:44,973 --> 00:01:48,552
So let's write that down as an equation.

16
00:01:48,552 --> 00:02:02,632
Take x, multiply it by 11. So, 11 times as old he is right now is how old he is going to be in 40 years.

17
00:02:02,632 --> 00:02:14,959
And we have set up a nice little tidy linear equation now, so we just have to solve for x.

18
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:21,821
So let's get all the x's on the left hand side. We have more x's here than on the other side, so we avoid negative x's.

19
00:02:21,821 --> 00:02:31,048
So if I want to get rid of this x on the right hand, I want to subtract an x, but obviously I can't just do it to the right, otherwise the equality wouldn't be true anymore. I have to do it on the left as well.

20
00:02:31,048 --> 00:02:37,359
And so, I am left with 11. If I have 11 of something, and I take away one of them, I'm left with 10 of that something.

21
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:50,493
So I'm left with 10 times x is equal to 40.

22
00:02:50,493 --> 00:02:53,221
You can do this in your head at this point, but let's just solve it formally.

23
00:02:53,221 --> 00:03:01,828
So if we want a one coefficient here, we'd want to divide by 10. We've got to do that on both sides, and so we are left with, and we can have our drum roll now...

24
00:03:01,828 --> 00:03:13,039
We are left with x is equal to 4 years old. x is equal to 4.

25
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:21,125
So our answer to the question "How old is Imran right now?" He is 4 years old.

26
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:39,630
And let's verify this. If he's four years old right now, if 40 years, he's going to be 44. And, 44 years old is indeed 11 times older than 4 years old.

27
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:43,000
So it all worked out.
