1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,550
   

2
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,790
I was just looking on the
discussion boards on the Khan

3
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:08,150
Academy Facebook page, and Bud
Denny put up this problem,

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:09,335
asking for it to be solved.

5
00:00:09,335 --> 00:00:12,010
And it seems like a problem
of general interest.

6
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:18,510
If the indefinite integral of
2 to the natural log of x

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,200
over, everything over x, dx.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,210
And on the message board, Abhi
Khanna also put up a solution,

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,110
and it is the correct solution,
but I thought this was of

10
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,080
general interest, so I'll
make a quick video on it.

11
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,420
So the first thing when you see
an integral like this, is you

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,635
say, hey, you know, I have this
natural log of x up in

13
00:00:36,635 --> 00:00:40,150
the numerator, and
where do I start?

14
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,150
And the first thing that should
maybe pop out at you, is that

15
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:49,370
this is the same thing as the
integral of one over x times 2

16
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:53,870
to the natural log of x, dx.

17
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,580
And so you have an expression
here, or it's kind of part of

18
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,640
our larger function, and you
have its derivative, right?

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,570
We know that the derivative,
let me write it over here, we

20
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,260
know that the derivative with
respect to x of the natural

21
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,870
log of x is equal to 1/x.

22
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,870
So we have some expression, and
we have its derivative, which

23
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,980
tells us that we can
use substitution.

24
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,250
Sometimes you can do in your
head, but this problem, it's

25
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,690
still not trivial to
do in your head.

26
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,130
So let's make the substitution.

27
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,570
Let's substitute this
right here with a u.

28
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,710
So let's do that.

29
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,890
So if you define u, and it
doesn't have to be u, it's

30
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,670
just, that's the convention,
it's called u-substitution, it

31
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,120
could have been s-substitution
for all we care.

32
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,760
Let's say u is equal to the
natural log of x, and then du

33
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,400
dx, the derivative of u with
respect to x, of course

34
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,220
is equal to 1/x.

35
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,480
Or, just the differential du,
if we just multiply both sides

36
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,600
by dx is equal to 1 over x dx.

37
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,080
So let's make our substitution.

38
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,990
This is our integral.

39
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:00,160
So this will be equal to the
indefinite integral, or the

40
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,480
antiderivative, of 2 to the
now u, so 2 to the u,

41
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,450
times 1 over x dx.

42
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,620
Now what is 1 over x dx?

43
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,440
That's just du.

44
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,860
So this term times that
term is just our du.

45
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,540
Let me do it in a
different color.

46
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,380
1 over x times dx is
just equal to du.

47
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,530
That's just equal to that
thing, right there.

48
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,630
Now, this still doesn't look
like an easy integral, although

49
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,230
it's gotten simplified
a good bit.

50
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:34,000
And to solve, you know,
whenever I see the variable

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,710
that I'm integrating against
in the exponent, you know,

52
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,570
we don't have any easy
exponent rules here.

53
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:42,710
The only thing that I'm
familiar with, where I have my

54
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,910
x or my variable that I'm
integrating against in

55
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,430
my exponent, is the
case of e to the x.

56
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,990
We know that the integral of
e to the x, dx, is equal

57
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,090
to e to the x plus c.

58
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,470
So if I could somehow turn this
into some variation of e to the

59
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,370
x, maybe, or e to the u, maybe
I can make this integral a

60
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,980
little bit more tractable.

61
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,600
So let's see.

62
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:10,890
How can we redefine
this right here?

63
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,380
Well, 2, 2 is equal to what?

64
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:19,970
2 is the same thing as e to
the natural log of 2, right?

65
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,850
The natural log of 2 is
the power you have to

66
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,860
raise e to to get 2.

67
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,620
So if you raise e to
that power, you're, of

68
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,410
course going to get 2.

69
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,030
This is actually the definition
of really, the natural log.

70
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:35,490
You raise e to the natural log
of 2, you're going to get 2.

71
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:38,180
So let's rewrite this, using
this-- I guess we could call

72
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,650
this this rewrite or-- I
don't want to call it

73
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,380
quite a substitution.

74
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,440
It's just a different way
of writing the number 2.

75
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,940
So this will be equal to,
instead of writing the number

76
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,260
2, I could write e to
the natural log of 2.

77
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:58,090
And all of that to the u du.

78
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,120
And now what is this equal to?

79
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,690
Well, if I take something to an
exponent, and then to another

80
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,420
exponent, this is the same
thing as taking my base to the

81
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,250
product of those exponents.

82
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:12,810
So this is equal to, let me
switch colors, this is equal

83
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:21,620
to the integral of e,
to the u, e to the, let

84
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,640
me write it this way.

85
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,660
e to the natural
log of 2 times u.

86
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,770
I'm just multiplying
these two exponents.

87
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,190
I raise something to something,
then raise it again, we know

88
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,170
from our exponent rules,
it's just a product of

89
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,500
those two exponents.

90
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,250
du.

91
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,810
Now, this is just a constant
factor, right here.

92
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,210
This could be, you know, this
could just be some number.

93
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,300
We could use a calculator to
figure out what this is.

94
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,720
We could set this equal to a.

95
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,050
But we know in general that
the integral, this is pretty

96
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,710
straightforward, we've
now put it in this form.

97
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:56,290
The antiderivative of e
to the au, du, is just

98
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,750
1 over a e to the au.

99
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,520
This comes from this definition
up here, and of course plus

100
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,780
c, and the chain rule.

101
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,975
If we take the derivative of
this, we take the derivative

102
00:05:05,975 --> 00:05:08,210
of the inside, which
is just going to be a.

103
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,510
We multiply that times the
one over a, it cancels

104
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,920
out, and we're just
left with e to the au.

105
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,420
So this definitely works out.

106
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,590
So the antiderivative of this
thing right here is going to be

107
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:24,340
equal to 1 over our a, it's
going to be 1 over our constant

108
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:29,640
term, 1 over the natural log of
2 times our whole

109
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,485
expression, e e.

110
00:05:32,485 --> 00:05:35,030
And I'm going to do something.

111
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,170
This is just some number times
u, so I can write it as

112
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,250
u times some number.

113
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,650
And I'm just doing that to put
in a form that might help us

114
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,050
simplify it a little bit.

115
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,270
So it's e to the u times the
natural log of 2, right?

116
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,780
All I did, is I
swapped this order.

117
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,640
I could have written this
as e to the natural

118
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,140
log of 2 times u.

119
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,590
If this an a, a times u is
the same thing as u times a.

120
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,530
Plus c.

121
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,110
So this is our answer, but we
have to kind of reverse

122
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,340
substitute before we can feel
satisfied that we've taken

123
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,300
the antiderivative
with respect to x.

124
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,680
But before I do that, let's
see if I can simplify

125
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,880
this a little bit.

126
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,550
What is, if I have, just from
our natural log properties,

127
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,450
or logarithms, a times
the natural log of b.

128
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,140
We know this is the same
thing as the natural

129
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,480
log of b to the a.

130
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,900
Let me draw a line here.

131
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,220
Right?

132
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,130
That this becomes the exponent
on whatever we're taking

133
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,620
the natural log of.

134
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:31,950
So u, let me write this here,
u times the natural log of

135
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:35,470
2, is the same thing as the
natural log of 2 to the u.

136
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,440
So we can rewrite our
antiderivative as being equal

137
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,020
to 1 over the natural log of 2,
that's just that part here,

138
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,450
times e to the, this can be
rewritten based on this

139
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:51,740
logarithm property, as the
natural log of 2 to the u, and

140
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,750
of course we still have
our plus c there.

141
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:00,500
Now, what is e raised to the
natural log of 2 to the u?

142
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,260
The natural log of 2 to the u
is the power that you have to

143
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,960
raise e to to get to
2 to the u, right?

144
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,040
By definition!

145
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,540
So if we raise e to that power,
what are we going to get?

146
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,040
We're going to get 2 to the u.

147
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,080
So this is going to be equal to
1 over the natural log of 2.

148
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,350
This simplifies to
just 2 to the u.

149
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,220
I drew it up here.

150
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,970
The natural log a I could just
write in general terms, let

151
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,520
me do it up here, and maybe
I'm beating a dead horse.

152
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,570
But I can in general write any
number a as being equal to

153
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,890
e to the natural log of a.

154
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:36,230
This is the exponent you have
to raise e to to get a.

155
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,880
If you raise e to that,
you're going to get a.

156
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,420
So e to the natural log of 2 to
the u, that's just 2 to the u.

157
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,900
And then I have my
plus c, of course.

158
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,450
And now we can
reverse substitute.

159
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,830
What did we set u equal to?

160
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:53,060
We defined u, up here, as equal
to the natural log of x.

161
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,990
So let's just reverse
substitute right here.

162
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:00,570
And so the answer to our
original equation, your answer

163
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:03,260
to, let me write it here,
because it's satisfying when

164
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:08,950
you see it, to this kind of
fairly convoluted-looking

165
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:14,730
antiderivative problem, 2 to
the natural log of x over x dx,

166
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,815
we now find is equal to, we
just replaced u with natural

167
00:08:17,815 --> 00:08:21,750
log of x, because that was our
substitution, and 1 over the

168
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:29,410
natural log of 2 times 2 to the
natural log of x plus c.

169
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,100
And we're done.

170
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,970
This isn't in the denominator,
the way I wrote it might

171
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,410
look a little ambiguous.

172
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,110
And we're done!

173
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,340
And that was a pretty neat
problem, and so thanks

174
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,900
to Bud for posting that.
