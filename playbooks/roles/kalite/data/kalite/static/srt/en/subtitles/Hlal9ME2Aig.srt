00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,457
In this video I want to familiarize ourselves

2
00:00:03,457 --> 00:00:04,768
with negative numbers.

3
00:00:04,768 --> 00:00:07,564
And also learn a bit of how do we add and subtract them.

4
00:00:07,564 --> 00:00:09,326
And when you first encounter them,

5
00:00:09,326 --> 00:00:11,612
they look like this deep and mysterious thing.

6
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:14,769
When we first count things, we're counting positive numbers.

7
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:17,346
What does a negative number even mean?

8
00:00:17,346 --> 00:00:20,835
But when we think about it, you probably have encountered

9
00:00:20,835 --> 00:00:22,905
negative numbers in your everyday life.

10
00:00:22,905 --> 00:00:25,195
And let me just give you a few examples.

11
00:00:25,195 --> 00:00:26,412
So before I give the example, the general idea is

12
00:00:26,412 --> 00:00:30,674
a negative number is any number less than zero.

13
00:00:30,674 --> 00:00:34,839
Less than zero.

14
00:00:34,839 --> 00:00:37,191
And if that sounds strange and abstract to you,

15
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:39,851
let's just think about it in a couple of different contexts.

16
00:00:39,851 --> 00:00:45,251
If I have... if we're measuring the temperature ...

17
00:00:45,251 --> 00:00:47,114
(and it can be in Celsius or Farenheit,

18
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:49,881
but let's just say we're measuring it in Celsius),

19
00:00:49,881 --> 00:00:51,878
and so let me draw a little scale

20
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:53,707
that we can measure the temperature on.

21
00:00:53,707 --> 00:00:57,099
So let's say that this is 0° Celsius,

22
00:00:57,099 --> 00:01:02,909
that is 1° Celsius, 2° Celsius, 3° Celsius.

23
00:01:02,924 --> 00:01:05,817
Now, let's say it's a pretty chilly day

24
00:01:05,817 --> 00:01:10,296
and it's currently 3° Celsius.

25
00:01:10,296 --> 00:01:12,004
And someone who predicts the future

26
00:01:12,004 --> 00:01:16,976
tells you that it is going to get 4° colder the next day.

27
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:21,502
So how cold will it be? How can you represent that coldness?

28
00:01:21,502 --> 00:01:25,126
Well, if it only got 1° colder it would be at 2°,

29
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,874
but we know we have to go 4° colder.

30
00:01:26,874 --> 00:01:32,068
If we got 2° colder, we would be at 1°.

31
00:01:32,068 --> 00:01:35,311
If we got 3° colder, we would be at 0°.

32
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:38,453
But 3° isn't enough, we have to get 4° colder,

33
00:01:38,453 --> 00:01:43,965
so we actually have to go one more below zero.

34
00:01:43,965 --> 00:01:50,416
And that 1 below 0 we call that "negative 1".

35
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:52,907
And so you can kind of see that the number line,

36
00:01:52,907 --> 00:01:57,029
as you go to the right of zero increases in positive values,

37
00:01:57,029 --> 00:02:04,207
as you go to the left of zero you're going to have -1, -2, -3.

38
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:07,301
And you're going to have-depending on how you think about it-

39
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:09,948
you're going to have larger negative numbers.

40
00:02:09,948 --> 00:02:15,372
But I want to make it very clear: -3 is LESS than -1.

41
00:02:15,372 --> 00:02:19,488
There is less heat in the air at -3° than at -1°.

42
00:02:19,488 --> 00:02:23,329
It is colder---there is less temperature there.

43
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:39,824
So let me just make it very clear: -100 is much smaller than -1.

44
00:02:39,824 --> 00:02:41,913
You might look at 100 and you might look at 1 and

45
00:02:41,913 --> 00:02:45,094
your gut reaction might be that 100 is much larger than 1.

46
00:02:45,094 --> 00:02:46,272
But when you think about it,

47
00:02:46,272 --> 00:02:48,849
-100 means there is a lack of something.

48
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:52,304
-100: if it's -100° there is a lack of heat,

49
00:02:52,304 --> 00:02:55,737
so there is much less heat here than if we had -1°.

50
00:02:55,737 --> 00:02:57,493
Let me give you another example.

51
00:02:57,493 --> 00:03:11,264
Let's say in my bank account today I have $10.

52
00:03:11,264 --> 00:03:13,114
Now, let's say I go out there

53
00:03:13,114 --> 00:03:14,949
(because I feel good about my $10),

54
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:21,426
and let's say I go and spend $30.

55
00:03:21,426 --> 00:03:22,735
And, for the sake of argument

56
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:24,275
let's say I have a very flexible bank,

57
00:03:24,275 --> 00:03:26,861
one that lets me spend more money than I have

58
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:28,354
(and these actually exist!).

59
00:03:28,354 --> 00:03:30,422
So I spend $30.

60
00:03:30,422 --> 00:03:32,907
So what's my bank account going to look like?

61
00:03:32,907 --> 00:03:35,564
So let me draw a number line here.

62
00:03:35,564 --> 00:03:37,839
And you may already have an intuitive response:

63
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:43,284
I will owe the bank some money.

64
00:03:43,284 --> 00:03:47,130
Tomorrow, what is my bank account?

65
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:51,642
You might immediately say, "if I have $10 and I spend $30,

66
00:03:51,642 --> 00:03:54,219
there's $20 that had to come from some place."

67
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:56,489
And that $20 is coming from the bank.

68
00:03:56,489 --> 00:03:59,119
So I'm going to owe the bank $20.

69
00:03:59,119 --> 00:04:00,789
And so, in my bank account,

70
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:07,199
to show how much I have, I could say $10 - $30 is -$20.

71
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:13,345
So in my bank account tomorrow, I'm going to have -$20.

72
00:04:13,345 --> 00:04:18,075
So, if I say I have -$20, that means that I owe the bank.

73
00:04:18,075 --> 00:04:19,357
---I don't even have it.

74
00:04:19,357 --> 00:04:20,946
Not only do I have nothing, I owe something.

75
00:04:20,946 --> 00:04:22,535
It's going in reverse.

76
00:04:22,535 --> 00:04:25,589
Here, I have something to spend...

77
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:29,228
if my $10 in my bank account means the bank owes me $10.

78
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:31,817
I have $10 that I can use to go spend.

79
00:04:31,817 --> 00:04:33,390
Now, all of a sudden I owe the bank.

80
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,963
I've gone the other direction.

81
00:04:34,963 --> 00:04:36,778
If we use a number line here

82
00:04:36,778 --> 00:04:38,593
it should hopefully make more sense.

83
00:04:38,593 --> 00:04:39,832
So that is 0.

84
00:04:39,832 --> 00:04:43,347
I'm starting off with $10,

85
00:04:43,347 --> 00:04:47,417
and spending $30 means I'm moving 30 spaces to the left.

86
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:49,848
So if I move 10 spaces to the left---

87
00:04:49,848 --> 00:04:52,804
if I only spend $10 I'll be back at $0.

88
00:04:52,804 --> 00:04:56,829
If I spend another $10, I'll be at -$10.

89
00:04:56,829 --> 00:05:02,208
If I spend another $10 after that, I will be at -$20.

90
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,483
So, each of these distances, I spent $10 I'd be at $0.

91
00:05:04,483 --> 00:05:06,759
Another $10 I'd be at -$10.

92
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:09,754
Another $10 I would be at -$20.

93
00:05:09,754 --> 00:05:13,144
So this whole distance here is how much I spent.

94
00:05:13,144 --> 00:05:17,270
I spent $30.

95
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,398
So the general idea when you spend or if you subtract,

96
00:05:20,398 --> 00:05:23,327
or getting colder, you would move to the left.

97
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,803
The numbers would get smaller.

98
00:05:24,803 --> 00:05:27,229
And we now know they can get even smaller than 0.

99
00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:31,604
They can go to -1, -2---they can even go to -1.5, -1.6.

100
00:05:31,604 --> 00:05:34,948
The more and more negative, the more you lose.

101
00:05:34,948 --> 00:05:37,268
If you're adding, if I go and get my paycheck,

102
00:05:37,268 --> 00:05:41,389
I will move to the right of the number line.

103
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:43,058
Now, with that out of the way,

104
00:05:43,058 --> 00:05:46,082
let's just do a couple more pure math problems.

105
00:05:46,082 --> 00:05:52,317
What it means, if we were to say...

106
00:05:52,317 --> 00:05:56,474
Let's say, 3 - 4.

107
00:05:56,474 --> 00:05:57,710
So once again,

108
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,193
this is exactly the situation we did with the temperature.

109
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,944
We're starting with 3 and we're subtracting 4,

110
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,695
so we're going to move 4 to the left.

111
00:06:03,695 --> 00:06:05,854
We go 1, 2, 3, 4.

112
00:06:05,854 --> 00:06:10,417
That gets us to -1.

113
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:11,767
And when you're starting to do this

114
00:06:11,767 --> 00:06:13,934
you really understand what a negative number means.

115
00:06:13,934 --> 00:06:15,843
I really encourage you to visualize the number line

116
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:17,752
and really move along it depending on

117
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,961
whether you're adding or subtracting.

118
00:06:19,961 --> 00:06:21,236
Let's do a couple more.

119
00:06:21,236 --> 00:06:27,848
Let's say I have 2 - 8

120
00:06:27,848 --> 00:06:30,552
(and we'll think about more ways to do this in future videos),

121
00:06:30,552 --> 00:06:33,612
but once again, you just want to do the number line.

122
00:06:33,612 --> 00:06:35,083
You have a 0 here.

123
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:38,729
We're at (let me draw the spacing a little bit).

124
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:42,032
We have 0 here...we're at 1... 2.

125
00:06:42,032 --> 00:06:43,891
If we're subtracting 8,

126
00:06:43,891 --> 00:06:47,043
that means we're going to move 8 to the left.

127
00:06:47,043 --> 00:06:50,993
So we're going to go 1 to the left, 2 to the left.

128
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:53,036
So, we've gone 2 to the left to get to 0.

129
00:06:53,036 --> 00:06:55,080
We have to move how many more to the left?

130
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,961
We've already moved 2 to the left,

131
00:06:56,961 --> 00:06:59,010
to get to 8, we have to move 6 more to the left.

132
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:07,396
So we're going to have to move 1-2-3-4-5-6 more to the left.

133
00:07:07,396 --> 00:07:09,106
Well, where is that going to put us?

134
00:07:09,106 --> 00:07:10,074
Well, we were at 0.

135
00:07:10,074 --> 00:07:18,706
This is -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6.

136
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:24,310
So, 2 - 8 is -6.

137
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,540
2-2 would be 0.

138
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,633
When you're subtracting 8 you're subtracting another 6.

139
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:33,366
So we go to -6, we go 6 below 0.

140
00:07:33,366 --> 00:07:34,994
Let me do one more example.

141
00:07:34,994 --> 00:07:36,562
(and this will be a little less conventional

142
00:07:36,562 --> 00:07:38,807
but hopefully it will make sense).

143
00:07:38,807 --> 00:07:43,976
Let us take... (and I'll do this in a new color)...

144
00:07:43,976 --> 00:07:47,870
Let me take -4 - 2.

145
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,439
So we're starting at a negative number

146
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:51,009
and then we're subtracting from that.

147
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:56,808
Now, if this seems confusing just remember the number line!

148
00:07:56,838 --> 00:07:59,680
So this is 0 right here.

149
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:07,015
This is -1, -2, -3, -4. So that's where we're starting.

150
00:08:07,015 --> 00:08:09,279
Now we're going to subtract 2 from -4,

151
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:11,543
so we're going to move 2 to the left.

152
00:08:11,543 --> 00:08:15,387
So if we subtract 1 we'll be at -5.

153
00:08:15,387 --> 00:08:21,723
If we subtract another 1 we are going to be at -6.

154
00:08:21,723 --> 00:08:23,332
So this is -6.

155
00:08:23,332 --> 00:08:24,748
Let's do another interesting thing.

156
00:08:24,748 --> 00:08:30,266
Let's start at -3 ... let's say we have -3.

157
00:08:30,266 --> 00:08:34,261
Instead of subtracting something from that, let's add 2.

158
00:08:34,261 --> 00:08:36,562
So where would this put us on the number line?

159
00:08:36,562 --> 00:08:39,389
So we're starting at -3 and we're adding 2.

160
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:42,217
So we're going to move to the right.

161
00:08:42,217 --> 00:08:44,750
So you add 1, you become -2

162
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,760
But if you add another 1 (which we have to do),

163
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,969
you become -1.

164
00:08:47,969 --> 00:08:49,394
You move 2 to the right.

165
00:08:49,394 --> 00:08:54,395
So, -3 + 2 is -1.

166
00:08:54,395 --> 00:08:55,957
And you can see for yourself,

167
00:08:55,957 --> 00:08:59,934
this all fits our traditional notion of adding and subtracting.

168
00:08:59,934 --> 00:09:05,399
If we start at -1 and we subtract 2, we should get -3.

169
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,506
Kind of reverses this thing up here.

170
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:09,637
-3 +2 gets us there.

171
00:09:09,637 --> 00:09:11,229
And if we start there and we subtract 2

172
00:09:11,229 --> 00:09:12,514
we should get back to -3.

173
00:09:12,514 --> 00:09:13,429
And we see that happens.

174
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:17,634
If you start at -1, right over here,

175
00:09:17,634 --> 00:09:20,469
and you subtract 2, you move 2 to the left.

176
00:09:20,469 --> 00:09:22,106
You get back to -3.

177
00:09:22,106 --> 00:09:25,322
So hopefully this starts to give you a sense of what it means

178
00:09:25,322 --> 00:09:29,028
to deal with or add and subtract negative numbers.

179
00:09:29,028 --> 00:09:31,337
But we are going to give a lot more examples in the next video.

180
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:32,475
And we're actually going to see what it means

181
00:09:32,475 --> 00:09:35,337
to subtract a negative number.
