1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,400
   

2
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,040
In the last couple of videos we
were trying to figure out

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,540
whether there was a meaningful
difference between the

4
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,480
proportion of men likely to vote
for a candidate and the

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,790
proportion of women.

6
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,800
And in the last video, we
actually estimated that using

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,340
a 95% confidence interval for
the difference in the

8
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,780
proportion of men and the
difference in the

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,850
proportion of women.

10
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,950
What I want to do in this
video is just to ask the

11
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:24,990
question more directly.

12
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,760
Or just do a straight up
hypothesis test to see is

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,050
there a difference?

14
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,585
So we're going to make
our null hypothesis.

15
00:00:30,585 --> 00:00:37,680
   

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,160
No difference.

17
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:45,330
No difference between how the
men and the women will vote.

18
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,600
Or another way of viewing, it
that the proportion of men who

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,590
will vote for the candidate is
going to be the same as the

20
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,060
proportion of women
who are going to

21
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:54,780
vote for the candidate.

22
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,660
Or another way you could say
that, is that the difference

23
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,510
P1 minus P2, the true proportion
of men voting for

24
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,830
the candidate minus the true
population proportion of women

25
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,540
voting for the candidate
is going to be 0.

26
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,170
That's are our null
hypothesis.

27
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,550
Our alternative hypothesis is
that there is a difference.

28
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:26,600
   

29
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,200
Or that P1 does not equal P2.

30
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,575
Or that P1 minus P2, the
proportion of men voting minus

31
00:01:34,575 --> 00:01:37,300
the proportion of women voting,
the true population

32
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,930
proportions, do not equal 0.

33
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,940
And we're going to do the
hypothesis test with a

34
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:49,030
significance level of 5%.

35
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,870
And all that means, and we've
done this multiple times, is

36
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,415
we're going to assume
the null hypothesis.

37
00:01:54,415 --> 00:02:00,760
   

38
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,930
And then assuming the null
hypothesis is true, we're

39
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:15,950
going to figure out the
probability of getting the

40
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,810
actual difference of our
sample proportions.

41
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,010
So we're going to figure out
the probability of actually

42
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:26,040
getting our actual difference
between our male sample

43
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,790
proportion and our female
sample proportion.

44
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:35,540
Given the assumption that our
null hypothesis is correct.

45
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:41,610
And if this probability is
less than 5%, if this

46
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,610
probability is less than
our significance level.

47
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,870
So if the odds of getting these
two samples and the

48
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,570
difference between those two
samples, is less than 5%

49
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,530
percent, then we're going to
reject the null hypothesis.

50
00:02:53,530 --> 00:03:01,090
   

51
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,390
So how are we going
to do this?

52
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:07,380
So if we assume the null
hypothesis, what does the

53
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,550
sampling distribution of this
statistic start to look like?

54
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:16,640
Well, if we assume that the true
population proportions

55
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,260
are actually the same between
men and women.

56
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:24,020
If P1 and P2 are actually the
same, then this right here is

57
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,270
going to be 0.

58
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,790
   

59
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:34,310
So what we can do is, we can
figure out that we got when we

60
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,520
took the proportion of men and
we subtracted from that the

61
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,660
proportion of women-- So this
is our sample proportion of

62
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:45,440
men who, at least in our
poll, said they would

63
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,510
vote for the candidate.

64
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,750
This is a proportion of women
who said they would vote for

65
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,590
the candidate.

66
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,740
The difference between
the two was 0.051.

67
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,760
So we can do is figure out
what's the probability?

68
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,490
Assuming that the true
proportions are equal, that

69
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,470
the mean of the sampling
distribution of this statistic

70
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:10,890
is actually 0, what's the
probability that we get a

71
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,550
difference of 0.051?

72
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:18,519
So what's the likelihood that we
get something that extreme?

73
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,690
And what we're going to do
here is just figure out a

74
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,690
Z-score for this.

75
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,440
Essentially figure out how many
standard deviations away

76
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,340
from the mean this is.

77
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,820
That would be our Z-score.

78
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,450
And then figure out, is the
likelihood of getting a

79
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:35,410
standard deviation, or that
extreme of a result, or that

80
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,920
many standard deviations away
from the mean, is that

81
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,420
likelihood more or
less than 5%?

82
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,670
If it is less than 5%, we're
going to reject the null

83
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,780
hypothesis.

84
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,530
So let's first of all figure
out our Z-score.

85
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:54,040
So we're assuming the null
hypothesis, P1 is equal to P2.

86
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,120
Our Z-score, the number of
standard deviations that our

87
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,470
actual result is away from the
mean, the actual difference

88
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:04,710
that we sampled in the last few
videos between the men and

89
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:08,540
the women was 0.051.

90
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,890
And from that we're going
to subtract the

91
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,460
assumed that mean.

92
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,280
Remember, we're assuming that
these two things are equal.

93
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,580
So the mean of this sampling
distribution right here is 0.

94
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:26,460
So we're just going
to subtract 0.

95
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:34,160
And then we have to divide this
by the standard deviation

96
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:42,410
of the sampling distribution of
the statistic right here.

97
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:46,600
   

98
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,380
P1 minus P2.

99
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,940
Now, what's the standard
deviation of the distribution

100
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,260
going to be?

101
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,710
In the last video, we figured
out that we could represent it

102
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,350
by this formula over here.

103
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,980
But with our null hypothesis,
we're assuming that P1 and P2

104
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,340
are the same value.

105
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,590
Let me rewrite it.

106
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:10,840
   

107
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,890
So in our last video, and I
don't want to confuse the

108
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,860
issue, because in the last
video, I made this

109
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,090
approximation over here.

110
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,710
So let me write the clean
version down here.

111
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:27,390
We know that the standard
deviation of our sampling

112
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:32,450
distribution of this statistic
of the sample mean of P1 minus

113
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:38,150
the sample proportion, or sample
mean of P2, is equal to

114
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:48,510
the square root of P1 times 1
minus P1 over 1,000, plus P2

115
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,530
times 1 minus P2 over 1,000.

116
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,280
We've seen this in
several videos.

117
00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:00,460
But in the null hypothesis,
we are assuming that

118
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,280
P1 is equal to P2.

119
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,550
That's what we do.

120
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,760
We assume the null hypothesis
and see the probability of

121
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,360
this occuring.

122
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,980
So if P1 is equal to P2, we
can just represent them as

123
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,375
just some true population
proportion.

124
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:17,090
   

125
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:21,070
So we could write it like this,
the square root of-- we

126
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:31,180
can literally just factor out
1/1,000 times P times 1 minus

127
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,790
P, plus P times 1 minus P.

128
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,140
Because they're going to
be the same value.

129
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,530
That's what we're assuming
in the null hypothesis.

130
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,870
And so this is just two
of these over here.

131
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:47,120
So this is going to be equal to
2P times 1 minus P, all of

132
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,510
that over 1,000.

133
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:54,470
And we're going to take the
square root of that.

134
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:59,030
Now this is the standard
deviation, once again, of the

135
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,830
distribution of this statistic
right over.

136
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:05,860
The sample proportion for
the men minus the sample

137
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,470
proportion of the women.

138
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,450
Now, we still don't know this.

139
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,525
We still don't know the
true proportion.

140
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:18,950
   

141
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,690
But we can estimate it
using our samples.

142
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:25,300
And since we're assuming that
the men and women, that

143
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,050
there's no difference between
them, we can actually view it

144
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:32,010
as a sample size of 2,000
to figure out that true

145
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:32,940
proportion.

146
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:39,309
So we can actually substitute
this with a sample proportion.

147
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:42,010
And we can pretend like our
survey of the men and women is

148
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,789
just one huge survey.

149
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:48,550
So you have your sample
proportion, we're surveying a

150
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,130
total of 2,000 people.

151
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,600
1,000 men and 1,000 women.

152
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,050
But we're assuming that
they're no different.

153
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,180
That's what our null hypothesis
is all about,

154
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,750
assuming there's no difference
between men and women.

155
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:03,780
And we got 642 yeses
amongst the men and

156
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,620
591 amongst the women.

157
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:18,960
So we got a total
of 642 plus 591.

158
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,790
If you viewed it as just one
huge sample of 2,000 people,

159
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:40,610
we got 642 plus 591 is equal
to 1,233 divided by 2,000

160
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:49,880
gives us 0.6165.

161
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:56,050
And this is our best estimate of
this consistent population

162
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,230
proportion that is true
of both men and women.

163
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,920
Because we are assuming that
they are no different.

164
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,680
So we can substitute this value
in for P to estimate the

165
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,860
standard deviation of the
sampling distribution of this

166
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,700
statistic right over here.

167
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:15,940
Assuming that the proportion of
men and women are the same.

168
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,860
Or the proportion that will
vote for the candidate.

169
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,200
So let's do that.

170
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:27,140
It's going to be the square root
of 2 times P, which is

171
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:37,080
0.6165, times 1 minus
P, 1 minus

172
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:46,730
0.6165, divided by 1,000.

173
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,660
Let make sure I got it.

174
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,510
2 times 0.6165, that's
that P right there.

175
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,430
Times 1 minus P divided
by 1,000.

176
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,530
We're taking the square root
of the whole thing.

177
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,400
   

178
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:06,740
And so we get a standard
deviation of 0.0217.

179
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,920
Let me write this over here.

180
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:15,740
So this thing right over
here is 0.0217.

181
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,040
So if we want to figure out
our Z-score, if we want to

182
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:23,860
figure out how many standard
deviations the actual sample

183
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,620
that we got of this statistic
right over here.

184
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,930
If we want to figure out how
many standard deviations that

185
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:33,690
is away from our assumed mean,
that there's no difference,

186
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:38,080
then we just divide 0.051
by this standard

187
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,330
deviation right over here.

188
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,630
So let's do that.

189
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:47,130
So we have 0.051 divided by this
standard deviation, and

190
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,270
that was our answer up here.

191
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,150
So I'll just do divided
by our answer.

192
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:56,900
And we are 2.35 standard
deviations away.

193
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:03,690
So our Z-score is
equal to 2.35.

194
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,540
So just to review what we're
doing, we're assuming the null

195
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,610
hypothesis, there's
no difference.

196
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:13,530
If we assume there's no
difference, then the sampling

197
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:16,740
distribution of this statistic
right here is going to

198
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,250
have a mean of 0.

199
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:25,460
And the result that we actually
got for the statistic

200
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:31,350
has a Z-score of 2.34.

201
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:41,630
Or this is equivalent to being
2.34 standard deviations away

202
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,180
from this mean of 0.

203
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,960
So, in order to reject the null
hypothesis, that has to

204
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,060
be less probable than our
significance level.

205
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:58,100
And to see that, let's see what
the minimum Z-score we

206
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,280
need to reject our hypothesis.

207
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,610
So let's think about
that a second.

208
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:06,430
I'll go back to my Z-table.

209
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:14,770
We want to have a significance
level of 5%.

210
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:19,430
Which means the entire area of
our rejection, in which we

211
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,850
would reject the null
hypothesis is 5%.

212
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:27,770
This is a two tail test. An
extreme event on either far

213
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:30,750
above the mean or far below
the mean will allow us to

214
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,280
reject the hypothesis.

215
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,630
So we care about the
area over here.

216
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:37,870
And over here we would put
2.5% and over here

217
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,320
we would have 2.5%.

218
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,150
   

219
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,290
And we would have 95%
in the middle.

220
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,300
So we need to find
this critical

221
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:53,020
Z-score, critical Z-value.

222
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:56,580
And if our Z-value is greater
than the positive version of

223
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:03,080
this critical Z-value, then the
odds of getting something

224
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,750
so extreme is less than 5%,
assuming the null hypothesis

225
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,840
is correct.

226
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,100
So then we can reject
the null hypothesis.

227
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,270
So let's see what this
critical Z-value is.

228
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,030
So essentially we want a Z-value
where the entire

229
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,990
percentage below it is
going to be 97.5%.

230
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,920
Because then you're going
to have 2.5% over here.

231
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,510
And we've actually already
figured that out.

232
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:27,280
This whole cumulative has to be
97.5%, we did that in the

233
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,470
last video.

234
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,720
If you look for that, you
get 0.975 right there.

235
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,690
It's a Z-score of 1.96.

236
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:36,980
I even wrote it over there.

237
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,400
So this critical Z-value
is 1.96.

238
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:55,360
So what that tells you is
there is a 5% chance of

239
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:12,700
sampling a Z-statistic greater
than 1.96, assuming the null

240
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,790
hypothesis is correct.

241
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:22,910
Now, we just sampled a
Z-statistic of 2.34 assuming

242
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,800
the null hypothesis correct.

243
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,510
So the probability of sampling
this, given the null

244
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:34,720
hypothesis is correct, is going
to be less than 5%.

245
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,780
It is more extreme than this
critical view Z-value.

246
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,480
It's going to be out
here some place.

247
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,580
And because of that, we can
reject the null hypothesis.

248
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,680
I'm sorry for jumping around
so much in this video.

249
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,610
I had already written a lot.

250
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,700
So I just kind of leveraged what
I had already written.

251
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,800
But since the odds of getting
that, assuming the null

252
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,790
hypothesis, are less than 5%,
and that was our significance

253
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:59,100
level, we can reject the null
hypothesis and say that there

254
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,930
is a difference.

255
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,850
We don't know 100% sure
that there is.

256
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:06,620
But statistically, we are in
favor of the idea that there

257
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,360
is a difference between the
proportion of men and the

258
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,800
proportion of women
who are going to

259
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,590
vote for the candidate.

260
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:12,867
