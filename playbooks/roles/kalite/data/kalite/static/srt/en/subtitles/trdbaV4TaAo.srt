1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,105
I don't think it's any secret that if you'll have to do with

3
00:00:03,105 --> 00:00:06,215
any kind of science, you're going to be
dealing with a lot of numbers.

4
00:00:06,215 --> 00:00:08,943
It doesn't matter whether you
do biology or chemistry or

5
00:00:08,943 --> 00:00:10,630
physics, numbers are involved.

6
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:14,580
And in many cases the
numbers are very large.

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,660
There are very, very
large numbers.

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:25,030
Very large numbers, or they're
very small, very small

9
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,850
numbers, very small numbers.

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,910
You could imagine some
very large number.

11
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,030
If I were to ask you, how
many atoms are there

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:33,910
in the human body?

13
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,330
Or how many cells are
in the human body?

14
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,120
Or the mass of the
earth in kilograms?

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,390
Those are very large numbers.

16
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,980
If I were to ask you, if I were
to ask you the mass of an

17
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,180
electron, that would be a
very, very small number.

18
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,390
So any kind of science, you're
going to be dealing with these.

19
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,580
Just as an example, let me show
you one of the most common

20
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,930
numbers you're going to see,
especially chemistry, it's

21
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,350
called Avogadro's number.

22
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,800
Avogadro's number.

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,730
And if I were to write it in
just the standard way of

24
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,673
writing a number, it would
literally be written as, do

25
00:01:06,673 --> 00:01:11,660
it in a new color, it would
be 6 0 2 2 and then

26
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,840
another twenty 0's.

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,520
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

28
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,700
eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,

29
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,290
seventeen, eighteen,
nineteen, twenty.

30
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,570
And even if I were to throw
some commas in here, it's not

31
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,170
going to really help the
situation to make

32
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,030
it more readable.

33
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,160
Let me throw some
commas in here.

34
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,460
It's still a huge number, and I
don't even, you know, if I had

35
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,620
to write this on a piece of
paper, or if I were to publish

36
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,366
some paper on, you know, using
Avogadro's number, it would

37
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:40,500
take me forever to write this.

38
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,680
And even more, it's hard
to tell if I forgot to

39
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,370
write a 0, or if I maybe
wrote too many 0's.

40
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,780
So there's a problem here.

41
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,270
Is there a better
way to write this?

42
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:56,190
So is there a better way to
write this, than to write

43
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,430
it all out like this.

44
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,160
To write literally the 6
followed by the 23 digits,

45
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,170
or the 6 0 2 2 followed
by the twenty 0's there.

46
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,610
And to answer that question,
and in case you're curious,

47
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,740
Avogadro's number, if you had
twelve grams of carbon,

48
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,920
especially twelve grams of
carbon-12, this is how many

49
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,220
atoms you would have in that.

50
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,140
And so you know, twelve grams
is like 1/50th of a pound.

51
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,920
So that just gives you an idea
of how many atoms are laying

52
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,290
around at any point in time.

53
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,270
This is a huge number.

54
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,980
The point here isn't to
teach you some chemistry.

55
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,410
The point here is to talk about
an easier way to write this.

56
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,280
And the easier way to
write this we call

57
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,940
scientific notation.

58
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:40,760
Scientific notation.

59
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,250
And take my word for it, even
though it might be a little

60
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,840
unnatural for you, it really is
an easier way to write things

61
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,360
like, things like that.

62
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,290
So let me, before I show you
how to do it, let me show

63
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:55,650
you the underlying theory
behind scientific notation.

64
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,490
If I were to tell you, what,
what is 10 to the 0 power?

65
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,010
We know that's equal to 1.

66
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,800
What is 10 to the 1 power?

67
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,330
Well that's equal to 10.

68
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,090
What's 10 squared?

69
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,060
That's 10 times 10, that's 100.

70
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,070
What is 10 to the third?

71
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,810
10 to the third is 10
times 10 times 10 which

72
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,900
is equal to 1,000.

73
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,810
I think you see a
general pattern here.

74
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,700
10 to the 0 has no 0's.

75
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,850
No 0's in it, right?

76
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,770
10 to the 1 has 1 0.

77
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:32,310
10 to the second power, I was
going to say the "twoth" power.

78
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,920
10 to the second power has
two 2 0's Finally, 10 to

79
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,450
the third has three 0's.

80
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,090
Don't want to beat a dead
horse here, but I think

81
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:41,690
you get the idea.

82
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,310
Three 0's.

83
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:47,920
If I were to do, if I were to
do 10 to the 100th power, 10

84
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,510
to the 100th power, what
would that look like?

85
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,600
I don't feel like writing it
all out here, but it would be

86
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,900
1 followed by, you could
guess it, 100 0's.

87
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,150
So it would just be
a bunch of 0's.

88
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,120
And if we were to count up
all of those 0's, you would

89
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,110
have 100 0's right there.

90
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,270
And actually, this might be
interesting just as an aside.

91
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,780
You may or may not know what
this number is called.

92
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:16,430
This is called a googol.

93
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,510
A googol.

94
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,250
In the early nineties if
someone said, hey that's, you

95
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,780
know, that's a googol, you
wouldn't have thought of a

96
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,170
search engine, you would
have thought of the number

97
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,550
10 to the 100th power.

98
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,510
Which is a huge number.

99
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:33,770
If you actually, it's more than
the number of atoms, or the

100
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,540
estimated number of atoms
in the known universe.

101
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,660
In the known universe.

102
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,410
I mean, you know, raises
the question of what else

103
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,220
is it that's out there?

104
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,450
But you know, I was reading up
on this not too long ago, and

105
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,850
if I remember correctly, the
known universe as the order of

106
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:53,460
10 to the 79th to 10
to the 81 atoms.

107
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,560
And this is of course rough.

108
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,630
No one can really count this.

109
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,440
People are just kind of
estimating it, or even

110
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,540
better guestimating it.

111
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,980
But this is a huge number.

112
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,500
But maybe even more interesting
to you, this number was the

113
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,780
motivation behind the naming of
a very popular search

114
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,730
engine Google.

115
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,580
googol with the "ol".

116
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,140
And I don't know why
they called it Google.

117
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,060
Maybe they got the domain
name, maybe they want to

118
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,010
hold this much information.

119
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,490
Maybe that many bytes of
information, or it's

120
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,670
just a cool word.

121
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,590
Whatever it is, maybe it
was, you know, was the

122
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,760
founder's favorite number.

123
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,570
But it's a cool
thing, you know.

124
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,290
But anyway, I'm digressing.

125
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,460
This is a googol, just
1 with a hundred 0's.

126
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,990
But I could equivalently just
written that as 10 to 100.

127
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,610
Which is, you know, clearly
an easier way, this is an

128
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,370
easier way to write this.

129
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,080
This is easier.

130
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,210
In fact, this is so hard to
write that I didn't even

131
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,150
take the trouble write it.

132
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,090
It would have taken me forever.

133
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,170
This was just twenty
0's right here.

134
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:53,560
A hundred 0's, I would have
filled up this screen and you

135
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,430
would have found it boring,
so I didn't even write it.

136
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,110
So clearly this is
easier to write.

137
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,840
And so, you might very well
think, right, this is just good

138
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,650
for powers of ten, right?

139
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,890
But how can we write something
that isn't a direct

140
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:07,470
power of 10?

141
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,360
How can we use the power
of the simplicity?

142
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,460
How can we use the power of
the simplicity somehow?

143
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,660
And to do that, you just need
to make the realization.

144
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,580
This number, this number,
we would write it as.

145
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,890
So this has how many
digits in It has 1, 2,

146
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,420
3, and then twenty 0's.

147
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,840
So that's twenty-three
digits after the 6, right?

148
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,460
Twenty-three digits
after the 6.

149
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,890
What happens if I have, if I
use this, if I try to get close

150
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,880
to it with a power of 10.

151
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,260
So what if I were to
say 10 to the 23?

152
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,130
With this magenta.

153
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,710
10 to the 23rd power.

154
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,600
That's equal to what?

155
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,740
That equals 1 with
twenty-three 0's.

156
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,820
So one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

157
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,540
eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,

158
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,240
seventeen, eighteen, nineteen,
twenty, twenty-one,

159
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,410
twenty-two, twenty-three.

160
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,350
You get the idea.

161
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,200
That's 10 to the 23rd.

162
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,550
Now can we somehow
write this guy as some

163
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:14,370
Because if we multiplied this
guy by 6, so what is 6, if we

164
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,380
multiply 6 times 10 to the
23rd, what do we get?

165
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,950
Well we're just going to have
a 6 with twenty-three 0's.

166
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:25,080
We have a 6, and then you're
going to have twenty-three 0's.

167
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,730
Let me write that.

168
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,100
You're going to have
twenty-three 0's like that.

169
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,950
Because all I did, if you take
6 times this, you know how to

170
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,930
multiply, you'd have 6 times
this 1, and you'd get a 6,

171
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,150
and all the 6 times the
0'x will all be 0's.

172
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,580
So we'll have 6 followed
by twenty-three 0's.

173
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,960
So that's pretty useful.

174
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,130
But still, we're not getting
quite to this number.

175
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,640
I mean this had some, this
had some 2's in there.

176
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,180
So how could we do it
a little bit better?

177
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,680
Well, what if we wrote
it as a decimal?

178
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,800
This number, this number right
here, is identical to this

179
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,850
number is if these
2's were 0's.

180
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,680
But if we have, we want
to put those 2's there,

181
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,630
what could we do?

182
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,540
Well we could put
some decimals here.

183
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:01,330
We could say that it's
the same thing as 6.022

184
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,690
times 10 to the 23rd.

185
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,820
And now this number is
identical to this number,

186
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,820
but it's a much easier
way to write it.

187
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,650
And you could verify
it if you like.

188
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,620
It'll take a long time.

189
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,470
Maybe we should do it with
a smaller number first.

190
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:18,480
But if you multiply 6.022 times
10 to the twenty-third, and you

191
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,350
write it all out, you will
get this number right there.

192
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,860
You will get Avogadro's number.

193
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:29,550
Avogadro's number.

194
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,500
And although this is
complicated, or it looks

195
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,300
a little bit unintuitive
to you at first.

196
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,180
You know, this was just
a number written out.

197
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,060
This has a multiplication,
and then a 10 to a power.

198
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,210
You say, hey, that's
not so simple.

199
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,350
But it really is.

200
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:43,650
Because you immediately know
how many 0's there are.

201
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:46,800
And it's obviously a
much shorter way to

202
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,590
write this number.

203
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,560
Let's do a couple more.

204
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,900
This was, I started with
Avogadro's number because it

205
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,070
really shows you the need for a
scientific notation, so you

206
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,430
don't have to write things like
that over and over again.

207
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,840
So let's do a couple
of other numbers.

208
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,870
And we'll just write them
in scientific notation.

209
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:05,080
So let's say I have the
number, let's say I

210
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,080
have the number 7,345.

211
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,400
And I want to write it
in scientific notation.

212
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,610
So the, I guess the best
way to think about it is,

213
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,360
Well I wrote it over here.

214
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,520
10 to the third is 1,000.

215
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,350
So we know that 10 to the
third is equal to 1,000.

216
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,010
So essentially the largest
power of 10 that I

217
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:31,880
can fit into this.

218
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,570
This is 7 thousand.

219
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,730
So this is 7 thousands, and
then it's 0.3 thousands,

220
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,520
then it's 0.04 thousands.

221
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,720
I don't know if that helps you.

222
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:46,170
We can write this as 7.345
times 10 to the third.

223
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,420
Because it's going to be 7
thousands plus 0.3 thousands.

224
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,160
What's 0.3 times 1,000?

225
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,230
0.3 times 1,000 is 300.

226
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,510
What's 0.04 times 1,000?

227
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,090
It's 40.

228
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,340
What's 0.005 times 1,000?

229
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,140
That's a 5.

230
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:05,390
So 7.345 times 1,000
is equal to 7,345.

231
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:09,300
Let me multiply it out,
just to make it clear.

232
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:15,160
So if I took 7.345 times 1,000.

233
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,360
The way I do it is,
I ignore the 0's.

234
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,130
I essentially multiply 1
times that guy up there.

235
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:26,390
So I get 7 3 4 5, then I
had three 0's here, so

236
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,090
I put those on the end.

237
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,940
And then I have three
decimal places.

238
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,830
One, two, three.

239
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,380
So one, two, three, put
the decimal right there.

240
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,260
And there you have it.

241
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:40,210
7.345 times 1,000
is indeed 7,345.

242
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,770
Let's do a couple of them.

243
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,360
Let's say we wanted to
write the number 6 in

244
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,310
scientific notation.

245
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,420
Obviously there's no need to
write the scientific notation,

246
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,790
but how would you do it?

247
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,330
What's the largest power
of 10 that fits into 6?

248
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:54,520
Well, the largest power of 10
that fits into 6 is just 1.

249
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:59,120
So we could write it as,
something times 10 to the 0.

250
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,570
This is just 1, right?

251
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,910
That's just 1.

252
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,610
So 6 is what times 1?

253
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:04,880
Well it's just 6.

254
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,140
So 6 is equal to 6
times 10 to the 0.

255
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,340
You wouldn't actually have
to write it this way.

256
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,380
This is much simpler.

257
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:20,300
Now, what if we wanted to
represent something like this?

258
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,550
I started off the video saying,
science, you deal with very

259
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,490
large and very small numbers.

260
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,380
So let's say you had the
number, do it in this color.

261
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:33,910
Say you have the number 1, and
you have 1, 2, 3, 4, and then

262
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:38,760
let's say five 0's, and you
have, followed by a 7.

263
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,180
Once again, this is not an
easy number to deal with.

264
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,660
What's the largest power of 10
that fits into this number?

265
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,910
That this number's
divisible by?

266
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,810
Let's think about it.

267
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,260
All the powers of 10 we
did before were going to

268
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,770
positive, or going to, yeah,
positive powers of 10.

269
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:59,940
We could also do
negative powers of 10.

270
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,700
You know that 10 to the 0 is 1.

271
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,890
Let's start there.

272
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:09,120
10 to the minus 1 is equal to 1
over 10, which is equal to 0.1.

273
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,040
Switch colors, I'll do pink.

274
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,700
10 to the minus 2 is equal to 1
over 10 squared, which is equal

275
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:21,230
to 1 over 100, which is equal
to 0.01 And I think

276
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,290
you get the idea.

277
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,630
Well let me just do one more
so that you can get the idea.

278
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,280
10 to the minus 3.

279
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,040
10 to the minus 3 is equal to
1 over 10 to the third, which

280
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:37,150
is equal to 1 over 1,000,
which is equal to 0.001.

281
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:40,010
So the general pattern here is,
10 to the whatever negative

282
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:43,190
power is however many places
you're going to have

283
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,270
behind the decimal point.

284
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,370
So here, it's not
the number of 0'x.

285
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:49,370
In here, 10 to the minus 3, you
only have two 0's, but you have

286
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,110
three places behind
the decimal point.

287
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:56,140
So what is the largest power
of 10 that goes into this?

288
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,200
Well how many decimal,
places behind the

289
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,290
decimal point do I have?

290
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:04,420
I have one, two, three,
four, five, six.

291
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:09,190
So 10 to the minus 6 is going
to be equal to point, and we're

292
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,100
going to have six places behind
the decimal point, and the last

293
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,240
point is going to be, or the
last place is going to be a 1.

294
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,760
So you're going to have
five 0's and a 1.

295
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,720
That's 10 to the minus 6.

296
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,240
Now this number right here is
7 times this number, right?

297
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:29,160
If we multiply this times 7,
times 7, we get 7 times 1, and

298
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,100
then we have one, two, three,
four, five, six numbers

299
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,820
behind the decimal point.

300
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,710
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

301
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:40,910
So this number times 7 is
clearly equal to the number

302
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,460
that we started off with.

303
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,790
So we can rewrite this number.

304
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,500
We can rewrite, instead of
writing this number every time,

305
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,670
we can write it as being equal
to this number, or we could

306
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:55,850
write it as 7, this is equal
to 7 times this number.

307
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,820
But this number's no better
than that number, but this

308
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,300
number's the same thing
as 10 to the minus 6th.

309
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,560
7 times 10 to the minus 6th.

310
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,380
So now you can imagine.

311
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:10,360
You know, numbers like, imagine
the number, what if we had a 7,

312
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,360
let me think of it this way.

313
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,610
What if we had a 7, say
we had a 7 3 over there.

314
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:17,720
So what would we do?

315
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,770
Well we'd want to go to the
first digit right here, because

316
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:24,190
this is kind of the largest
power of 10 that can be,

317
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,890
that can go into this
thing right here.

318
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,380
So if we want to represent that
thing, let me write, let me do

319
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,240
another decimal that's
like that one.

320
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,980
So let's see, I did 0.0000516.

321
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,730
I wanted to represent this
in scientific notation.

322
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:42,570
I'd go to the first non-digit
0, the first non-zero digit,

323
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,150
not non-digit 0,
which is there.

324
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,020
And I'm like, OK, what's the
largest power of 10 that

325
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,760
will fit into that?

326
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,350
So I'll go one, two, three,
four, five, so it's going to be

327
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:59,360
equal to 5.16, so I take 5
there, and then everything else

328
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,040
is going to be behind the
decimal point, times 10, so

329
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,030
this is going to be the largest
power of 10 that fits into

330
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,530
this first non-zero number.

331
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:10,180
So it's one, two, three,
four, five, so 10 to

332
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,740
the minus 5 power.

333
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,900
Let me do another example.

334
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,750
So the point I wanted to make
is, you just go to the first,

335
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,980
you go to the first, you're
starting at the left, the first

336
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,970
non-zero number, that's what
you get your power from.

337
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:24,080
That's where I got my 10 to the
minus 5, because I counted

338
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,700
one, two, three, four, five.

339
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,180
You've got to count
that number, just like

340
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,065
we did over here.

341
00:15:28,065 --> 00:15:30,980
And then everything else
would be behind the decimal.

342
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,040
Let me do another example.

343
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,103
If you had, and my wife always
points out that I have to write

344
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:38,510
a 0 in front of my decimal
points, because she's a doctor,

345
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,960
and if people don't see the
decimal points, someone might

346
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,105
overdose on some medications.

347
00:15:42,105 --> 00:15:43,620
So let's write it her way.

348
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:52,310
0.0000000008192.

349
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,770
Clearly this is a super
cumbersome number, right?

350
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,370
And you know you might forget
about a 0, or add too many 0's,

351
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:00,200
which could be costly, if
you're doing some important

352
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,030
scientific research, or maybe
doing, or you wouldn't

353
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,845
prescribe medicine in this
small a dose, or maybe you

354
00:16:04,845 --> 00:16:06,390
would, I don't want
to get into that.

355
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:09,030
But how would I write this
in scientific notation?

356
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:12,380
So I start off with the first
non-zero number, if I'm

357
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,345
starting from the left.

358
00:16:13,345 --> 00:16:17,570
So it's going to be 8.192, I
just put a decimal and write

359
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:21,430
0.192 times, times
10 of the what?

360
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:29,620
eight, nine, ten, I have
to include that number.

361
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,060
10 to the minus 10.

362
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,530
I think you'll find it
reasonably satisfactory that

363
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:39,940
this number is easier to write
than that number over there.

364
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,430
Now, and this is another
powerful thing about

365
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,370
scientific notation.

366
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,120
Let's say I have these
two numbers and I want

367
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,860
to multiply them.

368
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:51,560
Let's say I want to multiply
the number 0.005 times the

369
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:58,490
number, times the
number 0.0008.

370
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,600
This is actually a fairly
straightforward one to do.

371
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,760
But, sometimes they can get
quite cumbersome, especially if

372
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,880
you're dealing with twenty or
thirty 0's on either sides

373
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,860
of the decimal point.

374
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,030
Put a 0 here to make
my wife happy.

375
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,550
Well when you do it in
scientific notation, it

376
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,030
will actually simplify it.

377
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:18,380
This guy can be rewritten
as 5 times 10 to the what?

378
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,250
I have one, two, three
spaces behind the

379
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,820
decimal, 10 to the third.

380
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:27,790
And this is 8, so this is times
8 times 10 to the, sorry, this

381
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,760
is 5 times 10 to the minus 3.

382
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,580
That's very important.

383
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,240
5 times 10 to the 3
would've been 5,000.

384
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,110
Be very careful about that.

385
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,150
And what is this guy equal to?

386
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,710
This is one, two, three, four
places behind the decimal.

387
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,830
So it's 8 times 10
to the minus 4.

388
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,910
So if we're multiplying
numbers, so this is, if we're

389
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:48,370
multiplying these two things,
it's the same thing as 5 times

390
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:53,230
10 to the minus 3 times 8
times 10 to the minus 4.

391
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,940
There's nothing special about
the scientific notation.

392
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,770
It literally means
what it's saying.

393
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:59,220
So for multiplying, you could
write it out like this, And

394
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,480
multiplication, order doesn't
matter, so I can rewrite this

395
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,730
as 5 times 8 times 10 to the
minus 3 times 10

396
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,170
to the minus 4.

397
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,830
And then what is 5 times 8?

398
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:15,830
5 times 8 we know is 40.

399
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:19,080
So it's 40 times 10
to the minus 3 times

400
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,770
10 to the minus 4.

401
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,860
And if you know your exponent
rules, you know that when you

402
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,810
multiply two numbers that
have the same base, you can

403
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,320
just add their exponents.

404
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,360
You can just add the
minus 3 and the minus 4.

405
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:35,040
So it becomes equal to 10
times 10 to the minus 7.

406
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,010
Let's do another example.

407
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:39,560
Let's say we were to
multiply Avogadro's number.

408
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:44,190
So we know that's 6.022
times 10 to the 23rd.

409
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,820
Let's say we were
multiplying that times

410
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,720
some really small number.

411
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:57,850
So times, let's say it's 7.23
times 10 to the minus 22.

412
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,470
So this is some
really small number.

413
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,840
You're going to have a decimal,
and then you're going to have

414
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,170
twenty-one 0's then you're
going to have a 7

415
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,130
and a 2 and a 3.

416
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,210
So this is a really
small number.

417
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,310
But the multiplication, when
you do it in scientific

418
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:22,790
properly, 6.022 times 10
to the 23rd, times 7.23

419
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,880
times 10 to the minus 22.

420
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,970
We can change the order.

421
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:32,520
So it's equal to
6.022 times 7.23.

422
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,370
That's that part.

423
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,580
So you can do it as these
first parts of our

424
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,950
scientific notation.

425
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:42,610
Times, times, 10 to the
twenty-third times 10 to

426
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,620
the minus twenty-two.

427
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,450
And now, this is, you know,
you're going to have to

428
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,410
do some little decimal
multiplication right here.

429
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:52,540
It's going to be some number,
forty something, I think.

430
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,070
I can't do this one in my head.

431
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,130
here, this will be times, 10 to
the 23rd, times 10

432
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:02,840
to the minus 22.

433
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,790
You just add the exponents.

434
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:07,460
You get times 10 to the
first power times 10.

435
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,610
And then this number, whatever
it's going to equal, I'll just

436
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,920
leave it out here since I
don't have a calculator.

437
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,950
7.23, let's see
what it will be.

438
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:17,930
7.2, let's see, 0.2 times,
it's like 1/5, it'll

439
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,360
be like 41 something.

440
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,170
So this is approximately,
approximately, 41

441
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,150
times 10 to the 1.

442
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:27,230
Or another way, it's
approximately, it's a little,

443
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,410
it's going to be 410 something.

444
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:32,040
And to get it right, you just
have to actually perform

445
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,230
this multiplication.

446
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:36,120
So hopefully you see that
scientific notation is one,

447
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,870
really useful for super large
and super small numbers.

448
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,430
And not only is it more useful
to kind of understand the

449
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:45,380
numbers, and to write the
