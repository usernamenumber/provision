1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,700
   

2
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,050
Let's do some more systems
of equations problem.

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:08,210
In this video, we're going to
encounter systems that might

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,860
have no solutions, or that might
have an infinite many

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,440
solutions, and we'll label
them with words.

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,700
So let's start with one.

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:23,680
Let's say we have 3x minus
4y is equal to 13.

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:30,250
Let's say my other equation in
my system is y is equal to

9
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:34,320
negative 3x minus y.

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,620
So the first thing-- this is
kind of in a strange form

11
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,100
right here.

12
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,940
I want to get into the standard
form and maybe I'll

13
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,070
do elimination for this systems.
Let me rewrite the

14
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,140
top equation.

15
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,620
We have 3x minus 4y
is equal to 13.

16
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,060
And let me rearrange this
bottom equation here.

17
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:56,740
So if I were to add 2y-- well,
let me subtract y from both

18
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,840
sides of this equation.

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,820
So if I subtract y from both
sides of this equation, it

20
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:09,820
becomes 0 is equal to negative
3x minus 2y, or negative 3x

21
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,860
minus 2y is equal to 0.

22
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,190
So let me write that
over here.

23
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,735
And it looks nice because I
have a negative 3x here, I

24
00:01:15,735 --> 00:01:17,070
have a positive 3x here.

25
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,076
Looks well suited
for elimination.

26
00:01:19,076 --> 00:01:26,950
So, I have negative 3x minus
2y is equal to 0.

27
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,440
So let's add the left-hand side
of this equation to the

28
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,270
left-hand side of the
yellow equation.

29
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,200
And we're going to add 0 to
the right-hand side of the

30
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,850
yellow equation and
we're essentially

31
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:38,890
adding 0 to both sides.

32
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,300
We're adding the same quantity
to both sides, which we can

33
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,210
always do with an equation.

34
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:47,350
So, the left hant-side, the 3x
cancels out with a 3x and

35
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,410
we're left with negative
4y minus 2y.

36
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:55,950
You get negative 6y
is equal to 13.

37
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,715
Divide both sides
by negative 6.

38
00:01:58,715 --> 00:02:01,780
   

39
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:07,640
We are left with y is equal
to negative 13/6.

40
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,330
Now let's solve for x.

41
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,570
And we can solve for x using
either of these equations.

42
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,050
Let's use that top one,
just for fun.

43
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:21,210
So we have 3 times x minus
4 times negative

44
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:26,540
13/6 is equal to 13.

45
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,800
Now we have a negative times a
negative, so those are both

46
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,420
going to become positives.

47
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,560
And then the 4/6, that's
the same thing as 2/3.

48
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:44,430
So this becomes 3x plus 2 times
13 which is 26/3, is

49
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,840
equal to 13.

50
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,870
Instead of 13, since I'm about
to subtract 26/3 from both

51
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:55,520
sides, let me rewrite
13 as 39/3.

52
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:55,830
right?

53
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,750
39 divided by 3 is 13.

54
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,785
So, let me subtract 26/3
from both sides.

55
00:03:01,785 --> 00:03:08,420
   

56
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:12,500
The left-hand side becomes 3x--
these cancel out-- is

57
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:18,770
equal to 39 minus 26 is 13/3.

58
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,360
And then we're going to want
to divide both sides by 3.

59
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,920
Or you can view it as
multiplying both sides by 1/3.

60
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,600
   

61
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,240
The left-hand side, we're
just left with an x.

62
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:36,850
The right-hand side, x is going
to be equal to 13/9.

63
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:41,010
So this system had a well
defined solution.

64
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,050
The solution is x is equal
to 13/9 and y is equal to

65
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,480
negative 13/6.

66
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,250
It only has one solution.

67
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,810
So if you think of these as
lines, these two lines

68
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,300
intersect in exactly
one point.

69
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,220
And a system like this, where
it has exactly one solution,

70
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:07,300
is called a consistent
system of equations.

71
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,740
And everything we've been
doing so far has been

72
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,910
consistent systems. Let's see
if we can stumble upon

73
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,120
something that's maybe a
little less consistent.

74
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,690
Let's say we have a system.

75
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:25,190
Let's say it's 5x minus
4y is equal to 1.

76
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:32,340
And let's say we have negative
10x plus 8y is equal to

77
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,020
negative 30.

78
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,180
Once again, I'm tempted to do
elimination here, because I

79
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,010
have a negative 10x
and I have a 5x.

80
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:48,310
If I take this top equation and
I multiply it by 2, I'll

81
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:58,410
get 10x minus 8y is
equal to 2, right?

82
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,990
I just multiplied
both sides by 2.

83
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:09,940
And if we add the left-hand
sides, we'll get 0x plus 0y is

84
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,180
equal to negative 28.

85
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,360
So we essentially get 0 is
equal to negative 28.

86
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,080
That's crazy.

87
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,260
We know that that's not true.

88
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,370
This can never be true.

89
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:21,430
We're getting an inconsistent
statement.

90
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,190
We're getting a weirdo
statement, and that's because

91
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,440
this has no solution.

92
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,350
   

93
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,760
When you solve a system of
equation, it doesn't matter

94
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,550
how you do it, whether it's
through substitution or

95
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,830
whether it's through
elimination, like I did here.

96
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,620
When you get one of these
statements where 0 equals

97
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,630
negative 28 or 5 is equal to 7
or two things that clearly

98
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,420
don't equal each other, when
they essentially have to equal

99
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,020
each other in order for the
system to work, we call that

100
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,510
an inconsistent system.

101
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:57,670
   

102
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:00,010
And it will have no solution.

103
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,960
So what does it mean
for both of these

104
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,800
equations to have no solution?

105
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,040
Let's actually graph these.

106
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,030
I think you'll have a better
feel for what it means not to

107
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:09,840
have a solution.

108
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:16,060
So the first equation is 5x
minus 4y is equal to 1.

109
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,730
Let me put it into
slope-intercept form.

110
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:25,690
So if we subtract 5x from both
sides, we get negative 4y is

111
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,870
equal to negative 5x plus 1.

112
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,750
Now if we divide both sides by
negative 4, you get y is equal

113
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:41,450
to negative 5/4x minus
1/4, right?

114
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,500
1 divided by negative 4.

115
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,100
So this is the first equation,
right over here, in

116
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,690
slope-intercept form.

117
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,250
Now let me write the
second equation in

118
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,870
slope-intercept form.

119
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:57,390
We have negative 10x plus 8y
is equal to negative 30.

120
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,570
Let's add 10x to both sides.

121
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:04,770
You get 8y is equal to 10x minus
30, and let's divide

122
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,450
both sides by 8.

123
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:13,870
You'll get y is equal to 10/8,
is the same thing as 5/4.

124
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:18,020
5/4x minus 30/8.

125
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:25,030
30/8 is the same
thing as 15/4.

126
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,230
Oh, and actually I made
a mistake here.

127
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:29,610
When we divide both sides of
this equation by negative 4,

128
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:34,020
negative 5 divided by negative
4 is positive 5/4.

129
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,580
So I shouldn't have had
a negative there.

130
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,650
I almost made a blunder.

131
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,170
So there should be no
negative there.

132
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,280
Then a 1 divided by negative
4, is negative 1/4.

133
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:47,090
So going back to the two
equations, what do you notice?

134
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,350
Well, when you put them in
slope-intercept form, they

135
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:53,400
both have the exact
same slope, 5/4.

136
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,210
but they have different
y-intercepts.

137
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,160
So what would their
graphs look like?

138
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,800
Let me graph them.

139
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,860
Let's say that that
is my y-axis.

140
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,170
That is my x-axis.

141
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:09,260
This equation, its y-intercept
is at 0 negative 1, 4.

142
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,080
Maybe that's that point
right there.

143
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,370
And it goes up at 5/4x.

144
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,586
That's a little bit
more than one.

145
00:08:14,586 --> 00:08:16,110
It's a 1.25x.

146
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:20,050
Every time you go to the right
1, you're going up 1.25.

147
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,490
So this line is going to look
something like this.

148
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,590
I'm just drawing it rough.

149
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,930
I want you to get the
general idea.

150
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,150
That's what that line
looks like.

151
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:31,800
Now this line, its y-intercept
is at negative 15/4.

152
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,980
15/4 is what?

153
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,299
3 3/4.

154
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:41,020
So if this is negative 1/4, its
y-intercept is going to be

155
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,270
way down here someplace.

156
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:45,560
   

157
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,590
I'll do it in the same color.

158
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,060
Way down here someplace.

159
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,420
Let me continue my
x-axis down.

160
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,220
This would be at
negative 15/4.

161
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,400
But its slope is the
exact same thing.

162
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,610
Every time you go to the right,
1, you're going to go

163
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:02,200
up by 5/4, so its slope
is going to be

164
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,800
the exact same thing.

165
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,700
So what do you notice about
these two lines?

166
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,000
They are parallel.

167
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,350
They have the same slope,
different y-intercepts, so

168
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,690
they will never intersect.

169
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:18,350
These two lines will
never intersect.

170
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:22,500
Which means that there is no
point on the coordinate plane

171
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,250
on the x-, y-coordinate
plane that satisfies

172
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,000
both of these equations.

173
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,220
Remember, this line represents
all of the points that

174
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,910
satisfied this equation.

175
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,790
This line represents all
of the points that

176
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,190
satisfied that equation.

177
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,820
Notice, no point
satisfies both.

178
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,990
There's no point of intersection
and that's why

179
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,300
this was an inconsistent
system.

180
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,550
Let's do one more.

181
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,420
   

182
00:09:48,420 --> 00:10:00,990
Let's say I have 4x plus 5y is
equal to 0, and I have 3x is

183
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:05,520
equal to 6y plus 4.5.

184
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,890
   

185
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,725
Actually, let me do a slightly
different one, because I want

186
00:10:10,725 --> 00:10:13,460
to show you all of the different
types that we can

187
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,410
see in systems of equations.

188
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,660
Let me clear this.

189
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,810
   

190
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:30,240
Let's say my first system is
3x minus 7y is equal to 1.

191
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,880
And let's say my other equation
in my system is

192
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:44,540
negative 6x plus 14y is
equal to negative 2.

193
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,860
So, let's try to find the x's
and y's that satisfy this

194
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,570
equation here.

195
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:51,550
And just for a change of pace,
let's do some substitution.

196
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,360
   

197
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,210
Although this is very tempting
to do elimination here, let's

198
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,080
do substitution.

199
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,470
You get 3x.

200
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,490
Let's solve it for x.

201
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,120
Actually, let's just do
elimination, because this is

202
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,860
just so glaringly prepared
for elimination, let's

203
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,710
just do it that way.

204
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,090
So let's multiply this
top equation by 2.

205
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:16,200
   

206
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,340
And what do we get?

207
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:23,140
We get 6x minus 14y is
equal to 2 right?

208
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,750
I just multiplied every term
on both sides by 2.

209
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,810
And now let's add the
left sides together.

210
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,866
You get 0 plus 0.

211
00:11:31,866 --> 00:11:34,870
And on the right hand side,
you get is equal to 0.

212
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:39,270
You get 0 is equal to 0, which
is always going to be true.

213
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:42,410
This type of system is called
a dependent system.

214
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,500
   

215
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,550
So remember, when you get a nice
clean solution, that's a

216
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,780
consistent system.

217
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,660
When you get something crazy
like 0 equals 1, that's an

218
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,730
inconsistent system.

219
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,630
That means the lines
are parallel.

220
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,980
When you get 0 equals 0, or 1 is
equal to 1 or anything like

221
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,210
that, you're dealing with
the dependent system.

222
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,510
Which really means that these
are the exact same lines, even

223
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,450
though they might look a
little bit different.

224
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,730
And to verify that, let's
put them both into

225
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,430
slope-intercept form.

226
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:15,940
So this top line, you have 3x
minus 7y is equal to 1.

227
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,080
Let's subtract 3x
from both sides.

228
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:23,360
You get negative 7y is equal
to negative 3x plus 1.

229
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,510
Now let's divide both
sides by negative 7.

230
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:33,020
You get y is equal to positive
3/7x minus 1/7.

231
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,930
That's that first equation.

232
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,510
Now let's put the second
equation into

233
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,320
slope-intercept form.

234
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,570
You have negative 6x plus 14y
is equal to negative 2.

235
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:48,550
Let's add 6x to both sides
of the equation.

236
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:54,140
So you get 14y is equal
to 6x minus 2.

237
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,430
Then divide both sides of
the equation by 14.

238
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:03,490
You get y is equal to
6/14x minus 2/14.

239
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,690
Well, this is the same thing.

240
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:10,900
6/14 is the same thing
is 3/7x minus 1/7.

241
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:15,390
Notice, they are really the
exact same equation.

242
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:18,890
So if you want to find x's and
y's that satisfy both, let's

243
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,470
think about it.

244
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,750
Let's graph it.

245
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:26,380
So if that is my coordinate
plane, that's the y-axis, that

246
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,580
is the x-axis.

247
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,600
This graph is going to look
something like this.

248
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,790
I'm going to draw
it very roughly.

249
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:36,880
It might look something like
that, where its slope is 3/7.

250
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,470
So this line is going to look
something like that.

251
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,970
That line looks exactly
like that.

252
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,730
It's the same exact line.

253
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,010
So when you say, well, what
are the x's and y's that

254
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,500
satisfy both of these
equations?

255
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,110
Well, it's every x and y
that's on these points.

256
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,070
It's that x and y.

257
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:50,750
That coordinate.

258
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,310
That coordinate.

259
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,110
That coordinate.

260
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,260
There are an infinite
number of solutions.

261
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,140
And when we use the word
dependent -- because you can

262
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:00,200
get to one of these equations
from the other.

263
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,240
These equations are dependent
on each other.

264
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,950
You can just scale one or the
other and rearrange it, and

265
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:05,930
they equal each other.

266
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,020
So here you have infinite
solutions.

267
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:11,980
   

268
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,950
Anything that satisfies one line
will satisfy the other.

269
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,350
So you just pick an x.

270
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:21,080
When x is 1, you get 3/7
minus 1/7 that's 2/7.

271
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,470
So 1, 2/7 satisfies
both equations.

272
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,910
If you pick x is equal to 0.

273
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,490
0, negative 1/7 satisfies
both equations.

274
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,210
And you could pick an infinite
number of values for x, solve

275
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:38,400
for y, and those coordinates
will satisfy both equations.

276
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,040
Let me review this
a little bit.

277
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,380
So we started off just with
the plain vanilla.

278
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,120
When you actually get a solution
that is consistent.

279
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,240
These lines actually intersect
in one point.

280
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,650
Then you have the situation
where you get something crazy,

281
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,070
when you solve your system
of equations.

282
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,890
0 is equal to negative 28.

283
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,330
Definitely not true.

284
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,180
This is an inconsistent
system.

285
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,890
It has no solution,
which means that

286
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,690
these lines are parallel.

287
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,570
They never intersect.

288
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,520
And then finally, if you get
something that's always true--

289
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,920
that's just kind of silly how
true it is-- this is a

290
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,910
dependent system.

291
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,700
These are going to
be the same line.

292
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,340
Then you can verify it by
putting both of them into

293
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,840
slope-intercept form.
