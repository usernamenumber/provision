1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,570
   

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,720
One term you are going to hear
a lot of in these videos, and

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,080
in linear algebra in general,
is the idea of a linear

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,330
combination.

5
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:11,620
   

6
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:16,020
And all a linear combination of
vectors are, they're just a

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:16,809
linear combination.

8
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:18,910
Let me show you what
that means.

9
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:26,160
So let's say I have a couple
of vectors, v1, v2, and it

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,970
goes all the way to vn.

11
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,580
And they're all in, you know,
it can be in R2 or Rn.

12
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,510
Let's say that they're
all in Rn.

13
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,600
They're in some dimension of
real space, I guess you could

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,800
call it, but the idea
is fairly simple.

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,910
A linear combination of these
vectors means you just add up

16
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,640
the vectors.

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,420
It's some combination of a sum
of the vectors, so v1 plus v2

18
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,990
plus all the way to vn,
but you scale them

19
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,110
by arbitrary constants.

20
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:01,560
So you scale them by c1, c2,
all the way to cn, where

21
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,720
everything from c1
to cn are all a

22
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,970
member of the real numbers.

23
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,870
That's all a linear
combination is.

24
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,070
Let me show you a concrete
example of linear

25
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:11,810
combinations.

26
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,960
Let me make the vector.

27
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,320
Let me define the vector a to
be equal to-- and these are

28
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,180
all bolded.

29
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,140
These purple, these are all
bolded, just because those are

30
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,490
vectors, but sometimes it's
kind of onerous to keep

31
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,160
bolding things.

32
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:30,890
So let's just say I define the
vector a to be equal to 1, 2.

33
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:36,820
And I define the vector
b to be equal to 0, 3.

34
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,780
What is the linear combination
of a and b?

35
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,490
Well, it could be any constant
times a plus any

36
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:44,550
constant times b.

37
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:50,870
So it could be 0 times a plus--
well, it could be 0

38
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:54,690
times a plus 0 times b, which,
of course, would be what?

39
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,650
That would be 0 times 0,
that would be 0, 0.

40
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,810
That would be the 0 vector, but
this is a completely valid

41
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:01,860
linear combination.

42
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,980
And we can denote the
0 vector by just a

43
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,945
big bold 0 like that.

44
00:02:06,945 --> 00:02:09,979
   

45
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,580
I could do 3 times a.

46
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,880
I'm just picking these
numbers at random.

47
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,960
3 times a plus-- let me do a
negative number just for fun.

48
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,590
So I'm going to do plus
minus 2 times b.

49
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,820
What is that equal to?

50
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,230
Let's figure it out.

51
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,190
Let me write it out.

52
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:34,140
It's 3 minus 2 times 0,
so minus 0, and it's

53
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,490
3 times 2 is 6.

54
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:45,270
6 minus 2 times 3, so minus 6,
so it's the vector 3, 0.

55
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,590
This is a linear combination
of a and b.

56
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:52,170
I can keep putting in a bunch
of random real numbers here

57
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,070
and here, and I'll just get a
bunch of different linear

58
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,740
combinations of my
vectors a and b.

59
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,720
If I had a third vector here,
if I had vector c, and maybe

60
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,200
that was just, you know, 7, 2,
then I could add that to the

61
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,640
mix and I could throw in
plus 8 times vector c.

62
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,150
These are all just linear
combinations.

63
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,680
Now why do we just call
them combinations?

64
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,960
Why do you have to add that
little linear prefix there?

65
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,130
Because we're just
scaling them up.

66
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,360
We're not multiplying the
vectors times each other.

67
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,280
We haven't even defined what it
means to multiply a vector,

68
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,010
and there's actually several
ways to do it.

69
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,350
But, you know, we can't square
a vector, and we haven't even

70
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:36,260
defined what this means yet, but
this would all of a sudden

71
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,270
make it nonlinear
in some form.

72
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,400
So all we're doing is we're
adding the vectors, and we're

73
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,610
just scaling them up by some
scaling factor, so that's why

74
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:46,780
it's called a linear
combination.

75
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,920
Now you might say, hey Sal, why
are you even introducing

76
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,880
this idea of a linear
combination?

77
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,610
Because I want to introduce the
idea, and this is an idea

78
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,270
that confounds most students
when it's first taught.

79
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,730
I think it's just the very
nature that it's taught.

80
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:07,080
Over here, I just kept putting
different numbers for the

81
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,110
weights, I guess we could call
them, for c1 and c2 in this

82
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,350
combination of a and b, right?

83
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,860
Let's ignore c for
a little bit.

84
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,320
I just put in a bunch of
different numbers there.

85
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:23,470
But it begs the question: what
is the set of all of the

86
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,280
vectors I could have created?

87
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,530
And this is just one
member of that set.

88
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:31,390
But what is the set of all of
the vectors I could've created

89
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,500
by taking linear combinations
of a and b?

90
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,990
So let me draw a and b here.

91
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,280
Maybe we can think about it
visually, and then maybe we

92
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,190
can think about it
mathematically.

93
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,850
So let's say a and b.

94
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,160
So a is 1, 2.

95
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,650
So 1, 2 looks like that.

96
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,060
That's vector a.

97
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,760
Let me do vector b in
a different color.

98
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,720
We're going to do
it in yellow.

99
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,330
Vector b is 0, 3.

100
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:57,400
So vector b looks
like that: 0, 3.

101
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,320
So what's the set of all of
the vectors that I can

102
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,120
represent by adding and
subtracting these vectors?

103
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,120
And we said, if we multiply them
both by zero and add them

104
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,450
to each other, we
end up there.

105
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:12,820
If we take 3 times a, that's
the equivalent of

106
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,030
scaling up a by 3.

107
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,880
So you go 1a, 2a, 3a.

108
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,410
So that's 3a, 3 times a
will look like that.

109
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:26,750
So this vector is 3a, and then
we added to that 2b, right?

110
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:30,400
Oh no, we subtracted 2b
from that, so minus

111
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,680
b looks like this.

112
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,860
   

113
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,120
Minus 2b looks like this.

114
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,710
This is minus 2b, all the way,
in standard form, standard

115
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,930
position, minus 2b.

116
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:51,410
So if you add 3a to minus 2b,
we get to this vector.

117
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:57,860
3a to minus 2b, you get this
vector right here, and that's

118
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,060
exactly what we did when we
solved it mathematically.

119
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,430
You get the vector 3, 0.

120
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:06,500
You get this vector
right here, 3, 0.

121
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,060
But this is just one
combination, one linear

122
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,620
combination of a and b.

123
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,560
Instead of multiplying a times
3, I could have multiplied a

124
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,970
times 1 and 1/2 and just
gotten right here.

125
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:24,840
So 1 and 1/2 a minus 2b would
still look the same.

126
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,830
It would look like something
like this.

127
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,550
It would look something like--
let me make sure I'm doing

128
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,060
this-- it would look something
like this.

129
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,160
And so our new vector that
we would find would be

130
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,910
something like this.

131
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,060
So I just showed you, I can find
this vector with a linear

132
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,420
combination.

133
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,430
I can find this vector with
a linear combination.

134
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,190
And actually, it turns out that
you can represent any

135
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:52,530
vector in R2 with some linear
combination of these vectors

136
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,270
right here, a and b.

137
00:06:54,270 --> 00:07:00,020
Now, let's just think of an
example, or maybe just try a

138
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,400
mental visual example.

139
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,350
Wherever we want to go, we
could go arbitrarily-- we

140
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:12,840
could scale a up by some
arbitrary value.

141
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,650
So this is some weight on a,
and then we can add up

142
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,060
arbitrary multiples of b.

143
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,510
B goes straight up and down,
so we can add up arbitrary

144
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,060
multiples of b to that.

145
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,740
So we could get any point on
this line right there.

146
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,070
Now, if we scaled a up a little
bit more, and then

147
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:32,400
added any multiple b, we'd get
anything on that line.

148
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,100
If we multiplied a times a
negative number and then added

149
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,260
a b in either direction, we'll
get anything on that line.

150
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,110
We can keep doing that.

151
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:42,360
And there's no reason why we
can't pick an arbitrary a that

152
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,800
can fill in any of these gaps.

153
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,765
If we want a point here, we just
take a little smaller a,

154
00:07:47,765 --> 00:07:49,540
and then we can add all
the b's that fill

155
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,390
up all of that line.

156
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:54,060
So we can fill up any
point in R2 with the

157
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,700
combinations of a and b.

158
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:01,990
So what we can write here is
that the span-- let me write

159
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,230
this word down.

160
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:10,600
The span of the vectors a and
b-- so let me write that

161
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:18,140
down-- it equals R2 or it equals
all the vectors in R2,

162
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,120
which is, you know, it's
all the tuples.

163
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,300
R2 is all the tuples
made of two ordered

164
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,550
tuples of two real numbers.

165
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,780
So it equals all of R2.

166
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,450
This just means that I can
represent any vector in R2

167
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:32,220
with some linear combination
of a and b.

168
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,710
And you're like, hey, can't I do
that with any two vectors?

169
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:40,799
Well, what if a and b were the
vector-- let's say the vector

170
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:48,490
2, 2 was a, so a is equal to 2,
2, and let's say that b is

171
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:54,590
the vector minus 2, minus
2, so b is that vector.

172
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:59,320
So b is the vector
minus 2, minus 2.

173
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,420
Now, can I represent any
vector with these?

174
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:05,200
Well, I can scale a up and down,
so I can scale a up and

175
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,670
down to get anywhere on this
line, and then I can add b

176
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,940
anywhere to it, and
b is essentially

177
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,120
going in the same direction.

178
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,590
It's just in the opposite
direction, but I can multiply

179
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,750
it by a negative and go
anywhere on the line.

180
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,590
So any combination of a and b
will just end up on this line

181
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,320
right here, if I draw
it in standard form.

182
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,790
It'll be a vector with the same
slope as either a or b,

183
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,300
or same inclination, whatever
you want to call it.

184
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,050
I could never-- there's no
combination of a and b that I

185
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,330
could represent this vector,
that I could

186
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,550
represent vector c.

187
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,440
I just can't do it.

188
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,150
I can add in standard form.

189
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:41,020
I could just keep adding scale
up a, scale up b, put them

190
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,520
heads to tails, I'll just get
the stuff on this line.

191
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,230
I'll never get to this.

192
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:50,530
So in this case, the span--
and I want to be clear.

193
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:53,640
This is for this particular a
and b, not for the a and b--

194
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,590
for this blue a and this yellow
b, the span here is

195
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,820
just this line.

196
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,820
It's just this line.

197
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,830
It's not all of R2.

198
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:07,980
So this isn't just some kind of
statement when I first did

199
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,720
it with that example.

200
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,040
It's like, OK, can
any two vectors

201
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,000
represent anything in R2?

202
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,730
Well, no.

203
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:17,220
I just showed you two vectors
that can't represent that.

204
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:23,550
What is the span of
the 0 vector?

205
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,900
I'll put a cap over it, the 0
vector, make it really bold.

206
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:31,790
Well, the 0 vector is just 0,
0, so I don't care what

207
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,760
multiple I put on it.

208
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,490
The span of it is all of the
linear combinations of this,

209
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,650
so essentially, I could put
arbitrary real numbers here,

210
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:42,430
but I'm just going to end
up with a 0, 0 vector.

211
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:46,700
So the span of the 0 vector
is just the 0 vector.

212
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,830
The only vector I can get with
a linear combination of this,

213
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:54,830
the 0 vector by itself, is
just the 0 vector itself.

214
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:59,720
Likewise, if I take the span of
just, you know, let's say I

215
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,620
go back to this example
right here.

216
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,540
My a vector was right
like that.

217
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,400
Let me draw it in
a better color.

218
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,010
My a vector looked like that.

219
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:13,350
If I were to ask just what the
span of a is, it's all the

220
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,280
vectors you can get by
creating a linear

221
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,690
combination of just a.

222
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,220
So it's really just scaling.

223
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,450
You can't even talk about
combinations, really.

224
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,370
So it's just c times a,
all of those vectors.

225
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:30,230
And we saw in the video where
I parametrized or showed a

226
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:34,430
parametric representation of a
line, that this, the span of

227
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:37,750
just this vector a, is the line
that's formed when you

228
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,050
just scale a up and down.

229
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,340
So span of a is just a line.

230
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,620
You have to have two vectors,
and they can't be collinear,

231
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,500
in order span all of R2.

232
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,620
And I haven't proven that to you
yet, but we saw with this

233
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,780
example, if you pick this a and
this b, you can represent

234
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:56,080
all of R2 with just
these two vectors.

235
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,640
Now, the two vectors that you're
most familiar with to

236
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,550
that span R2 are, if you take
a little physics class, you

237
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,320
have your i and j
unit vectors.

238
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,580
   

239
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,990
And in our notation, i, the unit
vector i that you learned

240
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:16,560
in physics class, would
be the vector 1, 0.

241
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,710
So this is i, that's the vector
i, and then the vector

242
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:25,320
j is the unit vector 0, 1.

243
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,110
This is what you learned
in physics class.

244
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,310
Let me do it in a
different color.

245
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:29,560
This is j.

246
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,420
j is that.

247
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,270
And you learned that they're
orthogonal, and we're going to

248
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,840
talk a lot more about what
orthogonality means, but in

249
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,690
our traditional sense that we
learned in high school, it

250
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:39,840
means that they're 90 degrees.

251
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:45,060
But you can clearly represent
any angle, or any vector, in

252
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,660
R2, by these two vectors.

253
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,610
And the fact that they're
orthogonal makes them extra

254
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,816
nice, and that's why these
form-- and I'm going to throw

255
00:12:51,816 --> 00:12:53,500
out a word here that I
haven't defined yet.

256
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,970
These form the basis.

257
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:57,290
These form a basis for R2.

258
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:00,070
In fact, you can represent
anything in R2 by these two

259
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:00,600
vectors. line.

260
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,130
I'm not going to even define
what basis is.

261
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,670
That's going to be
a future video.

262
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,940
But let me just write the formal
math-y definition of

263
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,000
span, just so you're
satisfied.

264
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:17,430
So if I were to write the span
of a set of vectors, v1, v2,

265
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:24,020
all the way to vn, that just
means the set of all of the

266
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:31,340
vectors, where I have c1 times
v1 plus c2 times v2 all the

267
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:37,780
way to cn-- let me scroll over--
all the way to cn vn.

268
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:42,670
So this is a set of vectors
because I can pick my ci's to

269
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:47,640
be any member of the real
numbers, and that's true for

270
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:53,830
i-- so I should write for i to
be anywhere between 1 and n.

271
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:58,310
All I'm saying is that look, I
can multiply each of these

272
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:02,350
vectors by any value, any
arbitrary value, real value,

273
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,430
and then I can add them up.

274
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,340
And now the set of all of the
combinations, scaled-up

275
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:12,280
combinations I can get, that's
the span of these vectors.

276
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,850
You can kind of view it as the
space of all of the vectors

277
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:21,140
that can be represented by a
combination of these vectors

278
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,040
right there.

279
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,930
And so the word span,
I think it does have

280
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:24,800
an intuitive sense.

281
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,720
I mean, if I say that, you know,
in my first example, I

282
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,770
showed you those two vectors
span, or a and b spans R2.

283
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,720
I wrote it right here.

284
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,900
That tells me that any vector in
R2 can be represented by a

285
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,930
linear combination of a and b.

286
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,980
And actually, just in case
that visual kind of

287
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,960
pseudo-proof doesn't do you
justice, let me prove it to

288
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,300
you algebraically.

289
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,910
I'm telling you that I can
take-- let's say I want to

290
00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:00,670
represent, you know, I have
some-- let me rewrite my a's

291
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,740
and b's again.

292
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,060
So this was my vector a.

293
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,260
It was 1, 2, and b was 0, 3.

294
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,250
Let me remember that.

295
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:17,540
So my vector a is 1, 2, and
my vector b was 0, 3.

296
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,410
Now my claim was that I can
represent any point.

297
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:25,270
Let's say I want to represent
some arbitrary point x in R2,

298
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:28,640
so its coordinates
are x1 and x2.

299
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,210
I need to be able to prove to
you that I can get to any x1

300
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:34,760
and any x2 with some combination
of these guys.

301
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:41,240
So let's say that my
combination, I say c1 times a

302
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:48,460
plus c2 times b has to be
equal to my vector x.

303
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:52,530
Let me show you that I can
always find a c1 or c2 given

304
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,405
that you give me some x's.

305
00:15:54,405 --> 00:15:57,190
   

306
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:01,870
So let's just write this right
here with the actual vectors

307
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,010
being represented in their
kind of column form.

308
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:11,420
So we have c1 times this vector
plus c2 times the b

309
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:18,020
vector 0, 3 should be able to
be equal to my x vector,

310
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,630
should be able to be equal to my
x1 and x2, where these are

311
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,940
just arbitrary.

312
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,600
So let's see if I can
set that to be true.

313
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,720
So if this is true, then the
following must be true. c1

314
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:36,410
times 1 plus 0 times c2
must be equal to x1.

315
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:39,250
We just get that from our
definition of multiplying

316
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,820
vectors times scalars
and adding vectors.

317
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:48,550
And then we also know that
2 times c2-- sorry.

318
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:58,090
c1 times 2 plus c2 times 3, 3c2,
should be equal to x2.

319
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,760
Now, if I can show you that I
can always find c1's and c2's

320
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:07,130
given any x1's and x2's, then
I've proven that I can get to

321
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:10,450
any point in R2 using just
these two vectors.

322
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,839
So let me see if
I can do that.

323
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:17,440
So this is just a system
of two unknowns.

324
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,349
This is just 0.

325
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:19,599
We can ignore it.

326
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,780
So let's multiply this equation
up here by minus 2

327
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,550
and put it here.

328
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:28,670
So we get minus 2, c1--
I'm just multiplying

329
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,040
this times minus 2.

330
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:35,070
We get a 0 here, plus 0
is equal to minus 2x1.

331
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,590
And then you add these two.

332
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,500
You get 3c2, right?

333
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,400
These cancel out.

334
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,950
You get 3-- let me write it
in a different color.

335
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:51,860
You get 3c2 is equal
to x2 minus 2x1.

336
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,420
Or divide both sides by 3,
you get c2 is equal to

337
00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:00,180
1/3 x2 minus x1.

338
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:04,780
Now we'd have to go substitute
back in for c1.

339
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:08,890
But we have this first equation
right here, that c1,

340
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,670
this first equation that says
c1 plus 0 is equal to x1, so

341
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,530
c1 is equal to x1.

342
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:17,380
So that one just
gets us there.

343
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,260
So c1 is equal to x1.

344
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,750
So you give me any point in R2--
these are just two real

345
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,730
numbers-- and I can just perform
this operation, and

346
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:31,100
I'll tell you what weights to
apply to a and b to get to

347
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:31,890
that point.

348
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:35,190
If you say, OK, what combination
of a and b can get

349
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:38,520
me to the point-- let's say I
want to get to the point-- let

350
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,930
me go back up here.

351
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,430
Oh, it's way up there.

352
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:46,130
Let's say I'm looking to
get to the point 2, 2.

353
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,860
So x1 is 2.

354
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,400
Let me write it down here.

355
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,510
Say I'm trying to get to the
point the vector 2, 2.

356
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,830
What combinations of a
and b can be there?

357
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:59,930
Well, I know that c1 is equal
to x1, so that's equal to 2,

358
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:07,760
and c2 is equal to 1/3
times 2 minus 2.

359
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,000
So 2 minus 2 is 0, so
c2 is equal to 0.

360
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,230
So if I want to just get to
the point 2, 2, I just

361
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,120
multiply-- oh, I
just realized.

362
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,350
This was looking suspicious.

363
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,430
I made a slight error here,
and this was good that I

364
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,550
actually tried it out
with real numbers.

365
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:29,740
Over here, when I had 3c2 is
equal to x2 minus 2x1, I got

366
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,920
rid of this 2 over here.

367
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,970
There's a 2 over here.

368
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,150
I divide both sides by 3.

369
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,200
I get 1/3 times x2 minus 2x1.

370
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,260
And that's why I was like, wait,
this is looking strange.

371
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,540
So I had to take a
moment of pause.

372
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:44,720
So let's go to my corrected
definition of c2.

373
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,630
C2 is equal to 1/3 times x2.

374
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:55,830
So 2 minus 2 times x1,
so minus 2 times 2.

375
00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:01,880
So it's equal to 1/3 times 2
minus 4, which is equal to

376
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,670
minus 2, so it's equal
to minus 2/3.

377
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:14,410
So if I multiply 2 times my
vector a minus 2/3 times my

378
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:18,600
vector b, I will get
to the vector 2, 2.

379
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,480
And you can verify
it for yourself.

380
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:29,470
2 times my vector a 1, 2, minus
2/3 times my vector b 0,

381
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:34,000
3, should equal 2, 2.

382
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,066
