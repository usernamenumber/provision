1
00:00:02,505 --> 00:00:04,530
We're asked to shade 20% of the square below.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,700
Before doing that, let's just even think about

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,380
what percent means.

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,440
Let me just rewrite it.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,928
20% is equal to-- I'm just writing it out as a word--

6
00:00:15,928 --> 00:00:20,134
20 percent, which literally means 20 per cent.

7
00:00:20,134 --> 00:00:21,620
- Let me break it out -

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:26,000
which is the same thing as 20 per cent.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,380
And if you're familiar with the word century,

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,940
you might already know that cent comes from the Latin

11
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,598
for the word hundred.

12
00:00:35,598 --> 00:00:39,230
This literally means you can take cent,

13
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:40,700
and that literally means 100.

14
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:48,044
So this is the same thing as 20 per 100.

15
00:00:48,044 --> 00:00:51,007
20% means you're really going to meet

16
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:53,970
That means if you want to shade 20%,

17
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,957
if you break up the square into 100 pieces,

18
00:00:55,957 --> 00:00:59,375
we want to shade 20 of them. 20 per 100.

19
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:01,240
So how many squares have they drawn here?

20
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,847
So if we go horizontally right here, we have 1, 2, 3,

21
00:01:04,847 --> 00:01:09,400
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 squares.

22
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,450
If we go vertically, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

23
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,630
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

24
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,620
So this is a 10 by 10 square.

25
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,680
So it has 100 squares here.

26
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,580
Another way to say it is that this larger square-- I guess

27
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,270
that's the square that they're talking about.

28
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:31,970
This larger square is a broken
up into 100 smaller squares,

29
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,220
so it's already broken
up into the 100.

30
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,990
So if we want to shade 20% of
that, we need to shade 20 of

31
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,420
every 100 squares that
it is broken into.

32
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,470
So with this, we'll just
literally shade in 20 squares.

33
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,330
So let me just do one.

34
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:51,210
So if I just do one square, just
like that, I have just

35
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,050
shaded 1 per 100
of the squares.

36
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,080
100 out of 100 would
be the whole.

37
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,640
I've shaded one of them.

38
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,170
That one square by itself
would be 1%

39
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,300
of the entire square.

40
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:08,009
If I were to shade another one,
if I were to shade that

41
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:12,190
and that, then those two
combined, that's 2% of the

42
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:12,950
entire square.

43
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,680
It's literally 2 per 100,
where 100 would

44
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,640
be the entire square.

45
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,490
If we wanted to do 20, we do
one, two, three, four-- if we

46
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,860
shade this entire row, that
will be 10%, right?

47
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:34,160
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

48
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,430
And we want to do 20, so that'll
be one more row.

49
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,050
So I can shade in this whole
other row right here.

50
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,460
And then I would have shaded
in 20 of the 100 squares.

51
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,010
Or another way of thinking about
it, if you take this

52
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,750
larger square, divide it into
100 equal pieces, I've shaded

53
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:57,590
in 20 per 100, or 20%, of the
entire larger square.

54
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,720
Hopefully, that makes sense.
