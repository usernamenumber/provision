1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,470
Sal: I want to make a quick
correction to my second

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,550
oxidation video.

4
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,029
It was pointed out that I made
an error that you will

5
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:09,980
probably find confusing.

6
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,780
So I had written down
hydrogen peroxide.

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,490
Because this was one of the
situations or the special

8
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:19,680
cases where oxygen's oxidation
state isn't

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,080
necessarily minus 2.

10
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,580
So hydrogen peroxide is 2
hydrogens, 2 oxygens.

11
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,780
And it's structure
looks like this.

12
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,470
The oxygens are bonded to each
other, and they're each bonded

13
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,740
to a hydrogen.

14
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,350
And we know oxygen is really
electronegative.

15
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,800
It likes to hog electrons.

16
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,890
And I said that in that video.

17
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,870
And because it hogs electrons,
the hydrogens lose their

18
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,500
electron to oxygen, or at least
from the oxidation state

19
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,570
point of view.

20
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,910
So they each have a plus 1
oxidation state, which I did

21
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:51,760
say in that video.

22
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,240
And then I went on and my brain
was clearly-- and this

23
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,850
is actually a good point for you
to realize how confusing

24
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,150
this can sometimes
be if you're not

25
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,920
careful with your work.

26
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,620
I say in the last video,
and obviously

27
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,970
oxygen gains an electron.

28
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:08,530
And then I say and it's
oxidation state is plus 1.

29
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,470
Which clearly makes no sense.

30
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,440
If you gain an electron,
that will reduce

31
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,250
your oxidation state.

32
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,810
It will reduce that hypothetical
charge.

33
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:20,470
And so your oxidation
state is minus 1 in

34
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,230
each of these oxygens.

35
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,250
And, of course, this is
a special case because

36
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,240
traditionally, oxygen in
the case I always show

37
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,030
it with, is in water.

38
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,160
When it takes 2 electrons, 1
from this hydrogen and 1 from

39
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,340
that hydrogen, it normally has
an oxidation state of minus 2

40
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,760
and, of course, in this case,
it's plus 1 and plus 1 for the

41
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,810
2 hydrogens.

42
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,630
I think later, when I go back
to the molecular formula, I

43
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:44,920
kind of corrected in my head.

44
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,220
But I want to be very
clear to you.

45
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:50,190
Oxygen does not have an
oxidation state of plus 1 in

46
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,070
hydrogen peroxide.

47
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,370
It is minus 1.

48
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,950
I said it gained the electrons,
but then my brain

49
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,370
obviously heard the word gaining
and wanted to put a

50
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,230
plus sign there.

51
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:58,820
No.

52
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,080
it gained an electron that
reduces the oxygen.

53
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,190
It makes its oxidation state
minus 1 for hydrogen peroxide.

54
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:11,390
So hydrogen peroxide has 2
hydrogens with a plus 1

55
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,590
oxidation state.

56
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,210
And it has 2 oxygens with a
minus 1 oxidation state.

57
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:21,910
One times 2 minus 1 times 2 is
equal to 0, so we're all cool.
