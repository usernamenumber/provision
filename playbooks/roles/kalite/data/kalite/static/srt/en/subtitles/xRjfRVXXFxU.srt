1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,670
   

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:03,750
Let's continue with this example
and I welcome you to

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,120
throw examples my way, and we
can think about whether

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,420
something is consumption
or investment.

5
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:10,590
And my argument, in general,
is that investment is

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,100
something good for society.

7
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,340
It's good for you.

8
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,030
It is capital, right?

9
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,350
Or money that's being put to
work to create more wealth or

10
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,400
more capital or more
good for society.

11
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,100
While consumption is capital
that is, essentially, being

12
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,730
burned in some way, usually for
some type of social status

13
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:30,980
or ego gratification.

14
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,050
   

15
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,750
Well, let's think about that.

16
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:42,610
What about a going out once a
month-- Let's say a vacation,

17
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,850
this is an interesting case.

18
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:52,970
A simple vacation with family.

19
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,370
Maybe it's a family reunion,
depending on your family, it

20
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,360
might be simple, or it might
be relaxing, it might not.

21
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,530
But let's assume this is
a relaxing vacation.

22
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,720
You're going camping,
or you're going

23
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,770
to Yosemite or something.

24
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,860
It's a very peaceful, tranquil
thing to do.

25
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,590
So your original gut reaction
would be, well, if we take a

26
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,340
vacation, me and my family,
we're going to take time off,

27
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,820
we're not going to work,
my kids aren't

28
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,850
going to be in school.

29
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,460
So you might say, oh, well,
that's consumption because

30
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,270
we're going to spend money.

31
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:23,120
Let's say, the vacation
cost $2,000, right?

32
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,190
We're spending $2,000
on this vacation.

33
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,150
So that might be an investment,
or that might be

34
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:29,670
consumption.

35
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,830
So, at first you might say
that's consumption, you're not

36
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,840
going to be working.

37
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,530
Once you go on that vacation,
there's nothing left over.

38
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,650
But there could be a counter
argument here.

39
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,460
There could be an argument that,
by taking this simple

40
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,120
vacation with the family, it
recenters you, it bonds with

41
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,910
your family, it makes you
a happier human being.

42
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,530
And it makes you more likely
to be able to contribute to

43
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,980
society once you
get back home.

44
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,980
And if you didn't take this
vacation, you would

45
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,390
eventually burn out.

46
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,920
So in this example, and it
depends on what you consider a

47
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,280
simple vacation, I would
consider that actually,

48
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,260
probably an investment.

49
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,560
Especially if it makes you more
relaxed, it eases your

50
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,070
brain, it allows you to become
more creative and more

51
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,090
productive for society.

52
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,250
That could be an investment.

53
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,680
That's why I think it's
important that

54
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,190
people don't overwork.

55
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:17,360
Now, what if I were to take me
and my family and we were to

56
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,480
have someone carry us or we rode
on someone's back as they

57
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,470
swam across the ocean to go stay
in golden thrones while

58
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,480
an army of people
danced for us.

59
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:29,760
Right?

60
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,155
So let's say, an extravagant
vacation.

61
00:02:31,155 --> 00:02:37,400
   

62
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,570
So you could argue a lot of
things, this is, I have a

63
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:46,780
family of four and let's say
it costs me $200,000.

64
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,300
Well here, there's
a couple things.

65
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,780
There might be some part of this
vacation that makes you

66
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,440
more relaxed and might make
you more productive.

67
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,690
I'd argue that it is probably
the opposite, the extravagant

68
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:58,770
vacation is probably going to
make you more stressed and

69
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,620
probably feed your ego in ways
that are in some ways

70
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,910
self-destructive.

71
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,750
But let's say that there is some
component, let's stick to

72
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,590
the benefit of the doubt,
that does relax you.

73
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,150
And I would say that that
component is an investment.

74
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:10,780
But you know what?

75
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,490
You probably could have gotten
that for $2,000.

76
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:17,160
So we could say that $2,000
of this is something of an

77
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:25,890
investment and that $198,000
of this probably is

78
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:26,460
consumption.

79
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,110
Because it's not making
you more productive.

80
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,570
Sure enough, when you go to this
place, it is giving those

81
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:36,750
people something to do and it
is giving them jobs, but I

82
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,400
would call that a transfer
of wealth.

83
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,730
This isn't investment.

84
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,670
When you go to whatever country
you decide to go to

85
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:46,380
and you blow, essentially,
$198,000 that you didn't need

86
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:51,200
to just because it feels good
to have the locals dote on

87
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,550
you, you're transferring
money to them.

88
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,060
And then, maybe, they transfer
that money to someone else,

89
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:01,000
but it in no way is increasing
the wealth of the world.

90
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,120
It's not leading to innovation;
it's not leading

91
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,550
to more factories; and
it's not leading to

92
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,040
the pie getting bigger.

93
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,510
And you know what?

94
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,200
I don't even think this is,
necessarily, a bad idea

95
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,840
because, frankly, this is just
the transfer of wealth from

96
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,744
someone who needs ego
gratification to a transfer of

97
00:04:18,744 --> 00:04:21,470
wealth from someone who's
willing to do fairly simple

98
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,480
things to, essentially, take
that wealth from them.

99
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,960
But, at the end of the day,
it is consumption.

100
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,190
And I think you can imagine,
let's say, a simple purse.

101
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,500
   

102
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,990
My wife goes out and buys
a purse from Target

103
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,440
and it costs $20.

104
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,960
Is that consumption or is
that an investment?

105
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,290
Well, I'd argue that that's
an investment.

106
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,480
Maybe her old purse is falling
apart and by having a new

107
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,080
purse, maybe it helps her get
a job, be more productive;

108
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,980
maybe it helps her get
more organized.

109
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,255
So this could be
an investment.

110
00:04:52,255 --> 00:04:55,610
   

111
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,670
And what about a Louis Vuitton--
not to pick on them

112
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,390
in particular-- but what about
a Louis Vuitton purse.

113
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,690
I don't know how much they--
I don't even know

114
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,590
how to spell it.

115
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:09,560
I think these cost upwards
of $2,000, or whatever.

116
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,750
Well, this, clearly, is some
form of consumption.

117
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,310
You could maybe make some
argument that in certain

118
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,650
circles, you could get a job
if you carry around one of

119
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,000
these purses.

120
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,450
But there's some basic core
value to it that you probably

121
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,220
could have gotten with
a simple purse.

122
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,065
So that, maybe, is $20
of investment.

123
00:05:26,065 --> 00:05:30,990
   

124
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,790
And then the rest of it, I don't
know, the other $1,980,

125
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,166
is consumption.

126
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:40,450
Now, I'll ask you a further
question: do you think that

127
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,490
this is bad or good
for society?

128
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,990
Well, I'd actually argue that
it's probably neutral for

129
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,430
society, because it does look
like a quote, unquote, waste

130
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:53,830
of money, this extra almost
$2,000 that you spent that you

131
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,050
really didn't have to, to get
something of fairly basic

132
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,890
utility, but that those
resources weren't burned.

133
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,720
Those resources went from,
frankly, someone who just

134
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,110
wanted some ego gratification.

135
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,680
It went from someone's
ego, essentially.

136
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,780
So let's say this is
you, or your ego.

137
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:19,260
And this is Louis Vuitton,
the company.

138
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,980
So you gave them $1,980 that
you didn't have to.

139
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,210
Their cost of making the purse
probably didn't cost a lot

140
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,750
more than that simple purse.

141
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,730
And in exchange, they gave
you ego gratification.

142
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,690
So they really didn't have to
waste a lot of resources.

143
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:35,720
They gave you all of this brand
imagery that makes you

144
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,970
feel better about yourself.

145
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:40,440
   

146
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,830
So I would argue that this
capital actually didn't get

147
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,350
lost, it just got transferred
from someone who was probably

148
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,960
a little insecure to someone
who knows how to sell to

149
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,070
insecure people.

150
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:52,950
And then Louis Vuitton will then
have that $1,980 and then

151
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:56,400
who knows, maybe they give that
to their private equity

152
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,220
friend or their venture capital
friend, and then that

153
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,870
gets invested in some new
start-up idea, some solar-cell

154
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,120
company that actually can create
energy from the sun.

155
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,280
And in which case, that money
did not go wasted.

156
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,970
So they might actually
invest it in solar.

157
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,330
So this, actually, was
not a waste of money.

158
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,300
Although, this transaction, I
would agree, is consumption.

159
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,490
I would say that the waste
of money is all of the

160
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,050
advertising and all the
sponsorship that Louis Vuitton

161
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:25,110
has to do to convince you that
this will make you, somehow, a

162
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,260
better person if you
buy that purse.

163
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,515
Because those ads you see on TV
with those people you want

164
00:07:30,515 --> 00:07:34,630
to look like, that will not
give you-- that is not

165
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:37,570
creating any net wealth for the
world, or is not making

166
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,830
the pie any bigger.

167
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,820
Anyway, let me think of
another example here.

168
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,090
Well, let's say, so this example
with the Louis Vuitton

169
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,550
purse, this is just a
transfer of wealth.

170
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:53,152
But let's say, instead of doing
that, you had your ego

171
00:07:53,152 --> 00:07:56,510
and instead of buying a Louis
Vuitton purse, you just-- so

172
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:08,740
this is you-- you thought it
would be nice-- but let's say,

173
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,300
you thought it was nice, instead
of buying a Louis

174
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,580
Vuitton purse, which we
established would just be a

175
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,480
transfer of wealth-- it is
consumption, but at least that

176
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,980
money doesn't disappear-- let's
say that you wanted to

177
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:22,690
pay $2,000 to have-- I don't
know-- $10 an hour, you can

178
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:33,510
have 200 people dance for you
and recite your name and talk

179
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,919
about what an amazing
person you are.

180
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,400
This, I would argue, is
pure consumption.

181
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:44,520
Because those 200 people, sure
this money gets transferred to

182
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,910
them, but they didn't
do anything

183
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,200
productive with that time.

184
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,460
Right?

185
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,300
Those 200 people, they could
have been tilling the soil;

186
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,120
they could have been working in
a factory; they could have

187
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,970
been teaching their children how
to read; they could have

188
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,570
been doing something that was
productive for society.

189
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:02,580
But instead, they spent one hour
dancing for you for your

190
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,210
ego gratification.

191
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,960
And this is, in my mind, the
worst form of consumption

192
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,930
because, not only-- it's not
just the transfer of wealth,

193
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,340
it is the destruction
of wealth.

194
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:16,930
Because 200 people's time is
wealth, that is capital that

195
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,180
could be used to improve
someone's life.

196
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,330
But instead, this $2,000 was,
essentially destroyed.

197
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,590
Sure, it goes to those
people, right?

198
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,310
But in the end, they didn't
create anything in

199
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,200
that amount of time.

200
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,870
And I'll touch more
about that anyway.

201
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,930
In essence, the amount of money
didn't change in the

202
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,310
system, but the amount of
value in the system got

203
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,810
degraded because all these
people time got wasted.

204
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,940
And, In the end, that actually
leads to inflation.

205
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,830
If you have more money in a
system with less productive

206
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:47,110
goods and services, the price
for our productive goods and

207
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,740
services goes up.

208
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,520
But anyway, I'm out
of time again.

209
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,940
But I encourage you to think as
much as you can about just

210
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:57,170
this idea: when you spend money,
is it consumption or is

211
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:57,880
it investment?

212
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,860
And I'll continue this more into
kind of a lot of what the

213
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,430
government tells you to do when
the economy goes down.

214
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,110
How they say, go by yourself a
nice dress, instead of saying,

215
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,390
hey why don't you go
build a factory?

216
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,270
Or why don't you save your
money and invest in your

217
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,270
child's education?

218
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,560
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
