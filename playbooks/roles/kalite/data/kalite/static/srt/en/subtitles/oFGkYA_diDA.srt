00:00:00,395 --> 00:00:02,440
In the first video on evolution,

2
00:00:02,456 --> 00:00:07,770
I drew something that I called an ape, and then I drew a tail on it.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,716
And what I want to do in this video is clarify that that was absolutely wrong.

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,862
Apes - Apes have no tails.

5
00:00:16,862 --> 00:00:20,806
And it's actually one of the main distinguishing characteristics of apes.

6
00:00:20,806 --> 00:00:24,335
There's obviously other primates that also have no tails,

7
00:00:24,335 --> 00:00:27,667
but apes definitely have no tails.

8
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:30,790
And just to clarify, there's kind of two families within apes

9
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,133
and their common names are "the lesser apes" and "the great apes."

10
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:40,156
And the lesser apes - the lesser apes are things like gibbons, lesser apes,

11
00:00:40,156 --> 00:00:43,594
And the great apes are things like chimpanzees and gorillas,

12
00:00:43,594 --> 00:00:46,421
and, and me, or human beings!

13
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:50,544
So these right here, these are the great apes.

14
00:00:50,544 --> 00:00:53,346
These are the great apes.

15
00:00:53,346 --> 00:00:58,036
And clearly this great ape right here did not have a great sense of style

16
00:00:58,036 --> 00:00:59,692
in 1994.

17
00:00:59,692 --> 99:59:59,999
And really didn't feel the need to have a haircut.
