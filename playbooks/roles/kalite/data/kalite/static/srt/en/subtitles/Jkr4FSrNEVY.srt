1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620
   

2
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,410
I think we now have all the
tools we need to move forward,

3
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,590
so just to review a little bit
of the last video we said we

4
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:08,680
are trying to model out the
probability distribution of

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,780
how many cars might
pass in an hour.

6
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,950
And the first thing we did is
we sat at that intersection and

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,910
we found a pretty good expected
value of our random variable.

8
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,720
And this random variable, just
to go back to the top, we

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,030
defined the random variable as
the number of cars that pass

10
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:28,790
in an hour at a certain
point on a certain road.

11
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,410
We measure a bunch, we sat out
there a bunch of hours, and we

12
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,540
got a pretty good estimate of
this and we say it's lambda.

13
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,230
And we said, OK, we
wanted to model it as a

14
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,440
binomial distribution.

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,730
So if this is a binomial
distribution then this lambda

16
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,840
would be equal to the number of
trials times the probability

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,740
of success per trial.

18
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,120
And so, if we could view a
trial as an interval of time.

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,740
This is the total number
of successes in an hour.

20
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,320
   

21
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,430
And so this would be success
in a smaller interval.

22
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,820
And this would be the
probability of success in

23
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,020
that smaller interval.

24
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,540
And in the last video
we tried it out.

25
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,460
We said, oh, well, what if we
make this interval a minute

26
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,790
and this is the probability
of success per minute?

27
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,280
We'd have maybe a reasonable
description of what

28
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:15,850
we're describing.

29
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,890
But what if more than one
car passes in a minute?

30
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,840
And they said, oh, let's make
this per second and this

31
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,680
is the probability of
success per second.

32
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,130
But then we still have the
problem, more than one

33
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,020
car could pass in a
second, very easily.

34
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,020
So what we wanted to do is we
want to take the limit as this

35
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:34,530
approaches infinity and then
see what kind of formula we

36
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,610
get from the math gods.

37
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,580
If we describes this as a
binomial distribution with the

38
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,910
limit as it approaches
infinity, we could say that the

39
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:48,940
probability that x is equal to
some number-- so the

40
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:53,550
probability that our random
variable is equal to 3 cars in

41
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:58,960
a particular hour, exactly 3
cars in an hour-- is equal to--

42
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,460
oh, we want to take the limit
as it approaches

43
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,430
infinity, right?

44
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:09,090
The limit as n approaches
infinity of n choose k.

45
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,050
We're going to have k moments
in time because n approaches

46
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:16,250
infinity, these intervals
become super super duper small.

47
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,170
So these become
moments in time.

48
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,500
We're going to have close to an
infinite number moments and

49
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,260
this is the number of
successful moments

50
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,030
where cars pass.

51
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:29,815
We have 3 moments where there
was a success, where a

52
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:32,370
car passed, and we had
a total of 3 cars pass.

53
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,960
Or 7 cars, 7 moments where it
was true that a car passed,

54
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,760
and we would have total
7 cars pass in the hour.

55
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,660
So just finishing up with our
binomial distribution, n

56
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,890
moments, choose k successes
times the probability

57
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:45,830
of success.

58
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,220
What's the probability
of success?

59
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,000
   

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,960
So this would be n.

61
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,420
What's p equal to?

62
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,980
p is equal to lambda divided by
n, right? n times p is lambda,

63
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,250
so let me just write that down.
p is equal to lambda

64
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,550
divided by n.

65
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,530
I just rearranged this up here.

66
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,380
So our probability of
success is lambda times n.

67
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,370
   

68
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,650
And we're saying what's
the probability that

69
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,650
we have k successes?

70
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:19,210
   

71
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,990
And then, what's the
probability that

72
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,380
we have a failure?

73
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,180
Well, it's 1 minus the
probability of success.

74
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,710
And how many failures
are we going to have?

75
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,090
How many moments will
not have a car pass?

76
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,420
Well, we have total event
moments and k of them were

77
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:36,640
successes, so we'll have
n minus k failures.

78
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,380
Let's see what we
can do with this.

79
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,700
So this is equal to--
let me rewrite it all.

80
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,790
And I'll change colors.

81
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:47,840
The limit as n approaches
infinity-- let me write out

82
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,140
this binomial coefficient.

83
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:57,370
That's n factorial over n minus
k factorial times k factorial.

84
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,530
Normally I write these the
other way around, but

85
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,240
it's the same thing.

86
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:05,750
Times lambda to the k.

87
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,320
Using my exponent properties--
over n to the k.

88
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,300
And then this expression
right here, I can actually

89
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,460
separate out the exponents.

90
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,790
This is the same thing as 1
minus lambda over n to the

91
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:21,380
n times 1 minus lambda
over n to the minus k.

92
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,130
You have the same base, you
could add the exponents and

93
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,890
you would get this up here.

94
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,030
Let me simplify a
little bit more.

95
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,150
Let me swap spots
with these two.

96
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,390
You can kind of view them both
as being in the denominator.

97
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,630
So you can change the order of
division or multiplication

98
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,490
depending how you view it.

99
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:41,820
So this is equal to the
limit-- let me switch colors.

100
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,050
The limit as n approaches
infinity-- I don't

101
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:44,755
like that color.

102
00:04:44,755 --> 00:04:48,180
   

103
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,480
Actually, let me just rewrite
what we did in the last video.

104
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,170
What is this thing right here?

105
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,950
And we showed at the end of the
last video. n factorial divided

106
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,130
by n minus k factorial.

107
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:04,750
It was n times n minus 1
times n minus 2, all the

108
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,560
way to n minus k plus 1.

109
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,360
If this was 7 over 7 minus
2 factorial we would

110
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,760
have 7 times 6.

111
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,710
And 6 is one more
than 7 minus 2.

112
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,660
So that's where we got that.

113
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,600
We did that in the last video
if you're getting confused.

114
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,830
And we also said that
there's going to be

115
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,800
exactly k terms here.

116
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,080
So if you counted these as 1,
2, 3-- all the way, there's

117
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,240
going to be k terms here.

118
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,930
We took care of that.

119
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,620
We just rewrote that.

120
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,830
And I said I would switch these
two things around, so that's

121
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:46,240
divided by n to the k times--
I'm just switching

122
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,015
these-- lambda to the k
over k factorial.

123
00:05:52,015 --> 00:05:55,460
   

124
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,540
And then, what do we have here?

125
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,120
We'll I can just rewrite that.

126
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,600
This is continuing
the same line.

127
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,830
1 minus lambda over n to
the n times 1 minus lambda

128
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,620
over n to the minus k.

129
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,450
Now we can take the limit.

130
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,420
So what happens when
we take the limit?

131
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,870
If you take the limit, this
is another property so you

132
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:19,410
don't get too overwhelmed--
another property of limits.

133
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:23,100
If I take the limit as x
approaches anything, a

134
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,320
of f of x times g of x.

135
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,150
That's equal to the limit
as x approaches a of f of

136
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:35,230
x, times the limit as x
approaches a of g of x.

137
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,460
So we could take each of these
limits in the product and then

138
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,040
multiply them and then
we'll be all set.

139
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,070
So let's do that.

140
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,220
And I want to leave
this stuff up here.

141
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,560
So first of all,
what's this limit?

142
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,320
Let me write this out.

143
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,390
And let me pick a
good color-- yellow.

144
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:56,790
So we have the limit as
n approaches infinity.

145
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,930
So this thing up here, this n
times n minus 1 times n minus

146
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,200
2-- all the way down to n
minus k plus 1, what's

147
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,840
it going to look like?

148
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,020
It's going to be a
polynomial right?

149
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,380
We're multiplying a bunch of--
well really, we're multiplying

150
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,540
a bunch of binomials and
we're doing it k times.

151
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:13,210
So the largest degree term
is going to be n to the k.

152
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,390
It's going to be n to the
k plus something times

153
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,380
n to the k minus 1.

154
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:21,280
It's going to be this
big polynomial-- kth

155
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,010
degree polynomial.

156
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,690
And that's really all we need
to know for this derivation.

157
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:27,800
So it's going to be n to the
k plus blah, blah, blah,

158
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,610
blah, blah, blah, blah--
a bunch of other stuff.

159
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:34,190
This thing when you multiply it
out, over-- we have this n to

160
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:39,310
the k, that's this part of it.

161
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:44,960
Times the limit as--
well actually, we

162
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,540
don't have to worry.

163
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,390
This is a constant.

164
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,900
So we could actually
bring this out front.

165
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,340
So we don't even have
to write a limit.

166
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,800
So times lambda to the
k k over k factorial.

167
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,300
There's no n here, so this is
a constant with respect to n.

168
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:04,560
Times the limit as n approaches
infinity of 1 minus lambda

169
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:12,580
over n to the n times 1 minus
lambda over n to the minus k.

170
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:16,220
All right, I know you
can barely read this.

171
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,820
So first of all,
what's this limit?

172
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,700
The limit as n approaches
infinity of some polynomial

173
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,410
where it's n to the kth power
plus blah, blah, blah, blah.

174
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,080
Where all of these other
terms have a lower degree.

175
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,460
This is the highest
degree term.

176
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,050
   

177
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,050
So you have n to the k in the
numerator and you have n to

178
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,350
the k in the denominator.

179
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,720
So the highest degrees
are the same.

180
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,820
The coefficients are 1,
so this limit is 1.

181
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,450
Another way you could do it,
you could divide the numerator

182
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:43,250
and the denominator by n to the
k and you would get-- this

183
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:47,670
would just be 1 plus 1 over n
plus 1 over-- everything else

184
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,460
would have a 1 over n in it,
and this would just be a 1.

185
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,640
And if you took the limit as
you approach infinity, then all

186
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,910
of these other terms would be
zero and you'd be

187
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,250
left with 1/1.

188
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,140
But either way, you have the
same degree in the top and the

189
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:01,340
bottom, and their coefficients
are the same, so the limit as n

190
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,100
approaches infinity of this is
1, which is a nice

191
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,320
simplification.

192
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:12,670
So you end up with 1 times
lambda k over k factorial.

193
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,660
Now what's the limit as n
approaches infinity of

194
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,300
this thing right here?

195
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,120
1 minus lambda over n to the n.

196
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,350
Well, in the last video we
showed that it would be--

197
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,270
I'll write it right here.

198
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:30,850
That the limit as n approaches
infinity of 1 plus a over n to

199
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,560
the n is equal to e to the a.

200
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,320
That's exactly what we have
you here, but instead of an

201
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,675
a we have a minus lambda.

202
00:09:38,675 --> 00:09:41,590
   

203
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:46,850
So this is going to be equal
to e to the minus lambda.

204
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,770
We have a minus lambda
instead of an a.

205
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:51,070
And then finally, what's the
limit as n approaches infinity?

206
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,840
Let me write it a
little bit neater.

207
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,880
I'm just rewriting this term.

208
00:09:53,880 --> 00:10:00,590
1 minus lambda over n
to the minus k power.

209
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,980
What happens as n
approaches infinity?

210
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,200
Well, this term,
lambda's a constant.

211
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,050
As this approaches infinity,
this term's going

212
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:08,970
to approach 0.

213
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,430
So you have 1 to the minus k.

214
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:14,240
1 to any power is 1, so
that term becomes 1.

215
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,840
So we have another 1 there.

216
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,930
So there you have it.

217
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,510
We're done.

218
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:23,480
The probability that our random
variable, the number of cars

219
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,150
that passes in an hour, is
equal to a particular number.

220
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,880
You know, it's equal to
7 cars pass in an hour.

221
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,470
Is equal to the limit as n
approaches infinity of n choose

222
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:41,660
k times-- well, we said it was
lambda over n to the k

223
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,600
successes times 1 minus
lambda over n to the

224
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,900
n minus k failures.

225
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:51,070
And we just showed that this is
equal to lambda to the kth

226
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:57,010
power over k factorial times
e to the minus lambda.

227
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,680
And that's pretty neat because
when you just see it in kind of

228
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,590
a vacuum-- if you have no
context for it, you wouldn't

229
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,560
guess that this is in any
way related to the

230
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,340
binomial theorem.

231
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,000
I mean, it's got an e in there.

232
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,890
It's got a factorial, but a lot
of things have factorials in

233
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:12,170
life, so not clear that
that would make it

234
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:12,750
a binomial theorem.

235
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,445
But this is just the limit as
you take smaller and smaller

236
00:11:15,445 --> 00:11:17,730
and smaller intervals, and the
probability of success in each

237
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,680
interval becomes smaller.

238
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,620
But as you take the limit
you end up with e.

239
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,410
And if you think about it it
makes sense because one of our

240
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,660
derivations of e actually came
out of compound interest and we

241
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,190
kind of did something
similar there.

242
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,620
We took smaller and smaller
intervals of compounding and

243
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,650
over each interval we
compounded by a much

244
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,220
smaller number.

245
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,060
And when you took the
limit you got e again.

246
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,330
And that's actually where
that whole formula up here

247
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,960
came from to begin with.

248
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,940
But anyway, just so that you
know how to use this thing.

249
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,080
So let's say that I were to go
out, I'm the traffic engineer,

250
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,850
and I figure out that
on average, 9 cars

251
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:50,810
passed per hour.

252
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,950
   

253
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:58,570
And I want to know the
probability that-- so this

254
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,920
is my expected value.

255
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,910
In a given hour, on average,
9 cars are passing.

256
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:06,100
So I want to know the
probability that 2 cars

257
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,110
pass in a given hour,
exactly 2 cars pass.

258
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:14,290
That's going to be equal to 9
cars per hour to the 2'th power

259
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,850
or squared, to the 2'th power.

260
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:23,030
Divided by 2 factorial times
e to the minus 9 power.

261
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:31,650
So it's equal to 81 over 2
times e to the minus 9 power.

262
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,010
And let's see, maybe I should
just get the graphing

263
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:35,810
calculator out.

264
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:38,170
Well, I'll let you do that
exercise to figure out what

265
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:41,220
that is, but I'll see
you in the next video.
