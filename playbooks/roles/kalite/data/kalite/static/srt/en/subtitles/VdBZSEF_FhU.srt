1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,380
We're on problem 65.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:16,410
They wrote 2, 4, 6, 8, n, 3, 5, 7, and 9.

3
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,460
And they tell us, in the list above, if n is an integer

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,610
between 1 and 10, inclusive-- so that means n could be 1,

5
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:27,600
and it could be 10, or any number inbetween,

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:33,700
and it's an integer-- then the median must be-- the median,

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,930
right, not the mean, the median.

8
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,010
So the median means the middle number, right?

9
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:43,330
Let's put all the other numbers in order.

10
00:00:43,330 --> 00:01:01,770
So we have 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

11
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,770
And they're essentially saying that

12
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,970
n could be anywhere in this.

13
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,240
It could be a 1 here, it could be right here,

14
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,740
it could be another 2, it doesn't tell us.

15
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,480
It could be any number,

16
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,130
it could be 2, could be another 3, could be 10.

17
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:15,860
We don't know.

18
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,030
But before we stick n in here, let's figure out

19
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,360
what the middle is.

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,270
Right here we have eight numbers,

21
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,350
so the middle of the range is actually--

22
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,450
there is no middle number-- but when we add n,

23
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:30,540
there will be a middle number.

24
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,750
So let's just think about it for a little bit.

25
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:39,100
If n is 5 or less, so n goes into this bucket,

26
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,270
n goes someplace here, then what happens?

27
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,640
Then what becomes the middle number?

28
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,560
If n is 5 or less, then we'll have n here.

29
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,710
And n might be 5, n might go right here.

30
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,020
But what becomes the middle number?

31
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,520
Then we have 1, 2, 3, 4 on this side of the middle number,

32
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,500
and we have 1, 2, 3, 4 on that side of the number.

33
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,390
So then, the median, which is the middle number, becomes 5.

34
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,940
That's if n is 5 or less.

35
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,010
If n is less than or equal to 5,

36
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:12,970
then we know that the median will be equal to 5.

37
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,400
Now let's do the opposite thought experiment.

38
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,130
What if n is 6 or more?

39
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,600
What if n is greater than or equal to 6?

40
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,450
So it goes someplace over here,

41
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,210
so n will go someplace here.

42
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,070
Could be 6, I might have to put it right there.

43
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,870
But wherever I put it on the side, I'll have 4 to the right

44
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,950
of 6, and I'll have 4 to the left of 6.

45
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,400
n isn't on this side anymore, 4 to the left of 6.

46
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,180
So then the median would be 6.

47
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,090
And either of these cases have to be true for n.

48
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:47,930
So the median is either 5 or 6, and that is choice B.

49
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,750
Problem 66.

50
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,320
I like this brownish color.

51
00:02:53,320 --> 00:03:01,940
Reminds me of when I was in middle school math competitions.

52
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:11,830
4u7, n23, 162.

53
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:19,090
And you add them all together, you get one 1,222.

54
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,850
And what they want to know is,

55
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,280
if n and u represent single digits

56
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,130
in the correctly worked computation above,

57
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,040
what is the value of n plus u?

58
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,990
So the best thing to do is to try to work these out,

59
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,870
and see what happens.

60
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:35,610
So 7 plus 3 is 10, plus 2 is 12.

61
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,770
So you would write a 2 here,

62
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,230
which they already wrote, and carry a 1.

63
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,680
And now we have 1 plus u--

64
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,690
let me write this down--

65
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:51,650
1 plus u plus 2 plus 6 is equal to,

66
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,270
well, it's either going to be equal to 2,

67
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,580
or some digit and a 2.

68
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,000
So let's just think about it a little bit.

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,340
1 plus u plus 2 plus 6, that's equal to u plus 9.

70
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:08,590
u plus 9 is going to have to equal something.

71
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:14,630
So if u is 9, and it has to be something that ends with a 2.

72
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:20,000
And remember, u can only be between 0 and 9.

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,480
It's a digit, it has to be an integer, it has to be a digit.

74
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,150
So let's think about it a little bit.

75
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,120
It has to be something that ends in a 2.

76
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,350
So the only next thing above 9 that ends as a 2 is 12.

77
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,850
Because you can't get to 22.

78
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,530
To get to 22, you would have to add 13,

79
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,770
and u can't be 13.

80
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:42,340
So this has to be a 12, so u has to be equal to 3.

81
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,770
That's the only possibility that'll give you something

82
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:45,850
that ends in a 2.

83
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,260
So if we assume that u is 3,

84
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:53,300
then we have 1 plus 3 plus 2 plus 6, which is 12,

85
00:04:53,300 --> 00:05:03,780
carry the 1, you get 1 plus 4 plus n plus 1 is equal to 12.

86
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,640
So you get 1 plus 4 plus 1.

87
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:12,290
That's 6, plus n is equal to 12, and n would be equal to 6.

88
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:15,170
And they want to know what n plus u is.

89
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,890
So n plus u, 6 plus 3.

90
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:18,860
That's equal to 9.

91
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,950
And that is choice B, 9.

92
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:27,340
67.

93
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:36,090
Look at that, this is a dense looking one,

94
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,820
but let me write down the little equation they wrote on top.

95
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:47,340
r is equal to 400 times d plus s minus p,

96
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,520
all of that over p.

97
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:56,080
If stock is sold three months after it is purchased,

98
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,120
the formula above relates p, d, s, and r,

99
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,500
where p is the purchase price of the stock.

100
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,030
That's the purchase price.

101
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,950
d is the amount of any dividend received.

102
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,150
Fair enough.

103
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,510
s is the selling price of the stock,

104
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:14,540
and r is the yield of the investment as a percent.

105
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,380
Fair enough.

106
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:21,980
If Rose purchased $400 worth of stock-- so p is equal to

107
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:27,430
$400-- received a $5 dividend-- so d is equal to

108
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:35,630
$5-- and sold the stock for $420, for three months after

109
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,540
purchasing-- so this formula applies,

110
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,800
because this is the formula for selling after three months--

111
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,900
what was the

112
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,990
yield of her investment, according to the formula?

113
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,580
Assuming she paid no commissions.

114
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,610
We just substitute in.

115
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,600
So let's see.

116
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:57,540
The yield would be equal to 400 times 5 plus 420 minus 400,

117
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:01,470
p is 400, all of that over 420.

118
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:06,810
That is equal to 420 minus 400 is 20, plus 5 is 25.

119
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:17,810
400 times 25 over-- this shouldn't be 420, this is p.

120
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,300
The price you paid was 400.

121
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,290
25 over 400.

122
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:26,420
I just substituted these values into this equation.

123
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:31,530
This cancels out, and I'm just left with a yield of 25,

124
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,990
and it's probably in terms of percent.

125
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,290
Yep, 25%.

126
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,020
E.

127
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,300
All right, problem 68.

128
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,290
Let's switch colors.

129
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,520
68.

130
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,790
The temperatures in degree Celsius recorded at 6:00

131
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:52,520
in the morning in various parts of a certain country were

132
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,270
10 degrees,

133
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,290
I'm not going to write all of it, 5,

134
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:02,410
minus 2, minus 1, minus 5, and 15.

135
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:06,140
What is the median of these temperatures?

136
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,930
The median just means the middle.

137
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,480
Don't confuse that with the average, which is the mean.

138
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,330
Or the mean, which is the average.

139
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,410
Median means middle,

140
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,930
so let's just put them in order and figure out the middle.

141
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:18,720
So the smallest of these numbers is minus 5, cross it out.

142
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,110
Then we have minus 2, cross it out.

143
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,130
Then we have minus 1, cross it out.

144
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:31,640
Then we have 5, cross it out, then we have 10, cross it out.

145
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,300
Then we have 15.

146
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:37,880
So this is interesting about median.

147
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,880
If there is no true middle number,

148
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,050
you have three on this side of negative 1,

149
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,610
or negative 1 and less, and you have three on that side,

150
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,290
so there's no middle number,

151
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,870
because we have an even number of numbers.

152
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,460
So what you want to do is, you take the two middle numbers,

153
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,450
which are negative 1 and 5, and you average them.

154
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:58,980
So it's negative 1 plus 5 over 2, which equals 4 over 2,

155
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,060
which is equal to 2.

156
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,290
2 degrees Celsius, which is choice C.

00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,790
Problem 69.

158
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:19,130
If y times 3x minus 5 over 2 is equal to y,

159
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:25,290
and y does not equal 0, then x is equal to what?

160
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,570
Well the simplest thing, since y doesn't equal 0,

161
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,720
we can divide both sides of this equation by y.

162
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,510
You divide both sides by y. y divided by y is 1,

163
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,390
y divided by y is 1.

164
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:40,340
So then we're left with 3x minus 5 over 2 is equal to 1.

165
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:46,000
Multiply both sides by 2, you get 3x minus 5 is equal to 2.

166
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,440
Add 5 to both sides, 3x is equal to 7.

167
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,390
And you get x is equal to 7 over 3, which is choice C.

168
00:09:55,390 --> 00:10:00,090
And I'm out of time, so I'll see you in the next video.
