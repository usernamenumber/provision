1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,020
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:06,010
We're now starting section eight on page 547.

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,040
OK. And I think we're in the third test.

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,050
So problem number one,

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,010
if e is a set of even numbers--even integers,

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,280
sorry-- e is a set of even integers,

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,420
p is a set of positive integers,

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,010
and f is a set of integers less than 5,

9
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,060
which of the following integers will be

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,970
in all three sets?

11
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,140
So we're looking for something that meets all the constraints

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,530
So it has to be even,

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
it has to be positive,

14
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,010
and it has to be less than 5.

15
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,080
OK, so choice A is 6. 6 is not less than 5.

16
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,000
Choice B is 4.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,080
4 is even, 4 is positive,4 is less than 5.

18
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,050
So the answer is B.

19
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:57,040
And the other choices don't work because, C,1 is odd.

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,040
D, 0 is not positive.

21
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,070
And the last choice,E, negative 2.

22
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,080
Well, that's not positive either.

23
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:13,020
So our answer was B.Choice B was 4

24
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,070
Problem number two.

25
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:21,070
If 8 plus the square root of k is equal to 15,

26
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,040
then what does k equal?

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,630
Well, subtract 8 from both sides,

28
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,050
and you get square root of k is equal to 7.

29
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:34,030
Square both sides,k is equal to 49.

30
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,080
Next problem.

31
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,070
Problem number three.

32
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:42,010
Let's see If I can clear image.

33
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,000
Problem number three.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,060
In a poll, 35 people were in favor of building a new library.

35
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,020
So 35, yes, they want it.

36
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,070
14, against it. 14 said no.

37
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,050
And 1 person doesn't know.

38
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,050
1 person just has no opinion.

39
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:07,920
What fraction of those polled were in favor of

40
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,040
building a new library.

41
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,020
So the people that were in favor were 35.

42
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,450
And the fraction of the total people polled--

43
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:22,050
so the total people polled was 35 plus 14 plus 1, right?

44
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:29,010
And what is this? That's 50. So that's equal to 35 over 50.

45
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,390
And 35 over 50, if we divide the top and bottom by 7,

46
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:38,090
you get 7/10. So the answer is A.

47
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:43,080
7/10 were in favor of the library.Problem number four

48
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,050
We've got a kind of crazy looking figure here.

49
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,810
You have a line that goes something like this,

50
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:58,060
and it goes like that and then it goes like this and looks

51
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:04,000
something like that. Close enough. And what's going on here?

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,030
So they tell us that this angle is 70. That's 70. This is 30.

53
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,040
They say that this is t and this is u.

54
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,080
You probably can't read that but you see

55
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,080
it in your own book.

56
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,030
In the figure above, what is the value of t plus u?

57
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,060
This is the angle game again.

58
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,030
Let's see what angles we can figure out.

59
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,060
So, this is 70, this is 30.

60
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,020
So this angle right here plus 70, plus 30 has

61
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,000
to equal 180, right?

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,040
This angle plus 70, plus 30. 70 plus 30 is 100.

63
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,040
So this is 80 degrees right here. If this is 80 degrees,

64
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,030
this is the opposite angle to 80 degrees.

65
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,020
So that's going to also be 80 degrees.

66
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,040
We learned that in geometry class.

67
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,250
And so if this is 80 degrees-- first of all,

68
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,550
what do all of these angles combined equal?

69
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:55,020
t plus u, plus 80 are all on the same triangle.

70
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,090
So they have to add up to 180.

71
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:01,290
So we know that t plus u has to be 100 degrees,

72
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:07,030
and that's choice C. Next problem.

73
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:12,030
OK, problem number five. Oh, there's a big graph.

74
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,590
According to the graph above,

75
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,770
between which two consecutive years was

76
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,050
the greatest change in the price of coffee?

77
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,040
Oh, I think I'm going to have to draw this.

78
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,030
Just so that you see what I see, hopefully.

79
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,090
OK, and then let me just write the years.

80
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,000
So this is, it goes'81 through '86.

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So '81, '82, '83,'84, '85, '86.

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,210
Let's see, in 1981-- so let's see,

83
00:04:42,210 --> 00:05:01,040
we have $3.00, $3.75,we have $4.00,$4.25,$4.50,$4.75.

84
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,060
In 1981 it cost $3.75.

85
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,050
It's going to take me a little time to draw this whole thing.

86
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:13,020
In 1982 it was at $3.50.

87
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,000
Oops, that's $3.50 down here, not $3.00.

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,010
Let me write that,that's $3.50.

89
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:28,060
Back to what I was doing. In 1983 it went to $4.25.

90
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:35,090
In 1984 it went all the way to $4.75.

91
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:41,000
In 1985 it was at $3.75 again.

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,010
That looks something like that.

93
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:51,060
And then 1986 goes to $4.50. 1986, $4.50.

94
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,040
OK, and what are they asking us? According to

95
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,060
the graph above,between which two consecutive

96
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,070
years was the greatest change in the price of coffee?

97
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,090
Well, let's figure that out.

98
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:05,090
So here, the change is $0.25.

99
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:09,130
Here, the change, going from this year to this year,

100
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,090
is-- let's see, $0.25,$0.50, $0.75.

101
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:16,040
That's a good contender right there. $0.75.

102
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:22,050
Going from here to here we only had a $0.50 change.

103
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,590
Then we went from $4.75 to $3.50.

104
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,090
So this is a pretty big change, actually.

105
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,020
This looks like our winner.

106
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,000
That's from $4.75 to actually $3.75, so

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,070
this is a $1.00 change.

108
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:37,000
And then we went from $3.75to $4.50,

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,080
so we had a $0.75change again.

110
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,410
So the biggest change happened from 1984 to 1985, choice D.

111
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:48,060
All that work for a fairly straightforward problem.

112
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:54,000
Next problem. Problem number six.

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
More drawing for me. OK.

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:05,010
let's see,more drawing.Got to be focused,Sal, focused

115
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:14,630
This is negative 1, this is negative 2,

116
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:19,080
this is 1, this is 2. 1 and 2.

117
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,080
And what does this graph look like?

118
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:27,570
Let's see, we go from here to here,

119
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:31,470
it looks like, and then we stay flat here,

120
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:38,050
and then we go like this, and then we go flat again.

121
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,050
And what are they asking?

122
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,050
The graph of y equals g of x.

123
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:46,000
So this is y is equal to g of x.

124
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,020
Shown above.

125
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:51,270
If g of k is equal to 1,

126
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,090
which of the following is a possible value of k?

127
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,040
So g of k is equal to 1.

128
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,070
So when does this graph equal 1?

129
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:00,830
Well, this graph equals 1--add a different color--

130
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,000
it equals 1 here-- oh,it equals 1 here.

131
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,090
It equals 1 this entire period, right?

132
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:12,040
All of these values are where g of x is equal to 1.

133
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,170
So what could be the values of k?

134
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,050
Well, the values of k could be anywhere between

135
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,050
negative 1 and 0.

136
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,000
All of those could be values of k, anywhere from here.

137
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,020
Because at all of these values,g of k is equal to 1.

138
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,050
So let's see. They have choices. Minus 1.5 is here.

139
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:34,000
No, that's over there. Minus 0.5 is right here.

140
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,260
And g of minus 0.5 is right here, so that's 1.

141
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,070
g of minus 0.5 is equal to 1.

142
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:47,090
So that looks pretty good. So that is our answer. Choice B.

143
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:51,090
Let's see if I can squeeze in problem number seven.

144
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:54,930
I think that would be the most videos I've ever done-

145
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:57,030
most problems in 10 minutes.

146
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:02,870
If a,b and c are different positive integers,

147
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:06,410
and 2 to the a,times 2 to the b, times 2 to the c,

148
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:10,850
is equal to 64, then they want to know,

149
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:17,060
what is 2 to the a, plus 2 to the b, plus 2 to the c?

150
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,040
Fascinating.

151
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,030
Well, what do we know about exponent rules?

152
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:24,570
2 to the a, times 2 to the b,times 2 to the c,

153
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:32,050
that's 2 to the a, plus b, plus c, right?

154
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:35,010
2 to the what power is 64?

155
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:38,020
2 to the sixth power, right?

156
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,050
2 to the sixth power is 64.

157
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,000

158
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,010

159
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:49,080
I only have 15 seconds left. See you soon.
