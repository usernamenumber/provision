1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,380
   

2
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,440
In the last video, I introduced
you to what is

3
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,850
probably the most bizarro
function that you've

4
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:05,950
encountered so far.

5
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,235
And that was the Dirac
delta function.

6
00:00:09,235 --> 00:00:13,530
   

7
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,190
And I defined it to be--
and I'll do the

8
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,400
shifted version of it.

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,970
You're already hopefully
reasonably familiar with it.

10
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,380
So Dirac delta of t minus c.

11
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:31,370
We can say that it equals 0,
when t does not equal c, so it

12
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,775
equals 0 everywhere, but it

13
00:00:33,775 --> 00:00:35,450
essentially pops up to infinity.

14
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,470
And we have to be careful
with this infinity.

15
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,760
I'm going to write
it in quotes.

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,970
It pops up to infinity.

17
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:42,700
And we even saw in the previous
video, it's kind of

18
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,100
different degrees of infinity,
because you can still multiply

19
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,510
this by other numbers to get
larger Dirac delta functions

20
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,560
when t is equal to c.

21
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,170
But more important than this,
and this is kind of a

22
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,750
pseudodefinition here, is the
idea that when we take the

23
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,860
integral, when we take the area
under the curve over the

24
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,839
entire x- or the entire t-axis,
I guess we could say,

25
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:08,730
when we take the area under this
curve, and obviously, it

26
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:13,890
equals zero everywhere except
at t is equal to c, when we

27
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,930
take this area, this is the
important point, that the area

28
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,180
is equal to 1.

29
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,630
   

30
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,830
And so this is what I meant by
pseudoinfinity, because if I

31
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:32,730
have 2 times the Dirac delta
function, and if I'm taking

32
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:37,140
the area under the curve of
that, of 2 times the Dirac

33
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,370
delta function t minus c dt,
this should be equal to 2

34
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:46,410
times-- the area of just under
the Dirac delta function 2

35
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,570
times from minus infinity to
infinity of the delta function

36
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:55,120
shifted by c dt, which is just
2 times-- we already showed

37
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,090
you, I just said, by definition,
this is 1, so this

38
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,060
will be equal to 2.

39
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,620
So if I put a 2 out here, this
infinity will have to be twice

40
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,370
as high, so that the
area is now 2.

41
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,870
That's why I put that infinity
in parentheses.

42
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,180
But it's an interesting
function.

43
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,100
I talked about it at the end of
the last video that it can

44
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,720
help model things that kind of
jar things all of a sudden,

45
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,970
but they impart a fixed amount
of impulse on something and a

46
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,010
fixed amount of change
in momentum.

47
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,660
And we'll understand that a
little bit more in the future.

48
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,300
But let's kind of get the
mathematical tools completely

49
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:30,720
understood.

50
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,590
And let's try to figure out what
the Dirac delta function

51
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,200
does when we multiply it, what
it does to the Laplace

52
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,550
transform when we multiply
it times some function.

53
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:42,105
So let's say I have my Dirac
delta function and I'm going

54
00:02:42,105 --> 00:02:43,170
to shift it.

55
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,560
That's a little bit
more interesting.

56
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,480
And if you want to unshift
it, you just say, OK,

57
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,440
well, c equals 0.

58
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,030
What happens when c equals 0?

59
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:52,520
And I'm going to shift it and
multiply it times some

60
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,720
arbitrary function f of t.

61
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,590
If I wanted to figure out the
Laplace transform of just the

62
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,800
delta function by itself,
I could say f of

63
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,390
t is equal to 1.

64
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:08,020
So let's take our Laplace
transform of this.

65
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,220
And we can just use the
definition of the Laplace

66
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:16,740
transform, so this is equal to
the area from 0 to infinity,

67
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:21,510
or we could call it the integral
from 0 to infinity of

68
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,340
e to the minus -- that's just
part of the Laplace transform

69
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,095
definition-- times this thing--
and I'll just write it

70
00:03:27,095 --> 00:03:31,080
in this order-- times
f of t times

71
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,960
our Dirac delta function.

72
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,600
Delta t minus c and times dt.

73
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,360
   

74
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,090
Now, here I'm going to
make a little bit of

75
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,670
an intuitive argument.

76
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,760
A lot of the math we do is kind
of-- especially if you

77
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,410
want to be very rigorous and
formal, the Dirac delta

78
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,660
function starts to break down a
lot of tools that you might

79
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,170
have not realized it would
break down, but I think

80
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,920
intuitively, we can still
work with it.

81
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,425
So I'm going to solve this
integral for you intuitively,

82
00:04:00,425 --> 00:04:02,990
and I think it'll
make some sense.

83
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,380
So let's draw this.

84
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,790
Let me draw this, what
we're trying to do.

85
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,310
So let me draw what we're
trying to take

86
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,375
the integral of.

87
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,600
And we only care from zero to
infinity, so I'll only do it

88
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,610
from zero to infinity.

89
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,820
And I'll assume that c is
greater than zero, that the

90
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,560
delta function pops
up someplace in

91
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,870
the positive t-axis.

92
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,620
So what is this first part
going to look like?

93
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,610
What is that going to look
like? e to the minus

94
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,780
st times f of t?

95
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,220
I don't know.

96
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,460
It's going to be some function.
e to the minus st

97
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,320
starts at 1 and drops down, but
we're multiplying it times

98
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,270
some arbitrary function, so I'll
just draw it like this.

99
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,510
Maybe it looks something
like this.

100
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:45,570
This right here is e to the
minus st times f of t.

101
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:48,860
And the f of t is what kind of
gives it its arbitrary shape.

102
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,200
Fair enough.

103
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,110
Now, let's graph our Dirac
delta function.

104
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,980
With zero everywhere except
right at c, right at c right

105
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,840
there, it pops up infinitely
high, but we only draw an

106
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,540
arrow that is of height 1 to
show that its area is 1.

107
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,260
I mean, normally when you graph
things you don't draw

108
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,110
arrows, but this arrow shows
that the area under this

109
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,290
infinitely high thing is 1.

110
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,260
So we do a 1 there.

111
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,630
So if we multiply this, we care
about the area under this

112
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,410
whole thing.

113
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:21,120
When we multiply these two
functions, when we multiply

114
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,050
this times this times the delta
function, this is-- let

115
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:24,570
me write this.

116
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,800
This is the delta function
shifted to c.

117
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,950
If I multiply that times
that, what do I get?

118
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:34,060
This is kind of the key
intuition here.

119
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,410
Let me redraw my axes.

120
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,500
Let me see if I can do it
a little bit straighter.

121
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,930
Don't judge me by the
straightness of my axes.

122
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,260
So that's t.

123
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,480
So what happens when I
multiply these two?

124
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,480
Everywhere, when t equals
anything other than c, the

125
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,570
Dirac delta function is zero.

126
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,290
So it's zero times anything.

127
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,560
I don't care what this function
is going to do, it's

128
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,920
going to be zero.

129
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,760
So it's going to be zero
everywhere, except something

130
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,050
interesting happens at
t is equal to c.

131
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,110
At t equals c, what's the
value of the function?

132
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,000
Well, it's going to
be the value of

133
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,070
the Dirac delta function.

134
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,760
It's going to be the Dirac delta
function times whatever

135
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,030
height this is.

136
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:23,410
This is going to be this point
right here or this right

137
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,530
there, that point.

138
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:30,030
This is going to be this
function evaluated at c.

139
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,830
I'll mark it right here on the
y-axis, or on the f of t,

140
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,950
whatever you want to call it.

141
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:39,765
This is going to be e to the
minus sc times f of c.

142
00:06:39,765 --> 00:06:42,970
All I'm doing is I'm just
evaluating this function at c,

143
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,150
so that's the point
right there.

144
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,180
So if you take this point, which
is just some number, it

145
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,840
could be 5, 5 times this, you're
just getting 5 times

146
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,140
the Dirac delta function.

147
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,540
Or in this case, it's not 5.

148
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,930
It's this little more
abstract thing.

149
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,660
I could just draw
it like this.

150
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,080
When I multiply this thing times
my little delta function

151
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,260
there, I get this.

152
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:08,560
The height, it's a delta
function, but it's scaled now.

153
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,420
It's scaled, so now my
new thing is going

154
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,950
to look like this.

155
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:17,080
If I just multiply that times
that, I essentially get e to

156
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,820
the minus sc times f of c.

157
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,240
This might look like some fancy
function, but it's just

158
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,600
a number when we consider
it in terms of t.

159
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,240
s, it becomes something when we
go into the Laplace world,

160
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,250
but from t's point of view,
it's just a constant.

161
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,100
All of these are just constants,
so this might as

162
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,430
well just be 5.

163
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:41,060
So it's this constant times my
Dirac delta function, times

164
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,360
delta of t minus c.

165
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,600
When I multiply that thing times
that thing, all I'm left

166
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,680
with is this thing.

167
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,315
And this height is still going
to be infinitely high, but

168
00:07:51,315 --> 00:07:57,070
it's infinitely high scaled in
such a way that its area is

169
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,130
going to be not 1.

170
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,500
And I'll show it to you.

171
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,850
So what's the integral
of this thing?

172
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,980
Taking the integral of this
thing from minus infinity to

173
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,870
infinity, since this thing is
this thing, it should be the

174
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,380
same thing as taking the
integral of this thing from

175
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,710
minus infinity to infinity.

176
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,220
So let's do that.

177
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,500
Actually, we don't have to do
it from minus infinity.

178
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,220
I said from zero to infinity.

179
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:19,850
So if we take from zero to
infinity, what I'm saying is

180
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,390
taking this integral
is equivalent

181
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,160
to taking this integral.

182
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:31,260
So e to the minus sc f of c
times my delta function t

183
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,270
minus c dt.

184
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,179
Now, this thing right here, let
me make this very clear,

185
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:41,280
I'm claiming that this is
equivalent to this.

186
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,530
Because everywhere else, the
delta function zeroes out this

187
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:47,300
function, so we only care about
this function, or e to

188
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,430
the minus st f of t when
t is equal to c.

189
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,810
And so that's why we were able
to turn it into a constant.

190
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,920
But since this is a constant,
we can bring it out of the

191
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,380
integral, and so this is equal
to-- I'm going to go backwards

192
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,860
here just to kind of save space
and still give you these

193
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,120
things to look at.

194
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,690
If we take out the constants
from inside of the integral,

195
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:14,540
we get e to the minus sc times f
of c times the integral from

196
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:21,650
0 to infinity of f
of t minus c dt.

197
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,830
Oh sorry, not f of t minus c.

198
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,520
   

199
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,370
This is not an f.

200
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,380
I have to be very careful.

201
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,000
This is a delta.

202
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,160
Let me do that in a
different color.

203
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,960
I took out the constant terms
there, and it's going to be a

204
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,710
delta of t minus c dt.

205
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,410
   

206
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,760
Let me get the right color.

207
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,350
   

208
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,300
Now, what is this thing
by definition?

209
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,370
This thing is 1.

210
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,420
I mean, we could put it from
minus infinity to infinity, it

211
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,150
doesn't matter.

212
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,170
The only time where it has any
area is right under c.

213
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,110
So this thing is equal to 1.

214
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:01,390
So this whole integral right
there has been reduced to this

215
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:04,040
right there, because this
is just equal to 1.

216
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,460
So the Laplace transform of
our shifted delta function

217
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:13,060
times some other function is
equal to e to the minus sc

218
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,200
times f of c.

219
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,160
Let me write that
again down here.

220
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,650
Let me write it all at once.

221
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:25,590
So the Laplace transform of our
shifted delta function t

222
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:32,900
minus c times some function
f of t, it equals e

223
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,570
to the minus c.

224
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,420
Essentially, we're just
evaluating e to the minus st

225
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,240
evaluated at c.

226
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,110
So e to the minus
cs times f of c.

227
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,420
We're essentially just
evaluating these things at c.

228
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,680
This is what it equals.

229
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,160
So from this we can get a lot
of interesting things.

230
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,080
What is the Laplace transform--
actually, what is

231
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,490
the Laplace transform
of just the plain

232
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,250
vanilla delta function?

233
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:05,880
Well, in this case, we have c
is equal to 0, and f of t is

234
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,880
equal to 1.

235
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,340
It's just a constant term.

236
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,090
So if we do that, then the
Laplace transform of this

237
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:16,095
thing is just going to be e to
the minus 0 times s times 1,

238
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,040
which is just equal to 1.

239
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,740
So the Laplace transform of our
delta function is 1, which

240
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,850
is a nice clean thing
to find out.

241
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,270
And then if we wanted to just
figure out the Laplace

242
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,530
transform of our shifted
function, the Laplace

243
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:35,870
transform of our shifted delta
function, this is just a

244
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,813
special case where f
of t is equal to 1.

245
00:11:37,813 --> 00:11:40,440
   

246
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,870
We could write it times 1, where
f of t is equal to 1.

247
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:47,810
So this is going to be equal to
e to the minus cs times f

248
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:51,840
of c, but f is just a constant,
f is just 1 here.

249
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,670
So it's times 1, or it's
just e to the mine cs.

250
00:11:55,670 --> 00:12:01,550
So just like that, using a kind
of visual evaluation of

251
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,820
the integral, we were able
to figure out the Laplace

252
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,850
transforms for a bunch of
different situations involving

253
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,510
the Dirac delta function.

254
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,400
Anyway, hopefully, you found
that reasonably useful.
