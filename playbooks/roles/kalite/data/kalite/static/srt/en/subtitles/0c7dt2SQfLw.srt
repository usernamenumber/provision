1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
   

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,019
In the last video we defined the
notion of a determinant of

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:05,160
a 2 by 2 matrix.

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,490
So if I have some matrix-- let's
just call it B-- if my

5
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:15,710
matrix B looks like this, if
its entries are a, b, c, d,

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:20,490
we've defined to determinant
of B.

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,910
Which could also be written as
B with these lines around it,

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,840
which could also be written as
the entries of the matrix with

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,690
those lines around
it, a, b, c, d.

10
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,250
And I don't want you to
get these confused.

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,420
This is the matrix when
you have the brackets.

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,930
This is the determinant of the
matrix, when you just have

13
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,360
these straight lines.

14
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:44,760
And this, by definition, was
equal to ad minus bc.

15
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,270
And you saw in the last video,
or maybe you saw in the last

16
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,195
video, what the motivation
for this came from.

17
00:00:49,195 --> 00:00:53,010
When we figured out the inverse
of B, we determined

18
00:00:53,010 --> 00:01:02,500
that it was equal to 1 over ad
minus bc times another matrix,

19
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,110
which was essentially these
two entry swaps, you

20
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,340
got a d and an a.

21
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,190
And then these two entries
made negative, so

22
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:11,140
minus c and minus b.

23
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,930
This was the inverse of B.

24
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,560
And we said, well, when
is this defined?

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,690
This is defined as long as this
character right here does

26
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:20,850
not equal 0.

27
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,150
So you said hey, this looks
pretty important.

28
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,005
Let's call this thing right
there the determinant.

29
00:01:25,005 --> 00:01:31,110
   

30
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:40,000
And then we could say that B is
invertible, if and only if,

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,010
the determinant of B
does not equal 0.

32
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:50,230
Because if it equals 0, then
this formula for your inverse

33
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,080
won't be well defined.

34
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,970
And we just got this from our
technique of creating an

35
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,870
augmented matrix whatnot.

36
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,530
But the big take away is we
defined this notion of a

37
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,120
determinant it for
a 2 by 2 matrix.

38
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,120
Now the next question is, well
that's just a 2 by 2,

39
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,950
everything we do in linear
algebra, we like to generalize

40
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,930
it to higher numbers of
rows and columns.

41
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,980
So the next step, at least--
let's just do baby steps--

42
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,470
let's start with a 3 by 3.

43
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,870
Let's define what its
determinant is.

44
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,750
So let me construct a
3 by 3 matrix here.

45
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,160
Let's say my matrix A is equal
to-- let me just write its

46
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,100
entries-- first row, first
column, first row, second

47
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,460
column, first row,
third column.

48
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:34,920
Then you have a2
1, a2 2, a2 3.

49
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,880
Then you have a3 1, third
row first column, a3

50
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,570
2, and then a3 3.

51
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,730
That is a 3 by 3 matrix.

52
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,280
Three rows and three columns.

53
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,660
This is 3 by 3.

54
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:55,110
I am going to define the
determinant of A.

55
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,630
So this is a definition.

56
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:00,720
I'm going to define the
determinant of this 3 by 3

57
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,010
matrix A as being equal to--
and this is a little bit

58
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,110
convoluted, but you'll get the
hang of it eventually.

59
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,890
In the next several videos we're
just going to do a ton

60
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:08,350
of determinants.

61
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,155
So it just becomes a bit of
second nature to you.

62
00:03:11,155 --> 00:03:13,770
It's a little computationally
intensive sometimes.

63
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,600
But it equals this first row.

64
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:22,080
It equals a1 1 times the
determinant of the matrix you

65
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,020
get, if you get rid of this
guy's column and row.

66
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,650
So if you get rid of this guy's
column and row, you're

67
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,040
left with this matrix here.

68
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:39,040
So times the determinant of the
matrix a2 2, a2 3, a3 2,

69
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,140
and then a3 3.

70
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,010
Just like that.

71
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,490
So that's our first entry
and that's a plus this.

72
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,680
And then I said it's a plus
this, because the next entry's

73
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,330
going to be a minus.

74
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,610
You have a minus this
guy right here.

75
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:59,580
So then you're going to have
minus a1 2 times the matrix

76
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,200
you get if you eliminate
his column and his row.

77
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,210
So times, you're going to get
these entries right there.

78
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:18,660
So a2 1, a2 3, a3 1, and
then you have a3 3.

79
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,089
We're not quite done.

80
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:21,839
You could probably guess with
the next one's going to be.

81
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,550
Then you're going to have a
plus-- let me switch to a

82
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,430
better color-- plus this guy.

83
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:33,210
Plus a1 3 times the determinant
of its-- I guess

84
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,850
you could call it--
its sub-matrix.

85
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:35,930
We'll call it that for now.

86
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,750
So this matrix right here.

87
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:45,680
So a2 1, a2 2, a3 1, a3 2.

88
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,130
This is our definition of the

89
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,860
determinant of a 3 by 3 matrix.

90
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,870
And the motivation is, because
when you take the determinant

91
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,240
of a 3 by 3 it turns out-- I
haven't shown it to you yet--

92
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,590
that the property is the same.

93
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,410
That if the determinant of this
is 0, you will not be

94
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,190
able to find an inverse.

95
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,370
And when I defined determinant
in this way.

96
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,590
If the determinant does not
equal 0, you will be able to

97
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,210
find an inverse.

98
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,200
So that's where this
came from.

99
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,820
And I haven't shown
you that yet.

100
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,540
And I might not show you
because it's super

101
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,230
computational.

102
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,580
It'll take a long time.

103
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,260
It'll be very hairy and I'll
make careless mistakes.

104
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,220
But the motivation comes from
the exact same place as the 2

105
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,430
by 2 version.

106
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,660
But I think what you probably
want to see right now is at

107
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,050
least just this thing applied
to an actual matrix, because

108
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,480
this looks all abstract
right now.

109
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,790
But if we do it with an actual
matrix, you'll actually see

110
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,490
it's not too bad.

111
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:35,430
So let's leave the definition up
there, and let's say that I

112
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:52,820
have the matrix 1, 2, 4, 2, 2,
minus 1, 3, and 4, 0, 1.

113
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,070
So by our definition of a
determinant, the determinant

114
00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:00,410
of this guy right here-- so
let's say I call that matrix

115
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,230
C-- C is equal to that.

116
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:05,140
So if we want to figure out
the determinant of C, the

117
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:09,690
determinant of C is equal to--
I take this guy right here,

118
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:13,260
let me take that 1-- times the
determinant of-- let's just

119
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,180
call it the submatrix,
right here.

120
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:24,990
So we have a minus 1, we
have a 3, we have a 0,

121
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,570
and we have a 1.

122
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,520
Just like that.

123
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,010
Notice, I got rid of
this guy's column

124
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:29,690
and this guy's row.

125
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,865
And I was just left with
minus 1, 3, 0, 1.

126
00:06:31,865 --> 00:06:34,760
   

127
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,460
Next, I take this guy.

128
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,930
And this is the trick.

129
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,160
You have to alternate signs.

130
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,550
If you start with a positive
here, this next one's going to

131
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,690
be a minus.

132
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:49,710
So you're going to have minus 2
times the submatrix-- we can

133
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,250
call it-- if we get rid
of this guy's column

134
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,000
and this guy's row.

135
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,630
So 2, 3, 4, 1.

136
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:59,050
   

137
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,970
I just blanked this out.

138
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:03,310
If I could videotape my finger,
I would cover my

139
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,700
finger over this column right
here and over that row, and

140
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,640
you'd just see a 2,
a 3, a 4, and a 1.

141
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,280
And that's what I
put right there.

142
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,720
And then finally, we went
plus, minus, plus.

143
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,810
So finally, we'll have plus 4
times the determinant of the

144
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:21,200
submatrix, if you get rid of
that row in that column.

145
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,260
So 2, minus 1, 4, 0.

146
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:28,790
   

147
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,660
Now, these are pretty
straightforward.

148
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,660
These are not too
bad to compute.

149
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,350
Let's actually do it.

150
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:37,030
So this is going to be equal
to 1 times what?

151
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,460
Minus 1 times 1.

152
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,130
Let me just write it out.

153
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:44,240
Minus 1 times 1, minus
0 times 3.

154
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,330
This just comes from the
definition of a 2 by 2

155
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:46,820
determinant.

156
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,360
We've already defined that.

157
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:55,300
And then we're going to have
a minus 2 times 2 times 1,

158
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,260
minus 4 times 3.

159
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:03,120
And then finally, we're going to
have a plus 4 times 2 times

160
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:10,165
0 minus minus 1 times 4.

161
00:08:10,165 --> 00:08:13,250
   

162
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,410
I wrote it all out
so you can see.

163
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,320
This thing right here is just
this thing right here.

164
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,560
And then you have
the 4 out front.

165
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,910
This thing right here was just
this thing right here.

166
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:25,380
So it's the determinant of the
2 by 2 submatrix for each of

167
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,350
these guys.

168
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:30,910
And if we compute this, this is
equal to-- minus 1 times 1

169
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,230
is minus 1.

170
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,630
Minus 0, that's 0.

171
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:38,440
So this is a minus 1 times
1, so that's a minus 1.

172
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,950
And then we get-- what
is this equal to?

173
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,580
This right here is 12.

174
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,040
So you get 2 minus 12.

175
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,530
Right?

176
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,280
You get 2 times 1
minus 4 times 3.

177
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,200
So it's minus 10.

178
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,300
So that is equal to minus 10.

179
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,000
And then you have a minus
10 times a minus 2.

180
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,400
So that becomes a
plus 20, right?

181
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,450
Minus 2 times minus 10.

182
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,340
And then finally, in the green,
we have 2 times 0,

183
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,770
that's just a 0.

184
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:11,340
And then you have minus 1 times
4, which is minus 4.

185
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,800
Then you have a minus sign
here, so it's plus 4.

186
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,630
So this all becomes a plus 4.

187
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:21,290
Plus 4 times 4 is
16, so plus 16.

188
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,320
And what do we get when
we add this up?

189
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:29,830
We get 20 plus 16 minus 1.

190
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:33,430
It is equal to 35.

191
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,030
We're done.

192
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:38,570
We found the determinant
of our 3 by 3 matrix.

193
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:41,380
Not too bad.

194
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:47,450
Right there, so that is equal
to the determinant of C.

195
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,040
So the fact that this isn't
0 tells you that C is

196
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,290
invertible.

197
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:55,710
   

198
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,950
In the next video, we'll try
to extend this to n by n

199
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,200
square matrices.

200
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,970
