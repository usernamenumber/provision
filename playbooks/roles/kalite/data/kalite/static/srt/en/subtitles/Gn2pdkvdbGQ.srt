1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,890
   

2
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,770
I'll now show you how
to convert a fraction

3
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:04,920
into a decimal.

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,990
And if we have time, maybe
we'll learn how to do a

5
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,730
decimal into a fraction.

6
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,420
So let's start with, what
I would say, is a fairly

7
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,480
straightforward example.

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,210
Let's start with
the fraction 1/2.

9
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,390
And I want to convert
that into a decimal.

10
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,170
So the method I'm going to
show you will always work.

11
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,850
What you do is you take the
denominator and you divide

12
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,530
it into the numerator.

13
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:25,510
Let's see how that works.

14
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,110
So we take the denominator-- is
2-- and we're going to divide

15
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,280
that into the numerator, 1.

16
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,110
And you're probably saying,
well, how do I divide 2 into 1?

17
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,010
Well, if you remember from the
dividing decimals module, we

18
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,220
can just add a decimal point
here and add some trailing 0's.

19
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,880
We haven't actually changed the
value of the number, but we're

20
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,260
just getting some
precision here.

21
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,700
We put the decimal point here.

22
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,260
   

23
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:50,650
Does 2 go into 1?

24
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:51,280
No.

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,180
2 goes into 10, so we go 2
goes into 10 five times.

26
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,060
5 times 2 is 10.

27
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,050
Remainder of 0.

28
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,150
We're done.

29
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:06,675
So 1/2 is equal to 0.5.

30
00:01:06,675 --> 00:01:10,570
   

31
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,050
Let's do a slightly harder one.

32
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,000
Let's figure out 1/3.

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,190
Well, once again, we take the
denominator, 3, and we divide

34
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,740
it into the numerator.

35
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:25,470
And I'm just going to add a
bunch of trailing 0's here.

36
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,800
3 goes into-- well, 3
doesn't go into 1.

37
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,150
3 goes into 10 three times.

38
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,452
3 times 3 is 9.

39
00:01:32,452 --> 00:01:35,720
Let's subtract, get a
1, bring down the 0.

40
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,700
3 goes into 10 three times.

41
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,700
Actually, this decimal
point is right here.

42
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,710
3 times 3 is 9.

43
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,930
Do you see a pattern here?

44
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,070
We keep getting the same thing.

45
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,350
As you see it's
actually 0.3333.

46
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,830
It goes on forever.

47
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:52,160
And a way to actually represent
this, obviously you can't write

48
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,020
an infinite number of 3's.

49
00:01:54,020 --> 00:02:00,430
Is you could just write 0.--
well, you could write 0.33

50
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,060
repeating, which means that
the 0.33 will go on forever.

51
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,960
Or you can actually even
say 0.3 repeating.

52
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,630
Although I tend to
see this more often.

53
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,840
Maybe I'm just mistaken.

54
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,410
But in general, this line on
top of the decimal means

55
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:17,320
that this number pattern
repeats indefinitely.

56
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:25,210
So 1/3 is equal to 0.33333
and it goes on forever.

57
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:29,770
Another way of writing
that is 0.33 repeating.

58
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:33,400
Let's do a couple of, maybe a
little bit harder, but they

59
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,060
all follow the same pattern.

60
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,890
Let me pick some weird numbers.

61
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,470
   

62
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,890
Let me actually do an
improper fraction.

63
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:49,050
Let me say 17/9.

64
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,160
So here, it's interesting.

65
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,260
The numerator is bigger
than the denominator.

66
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,200
So actually we're going to
get a number larger than 1.

67
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,270
But let's work it out.

68
00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:00,586
So we take 9 and we
divide it into 17.

69
00:03:00,586 --> 00:03:06,000
And let's add some trailing 0's
for the decimal point here.

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,730
So 9 goes into 17 one time.

71
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,260
1 times 9 is 9.

72
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,040
17 minus 9 is 8.

73
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,240
Bring down a 0.

74
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,080
9 goes into 80-- well, we know
that 9 times 9 is 81, so it has

75
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,830
to go into it only eight times
because it can't go

76
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,230
into it nine times.

77
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,010
8 times 9 is 72.

78
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,560
80 minus 72 is 8.

79
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,770
Bring down another 0.

80
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,260
I think we see a
pattern forming again.

81
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,990
9 goes into 80 eight times.

82
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:40,820
8 times 9 is 72.

83
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,350
And clearly, I could keep
doing this forever and

84
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,790
we'd keep getting 8's.

85
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:53,740
So we see 17 divided by 9 is
equal to 1.88 where the 0.88

86
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,080
actually repeats forever.

87
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,200
Or, if we actually wanted to
round this we could say that

88
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,430
that is also equal to 1.--
depending where we wanted

89
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,860
to round it, what place.

90
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,990
We could say roughly 1.89.

91
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,480
Or we could round in
a different place.

92
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,310
I rounded in the 100's place.

93
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,350
But this is actually
the exact answer.

94
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,126
17/9 is equal to 1.88.

95
00:04:15,126 --> 00:04:17,380
I actually might do a separate
module, but how would we write

96
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,730
this as a mixed number?

97
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,030
Well actually, I'm going
to do that in a separate.

98
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,390
I don't want to
confuse you for now.

99
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,380
Let's do a couple
more problems.

100
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,560
   

101
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,980
Let me do a real weird one.

102
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,360
Let me do 17/93.

103
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,710
What does that equal
as a decimal?

104
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,130
Well, we do the same thing.

105
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:45,630
93 goes into-- I make a really
long line up here because

106
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,930
I don't know how many
decimal places we'll do.

107
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,570
   

108
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,220
And remember, it's always the
denominator being divided

109
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,930
into the numerator.

110
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,950
This used to confuse me a lot
of times because you're often

111
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,630
dividing a larger number
into a smaller number.

112
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,580
So 93 goes into 17 zero times.

113
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,080
There's a decimal.

114
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,990
93 goes into 170?

115
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,270
Goes into it one time.

116
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:11,410
1 times 93 is 93.

117
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,370
170 minus 93 is 77.

118
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,980
   

119
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,360
Bring down the 0.

120
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,700
93 goes into 770?

121
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,660
Let's see.

122
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,120
It will go into it, I think,
roughly eight times.

123
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,330
8 times 3 is 24.

124
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,970
8 times 9 is 72.

125
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,730
Plus 2 is 74.

126
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,186
And then we subtract.

127
00:05:42,186 --> 00:05:43,990
10 and 6.

128
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,710
It's equal to 26.

129
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,760
Then we bring down another 0.

130
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,800
93 goes into 26--
about two times.

131
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,020
2 times 3 is 6.

132
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,704
18.

133
00:05:58,704 --> 00:05:59,920
This is 74.

134
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,120
   

135
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,930
0.

136
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,380
So we could keep going.

137
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,030
We could keep figuring
out the decimal points.

138
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,020
You could do this indefinitely.

139
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,090
But if you wanted to at least
get an approximation, you would

140
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:23,490
say 17 goes into 93 0.-- or
17/93 is equal to 0.182 and

141
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,020
then the decimals
will keep going.

142
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,170
And you can keep doing
it if you want.

143
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,650
If you actually saw this on
exam they'd probably tell

144
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:29,640
you to stop at some point.

145
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,650
You know, round it to the
nearest hundredths or

146
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,610
thousandths place.

147
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,550
And just so you know, let's try
to convert it the other way,

148
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,830
from decimals to fractions.

149
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,090
Actually, this is, I
think, you'll find a

150
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,300
much easier thing to do.

151
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:49,810
If I were to ask you what
0.035 is as a fraction?

152
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:56,845
Well, all you do is you say,
well, 0.035, we could write it

153
00:06:56,845 --> 00:07:05,130
this way-- we could write
that's the same thing as 03--

154
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,300
well, I shouldn't write 035.

155
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,700
That's the same
thing as 35/1,000.

156
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,580
And you're probably
saying, Sal, how did

157
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,120
you know it's 35/1000?

158
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,590
Well because we went to 3--
this is the 10's place.

159
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,230
Tenths not 10's.

160
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,360
This is hundreths.

161
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,230
This is the thousandths place.

162
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,890
So we went to 3 decimals
of significance.

163
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:29,260
So this is 35 thousandths.

164
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:38,650
If the decimal was let's
say, if it was 0.030.

165
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,140
There's a couple of ways
we could say this.

166
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,490
Well, we could say, oh well
we got to 3-- we went to

167
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,570
the thousandths Place.

168
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:48,240
So this is the same
thing as 30/1,000.

169
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,610
or.

170
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:55,550
We could have also said, well,
0.030 is the same thing as

171
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:02,710
0.03 because this 0 really
doesn't add any value.

172
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,920
If we have 0.03 then we're only
going to the hundredths place.

173
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:11,100
So this is the same
thing as 3/100.

174
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,160
So let me ask you, are
these two the same?

175
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,330
   

176
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:16,670
Well, yeah.

177
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,680
Sure they are.

178
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,065
If we divide both the numerator
and the denominator of both of

179
00:08:20,065 --> 00:08:24,890
these expressions by
10 we get 3/100.

180
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,220
Let's go back to this case.

181
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,550
Are we done with this?

182
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,120
Is 35/1,000-- I
mean, it's right.

183
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,660
That is a fraction.

184
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,584
35/1,000.

185
00:08:32,584 --> 00:08:35,440
But if we wanted to simplify it
even more looks like we could

186
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,530
divide both the numerator
and the denominator by 5.

187
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,860
And then, just to get
it into simplest form,

188
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:47,280
that equals 7/200.

189
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,020
And if we wanted to convert
7/200 into a decimal using the

190
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:54,150
technique we just did, so we
would do 200 goes into

191
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,120
7 and figure it out.

192
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,170
We should get 0.035.

193
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,650
I'll leave that up to
you as an exercise.

194
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:05,370
Hopefully now you get at least
an initial understanding of how

195
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:09,320
to convert a fraction into a
decimal and maybe vice versa.

196
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,840
And if you don't, just do
some of the practices.

197
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,990
And I will also try to record
another module on this

198
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,880
or another presentation.

199
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,090
Have fun with the exercises.

200
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,808
