1
00:00:02,132 --> 00:00:04,826
I really like this picture that I found. It actually

2
00:00:04,826 --> 00:00:08,465
shows you really neatly where the heart sits in our body

3
00:00:08,465 --> 00:00:12,543
so you can see the heart is surrounded, on both sides, by ribs, right?

4
00:00:12,543 --> 00:00:16,200
And in fact, I didn't draw it in yet, but let me show you where the

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,080
lungs would be. This is the right lung

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,464
and on this side you'd have the left lung. So this is where

7
00:00:23,464 --> 00:00:27,543
your heart sits: between two lungs. And I'm saying

8
00:00:27,543 --> 00:00:31,424
left and right from the perspective of the the person who owns this

9
00:00:31,424 --> 00:00:35,700
heart. So this is their left and right, which is the opposite

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,328
of us if we're looking at it. The heart is actually sitting between the two

11
00:00:39,328 --> 00:00:42,952
lungs within this protective casing that

12
00:00:42,952 --> 00:00:47,072
the ribs are basically there to keep all these important organs

13
00:00:47,072 --> 00:00:51,108
safe. And then below them, so if you draw

14
00:00:51,108 --> 00:00:55,529
this here. Or if I draw it, you can

15
00:00:55,529 --> 00:00:58,606
see now that below all this stuff is

16
00:00:58,606 --> 00:01:02,865
a really really important muscle. So this muscle

17
00:01:02,865 --> 00:01:07,309
people don't talk about this muscle, or this is not the kind of muscle

18
00:01:07,309 --> 00:01:10,847
that you usually see people working on at the gym, but this muscle is called the diaphragm.

19
00:01:10,847 --> 00:01:15,113
So your diaphragm muscle

20
00:01:15,113 --> 00:01:22,841
and your ribs are enclosing a space, right? The diaphragm becomes the floor, and the ribs are kind of the

21
00:01:22,841 --> 00:01:25,686
ceiling and the walls of this space.

22
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:30,188
And if you look at the contents of this space, you'd have your lung

23
00:01:30,188 --> 00:01:33,770
and you'd have your heart. So, this entire space then

24
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:38,856
is called your thorax.

25
00:01:38,856 --> 00:01:42,267
So what exactly does the heart do? Let's actually make a little bit of

26
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:45,836
space now, and bring up a

27
00:01:45,836 --> 00:01:47,770
zoomed in version of the heart.

28
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:53,969
Let me start by orienting you to the heart. This is our right lung

29
00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:58,035
and on the other side we have our left lung. And all this would be

30
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:01,375
inside of the rib cage, but I'm not going to draw that now, because that would

31
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:05,498
make it harder to see the heart itself. So to think

32
00:02:05,498 --> 00:02:09,732
about exactly what the heart does, I think one, kind of neat way to do it is

33
00:02:09,732 --> 00:02:13,434
to actually imagine that you're a cell. So put yourself in the perspective

34
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:17,361
of a cell, and let's say you're a cell hanging out

35
00:02:17,361 --> 00:02:21,195
over here. This is you. And you can

36
00:02:21,195 --> 00:02:25,013
think about any part of the body that you could be. Let's say a little

37
00:02:25,013 --> 00:02:27,977
toe cell. So let's say you're a toe cell

38
00:02:27,977 --> 00:02:32,737
and your job, of course, is to live and be happy,and you've got

39
00:02:32,737 --> 00:02:36,834
near by, a little blood vessel. And in fact, every cell in our body

40
00:02:36,834 --> 00:02:40,791
has a little blood vessel that's near by. And this toe cell

41
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:44,209
is just trying to make a living. And toe

42
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:48,914
cells need certain things, right? They need, for example, let's say oxygen.

43
00:02:48,914 --> 00:02:52,815
I'll write it in white so it's very clear. They need oxygen

44
00:02:52,815 --> 00:02:56,589
and they need nutrients, right?

45
00:02:56,589 --> 00:03:00,429
So cells need certain things to live and be happy.

46
00:03:00,429 --> 00:03:03,938
And on the flip-side, they also make waste. They're in

47
00:03:03,938 --> 00:03:08,269
a sense just like us, they make waste. And that waste could be

48
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:12,525
all sorts of things, and one that kind of jumps to mind is

49
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,197
carbon dioxide (CO2). So carbon dioxide is waste

50
00:03:15,197 --> 00:03:19,394
for this cell. So it's making some

51
00:03:19,394 --> 00:03:23,494
waste and for the moment let's imagine that there's no blood flow.

52
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,044
So, even though there's a blood vessel near by,

53
00:03:26,044 --> 00:03:29,905
really, no flow is happening, so I'll just write "no flow".

54
00:03:29,905 --> 00:03:34,306
So as the little cell

55
00:03:34,306 --> 00:03:38,949
makes waste. That waste, let's draw a little ball right here,

56
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:42,078
it's going to start accumulating, you're going to start collecting more and more of it

57
00:03:42,078 --> 00:03:45,462
since the blood is not really flowing. And it might kind of

58
00:03:45,462 --> 00:03:50,435
end up getting all the way around our toe cell. So our toe cell is getting

59
00:03:50,435 --> 00:03:54,100
swamped, literally getting kind of covered by its own waste.

60
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,759
And on the flip-side, is it getting oxygen or nutrients? No.

61
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:01,945
It's not getting either of these things. So, before very

62
00:04:01,945 --> 00:04:06,133
long, I would say within minutes, our toe cell

63
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:09,637
is thinking, "Well this is not a very happy way to live!" this is

64
00:04:09,637 --> 00:04:13,245
actually really very sad, this is awful. And if this continues

65
00:04:13,245 --> 00:04:17,418
the toe cell would die. So, what a toe

66
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:20,630
cell needs, and what every cell needs, and that could be a finger cell or a

67
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:25,199
skin cell, or really any cell that's living, needs

68
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,349
flow. Right? It needs this blood to be flowing nicely

69
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:31,623
and smoothly. And if there is flow

70
00:04:31,623 --> 00:04:36,244
then you get a very different picture, right? If there's flow then all the sudden all the

71
00:04:36,244 --> 00:04:39,564
waste product is actually now lifted and taken away.

72
00:04:39,564 --> 00:04:43,182
It's flowing away, and it's a little bit like having

73
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:48,294
someone come by and pick up the trash, then you don't have trash all over the house.

74
00:04:48,294 --> 00:04:51,289
So then you have nice flow, and

75
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:56,135
in return, oxygen and nutrients are delivered. So this stuff

76
00:04:56,135 --> 00:04:59,613
gets delivered as well. So, all of the sudden the cell is going to be

77
00:04:59,613 --> 00:05:03,606
very, very happy, and is going to be living just fine.

78
00:05:03,606 --> 00:05:06,977
So, really if you want all of the cells in your body to be living just fine

79
00:05:06,977 --> 00:05:11,414
like this cell here, you really want good flow throughout the

80
00:05:11,414 --> 00:05:15,100
body. And so this is really point number one. Is that you really

81
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,068
need, somehow, to have blood flow moving and pushing

82
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:22,117
blood constantly throught the body. So,

83
00:05:22,117 --> 00:05:27,741
to do this for billions and billions of cells you would need a pretty powerful

84
00:05:27,741 --> 00:05:31,034
pump, right? Something that's going to be able to pull

85
00:05:31,034 --> 00:05:35,281
in all the blood from the body, and then push it back out. And that's what the heart

86
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:39,223
is. I mean at its core, that's exactly what the heart is doing.

87
00:05:39,223 --> 00:05:42,910
It's an amazing pump, pushing blood, so that

88
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,540
you have good blood flow. And so I'm

89
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,524
going to write that on the side as kind of job number one. These are the jobs of the heart.

90
00:05:49,524 --> 00:05:53,479
So jobs, and number one, would be

91
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:56,045
blood flow. And I'll write systemic

92
00:05:56,045 --> 00:06:01,049
flow. Systemic flow. And all

93
00:06:01,049 --> 00:06:05,043
that systemic means is that I'm refering to the entire body. So systemic

94
00:06:05,043 --> 00:06:08,782
when I say that word, I just mean the entire body. All the cells

95
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:12,861
in the body. Now, exactly how that happens actually

96
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:16,508
you can see on this picture. So, here you have a giant

97
00:06:16,508 --> 00:06:20,656
vein, this is a vein, and you have an artery.

98
00:06:20,656 --> 00:06:23,602
This is an artery.

99
00:06:23,602 --> 00:06:28,698
And blood is actually going through the artery, that way.

100
00:06:28,698 --> 00:06:32,938
And it's actually coming into two veins, the one

101
00:06:32,938 --> 00:06:36,820
at the top, this is called the superior, superior just kind of means

102
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,490
at the top. Superior vena cava. That's the

103
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,382
name of the vein. And at the bottom here, you can't see it because

104
00:06:44,382 --> 00:06:48,496
it's on the other side of the heart, but there's another vein called the inferior vena cava.

105
00:06:48,496 --> 00:06:51,522
And these two veins, this is also a vein,

106
00:06:51,522 --> 00:06:57,533
these two veins are actually dragging blood in from all over the body,

107
00:06:57,533 --> 00:06:59,406
into the heart.

108
00:06:59,406 --> 00:07:02,906
And then, when the heart is ready to pump it back out, it goes into this

109
00:07:02,906 --> 00:07:07,256
artery, and the name of it is the aorta.

110
00:07:07,256 --> 00:07:10,827
So if you've heard of the aorta, this is the artery that people

111
00:07:10,827 --> 00:07:14,856
are talking about. So this is how blood comes and gets pumped

112
00:07:14,856 --> 00:07:18,775
around. But this isn't actually the only job of the heart. The job,

113
00:07:18,775 --> 00:07:22,465
the second job of the heart, is actually

114
00:07:22,465 --> 00:07:26,536
also in this picture, and it's called pulmonary flow.

115
00:07:26,536 --> 00:07:30,517
Pulmonary flow. So, what does that

116
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:34,116
mean? Well, we know that cells are expecting

117
00:07:34,116 --> 00:07:39,079
oxygen, right? We know this. And that they have a lot of carbon dioxide

118
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:42,322
waste. Well, it's good to move things around. It's good

119
00:07:42,322 --> 00:07:45,399
to move blood around. But if you actually never got rid of that carbon dioxide

120
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:49,786
or brought in new oxygen, then a cell is not going to be very happy either.

121
00:07:49,786 --> 00:07:53,107
I mean, you can have blood flow, but at some point it's also going to want some oxygen.

122
00:07:53,107 --> 00:07:57,271
And it's going to want to get rid of that carbon dioxide. So, that's where the

123
00:07:57,271 --> 00:08:00,911
lungs come in. So what happens is that the heart, before

124
00:08:00,911 --> 00:08:05,436
sending blood out the aorta, before just dishing it out back into the body,

125
00:08:05,436 --> 00:08:09,411
it actually sends the blood over to the

126
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:12,895
lungs. And it goes over to the left lung, and over to the right lung.

127
00:08:12,895 --> 00:08:17,186
And the blood comes back from the right lung

128
00:08:17,186 --> 00:08:21,280
and the left lung, and gets pushed back into

129
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,629
the heart, and then gets squeezed through the aorta. So there's this

130
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:28,223
actual extra little step here, where blood is going to

131
00:08:28,223 --> 00:08:32,528
and from the lungs, and that's the pulmonary flow.

132
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:36,813
So the final thing you'll notice, if you look at this picture it's hard not to notice,

133
00:08:36,813 --> 00:08:40,196
is that there are these, kind of wriggly looking little

134
00:08:40,196 --> 00:08:44,344
blood vessels all over the heart. And what are these

135
00:08:44,344 --> 00:08:47,030
exactly? I mean, you've got red ones, and blue ones, and

136
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,356
the blue ones are the veins, and the red ones are the arteries

137
00:08:50,356 --> 00:08:55,270
but are they part of the systemic flow, or pulmonary flow, or something else?

138
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:58,476
Well, these vessels, all of them,

139
00:08:58,476 --> 00:09:01,943
together are called coronary vessels.

140
00:09:01,943 --> 00:09:06,929
And so specifically you might hear about

141
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:10,720
a coronary artery, or a coronary vein, but together you can call them

142
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,450
coronary blood vessels. I'll add the word blood here. So these

143
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:18,109
coronary blood vessels are actually serving the heart muscle

144
00:09:18,109 --> 00:09:20,715
itself. I mean remember, the heart

145
00:09:20,715 --> 00:09:24,724
is made up of thousands and thousands, actually tens of thousands of cells

146
00:09:24,724 --> 00:09:29,948
and those cells, just like our toe cell that we drew,

147
00:09:29,948 --> 00:09:33,636
they also need oxygen, nutrients, and have waste.

148
00:09:33,636 --> 00:09:37,223
So, those cells are going to need blood vessels supplying

149
00:09:37,223 --> 00:09:40,319
them as well. So, that's what the coronary blood vessels are. They're literally

150
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:43,835
the blood vessels that go to and serve

151
00:09:43,835 --> 00:09:47,735
the heart. So these are the ones that serve the heart.

152
00:09:47,735 --> 00:09:51,059
Now, if they're serving the heart muscles

153
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:55,616
and the heart cells, then, think about it, would they fit under

154
00:09:55,616 --> 00:09:59,304
the systemic flow, or pulmonary flow? Well if the

155
00:09:59,304 --> 00:10:03,411
main job is to serve the needs of cells, then

156
00:10:03,411 --> 00:10:08,167
the coronary vessels fall under the systmic flow.
