1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,550
   

2
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,380
In the last several videos, we
assumed that the velocity of

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,430
the source, of the object that's
emitting the wave,

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,730
we've assumed that that's less
than the velocity of the wave.

5
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,420
And we saw what happens
with the Doppler

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,670
effect and all of that.

7
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,240
But what I want to do in this
video is not make this

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:18,760
assumption.

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,570
In particular, let's see what
happens, at least, at first

10
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,320
for our formulas, and then get
a conceptual understanding.

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,900
Let's see what happens when the
velocity of the source is

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,040
equal to the velocity
of the wave.

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,790
The first thing we might try to
do is just apply this new

14
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,030
assumption into the formulas
that we had in the last video.

15
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,210
And those formulas were here.

16
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,650
These are the observed period
and frequency for an observer

17
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,980
that's in the direction
of the object.

18
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,100
And if we make this assumption,
that the velocity

19
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,650
of the sound-- and the velocity
of the source-- we're

20
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,110
not necessarily dealing with
soundwaves, although that

21
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,700
might be an easy visualization
for you.

22
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,210
That tends to be how
I visualize it.

23
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,990
But what happens to these
formulas when the velocity of

24
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:07,070
the source is equal to the
velocity of the wave?

25
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,110
If these two quantities are
equal up here, you have

26
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,300
something, subtract the
same thing from it.

27
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,270
This numerator right
here becomes 0.

28
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,880
So it'll turn this whole
thing into being 0.

29
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,440
So the period, or the observed
period, will be 0, which means

30
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,580
you don't have to wait
any time at all

31
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,400
between successive crests.

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,280
The entire waveform just gets
infinitely bunched together.

33
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,290
So it's kind of like
one impulse.

34
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,600
And if we look at the frequency,
we can either look

35
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,000
directly at the formula, and
you'll see, you have something

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,180
divided by 0 right here.

37
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,275
So you can say this is 1 over 0,
or you could just say that

38
00:01:41,275 --> 00:01:44,300
the frequency is 1 over the
period, and you get this thing

39
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,550
that's undefined.

40
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:49,080
   

41
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,980
But if you want to think about,
what does the frequency

42
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:55,120
approach as the velocity of
the source approaches the

43
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,850
velocity of the wave, if this
thing is only a little bit

44
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,340
less that thing, this is going
to be a very, very, very

45
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,770
small, very, very small
positive number.

46
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,300
So when you divide these
quantities by that very, very,

47
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,300
very small positive
number, you're

48
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,350
going to approach infinity.

49
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:14,070
So the frequency is undefined at
the speed, at the velocity

50
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,120
of the wave, but it's going
to approach infinity.

51
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,870
   

52
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:28,100
It will approach infinity as
the source approaches the

53
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,560
velocity of the wave. Not
necessarily a soundwave.

54
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,150
I keep using soundwaves, because
that's how I tend to

55
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:33,930
visualize things.

56
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,450
And we'll talk in future videos
specifically about

57
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:36,563
soundwaves.

58
00:02:36,563 --> 00:02:39,510
And we'll touch on it a little
bit in this video.

59
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,830
So what is this telling us?

60
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,440
Does this make any sense?

61
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,640
And if you think about it, at
least to me, it starts to make

62
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,230
sense just what you saw in the
last couple of videos.

63
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,850
The last couple of videos,
when something was moving

64
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:54,470
slower than the speed
of sound, you had,

65
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,190
OK, I'm here now.

66
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:01,800
And I'm about to release the
next crest. If I go one period

67
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,170
ago, maybe I was right there.

68
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,720
And the crest that I had
released at that time period

69
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,830
maybe has traveled this
far, just like that.

70
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,570
If you go a period before
that, I would

71
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:13,680
have been over there.

72
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,400
And crest that I released then
would have traveled that far.

73
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,850
We saw this in the
last two videos.

74
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,400
And if you go the period
before that, I

75
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,330
would have been there.

76
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,120
And the crest that I would
have released would

77
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,580
have been that far.

78
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,790
This was the whole reason why
the Doppler effect happens.

79
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:32,400
Because the observer sitting
right here-- let me do this in

80
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,890
a separate color-- the observer
sitting right here is

81
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,310
going to experience these crests
more frequently than an

82
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,380
observer sitting out here.

83
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,520
Because the wavelength gets
compressed, because every time

84
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,980
this guy releases a new
crest, or a new cycle,

85
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,510
he has moved forward.

86
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,570
He's moved forward in the
direction of this

87
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,160
motion right here.

88
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,120
So let's think about what
happens when he is exactly

89
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,030
moving at the speed of the wave.
So let's say that the

90
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,930
source is here now.

91
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,200
This is right where he is.

92
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,530
And he's right about to release
a new crest. So where

93
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:07,760
was he at one period ago?

94
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,490
So let's say he was here
one period ago.

95
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,550
   

96
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,990
So one period ago, if he's right
going to release crest

97
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:22,390
or cycle right now,
one period ago, he

98
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,130
released another cycle.

99
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,540
And where has that cycle gone?

100
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,560
Well, we're assuming that the
wave is traveling at the same

101
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,540
velocity as this guy.

102
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,020
But it's going radially
outward.

103
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,260
So whatever he released then,
it will have traveled at the

104
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,260
same velocity as himself.

105
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,210
So it will have gotten
this far.

106
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,280
He released it one period ago,
and that's where he was one

107
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,210
period ago.

108
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,210
Over the course of the next
period, he traveled there and

109
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,990
so did the wave. The wave
also traveled there.

110
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,630
Now, where was this character
two periods ago?

111
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,910
When I talk about the period,
I'm talking about the actual

112
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,490
period of the wave. Every
period, or how long does it

113
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,750
take between similar points
in the cycle?

114
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,210
And I like to think of them as
the crests in the cycle.

115
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,270
So two periods ago,
he was here.

116
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,700
And he released a-- you can
imagine, a pulse, or crest.

117
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,190
And where will that be now?

118
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,940
Well that will have traveled
as far as he did.

119
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,300
He traveled that far,
and so will the

120
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,400
pulse that he released.

121
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,800
It will have traveled-- actually
I have to make it a

122
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,360
little bit more symmetric.

123
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,890
It will have traveled
that far.

124
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:31,310
   

125
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,750
And if you go three periods ago,
I think you get the idea.

126
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,750
If you go three periods
ago, he was here.

127
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:41,650
And he released a pulse then,
or crest, or a cycle of the

128
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,870
wave. And where will
that be now?

129
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,820
Well, it will have traveled
as fast as he's gotten.

130
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,620
So it will have gotten
this far.

131
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,680
   

132
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,830
Of course, it's traveling that
velocity in every direction,

133
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,340
radially outward.

134
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,980
Now think about the situation
for the observer.

135
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,770
Think, in particular, about
the observer who's sitting

136
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,140
right here.

137
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,330
Let's say he's just out of the
way so that this thing doesn't

138
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,600
run into him and kill him,
and what whatever else.

139
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,330
But he's just out of the way,
just enough to experience the

140
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,420
sound, but not directly collide
with this object

141
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,340
that's emitting the-- well, I
shouldn't say sound-- emitting

142
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,410
the wave. I want to be
general right here.

143
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,180
We're not assuming that
this is a soundwave.

144
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,870
What's he going to experience?

145
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,020
Well, he's not going to-- well,
if we assume this is a

146
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,050
soundwave, he's not going to
hear anything until the thing

147
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,200
passes right there.

148
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,770
And right when the thing passes,
it has all of the

149
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,620
sound that it generated coming
with it at exactly

150
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,140
that moment in time.

151
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:40,150
Instead of hearing things
periodically, all of the wave

152
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,630
fronts smack this
guy all at once.

153
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:46,910
And perceptually, instead of
hearing a pitch, because

154
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,570
you're hearing something
periodic, you're just going to

155
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,540
hear a big thump, because all
of that sound energy is

156
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,020
getting to you at
the same time.

157
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:58,150
You're just going
to hear a thump.

158
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,900
Because it's no longer
really a frequency.

159
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,010
All of the energy is coming
to you at the same time.

160
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,400
And when you are talking about
sound, specifically, and

161
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,800
especially, when you are
trans-sonic, which means

162
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,410
you're around the speed of
sound, or parts of you are

163
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,570
above or below the speed of
sound, and you move into

164
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:14,410
supersonic speeds, that's
what people relate

165
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,850
to the sonic boom.

166
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,880
And we're going to talk a little
bit more about that in

167
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,690
the next video and mach numbers,
all that, because I

168
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,110
just find all of that
fascinating.

169
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,510
But I think this is intuitive.

170
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:28,110
Because when you look at this,
everything is just reaching

171
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,660
you at exactly the same time.

172
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,520
And this was the case of
soundwaves, but it would be

173
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,730
true of any type of waves.

174
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:34,266
