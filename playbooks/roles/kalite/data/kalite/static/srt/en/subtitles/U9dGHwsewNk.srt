1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,440
   

2
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's think about what'll
happen if

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,980
we have this molecule.

4
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:03,490
Let's name it.

5
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,940
We have one, two, three,
four, five carbons.

6
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,910
No double bond.

7
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,210
Five tells us pent.

8
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,740
It's pentane, and it has two
groups on the number three

9
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,140
carbon, one, two, three.

10
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,270
It doesn't matter which side
we start counting from.

11
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,160
We have a bromo group, and we
have an ethyl group, two

12
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,520
carbons right there.

13
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:30,470
On the three carbon, we have
three bromo, three ethyl

14
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:31,430
pentane right here.

15
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,190
So we have 3-bromo 3-ethyl
pentane dissolved in a

16
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,330
solvent, in this right here.

17
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:42,420
It's an alcohol and it has
two carbons right there.

18
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,530
Meth eth, so it is ethanol.

19
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,100
This right there is ethanol.

20
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,010
Let's think about what might
happen if we have 3-bromo

21
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,610
3-ethyl pentane dissolved
in some ethanol.

22
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,000
Now ethanol already
has a hydrogen.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,920
It's not super eager to get
another proton, although it

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,740
does have a partial
negative charge.

25
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,790
It is polar.

26
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,800
Oxygen is very electronegative.

27
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,530
It has a partial negative
charge, so maybe it might be

28
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,150
willing to take on another
proton, but doesn't want to do

29
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,320
so very badly.

30
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,760
It's actually a weak base.

31
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,260
Ethanol right here
is a weak base.

32
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,840
It's not strong enough to just
go nabbing hydrogens off of

33
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,520
carbons, like we saw
in an E2 reaction.

34
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,630
It's just going to sit passively
here and maybe wait

35
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,630
for something to happen.

36
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,010
What might happen?

37
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,550
Well, we have this bromo
group right here.

38
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,790
We have this bromine and the
bromide anion is actually a

39
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,230
pretty good leaving group.

40
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,590
It's a fairly large molecule.

41
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,540
It's able to keep that charge
because it's spread out over a

42
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,430
large electronic cloud,
and it's connected

43
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,830
to a tertiary carbon.

44
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,510
This carbon right here.

45
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,230
This carbon right here
is connected to

46
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,050
one, two, three carbons.

47
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:57,670
So if it were to lose its
electron, that electron right

48
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,500
there, it would be-- it might
not like to do it-- but it

49
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,920
would be reasonably stable.

50
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,820
It's within the realm
of possibilities.

51
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,350
It could occur.

52
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:08,280
Maybe in this first step since
bromine is a good leaving

53
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,840
group, and this carbon can be
stable as a carbocation, and

54
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,870
bromine is already more
electronegative-- it's already

55
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,680
hogging this electron-- maybe
it takes it all together.

56
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,940
Let me draw.

57
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,690
Neutral bromine has one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven

58
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,950
valence electrons.

59
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,820
Maybe it swipes this electron
from the carbon, and now it'll

60
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,410
have eight valence electrons
and become bromide.

61
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,150
What happens now?

62
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,610
And of course, the ethanol
did nothing.

63
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,550
It's a weak base.

64
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:40,080
It wasn't strong enough to
react with this just yet.

65
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,400
What is happening now?

66
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,780
This is going to be
the slow reaction.

67
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,340
What I said was that this isn't
going to happen super

68
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,750
fast but it could happen.

69
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,610
This is actually the
rate-determining step.

70
00:02:49,610 --> 00:03:01,910
   

71
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,130
What happens after that?

72
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:07,340
Let me just paste everything
again so this is our set up to

73
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,320
begin with.

74
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,640
But now that this little
reaction occurred, what will

75
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,060
it look like?

76
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,340
The bromine has left so
let me clear that out.

77
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,590
We clear out the bromine.

78
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,380
   

79
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,540
It actually took an electron
with it so it's bromide.

80
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,990
Let me draw it like this.

81
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,300
I'll do it in blue.

82
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,250
This is the bromine.

83
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,810
The bromine is right
over here.

84
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,820
It had one, two, three,
four, five, six,

85
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,200
seven valence electrons.

86
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,800
It swiped this magenta electron
from the carbon, now

87
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,870
it has eight valence
electrons.

88
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,480
It has a negative charge.

89
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:51,000
The carbon lost an electron,
so it has a positive charge

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,080
and it's somewhat stable
because it's a tertiary

91
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,960
carbocation.

92
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,790
Now let's think about
what's happening.

93
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:57,950
And I want to point
out one thing.

94
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,650
In this first step of a
reaction, only one of the

95
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,790
reactants was involved.

96
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,350
This rate-determining, the slow
step of reaction, if this

97
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,600
doesn't occur nothing
else will.

98
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,180
But now that this does
occur everything

99
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,650
else will happen quickly.

100
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,600
In our rate-determining step,
we only had one of the

101
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,880
reactants involved.

102
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,390
It's analogous to the SN1
reaction but what we're going

103
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,810
to see here is that we're
actually eliminating.

104
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,579
We're going to call this
an E1 reaction.

105
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:18,760
We're going to see
that in a second.

106
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,540
Actually, elimination
is already occurred.

107
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,770
The bromide has already left so
hopefully you see why this

108
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,680
is called an E1 reaction.

109
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,590
It's elimination.

110
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,950
E for elimination and the
rate-determining step only

111
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,640
involves one of the reactants
right here.

112
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,550
It didn't involve in this
case the weak base.

113
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:41,310
Now that the bromide has left,
let's think about whether this

114
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,380
weak base, this ethanol, can
actually do anything.

115
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,370
It does have a partial negative
charge over here.

116
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,590
It does have a partial negative
charge and on these

117
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:55,740
ends it has partial positive
charges, so it is somewhat

118
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,680
attracted to hydrogen, or to
protons I should say, to

119
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,810
positive charges.

120
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,730
But not so much that it can
swipe it off of things that

121
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,380
aren't reasonably acidic.

122
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,980
Now that this guy's a
carbocation, this entire

123
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,160
molecule actually now becomes
pretty acidic, which means it

124
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,700
wants to give away protons.

125
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,510
Another way you could view it is
it wants to take electrons,

126
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,830
depending on whether you want
to use the Bronsted-Lowry

127
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,150
definition of acid, or
the Lewis definition.

128
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:27,000
Either way, it wants to
give away a proton.

129
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,750
It could be this one.

130
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,640
It could be that one.

131
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,260
It has excess positive charge.

132
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,850
It wants to get rid of its
excess positive charge.

133
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:36,160
So it's reasonably acidic,
enough so that it can react

134
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,760
with this weak base.

135
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:44,270
What you have now is the
situation, where on this

136
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,310
partial negative charge of this
oxygen-- let me pick a

137
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,870
nice color here-- let's say
this purple electron right

138
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:57,690
here, it can be donated,
or it will swipe

139
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,720
the hydrogen proton.

140
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,770
Then hydrogen's electron
will be taken

141
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,810
by the larger molecule.

142
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,940
In fact, it'll be attracted
to the carbocation.

143
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,120
So it will go to the carbocation
just like that.

144
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,960
Now in that situation,
what occurs?

145
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,890
What's our final product?

146
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:16,890
Let me draw it here.

147
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,770
This part of the reaction is
going to happen fast. The

148
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,750
rate-determining step
happened slow.

149
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,560
The leaving group had
to leave. The

150
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,920
carbocation had to form.

151
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,970
That's not going to happen
super fast but once that

152
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,560
forms, it's not that
stable and then

153
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,030
this thing will happen.

154
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,780
This is fast.

155
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,730
Let me paste everything again.

156
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,710
So now we already
had the bromide.

157
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,960
It had left.

158
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,630
   

159
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,130
Now the hydrogen is gone.

160
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,820
   

161
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:56,230
The hydrogen from that carbon
right there is gone.

162
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:02,890
This electron is still on this
carbon but the electron that

163
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:07,550
was with this hydrogen is now
on what was the carbocation.

164
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:12,710
That electron right here is now
over here, and now this

165
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:16,590
bond right over here,
is this bond.

166
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:21,380
We formed an alkene and now,
what was an ethanol took a

167
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:25,930
hydrogen proton and now becomes
a positive cation.

168
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,390
Let me draw that.

169
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:33,390
So this electron ends
up being given.

170
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,640
It's no longer with
the ethanol.

171
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:40,800
   

172
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,960
It gets given to this
hydrogen right here.

173
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,270
That hydrogen right there.

174
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:53,870
And now they have formed a new
bond and since this oxygen

175
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:57,490
gave away an electron, it now
has a positive charge.

176
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,840
   

177
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,940
And all along, the bromide
anion had left in

178
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,350
the previous step.

179
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:09,150
The bromide anion is floating
around with its eight valence

180
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,950
electrons, one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, and

181
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,950
then it has this one
right over here.

182
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,440
That makes it negative.

183
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,180
Then our reaction is done.

184
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:25,090
We had a weak base and a good
leaving group, a tertiary

185
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,070
carbon, and the leaving
group left.

186
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,550
We only had one of the
reactants involved.

187
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,930
It was eliminated.

188
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:35,080
And then once it was eliminated,
then the weak base

189
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,409
was then able to take a hydrogen
off of this molecule,

190
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:41,760
and that allowed this molecule
to become an alkene, formed a

191
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,690
double bond.

192
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:47,170
This is called, and I already
told you, an E1 reaction.

193
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,100
E for elimination, in this
case of the halide.

194
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,460
One, because the
rate-determining step only

195
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,480
involved one of the molecules.

196
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,460
It did not involve
the weak base.

197
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,890
We'll talk more about this,
and especially different

198
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:03,450
circumstances where you might
have the different types of E1

199
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,830
reactions you could see, which
hydrogen is going to be picked

200
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,500
off, and all the things
like that.

201
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:14,490
And we're going to see with
E1, E2, SN1, and SN2, what

202
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,700
kind of environments or
reactants need to be there for

203
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,640
each one of those to occur in
different circumstances.

204
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,134
