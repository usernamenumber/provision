1
00:00:00,933 --> 00:00:03,113
Let's say we've got company A over here

2
00:00:03,113 --> 00:00:06,682
and it takes out a $1,000,000 loan

3
00:00:06,682 --> 00:00:09,800
and pays a variable interest rate on that loan

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,742
it pays LIBOR plus 2%

5
00:00:13,742 --> 00:00:14,960
and LIBOR stands for:

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,159
London Interbank Offer Rate

7
00:00:17,159 --> 00:00:21,467
it's one of the major benchmarks for variable interest rates

8
00:00:21,467 --> 00:00:23,267
And so it pays that to some lender,

9
00:00:23,267 --> 00:00:27,000
this is the person who lent company A the money

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,175
it pays them a variable interest rate every period

11
00:00:30,175 --> 00:00:32,700
so for example, in period 1

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,883
if LIBOR is at 5%

13
00:00:36,883 --> 00:00:40,091
then in that period company A will pay 7%

14
00:00:40,091 --> 00:00:44,010
or $70,000 to the lender in that period.

15
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:51,133
In Period 2, if LIBOR goes down a little bit to 4%

16
00:00:51,133 --> 00:00:55,600
then company A is going to 4 + 2 which is 6%

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,846
or, 6% which is $60,000 in interest.

18
00:01:00,846 --> 00:01:02,508
Let's say we have another company

19
00:01:02,508 --> 00:01:04,677
company B, right over here

20
00:01:04,677 --> 00:01:07,456
It also borrows $1,000,000

21
00:01:07,456 --> 00:01:13,084
but it borrows it at a fixed rate of 8%

22
00:01:13,084 --> 00:01:15,046
8% fixed interest rate

23
00:01:15,046 --> 00:01:16,654
so in each period

24
00:01:16,654 --> 00:01:18,463
regardless of what happens to LIBOR

25
00:01:18,463 --> 00:01:20,133
or any other benchmark

26
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:23,152
and so this is to probably another lender

27
00:01:23,152 --> 00:01:25,442
a different lender than the person that A borrowed it from

28
00:01:25,442 --> 00:01:27,339
and it could be a bank, or it may be a company

29
00:01:27,339 --> 00:01:29,008
or another investor of some kind

30
00:01:29,008 --> 00:01:31,754
We'll call this Lender 1 and Lender 2

31
00:01:31,754 --> 00:01:33,730
So, regardless of the period

32
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,204
right now company B will pay

33
00:01:35,204 --> 00:01:38,139
8% of $1,000,000 in each period

34
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:43,271
which is exactly $80,000 each period

35
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:45,505
Now let's say neither of these parties

36
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,075
are really happy with that situation

37
00:01:47,075 --> 00:01:48,529
Company A doesn't like the variability

38
00:01:48,529 --> 00:01:51,800
the unpredictability and what happens to LIBOR

39
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,400
They can't plan for how much they have to pay

40
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,767
Company B feels like they're overpaying for interest

41
00:01:56,767 --> 00:01:57,510
they feel like

42
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,463
"wow, the people who're doing variable interest rates,

43
00:01:59,463 --> 00:02:03,038
they're paying a less amount of interest every period"

44
00:02:03,038 --> 00:02:05,816
and maybe company B also thinks that

45
00:02:05,816 --> 00:02:07,591
interest rates are going to go down

46
00:02:07,591 --> 00:02:09,901
or that short-term, or that variable rate is going to go down

47
00:02:09,901 --> 00:02:11,585
LIBOR, is going to go down

48
00:02:11,585 --> 00:02:12,974
so that's an even bigger reason

49
00:02:12,974 --> 00:02:15,705
why they want to become a variable rate borrower.

50
00:02:15,705 --> 00:02:16,934
So what they can do

51
00:02:16,934 --> 00:02:17,884
and neither of them

52
00:02:17,884 --> 00:02:19,542
can get out of these lending agreements

53
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:22,133
but what they can do is agree to essentially swap

54
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:24,400
some or all of their interest rate payments

55
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,810
so for example, they can enter into an agreement

56
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,600
this would be called an "interest rate swap"

57
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,751
where company A agrees to pay B

58
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:38,207
maybe, let's make up a number here

59
00:02:38,207 --> 00:02:44,467
7% on a notional $1,000,000 loan.

60
00:02:44,467 --> 00:02:46,800
So the $1,000,000 will never change hands

61
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,921
but company A agrees to pay B

62
00:02:48,921 --> 00:02:51,438
7% of that notional $1,000,000

63
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:53,121
or $70,000 per period

64
00:02:53,121 --> 00:02:55,785
and in return

65
00:02:55,785 --> 00:03:01,487
company B agrees to pay A a variable rate

66
00:03:01,487 --> 00:03:07,747
let's say it's LIBOR plus 1% right over here

67
00:03:07,747 --> 00:03:09,408
And this little agreement

68
00:03:09,408 --> 00:03:11,092
And they agree they would do this for some amount

69
00:03:11,092 --> 00:03:13,467
And once again: this is LIBOR plus 1%

70
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:16,508
on a notional $1,000,000

71
00:03:16,508 --> 00:03:18,310
And that word "notional" just means that

72
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,110
that $1,000,000 will never change hands

73
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,198
they're just going to exchange

74
00:03:21,198 --> 00:03:24,454
the interest payments on $1,000,000

75
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:28,078
And this agreement right over here

76
00:03:28,078 --> 00:03:31,803
is called an interest rate swap

77
00:03:31,803 --> 00:03:33,305
And I'll leave you there and the next video

78
00:03:33,305 --> 00:03:35,365
we'll actually go through the mechanics to see that

79
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:39,816
A is truly now paying a fixed rate

80
00:03:39,816 --> 00:03:42,000
when you put in all of their different payments

81
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,610
into both the swap and the lender

82
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:44,652
and company B

83
00:03:44,652 --> 00:03:46,844
after entering into this swap agreement

84
00:03:46,844 --> 99:59:59,999
is now really paying a variable interest rate.
