2
00:00:04,899 --> 00:00:07,964
We're at the Louvre and we're looking at Rembrandt's "Bathsheba".

3
00:00:07,964 --> 00:00:11,401
It's a large canvas and it's almost square.

4
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:14,373
I think the nude is actually life-sized.

5
00:00:14,373 --> 00:00:19,110
"Bathsheba" is a story from the Old Testament.

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:24,636
King David sees her bathing from his terrace and is struck by her beauty,

7
00:00:24,636 --> 00:00:28,026
and summons her even though she is the wife of a general...

8
00:00:28,026 --> 00:00:28,955
Uriah...

9
00:00:28,955 --> 00:00:33,831
They begin an illicit, adulterous affair that ends in tragedy

10
00:00:33,831 --> 00:00:39,172
with Uriah being sent by David into battle to certain death

11
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,866
and David and Bathsheba have a stillborn child.

12
00:00:41,866 --> 00:00:44,002
She's ultimately an outcast.

13
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:51,200
I think we see that this is the first step in a terrible tragedy written on Bathsheba's face.

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,472
This is a really interesting painting in that you have Rembrandt lavishing

15
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,166
tremendous attention to the beauty of her body,

16
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:00,767
but at the same time this is really a painting that's about psychology.

17
00:01:00,767 --> 00:01:04,993
It's about this moment of contemplation as she readies herself

18
00:01:04,993 --> 00:01:09,358
and there's a degree of sadness and perhaps some interest in the illicit as well.

19
00:01:09,358 --> 00:01:14,791
Rembrandt is often showing us people's emotion, their vulnerability,

20
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:18,692
he's often showing us people in a contemplative moment

21
00:01:18,692 --> 00:01:21,014
and that's what we see here with Bathsheba.

22
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:25,380
She seems to be contemplating the future, she holds the letter in her hand,

23
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,559
she moves her left hand back and exposes her body to us,

24
00:01:29,559 --> 00:01:33,832
and you're right, there's that sense of the sensuality of her body

25
00:01:33,832 --> 00:01:38,290
and David's desire for her implicit in our own gaze at her body,

26
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:43,677
but at the same time a real consciousness of what this means for her,

27
00:01:43,677 --> 00:01:46,789
that she will commit a sin and that she will pay for that sin.

28
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:51,154
There does seem to be real foreboding and it's not simply from the dark,

29
00:01:51,154 --> 00:01:55,612
warm colors of this painting, but it really has to do with the tilt of her head,

30
00:01:55,612 --> 00:01:59,420
her gaze is downward, the lids of her eyes are low,

31
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,021
and it has to do with the softness and, as you said,

32
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:06,200
the vulnerability of the face and the relaxed muscles of the face.

33
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,612
We have that dark background that we often see in Rembrandt's work.

34
00:02:10,612 --> 00:02:12,795
Typical of the Baroque...

35
00:02:12,795 --> 00:02:19,761
But at the same time really warm colors - golds and yellows and reds and oranges...

36
00:02:19,761 --> 00:02:21,526
It's almost Venetian in those colors...

37
00:02:21,526 --> 00:02:25,287
And she's very close to us. There really is no background.

38
00:02:25,287 --> 00:02:29,699
We get a bit of a sense of a bed in the background... the servant at the bottom

39
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:34,111
washing or drying her feet... that typical Rembrandt painterliness

40
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:36,990
in the white sheet at the right corner.

41
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:42,563
She takes up the space of the painting and her emotions take up the space of the painting, too.

42
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:46,696
I'm struck by the subtlety of the color and of the brushwork.

43
00:02:46,696 --> 00:02:51,665
The brushwork is most evident in that white sheet that she has her hand on

44
00:02:51,665 --> 00:02:55,938
and that surrounds her and it's really playful and energetic.

45
00:02:55,938 --> 00:03:00,442
The quality of her flesh is really beautiful also.

46
00:03:00,442 --> 00:03:06,526
Look at those subtle whites and pinks and greens and warm tones

47
00:03:06,526 --> 00:03:11,123
against cool and the ways in which her skeletal structure and her flesh,

48
00:03:11,123 --> 00:03:15,628
the fat in her body, are all so tenderly rendered.

49
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:21,294
The figure of Bathsheba is modeled on Rembrandt's own female companion,

50
00:03:21,294 --> 00:03:27,052
Hendrikje, and I'm struck by how she's not an idealized classical nude.

51
00:03:27,052 --> 00:03:33,925
She's a real person and that also strikes me as very Baroque and very Rembrandt -

52
00:03:33,925 --> 00:03:35,783
this interest in the 'real'...

53
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:39,173
Although there is some distance. It's somewhat Orientalized.

54
00:03:39,173 --> 00:03:44,839
There's the distance of this being Biblical history so it's not as if she's a modern nude.

55
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:48,479
No, he's transformed her... He's based her on a real person.

56
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,789
And that sense of the reality of the figure is still present, I agree.

57
00:03:54,127 --> 00:03:55,723
