1
00:00:00,406 --> 00:00:04,930
Now that we have a reasonable understanding of why austerity is very difficult.

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,275
1) There probably isn't the political will to do it.

3
00:00:07,275 --> 00:00:10,608
And even more, it might drive Greece into a bigger recession.

4
00:00:10,608 --> 00:00:14,509
And we also understand why defaulting isn't an option for Greece

5
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:19,392
and we understand what a monetarily independent Greece would have done.

6
00:00:19,392 --> 00:00:26,179
We can now get a good sense of what Greece is likely to do, outside any other intervention,

7
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:28,844
outside any help from other Euro Zone members.

8
00:00:28,844 --> 00:00:37,052
In future videos, we will talk about why other Euro Zone members do have some incentive to try and stop Greece from doing what I'm about to articulate.

9
00:00:37,052 --> 00:00:44,127
So in an ideal world, Greece, if it had its own currency, would just print away and be able to inflate away its obligations.

10
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:48,311
Also, if it had its own currency, and this is not necessarily a good thing to do,

11
00:00:48,311 --> 00:00:51,599
because it will undermine investor trust going forward,

12
00:00:51,599 --> 00:00:57,350
but even defaulting would be an option, because they would still have access to their own currency

13
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,360
and then they could just keep printing and then lending to that government,

14
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,730
then the government could continue to pay the nominal obligations,

15
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:09,066
but since they're getting inflated away, in real terms they would become lower and lower.

16
00:01:09,066 --> 00:01:15,492
So what Greece, if it doesn't get any help from other Euro Zone members,

17
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:27,600
if it does not get bailed out in some way, what is likely to happen is that Greece leaves the Euro.

18
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,733
And the actual mechanics of that, and it will probably go back to a new form of the drachma.

19
00:01:32,733 --> 00:01:43,703
And the way that that would actually happen mechanically is that they would declare a banking holiday.

20
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:46,941
And it sounds like a very nice thing like everything which had a world "holiday" in it

21
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:53,259
but a banking holiday is essentially a forced shut down of all of the banks for some period of time,

22
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:57,891
over which they can do transition into the new currency.

23
00:01:57,891 --> 00:02:02,073
And so, entering into the banking holiday the Euro was the currency,

24
00:02:02,073 --> 00:02:08,114
and the money you had in your bank was denominated in Euro,

25
00:02:08,114 --> 00:02:11,847
but exiting the banking holiday the drachma will be the currency,

26
00:02:11,847 --> 00:02:14,986
and the money that you have in the bank will be the drachma.

27
00:02:14,986 --> 00:02:19,976
And what the government will essentially do is set some type of conversion rate over that banking holiday.

28
00:02:19,976 --> 00:02:31,414
They'll maybe say every one Euro you have will be converted into one drachma.

29
00:02:31,414 --> 00:02:33,761
And then just the exchange markets will determine

30
00:02:33,761 --> 00:02:38,066
what the actual exchange between a euro and a drachma is going forward.

31
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:41,647
And so then everybody would buy and sell in drachma.

32
00:02:41,647 --> 00:02:45,181
And the government would also say all of our obligations are now in drachma.

33
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:50,369
Which would essentially be a default because if they told to their debtors

34
00:02:50,369 --> 00:03:03,365
that "we no longer owe you....[where is the number?] 356 billion euros",

35
00:03:03,365 --> 00:03:05,598
or actually close to 400 billion or whatever the number is,

36
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:10,666
"we do not longer owe you 400 billion euros",

37
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:18,622
they are now going to say "we owe you 400 billion drachma."

38
00:03:18,622 --> 00:03:20,883
Or they can even say, we're only going to pay you 200 billion drachma,

39
00:03:20,883 --> 00:03:22,577
or a 100 billion drachma. But no matter what they say,

40
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:27,390
even if they say they are going to give you a trillion drachma, that would still be a default on the debt

41
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:36,493
because these debtors, in order to fulfill these obligations, they were expecting euro.

42
00:03:36,493 --> 00:03:38,398
And if you give them anything other than euro,

43
00:03:38,398 --> 00:03:42,950
if you give them strawberries or bananas or drachma, that is a default.

44
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:46,305
So no matter how many drachma they say they're going to give,

45
00:03:46,305 --> 00:03:50,348
this would constitute a default on their debt.

46
00:03:50,348 --> 00:03:55,650
But the Greek people could actually then move on with their lives.

47
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,210
And there's all sorts of crazy things that would happen,

48
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:03,932
but at least now the government would be able to print its own money and use

49
00:04:03,932 --> 00:04:08,852
it to buy government debt, and continue to fund government spending

50
00:04:08,852 --> 00:04:12,684
and eventually inflate away its obligations.

51
00:04:12,684 --> 00:04:17,194
You could imagine a situation that, right now,

52
00:04:17,194 --> 00:04:36,380
its real GDP is, let's say it's the equivalent of 100 drachma.

53
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:41,149
And then by just keep printing drachma, the actual productivity of the economy doesn't change.

54
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:45,058
It actually might improve if money is printed, but you don't get to hyper inflation.

55
00:04:45,058 --> 00:04:51,124
Let's say over the next 10 years that the real GDP doesn't change,

56
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:57,062
but the nominal GDP, due to inflation over the next 10 years, becomes 500.

57
00:04:57,062 --> 00:05:07,531
Prices in general, ...so inflation, you had 5x inflation.

58
00:05:07,531 --> 00:05:11,009
Things become worth 5 times as much, you produce the same goods and services,

59
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:16,033
they are now worth 5x as much. But now, that debt that you have,

60
00:05:16,033 --> 00:05:19,978
your taxes are going to grow with inflation because they are a % of your GDP

61
00:05:19,978 --> 00:05:24,715
but your actual debt obligations won't change.

62
00:05:24,715 --> 00:05:29,849
So in real terms, they'll be 1/5 as much, which all of a sudden, makes them sustainable.

63
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:34,457
Now, as I said, this is not a simple thing to do. And not a painless to do.

64
00:05:34,457 --> 00:05:38,946
And we haven't even started talking about the repercussions for the rest of Europe, and why this might be scary,

65
00:05:38,946 --> 00:05:44,270
and make other people suspicious of countries like Spain and Italy, etc.

66
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,976
And even in Greece this would be painful. Because you can imagine,

67
00:05:47,976 --> 00:05:50,909
you can imagine, we're already starting to see this in May of 2012.

68
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:55,611
The government will say every euro in your bank account will now be a drachma,

69
00:05:55,611 --> 00:06:02,268
but the people there they know better than just believing that a drachma is going to be worth the same as a euro.

70
00:06:02,268 --> 00:06:07,181
They're going to know that as soon as the drachma starts exchanging on foreign exchange markets,

71
00:06:07,181 --> 00:06:20,562
that the actual reality is 1 drachma is going to be worth something closer to maybe .6 of a euro.

72
00:06:20,562 --> 00:06:23,981
Or .7 of a euro.

73
00:06:23,981 --> 00:06:26,957
Let's say it's .7 of a euro.

74
00:06:26,957 --> 00:06:31,190
So essentially by this happening, everyone's savings and deposits,

75
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:36,646
in real terms, in terms of their global buying power is going to go down by 30% overnight.

76
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,216
And the Greek people are already seeing that.

77
00:06:38,216 --> 00:06:42,627
They are seeing the possibility of a banking holiday, and a conversion to the drachma.

78
00:06:42,627 --> 00:06:49,369
And so that's why you have people waiting in line before this happens and trying to withdraw their euros.

79
00:06:49,369 --> 00:06:55,112
So people are starting to withdraw their euros,

80
00:06:55,112 --> 00:06:57,755
and if they have a Swiss bank account they can deposit it there

81
00:06:57,755 --> 00:07:01,343
or they can just take the euros and stash in their mattresses.

82
00:07:01,343 --> 00:07:05,711
And that by itself is a little bit scary. The bank's deposits are depleted.

83
00:07:05,711 --> 00:07:08,644
But remember, they have a fractional reserve banking system.

84
00:07:08,644 --> 00:07:15,145
They do not expect everyone to show up on one day and expect all of their deposits to be accessible.

85
00:07:15,145 --> 00:07:18,678
So this is essentially going to lead to a run on banks.

86
00:07:18,678 --> 00:07:26,393
And you're already starting to see this in Greece, and it is actually rational behaviour.

87
00:07:26,393 --> 00:07:32,025
If you think that 30% of your savings is about to swiped away because of this thing right here,

88
00:07:32,025 --> 00:07:36,464
I'm going to give you .7 of a euro for every euro you have,

89
00:07:36,464 --> 00:07:39,834
you would rationally go to the bank and get your deposit back.

90
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:43,452
But because everyone is going to start doing that, the banks won't have their reserves.

91
00:07:43,452 --> 00:07:48,309
The Greeks don't have their own central bank that can back up the banking system there.

92
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:56,593
So this might lead to massive bank failures.

93
00:07:56,593 --> 00:08:00,832
And essentially, the entire Greek banking sector could go down because of this.

94
00:08:00,832 --> 00:08:04,243
And they don't have an independent central bank, independent of the European central bank,

95
00:08:04,243 --> 00:08:08,398
to kind of fight the fires the way that the Fed would in the US.

96
00:08:08,398 --> 00:08:11,942
So this is not a clean situation; it is not a painless situation.

97
00:08:11,942 --> 00:08:15,942
But, outside any help, it seems like the only option that Greece has at this point.
