1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:05,450
I have been asked for some intuition as to why, let's say,

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:12,030
a to the minus b is equal to one over a to the b.

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,382
And before I give you the intuition,

4
00:00:13,382 --> 00:00:17,420
I want you to just realize that this really is a definition.

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:17,920
I don't know.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,950
The inventor of mathematics wasn't one person.

7
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,120
It was, you know, a convention that arose.

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,180
But they defined this,

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,634
and they defined this for the reasons that I'm going to show you.

10
00:00:28,634 --> 00:00:30,477
Well, what I'm going to show you is one of the reasons,

11
00:00:30,477 --> 00:00:32,593
and then we'll see that this is a good definition,

12
00:00:32,593 --> 00:00:38,790
because once you learn the exponent rules, all of the other exponent rules stay consistent for negative exponents

13
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,596
and when you raise something to the zeroth power.

14
00:00:41,596 --> 00:00:44,740
So let's take the positive exponents.

15
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,180
Those are pretty intuitive, I think.

16
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:54,200
So the positive exponents, so you have a to the one, a squared,

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,140
a cubed, a to the fourth.

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,832
What's a to the one? a to the one, we said, was a,

19
00:01:01,832 --> 00:01:06,060
and then to get to a squared, what did we do?

20
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,200
We multiplied by a, right?

21
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,650
a squared is just a times a.

22
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,040
And then to get to a cubed, what did we do?

23
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,160
We multiplied by a again.

24
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,420
And then to get to a to the fourth, what did we do?

25
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,920
We multiplied by a again.

26
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:24,480
Or the other way, you could imagine, is when you decrease the exponent,
what are we doing?

27
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,560
We are multiplying by one over a, or dividing by a.

28
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,140
And similarly, you decrease again, you're dividing by a.

29
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:38,479
And to go from a squared to a to the first, you're dividing by a.

30
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,700
So let's use this progression to figure out what a to the zero is.

31
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,900
So this is the first hard one.

32
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,010
So a to the zero.

33
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:49,990
So you're the inventor, the founding mother of mathematics,

34
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,170
and you need to define what a to the zero is.

35
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,420
And, you know, maybe it's seventeen, maybe it's pi.

36
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,100
I don't know.

37
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,860
It's up to you to decide what a to the zero is.

38
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,140
But wouldn't it be nice if a to the zero retained this pattern?

39
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:07,274
That every time you decrease the exponent, you're dividing by a, right?

40
00:02:07,274 --> 00:02:11,700
So, if you're going from a to the first to a to the zero,

41
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,160
wouldn't it be nice if we just divided by a?

42
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,189
So let's do that.

43
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:18,320
So if we go from a to the first, which is just a,

44
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,078
and divide by a,

45
00:02:21,078 --> 00:02:23,848
right, so we're just going to go-- we're just going to divide it by a.

46
00:02:23,863 --> 00:02:27,235
What is a divided by a?

47
00:02:27,235 --> 00:02:29,730
Well, it's just one.

48
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,994
So that's where the definition--

49
00:02:30,994 --> 00:02:37,420
or that's one of the intuitions behind why something to the zeroth power is equal to one.

50
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,456
Because when you take that number

51
00:02:39,456 --> 00:02:43,190
and divide it by itself one more time, you just get one.

52
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,177
So that's pretty reasonable,

53
00:02:44,177 --> 00:02:45,890
but now let's go into the negative domain.

54
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:51,891
So what should a to the negative one equal?

55
00:02:51,891 --> 00:02:54,410
Well, once again, it's nice if we can retain this pattern,

56
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,682
where every time we decrease the exponent we're dividing by a.

57
00:02:57,682 --> 00:03:01,546
So let's divide by a again, so one over a.

58
00:03:01,546 --> 00:03:06,140
So we're going to take a to the zero and divide it by a.

59
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,610
a to the zero is one, so what's one divided by a?

60
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,090
It's one over a.

61
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,078
Now, let's do it one more time,

62
00:03:13,078 --> 00:03:15,330
and then I think you're going to get the pattern.

63
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,880
Well, I think you probably already got the pattern.

64
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,350
What's a to the minus two?

65
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,993
Well, we want-- you know, it'd be silly now to change this pattern.

66
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:25,130
Every time we decrease the exponent, we're dividing by a.

67
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,840
So to go from a to the minus one to a to the minus two,

68
00:03:27,855 --> 00:03:30,470
let's just divide by a again.

69
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,550
And what do we get?

70
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,040
If you take one over a and divide by a, you get one over a squared.

71
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,146
And you could just keep doing this pattern all the way to the left,

72
00:03:39,146 --> 00:03:44,761
and you would get a to the minus b is equal to one over a to the b.

73
00:03:44,761 --> 00:03:48,790
Hopefully, that gave you a little intuition as to why--

74
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,090
well, first of all, you know, the big mystery is, you know,

75
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,590
something to the zeroth power, why does that equal one?

76
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,970
First, keep in mind that that's just a definition.

77
00:03:55,972 --> 00:03:59,134
Someone decided that it should be equal to one, but they had a good reason.

78
00:03:59,134 --> 00:04:02,617
And their good reason was they wanted to keep this pattern going.

79
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:07,422
And that's the same reason why they defined negative exponents in this way.

80
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,654
And what's extra cool about it is

81
00:04:08,654 --> 00:04:13,227
not only does it retain this pattern of when you decrease exponents, you're dividing by a,

82
00:04:13,227 --> 00:04:16,138
or when you're increasing exponents, you're multiplying by a,

83
00:04:16,138 --> 00:04:20,457
but as you'll see in the exponent rules videos, all of the exponent rules hold.

84
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:25,574
All of the exponent rules are consistent with this definition of something to the zeroth power

85
00:04:25,574 --> 00:04:28,472
and this definition of something to the negative power.

86
00:04:28,472 --> 00:04:30,290
Hopefully, that didn't confuse you

87
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:34,010
and gave you a little bit of intuition and demystified something that, frankly,

88
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:37,545
is quite mystifying the first time you learn it.
