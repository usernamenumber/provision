1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,770
   

2
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:01,750
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:04,780
Before we proceed further and
get a little bit better

4
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,000
understanding of why maybe some
of these investors were

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,330
so keen on investing in mortgage
backed securities,

6
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,330
essentially loaning this money
to all these people who are

7
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,090
buying these ever appreciating
houses, I think we need to a

8
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,110
few more tools in
our tool belt.

9
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,910
So I'm going to introduce
you to the concept

10
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,710
of the yield curve.

11
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:22,890
You might have heard
this before.

12
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,970
You might have heard people
on CNBC talk about it.

13
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,460
And hopefully, after about the
next five or ten minutes, you

14
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,600
will know a lot about
the yield curve.

15
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,290
So when most people talk about
the yield curve, they're

16
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,950
talking about the treasury
yield curve.

17
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,930
And what does that mean?

18
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,580
What is even a treasury?

19
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,230
So these treasury securities,
whether they're T-Bills,

20
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,445
treasury bills, treasury notes,
or treasury bonds.

21
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:57,010
   

22
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:01,130
These are loans to the
federal government.

23
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,720
And these are considered
risk-free.

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,090
Because if you lend to the
federal government and they're

25
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,840
running short of cash, all they
have to do is increase

26
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,590
taxes on us the people and they
can pay back your debt.

27
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,400
So in dollar denominated terms,
the treasury bills,

28
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,060
notes, and bonds are about as
safe as you can get in terms

29
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,420
of lending your money
to anyone.

30
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,540
So when most people talk about
the yield curve, they're

31
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,630
talking about the risk-free
yield curve.

32
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:34,260
And they're talking about the
curve for treasuries.

33
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,770
So first, a little bit
of definitions.

34
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,470
What is the difference between
treasury bills, treasury

35
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,480
notes, and treasury bonds?

36
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,790
They're pretty much all loans
to the government.

37
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,210
But they're loans for different
amounts of time.

38
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:55,580
So if I give a loan to the
government for $1,000 for six

39
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,500
months, that will be
a treasury bill.

40
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,710
So I will give the government
$1,000, the government would

41
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,180
give me a treasury bill.

42
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,340
And that treasury bill from the
government is essentially

43
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,229
just an IOU saying that I'm
going to give you your money

44
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:12,740
back in six months with
interest. Similarly, if it's

45
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,010
three months, it's a three
month treasury bill.

46
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:19,590
Treasury notes are loans that
are from one year to 10 years.

47
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,110
So on this graph that we're
going to make using the actual

48
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:29,060
yield curve rates, from zero
to one year-- and actually

49
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,490
there's no zero year
treasury bill.

50
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,250
Actually, the shortest
one is one month.

51
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,830
This would be something like
here on our graph.

52
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:42,810
So from one month to one year,
these are T-bills.

53
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,090
And this is just definitional.

54
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,560
Then from one year to 10
year, these are notes.

55
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,670
Actually, I believe the one
year itself is a note.

56
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,440
Up to one year is a bill.

57
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,520
Although, I might be
wrong with that.

58
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,490
Correct me if I'm wrong.

59
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,700
That's just a definitional
thing.

60
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,950
From one to 10 year, these
are called notes.

61
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,850
And then when you go beyond
10 years, these are called

62
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,470
treasury bonds.

63
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,930
These are just definitional
things to worry about.

64
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,060
So with that out of the way,
let's talk about what the

65
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,840
yield curve is.

66
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,570
I'll just give you a simple
thought experiment.

67
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:24,260
If I'm lending money to someone
for a month versus

68
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,020
lending money to that person for
a year, in which situation

69
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,080
am I probably taking
on more risk?

70
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,040
Well, sure, if I'm lending
someone for a month, I know

71
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,870
only so much can happen
in that month.

72
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,920
So I would expect to be paid
less interest. Not just

73
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,530
obviously in dollar terms, but
even adjusted for time, I

74
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,370
would expect less interest
for that month.

75
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,410
And this is actually an
important point to make.

76
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,880
When I say that I'm charging
6% interest for that month,

77
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,730
that doesn't mean that after a
month the person is going to

78
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,650
pay me 6% on my money.

79
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,040
It means that if I were to give
that money to somebody

80
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,820
for a month, and they
were to pay it back.

81
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,970
And then I were to give that
money to, say, that same

82
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,240
person, or another person, for
a month, and I were to keep

83
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,770
doing that for a year, then in
aggregate I would get 6%.

84
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:16,310
So that 6%, no matter what
duration we talk about,

85
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,550
whether one month, one year,
five years, 15 years, when we

86
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,190
talk about the interest rate,
that's the rate that on

87
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,160
average we would
get for a year.

88
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,440
It's the annualized
interest rate.

89
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,740
So going back to my question.

90
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,970
If lend someone money, even the
government, for a month,

91
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,870
there's usually less
risk in that.

92
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,510
Because only so much
could happen in a

93
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,570
month versus in a year.

94
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,190
In a year there might be more
inflation, the dollar might

95
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:42,120
collapse, I might be passing on
better investments, I might

96
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,880
need the cash in a year's time,
while I have a lot of

97
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,630
confidence that I don't need
the cash in a month's time.

98
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:51,690
So in general, you expect less
interest when you loan money

99
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:55,910
for a shorter period time than
a longer period of time.

100
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,645
And so let's draw the
yield curve and see

101
00:04:57,645 --> 00:04:58,490
if this holds true.

102
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,830
So I actually went
to the treasury

103
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,400
website, so that's treas.gov.

104
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,490
And this is the yield curve.

105
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,000
So they say on March
14, so this is

106
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,860
the most recent number.

107
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,830
And I'm going to plot this.

108
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:15,520
They say, if you lend money to
the government for one month,

109
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,830
you'll get 1.2% on that money.

110
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,740
And remember, if it's $1,000
it's not like I'm going to get

111
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,830
1.2% on that $1,000 just
after a month.

112
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,320
If I kept doing it for a year,
this is an annualized number,

113
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,950
I'll get 1.2%.

114
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:31,400
And so for three months, I
get a little bit less.

115
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,080
And then for six months
I get more.

116
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,710
And then it does seem that the
overall trend is that I expect

117
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,700
more and more money as I lend
money to the government for

118
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,530
larger and larger
periods of time.

119
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,490
And this is a little interesting
anomaly that you

120
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,610
get a little bit more
interest for one

121
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:47,500
month than three months.

122
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,810
And we'll do a more advanced
presentation later as to why

123
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,170
you might get lower yields for
longer duration investments.

124
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,195
That's called an inverted
yield curve.

125
00:05:58,195 --> 00:06:02,160
So let's just plot this and
see what it looks like.

126
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,530
So you saw where
I got my data.

127
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,000
So they say for one month
I'd get 1.2%.

128
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,030
So this is one month.

129
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,800
It'd be right about here.

130
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,370
Three months I get about
the same thing.

131
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,720
For six months I get 1.32%.

132
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,910
Maybe that's like here.

133
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,520
One year, I get one 1.37%.

134
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,460
Maybe it's here.

135
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,880
Five years, I get 2.37%.

136
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,130
So that's maybe like here.

137
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,280
   

138
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,760
And these aren't all
of the durations.

139
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,700
I'm just for simplicity not
going to do all of them.

140
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,030
For 10 years, 3.44%.

141
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,850
So maybe that's here.

142
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,410
For 20 years, I get 4.3%.

143
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,870
Like that.

144
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:50,540
And then for 30 years,
I get 4.35%.

145
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,400
So the current yield curve looks
something like this.

146
00:06:53,400 --> 00:07:03,480
   

147
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,140
And so you now hopefully at
least understand what the

148
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:06,830
yield curve is.

149
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,960
All it is, is using
a simple graph.

150
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,950
Someone can look at that graph
and say, well, in general what

151
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:17,340
type of rates am I getting for
lending to the government?

152
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,710
On a risk-free free basis, or
as risk-free as anything we

153
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:23,280
can expect, what type of rates
am I getting when I lend to

154
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,100
the government for different
periods of time?

155
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,730
And that's what the yield
curve tells us.

156
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:29,120
And in general, it's
upwardly sloping.

157
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,380
Because, as I said, when you
lend money for a longer period

158
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,000
of time, you're kind of
taking on more risk.

159
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,770
There's a lot more that you
feel that could happen.

160
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,020
You might need that cash.

161
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,630
   

162
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,480
There might be inflation.

163
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,560
The dollar might devalue.

164
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,690
There's a lot of things
that could happen.

165
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,120
So the next question
is, well, what

166
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,500
determines this yield curve?

167
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:55,890
Well, when the treasury, the
government, needs to borrow

168
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:59,370
money, what it does is say, hey
everyone we need to borrow

169
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,990
a billion dollars from
you, because we

170
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,510
can't control are spending.

171
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,920
And they say we're going to
borrow a billion dollars in

172
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,960
one month notes.

173
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,490
So this is one month notes.

174
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,790
They're going to borrow
a billion dollars.

175
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,370
And they have an auction.

176
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,340
And the world, investors from
everywhere, they go in, they

177
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,460
say, well, this is a
safe place to put

178
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,850
my cash for a month.

179
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,490
And depending on the demand,
that determines the rate.

180
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,800
So if there are a lot of people
who want to buy those

181
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,940
one month treasuries, the rate
might be a little bit lower.

182
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,290
Does that make sense to you?

183
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,170
Think about it.

184
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,900
If a lot of people want to buy
it, there's a lot of demand

185
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,390
relative to the supply.

186
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,840
So the government has to pay a
lower interest rate on it.

187
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,159
Similarly, if for whatever
reason people don't want to

188
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,630
keep their money in the dollar,
they think the U.S.

189
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,860
might default on their debt
one day, and not that many

190
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,480
people want to invest in the
treasury, then that auction,

191
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,510
the government is going to have
to pay a higher interest

192
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,340
rate to people for them
to loan money to it.

193
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,310
So maybe then the auction
ends up up here.

194
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,230
And similarly, the government
does auctions for all of the

195
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,380
different durations.

196
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,150
And duration, I just mean
the time period you're

197
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,320
getting the loan for.

198
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,370
So they do it for one month,
three months, six months, one

199
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,940
year, two year, three
year, et cetera.

200
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:17,930
Once the government has done
that auction-- You give the

201
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,010
money to the government,
they give you an

202
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,740
IOU called a T-bill.

203
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,100
Then you could trade it
with other people.

204
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,930
And that's going to determine
the rate in the short term.

205
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,510
So the government does
the auction.

206
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,310
But then after the auction,
and a lot of people had

207
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,990
demand, but then a lot of
people get freaked out.

208
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,180
And the public markets, when you
try to sell that treasury,

209
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,480
will then expect.

210
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,200
a higher yield.

211
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,690
I know that might be a little
complicated now.

212
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,510
And I always start to jumble
things when I run out of time.

213
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,780
But hopefully at this point you
have a sense of what the

214
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,590
yield curve is.

215
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,210
You have a sense of what
treasury bills, treasury

216
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,820
notes, and treasury bonds are.

217
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,440
And you have some intuition
on why the yield

218
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,180
curve has this shape.

219
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,110
See you in the next video.
