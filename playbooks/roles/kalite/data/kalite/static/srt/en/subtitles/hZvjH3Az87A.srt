1
00:00:00,435 --> 00:00:01,977
Let's see if we can use our example

2
00:00:01,977 --> 00:00:05,329
to understand the 3 types of income statements

3
00:00:05,329 --> 00:00:07,127
and hopefully understanding those income statements

4
00:00:07,127 --> 00:00:10,203
will also help us understand this example.

5
00:00:10,203 --> 00:00:12,471
So I'm gonna start of, we're gonna focus on month 2

6
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:14,960
and what I've done is I've rewritten some of this

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,757
accrual income statement down here

8
00:00:16,757 --> 00:00:18,929
so it really looks like a statement

9
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:22,799
so this right here is the income statement for month 2

10
00:00:22,799 --> 00:00:26,284
on an accrual basis. And that month, we said we had

11
00:00:26,284 --> 00:00:30,810
$400 of revenue, $200 of expense,

12
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,336
$400 minus $200 gives us $200 of income.

13
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:37,274
And income statement tells us what happened

14
00:00:37,274 --> 00:00:39,489
over a period of time, what was the activity?

15
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:42,063
How much revenue, how much expenses, and other things

16
00:00:42,063 --> 00:00:44,403
this is just a super simplified one, without taxes

17
00:00:44,403 --> 00:00:49,074
without interest, without other types of expenses over here.

18
00:00:49,074 --> 00:00:52,729
I also have drawn the balance sheet at the end of month 1

19
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:54,561
and the balance sheet at the end of month 2.

20
00:00:54,561 --> 00:00:56,372
Or you could also view this balance sheet here

21
00:00:56,372 --> 00:00:58,898
as the balance sheet at the beginning of month 2.

22
00:00:58,898 --> 00:01:02,385
And the main thing to realize is the income statement tells you

23
00:01:02,385 --> 00:01:04,900
what happens over a time period,

24
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,560
while balance sheets are snapshots, or they're pictures

25
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,840
at a given moment.

26
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,790
Snapshots. So this tells us essentially,

27
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,002
what did I have?

28
00:01:15,002 --> 00:01:17,265
The assets are the things that can give me

29
00:01:17,265 --> 00:01:18,314
future benefits. So what do I have,

30
00:01:18,314 --> 00:01:21,402
and the liabilities are things that I have to give

31
00:01:21,402 --> 00:01:23,802
future benefit to, or things that I owe

32
00:01:23,802 --> 00:01:25,784
so this is what I have, this is what I owe,

33
00:01:25,784 --> 00:01:29,063
and then the equity is really what I have to my name

34
00:01:29,063 --> 00:01:32,373
if I net out the liabilities from the assets.

35
00:01:32,373 --> 00:01:35,859
So the beginning of month 2, which is the end of month 1,

36
00:01:35,859 --> 00:01:39,440
I had $100 of cash, no accounts receiveables,

37
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,270
I didn't owe anyone anything,

38
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,524
I didn't owe them money, I didn't owe them services

39
00:01:43,524 --> 00:01:47,046
So $100 minus 0, means I had $100,

40
00:01:47,046 --> 00:01:50,102
that's kind of what the owners of the company

41
00:01:50,102 --> 00:01:53,403
can say they have of value at the beginning of the month.

42
00:01:53,403 --> 00:01:57,021
You fast forward, now at the end of the month 2

43
00:01:57,021 --> 00:01:59,243
I now owe the bank $100,

44
00:01:59,243 --> 00:02:01,494
So I just put this as negative $100 here,

45
00:02:01,494 --> 00:02:03,440
it normally wouldn't be accounted that way

46
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,833
on an actual company's balance sheet, but just to simplify it,

47
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:10,151
But I have an accounts receivable of $400,

48
00:02:10,151 --> 00:02:14,302
so my total assets now are $300 of assets,

49
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:16,411
remember, accounts receivables aren't assets,

50
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:18,488
because someone owes me something,

51
00:02:18,488 --> 00:02:20,816
someone owes me cash in the future.

52
00:02:20,816 --> 00:02:22,965
I still have no liabilities

53
00:02:22,965 --> 00:02:24,378
So you take all of your assets,

54
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:26,487
minus all of your liabilities,

55
00:02:26,487 --> 00:02:29,791
and now I have $300 in equity.

56
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,045
So you can see

57
00:02:31,045 --> 00:02:34,116
the snapshot at the beginning of the month: $100 in equity

58
00:02:34,116 --> 00:02:37,212
snapshot at the end of the month: $300 in equity.

59
00:02:37,212 --> 00:02:39,902
And so to go from one point to the other,

60
00:02:39,902 --> 00:02:41,981
to go from $100 to $300,

61
00:02:41,981 --> 00:02:44,777
I must have grown in equity by $200,

62
00:02:44,777 --> 00:02:48,368
I must have gotten $200 worth of value from someplace

63
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,082
and that's what the income statement describes.

64
00:02:51,082 --> 00:02:52,722
It describes it right over here

65
00:02:52,722 --> 00:02:54,401
the change in equity,

66
00:02:54,401 --> 00:02:56,353
sometime the change in retained earnings,

67
00:02:56,353 --> 00:03:00,531
or just change in equity,

68
00:03:00,531 --> 00:03:03,580
that is going to be the $200 in net income

69
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,725
that the company got over that time period.

70
00:03:06,725 --> 00:03:09,951
Now there's one thing that you're probably confused by right now

71
00:03:09,951 --> 00:03:13,022
well you know, how do we reconcile everything with the cash

72
00:03:13,022 --> 00:03:15,966
we know that over this period we got $200 in income

73
00:03:15,966 --> 00:03:17,603
on an accrual basis.

74
00:03:17,603 --> 00:03:19,484
But when you look at the cash, we went from $100

75
00:03:19,484 --> 00:03:22,120
positive cash, to negative $100 in cash.

76
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,713
It looks like we lost $200.

77
00:03:24,713 --> 00:03:28,545
So how can we reconcile the fact that we got $200 income?

78
00:03:28,545 --> 00:03:31,142
How can we reconcile that with the fact that

79
00:03:31,142 --> 00:03:34,192
we lost $200 in cash?

80
00:03:34,192 --> 00:03:36,468
And that reconciliation is going to be done

81
00:03:36,468 --> 00:03:40,429
on the cash flow statement, and I'll do that in the next video.
