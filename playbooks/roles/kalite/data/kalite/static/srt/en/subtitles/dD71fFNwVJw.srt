99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The speed of light is 3 times 10 to the power 8!! So as you can tell light is very fast.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
3 times 10 to the power 8 metres per second.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If it takes 5 time 10 to the second power seconds for light to travel from the sun to the earth.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Lets just think about that a little bit.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So 5 times 10 to the second thats 500.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
500 seconds. You have 60 seconds in a minute. So 8 minutes would be 480 seconds

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So 500 seconds would be about 8 minutes 20 seconds

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it takes 8 minutes 20 seconds for light to travel from the sun to the earth

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What is the distance in metres between

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the sun and the earth. So they are giving us a rate, they are giving us a speed, they are giving us a

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
time and they want to find a distance. So this goes straight back to the standard

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
distance is equal to rate times time. So they give us the rate.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The rate is 3 times 10 to the 8 metres per second

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So its 3 times 10 to the 8 m/s

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That right there is the rate

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They give us the time

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The time is 5 times 10 to the second seconds.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So times 5 times 10 to the second seconds

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Seconds use that with an s

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So how many metres? What is the distance? What is the distance?

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we can just reassociate these or actually just move these around

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
from the commutative and dissociative properties of multiplication.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this right here is the same thing.

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And actually you can multiply the units its called dimensional analysis

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And when you multiply the units you kind of treat them like

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
variables. You should get the right dimensions for distance

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Lets just rearrange these numbers.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is equal to 3 times 5
