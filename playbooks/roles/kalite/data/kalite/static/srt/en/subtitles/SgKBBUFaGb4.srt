1
00:00:01,267 --> 00:00:03,600
We're asked to solve for p and we have the inequality here

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,200
negative 3 p minus 7 is less than p + 9.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,200
So what we really want to do here is isolate the p on one side of this inequality.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,533
And preferably the left, that just makes it just a little easier to read.

5
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:16,800
It doesn't have to be, but we just want to isolate the p.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,133
So a good step to that is to get rid of this p on the right hand side

7
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:24,000
and the best way I can think of doing that is subtracting p from the right.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,467
But of course, if we want to make sure that this inequality is always going to be true,

9
00:00:27,467 --> 00:00:30,467
if we do anything to the right, we also have to do that to the left.

10
00:00:30,467 --> 00:00:33,467
So we also have to subtract p from the left.

11
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:38,333
and so the left hand side, negative 3p minus p, that's negative 4p.

12
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:45,000
And then we still have a minus seven up here, is going to be less than p minus p, those cancel out, it is

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,467
less than 9.

14
00:00:47,467 --> 00:00:51,600
Now the next thing I'm in the mood to do is get rid of this negative 7 here,

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,467
so that we can better isolate the p on the left hand side. So the best way I can think of

16
00:00:56,467 --> 00:01:00,133
to get rid of a negative 7 is to add 7 to it, then it will just cancel out to 0.

17
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:03,333
So let's add 7 to both sides of this inequality.

18
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:08,267
Negative 7 plus 7 cancels out, all we're left with is negative 4 p.

19
00:01:08,267 --> 00:01:14,267
On the right hand side we have 9 plus 7 equals 16, and it's still less than.

20
00:01:14,267 --> 00:01:18,333
Now the last step to isolate the p is to get rid of this negative 4 coefficient,

21
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:23,133
and the easiest way I can think of to get rid of this negative 4 coefficient,

22
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:25,333
is to divide both sides by negative 4. So if we divide this side by negative 4,

23
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:32,467
these guys are going to cancel out, we're just going to be left with p.

24
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,533
We also have to do it to the right hand side.

25
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:37,333
Now there's one thing that you really have to rememeber, since this is an

26
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:40,467
inequality, not an equation. If you're dealing with an inequality and you

27
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:48,267
multiply both sides of an equation by a negative number, you have to swap the inequality.

28
00:01:48,267 --> 00:01:52,933
So in this case the less than becomes greater than, since we're dividing by a negative number.

29
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:56,333
And so negative 4 divided by negative 4, those cancel out.

30
00:01:56,333 --> 00:02:02,200
We have p is greater than 16 divided by negative 4, which is negative four.

31
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,133
And we can plot this solution set right over here, and then we can try out

32
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:10,200
some values to help us feel good about the idea of it working.

33
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,467
So let's say this is negative 5, negative 4, negative 3, negative 2

34
00:02:15,467 --> 00:02:21,800
negative one, zero... let me write that a little bit neater--

35
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,533
and then we can keep going to the right, and so our solution is

36
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:29,533
p is not greater than or equal, so we have to exclude negative 4.

37
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:33,800
p is greater than negative 4, so all the values above that.

38
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:40,933
So, negative 3.999999999 will work, negative 4 will not work.

39
00:02:40,933 --> 00:02:45,667
Now let's just try some values out to feel good that this really the solution set.

40
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:49,533
So first let's try out when p is equal to negative 3.

41
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:53,267
This should work. The way I've drawn it, this is in our solution set.

42
00:02:53,267 --> 00:02:57,800
p equals negative 3 is greater than negative 4.

43
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,667
So let's try that out.

44
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:04,000
We have negative 3 times negative 3. The first negative 3 is this one, and then we're saying

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,533
p is negative 3. Minus seven is less than-- instead of putting p

46
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:08,667
we're putting a negative 3.

47
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:10,667
Should be less than negative 3 plus 9.

48
00:03:10,667 --> 00:03:15,400
Negative 3 times negative 3 is 9, minus seven, should be less than negative 3 plus 9

49
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:22,667
is 6. 9 minus seven is 2. 2 should be less than 6, which of course, it is.

50
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:25,800
So let's try a value that definitely should not work.

51
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,267
So let's try negative 5, negative 5 is not in our solution set, so it should not work.

52
00:03:30,267 --> 00:03:38,333
So we have negative 3 times negative 5, minus seven. Let's see whether is it less than negative 5 plus

53
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:45,000
9. Negative 3 times negative 5 is 15, minus 7. It really should not be less than

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,467
negative 5 plus 9.

55
00:03:48,467 --> 00:03:55,133
So we're just seeing if p equals negative 5 works, 15 minus 7 is 8.

56
00:03:55,133 --> 00:04:01,467
And so we get 8 is less than 4, which is definitely not the case.

57
00:04:01,467 --> 00:04:05,333
So p equals negative 5 doesn't work, and it shouldn't work,

58
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,667
because it is not in our solution set.

59
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:08,867
And now if we really want to feel good about it,

60
00:04:08,867 --> 00:04:10,133
we can actually try this boundary point.

61
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:14,800
Negative 4 should not work, but it should satisfy the related equation.

62
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,467
When I talk about the related equation, negative 4 should satisfy negative 3 minus 7

63
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:25,600
is equal to p plus 9. It will satisfy this, but it won't satisfy this,

64
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,200
because when we get the same value on both sides, the same value is not

65
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,133
less than the same value.

66
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:34,733
So let's try it out, let's see if negative 4 at least satisfies the

67
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:42,800
related equation. So if we get negative 3 times negative 4 minus 7, this should be equal to negative

68
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,600
4 plus 9. So this is 12 minus seven should be equal to negative 4 plus 9. It should be equal to 5.

69
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,456
And this of course, is true.

70
00:04:51,471 --> 00:04:53,877
5 is equal to 5.

71
00:04:53,954 --> 00:04:56,575
So it satisfies the related equation, but it should not satisfy this.

72
00:04:56,575 --> 00:05:00,533
If you put negative 4 for p here, and I encourage you to do so,

73
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:02,867
actually we could do it over here instead of an equals sign,

74
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:06,629
if you put it into the original in equality --let me delete all of that

75
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:12,590
It really just becomes this. The original inequality is this right over here.

76
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,429
If you have negative 4, you have less than, and then you'll get

77
00:05:15,429 --> 00:05:17,800
5 is less than 5, which is not the case.

78
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,133
And that's good because we did not include that in the solution set.

79
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:25,733
We put an open circle. If negative 4 was included, we'd fill that in.

80
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:31,200
But the only reason we'd include negative four is if this was greater than or equal. So it's good that

81
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,333
this does not work, because negative four is not part of our solution set.

82
00:05:35,333 --> 99:59:59,999
You can kind of view it as a boundary point.
