1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490
   

2
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,220
We've already learned that
cellular respiration can be

3
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,820
broken down into roughly
three phases.

4
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:11,490
   

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,760
The first is glycolysis, which
literally means the breaking

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,010
down of glucose.

7
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:23,620
   

8
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,540
And then this can occur with
or without oxygen.

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,590
If we don't have oxygen, then
we go over to fermentation.

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,800
We'll talk about that
in the future.

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,320
Go over to fermentation
and in humans it

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,750
produces lactic acid.

13
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,150
In other types of organisms
it might

14
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,200
produce alcohol or ethanol.

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,675
But if we have oxygen-- and for
the most part we're going

16
00:00:45,675 --> 00:00:48,690
to assume that we can proceed
forward with oxygen-- if there

17
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,610
is oxygen, then we could
proceed forward

18
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,190
to the Krebs cycle.

19
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:58,750
Sometimes called the citric acid
cycle because it deals

20
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,390
with citric acid.

21
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,390
The same thing that's in
orange juice or lemons.

22
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,630
And then from there
we proceed to the

23
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,310
electron transport chain.

24
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,090
   

25
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,750
And we learned in the first
overview video of cellular

26
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,610
respiration that this is where
the bulk of the ATP is

27
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:16,500
actually produced.

28
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,920
Although it uses raw materials
that came out of

29
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,360
these phases up here.

30
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,460
Now what I want to do in this
video is just focus on

31
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,710
glycolysis.

32
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,500
   

33
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,080
And this is kind of-- it's
sometimes a challenging task

34
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,830
because you can really get
stuck in the weeds.

35
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,550
And I'll show you the weeds
in a little bit,

36
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,480
and the actual mechanism.

37
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,750
And it can be very daunting.

38
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,160
But what I want to do is
simplify it for you so you can

39
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,420
have the big take-aways.

40
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,550
And then we can appreciate, and
then maybe when we look at

41
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:45,770
the weeds of glycolysis we
can make a little bit

42
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:46,940
more sense of it.

43
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,230
So glycolysis, or really
cellular respiration, it

44
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,480
starts off with glucose.

45
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,230
   

46
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,130
And glucose, we know
its formula.

47
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:59,660
It's C6H12O6.

48
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,850
And I could draw its whole
structure; it would take a

49
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:02,300
little time.

50
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,270
But I'm just going to focus
on the carbon backbone.

51
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,010
So it is a ring, or
can be a ring.

52
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:12,700
But I'm just going to draw it
as six carbons in a row.

53
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,950
Now there's two kind of
important phases of glycolysis

54
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:16,820
that are good to know.

55
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,420
One, I call the investment
phase.

56
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,000
And the investment phase
actually uses two ATPs.

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,910
   

58
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,270
So you know, the whole purpose
of cellular respiration is to

59
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,650
generate ATPs, but right from
the get-go I actually have to

60
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,360
use two ATPs.

61
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,980
But I use two ATPs and then I'm
essentially going to break

62
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:50,710
up the glucose into two 3-carbon
compounds right here

63
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,730
that actually also have a
phosphate group on them.

64
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,690
The phosphate groups are
coming from those ATPs.

65
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,910
They also have a phosphate
group on them and this is

66
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,520
often called-- well, there's
a lot of names for it.

67
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,910
Sometimes it's called PGAL.

68
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,040
You really don't have
to know this.

69
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:12,360
Or phosphoglyceraldehyde, really
challenging my spelling

70
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,420
skills right here.

71
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,420
That's not that important
to know.

72
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,950
All you have to know
is in this first

73
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,840
phase you use two ATPs.

74
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,350
That's why I call it the
investment phase.

75
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:29,020
If we use a business analogy,
investment phase.

76
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,510
And then each of these two PGAL
molecules can then go

77
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,350
into the payoff phase.

78
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:39,480
So in the payoff phase,
each of these

79
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,280
PGALs turn into pyruvate.

80
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,310
Which is another 3-carbon,
but it's reconfigured.

81
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,670
But the process of it going to
pyruvate-- and let me write

82
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:53,130
pyruvate in blue, because this
is something that, at least

83
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,620
it's good to know the word.

84
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,290
And I'll show you the structure
in a second.

85
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,100
Pyruvate.

86
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,730
Sometimes it's called
pyruvic acid.

87
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,560
Same thing.

88
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,890
And that's essentially the end
product of glycolysis.

89
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,200
So you start off with glucose
in the investment phase.

90
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,480
You end up in this
phosphoglyceraldehyde, which

91
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,540
essentially you broke up your
glucose and you put a

92
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,070
phosphate on either end of it.

93
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,310
And then those each
independently go through the

94
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,490
payoff phase.

95
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:22,029
So you end up with two molecules
of pyruvate for

96
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,220
every molecule of glucose
you started off with.

97
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,860
Now you're saying, hey, Sal,
there was a payoff phase, what

98
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,310
was our payoff?

99
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:35,710
Well our payoff, we got, for
each-- let me write this down

100
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,280
as a payoff phase.

101
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,530
This is our payoff phase.

102
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,460
   

103
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,150
And I apologize for the
white background.

104
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,300
I did it because, the mechanism
I'm showing you, I

105
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,800
copy-and-pasted it from
Wikipedia, and they had a

106
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,390
white background so I just ran
with the white background for

107
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,950
this video.

108
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,910
But I, personally at least, like
the black background a

109
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,040
lot better.

110
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,750
But this is the payoff
phase right here.

111
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,990
And so when we go from the
phosphoglyceraldehyde to the

112
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,080
pyruvate or the pyruvic acid,
we produce two things.

113
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,420
Or I guess we could say we
produce three things.

114
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,860
We produce, each of
these PGALs to

115
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,450
pyruvates produce two ATPs.

116
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,120
   

117
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,880
So I'm going to produce two
ATPs there, I'm going to

118
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,490
produce two ATPs there.

119
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,410
And then they each
produce an NADH.

120
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:27,540
   

121
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,820
And I'll do it in
a darker color.

122
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,070
NADH.

123
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:36,940
   

124
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,910
And of course they're not
producing the whole molecule

125
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:40,800
in a vacuum.

126
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,450
Essentially what they're doing
is they're starting with the

127
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:47,640
raw material of an NAD plus-- so
they start off with an NAD

128
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,260
plus-- and they essentially
reduce

129
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,150
it by adding a hydrogen.

130
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,170
Remember, we learned a couple
of videos ago that you could

131
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,830
view reduction as a
gain in hydrogen.

132
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,110
So the NAD gets reduced
to NADH.

133
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,110
And then later on, these NADHs
are used in electron transport

134
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:08,470
chain to actually
produce ATPs.

135
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:13,090
So the big take-away here, if
I were to write the reaction

136
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:16,390
that we get for glycolysis,
is that you

137
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,640
start off with a glucose.

138
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,480
   

139
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,520
And you need some NAD plus.

140
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,840
   

141
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,870
And actually, for every mole
of glucose, you're going to

142
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,540
need two NAD plusses.

143
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,990
You're going to need two ATPs.

144
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,420
   

145
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,860
So I'm just writing all the
ingredients that we need to

146
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,350
start off with.

147
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,750
And then you're going to need--
well, let me say, these

148
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,290
guys are going to be ADPs before
we turn them to ATPs.

149
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:51,550
So I'll write plus four ADPs.

150
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:57,150
And then, after performing
glycolysis-- and

151
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:57,840
let me write it here.

152
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,055
Let me write also-- sorry
that was ADPs.

153
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:04,950
   

154
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,970
Let me just rewrite that
part right there.

155
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,540
Four ADPs.

156
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,390
And then you maybe need
two phosphate groups.

157
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,820
Because we're going to need
four phosphate groups.

158
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,540
Plus four-- I'll just call
them, sometimes they're

159
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,310
written like that.

160
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,440
But maybe I'll write
it like this.

161
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,740
Four phosphate groups.

162
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,670
   

163
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:30,790
And then once you perform
glycolysis, you have two

164
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:37,680
pyruvates, you have two NADHs.

165
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,660
   

166
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,190
The NAD has been reduced.

167
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,010
It gained a hydrogen.

168
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:45,850
RIG.

169
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:46,590
OIL RIG.

170
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,850
Reduction is gain an electron.

171
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,200
But in the biological
sense, we think of

172
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,110
it gaining the hydrogen.

173
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,320
Because hydrogen is very
non-electronegative, so you're

174
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,260
hogging its electrons.

175
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,020
You've gained its electrons.

176
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:01,810
So two NADHs and then plus these
two ATPs get used in the

177
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:02,720
investment phase.

178
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,390
That's why I kind of wrote
them a little separately.

179
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,860
So these two get used.

180
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,865
So then you're left
with two ADPs.

181
00:08:07,865 --> 00:08:10,860
   

182
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,630
And then these guys,
essentially,

183
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,750
get turned into ATPs.

184
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:19,090
So plus four ATPs.

185
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,570
I guess we didn't need four.

186
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,890
We only needed a net of
two phosphate groups.

187
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,570
Because two jump off of here.

188
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,710
And then we need a total
of two more to get

189
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,560
four jumping on there.

190
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,270
But the big picture is, you
start with a glucose, you end

191
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,020
up with two pyruvates.

192
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,090
You use up two ATPs.

193
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,909
You get four ATPs.

194
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:39,559
So you have a net of
two ATPs formed.

195
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,490
Let me write that very big.

196
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:45,840
Net, what you get out of
glycolysis, is two ATPs.

197
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:51,290
You get two NADHs that can
each later be used in the

198
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:54,600
electron transport chain
to produce three ATPs.

199
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,150
You get two NADHs and you get
two pyruvates, which are going

200
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:02,930
to be re-engineered into
acetyl-CoAs that are going to

201
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,950
be the raw materials for
the Krebs cycle.

202
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:10,690
But these are the outputs
of glycolysis.

203
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,070
So now that we have that big
picture, let's actually look

204
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:13,800
at the mechanism.

205
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,730
Because this is a little
bit more daunting

206
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,440
when you see it here.

207
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,970
But we'll see the same themes
that I just talked about.

208
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:22,000
We're starting with a
glucose right there.

209
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,270
It is a six chain.

210
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,060
It's in a circle, in a ring.

211
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:30,280
One, two, three, four,
five, six carbons.

212
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,110
I could write it like that,
just to make a huge

213
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,226
oversimplification.

214
00:09:34,226 --> 00:09:36,020
It goes through a few steps.

215
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,460
I use an ATP here.

216
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,430
So let me do that in a color.

217
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:42,310
Let me do it in orange whenever
I use an ATP.

218
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,870
I use one ATP there.

219
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,050
I use one ATP there.

220
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,500
And just like I told you,
they have a slightly

221
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,370
different name for it.

222
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:49,880
But this is the

223
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,040
phosphoglyceraldehyde right here.

224
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,480
They call it glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate.

225
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,850
It's the exact same molecule.

226
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,130
But as you can see, just when I
drew it very roughly before,

227
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,020
you've got one, two three
carbons there.

228
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,670
   

229
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,630
And it also has a phosphate
group on it.

230
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,600
The phosphate group's actually
attached to the oxygen.

231
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,160
But for just for simplification
I draw the

232
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,560
phosphate group just
like that.

233
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,750
And I showed that right here.

234
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,440
This was the

235
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,535
phosphoglyceraldehyde right here.

236
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,700
This is the actual structure
up here.

237
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,630
But I think sometimes when you
look at the structure it's

238
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,680
easy to miss the big picture.

239
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,480
And there are two of these.

240
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,600
They kind of say that you can
go back and forth with this,

241
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,190
with this other kind
of isomer of this.

242
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,740
But the important thing is that
you have two of these

243
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,950
compounds that are now
3-carbon compounds.

244
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,520
Glucose has been split.

245
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,650
And now we're ready to enter
the payoff phase.

246
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:43,050
Remember you have two of these
compounds right here.

247
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,610
That's why, when they drew this
mechanism, they wrote

248
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,310
times two right there.

249
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,650
Because the glucose has
been split into

250
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,090
two of these molecules.

251
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,810
So each of the molecules
are now going to

252
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,000
do this right here.

253
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,430
And for each of the
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphates,

254
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:58,600
or PGALs, or
phosphoglyceraldehyde, we can

255
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,920
look at the mechanism and say,
OK look here, there's going to

256
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,270
be an ADP turning into
an ATP there.

257
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,090
So this is plus one ATP.

258
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:12,410
And then we see it again
happening here

259
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,710
on our way to pyruvate.

260
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,100
On our way to pyruvate right,
there then we have another

261
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,330
plus one ATP.

262
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,640
So for each of the PGALs, or
the phosphoglyceraldehydes

263
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:29,290
that were produced, we're
producing two ATPs in the

264
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,200
payoff phase.

265
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,410
Now there were two of these.

266
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:35,040
So total for one glucose, we're
going to produce four

267
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,340
ATPs in the payoff phase.

268
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,420
So in the payoff phase,
four ATPs.

269
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,230
In the investment phase
we used one, two ATPs.

270
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:46,080
So total net ATPs directly
generated from

271
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,070
glycolysis is two ATPs.

272
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,440
Four, gross produced.

273
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,100
But we had to invest two in
the investment phase.

274
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,090
And then the NADs and the NADHs,
we see right here.

275
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,760
For each phosphoglyceraldehyde,
or

276
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,700
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphates or
PGALs or whatever you want to

277
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,540
call them, at this stage right
here you see that we are

278
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,800
reducing NAD plus to NADH.

279
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,935
So this happens once for each
of these compounds.

280
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:16,500
And obviously there
are two of these.

281
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,330
Glucose got split into
two of these guys.

282
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:22,900
So two NADHs are going
to be produced.

283
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,080
And later these are going to
be used in the electron

284
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:30,900
transport chain to actually
each produce three ATPs.

285
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,870
And then finally, when
everything is said and done,

286
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,250
we're left with the pyruvates.

287
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,715
And it's nice, at least that
they made it nice and big.

288
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:39,550
We can take a look at what
a pyruvate looks like.

289
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,600
And just as promised, we can
look at all the oxygen bonds

290
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,140
and all that.

291
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,635
But it's a 3-carbon structure.

292
00:12:45,635 --> 00:12:47,780
It has a 3-carbon backbone.

293
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:51,340
So the end result is that the
carbon, that the glucose got

294
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,280
split in half.

295
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,220
It got oxidized.

296
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,960
Some of the hydrogens got
stripped off of it.

297
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,190
As you can see there's only
three hydrogens here.

298
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,810
We started off with 12
hydrogens in glucose.

299
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:03,750
And now it has its carbons
bonding more

300
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,830
strongly with oxygen.

301
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,110
So it's essentially having its
electrons stolen by the

302
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,160
oxygens, or hogged
by the oxygens.

303
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,430
So carbon has gotten oxidized
in this process.

304
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:14,130
There's going to be more
oxidation left to do.

305
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:20,470
And in the process we were able
to generate two net ATPs

306
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:26,930
and two NADHs that can later
be used to produce ATPs.

307
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,570
Anyway, hopefully you
found that helpful.

308
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:29,608
