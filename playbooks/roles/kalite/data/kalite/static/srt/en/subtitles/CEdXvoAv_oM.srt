1
00:00:01,065 --> 00:00:04,905
This is a picture of the planet : Lubricon VI

2
00:00:04,905 --> 00:00:08,109
And Lubricon VI is a very special planet,

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,696
Because it's made of a yet to be discovered element called Lubrica

4
00:00:12,696 --> 00:00:18,739
And Lubrica is special because if anything glides across the surface if Lubrica

5
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:21,350
It will experience absolutely no friction.

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,211
So if this right over here if a sheet of Lubrica

7
00:00:23,211 --> 00:00:24,550
We're looking at it from the side.

8
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,676
And if we have a brick on top of it,

9
00:00:27,676 --> 00:00:29,897
maybe gliding on top of it, like that,

10
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:36,164
it experiences absolutely, it experiences absolutely no friction.

11
00:00:36,164 --> 00:00:38,913
Now the other things we know about Lubricon VI,

12
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:41,080
it's drifting in deep space,

13
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,332
and it does not have an atmosphere.

14
00:00:43,332 --> 00:00:45,597
In fact, it is a complete vacuum outside

15
00:00:45,597 --> 00:00:47,177
It's in such deep space,

16
00:00:47,177 --> 00:00:48,680
such a remote part of space

17
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,047
that there aren't even a few hydrogen atoms.

18
00:00:51,047 --> 00:00:52,145
right over here,

19
00:00:52,145 --> 00:00:54,782
is a complete, absolute vacuum.

20
00:00:54,782 --> 00:00:56,596
And it's also an ancient planet.

21
00:00:56,596 --> 00:00:59,049
The star that it used to orbit around

22
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:01,113
has long since died away.

23
00:01:01,113 --> 00:01:04,347
So it's just this lonely planet drifting in deep space,

24
00:01:04,347 --> 00:01:06,287
without an atmosphere.

25
00:01:06,287 --> 00:01:08,813
The other thing we know about Lubricon VI,

26
00:01:08,813 --> 00:01:10,806
is that it is a perfect sphere.

27
00:01:10,806 --> 00:01:15,029
it is a perfect sphere..

28
00:01:15,029 --> 00:01:18,883
Now my question to you, for some bizarre reason,

29
00:01:18,883 --> 00:01:21,683
There happens to be, on the surface of Lubricon VI,

30
00:01:21,683 --> 00:01:25,080
so this right over here is the surface of Lubricon VI

31
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,096
There happens to be a sock that is frozen in a block of ice.

32
00:01:29,096 --> 00:01:32,183
So this is my sock, and it's frozen

33
00:01:32,183 --> 00:01:35,262
It's frozen in this block of ice.

34
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:39,125
And it happens to be travelling at 1 km/h.

35
00:01:41,325 --> 00:01:43,178
in that direction.

36
00:01:43,178 --> 00:01:45,375
If we look at it in that macro scale,

37
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:46,731
When we were looking at that planet,

38
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:49,213
Let's say that that is the frozen sock,

39
00:01:49,213 --> 00:01:52,882
and it is traveling along the equator.

40
00:01:52,882 --> 00:01:59,845
It is traveling along the equator of Lubricon, of Lubricon VI.

41
00:01:59,845 --> 00:02:03,824
So my question to you, given all of these assumptions we made,

42
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:05,841
that it has absolutely no atmosphere

43
00:02:05,841 --> 00:02:07,634
It's a perfect sphere,

44
00:02:07,634 --> 00:02:10,261
and Lubrica has absolutely no friction

45
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:12,574
regardless of what's traveling on top of it.

46
00:02:12,574 --> 00:02:15,648
What will happen to this rock,

47
00:02:15,648 --> 00:02:16,445
or, or I should say..

48
00:02:16,445 --> 00:02:19,936
to this frozen sock over time?

49
00:02:23,998 --> 00:02:25,988
To answer that question, we need to

50
00:02:25,988 --> 00:02:27,812
think about all of the forces

51
00:02:27,812 --> 00:02:30,846
that are acting on this frozen block of

52
00:02:30,846 --> 00:02:33,882
I guess, this frozen block of ice and sock.

53
00:02:33,882 --> 00:02:35,358
And first of all, let's think about

54
00:02:35,358 --> 00:02:39,065
the forces that are acting in the radial direction,

55
00:02:39,065 --> 00:02:41,627
inward or outward of the center of the planet.

56
00:02:41,627 --> 00:02:44,367
Well, this planet has a mass,

57
00:02:44,367 --> 00:02:46,300
and so you have a inward force

58
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,583
towards the planet's center of mass.

59
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:52,817
And so you have the force of gravity acting on this block,

60
00:02:52,817 --> 00:02:56,529
going radially inward to the center of the planet.

61
00:02:56,529 --> 00:02:58,395
So I'll draw it like this,

62
00:02:58,395 --> 00:03:03,160
So we have our force of gravity.

63
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,833
It's going radially inward, just like that.

64
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,564
But then we know that the block is

65
00:03:07,564 --> 00:03:10,442
not just biraling towards the center of the earth,

66
00:03:10,442 --> 00:03:11,742
We have the surface here.

67
00:03:11,742 --> 00:03:14,500
It's not going to go through this surface of Lubrica.

68
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,242
We can also assume that Lubrica is a very, very. strong material.

69
00:03:18,242 --> 00:03:22,747
So you also have a normal force

70
00:03:22,747 --> 00:03:29,310
that is keeping the block from spiraling towards the center of the earth.

71
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,115
So this is a normal force.

72
00:03:32,115 --> 00:03:34,201
And one thing I will think about now,

73
00:03:34,201 --> 00:03:37,611
and will adress directly in another tutorial,

74
00:03:37,627 --> 00:03:41,807
is whether this normal force is equal to the

75
00:03:41,807 --> 00:03:44,554
is equal to the force of gravity.

76
00:03:44,554 --> 00:03:46,666
We'll think about that in a future video.

77
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,213
But these are all the forces that are acting

78
00:03:48,213 --> 00:03:49,660
in the radial direction.

79
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,927
either inward(towards the center of the planet)

80
00:03:51,927 --> 00:03:53,228
or outward.

81
00:03:53,228 --> 00:03:55,612
But if we think about the tangential direction,

82
00:03:55,612 --> 00:03:57,415
along the surface of the planet,

83
00:03:57,415 --> 00:03:59,959
there are no net forces.

84
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:02,414
And because there are no net forces,

85
00:04:02,414 --> 00:04:05,558
in this tangential direction, right over here,

86
00:04:05,558 --> 00:04:09,997
this block will not either accelerate, nor decelerate.

87
00:04:09,997 --> 00:04:13,129
There is no air friction, there is no friction,

88
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:14,781
or I should say air resistance,

89
00:04:14,781 --> 00:04:16,643
which is really the friction with the particles

90
00:04:16,643 --> 00:04:18,199
if you had an atmosphere,

91
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,980
It's a complete vacuum, so there's nothing there.

92
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,517
There is no friction with the surface of the planet.

93
00:04:22,517 --> 00:04:24,511
So there's no friction there,

94
00:04:24,511 --> 00:04:29,458
which could have been a force in the tangential direction.

95
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:32,646
So there's absolutely no forces in the tangential direction.

96
00:04:32,646 --> 00:04:34,392
So this block of ice will

97
00:04:34,392 --> 00:04:37,626
actually continue to travel at 1km/h

98
00:04:37,626 --> 00:04:41,027
for all of eternity.

99
00:04:41,027 --> 00:04:42,406
So it'll just continue to do it

100
00:04:42,406 --> 99:59:59,999
given the assumptions that we just made.
