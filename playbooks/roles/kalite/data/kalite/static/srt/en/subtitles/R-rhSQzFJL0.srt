1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,460
   

2
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:06,110
We're asked to factor 35k
squared plus 100k, minus 15.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:10,930
And because we have a non-1
coefficient out here, the best

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:14,600
thing to do is probably to
factor this by grouping.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,870
But before we even do that,
let's see if there's a common

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,250
factor across all of these
terms, and maybe we can get a

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,280
1 coefficient, out there.

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,140
If we can't get a 1 coefficient,
we'll at least

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,660
have a lower coefficient here.

10
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,950
And if we look at all of these
numbers, they all look

11
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,140
divisible by 5.

12
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,680
In fact their greatest
common factor is 5.

13
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,270
So let's at least
factor out a 5.

14
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:36,560
So this is equal to 5
times-- 35k squared

15
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:41,430
divided by 5 is 7k squared.

16
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,090
100k divided by 5 is 20k.

17
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,610
And then negative 15 divided
by 5 is negative 3.

18
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,710
So we were able to factor out a
5, but we still don't have a

19
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,350
1 coefficient here, so we're
still going to have to factor

20
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,300
by grouping.

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,500
But at least the numbers here
are smaller so it'll be easier

22
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,800
to think about it in terms of
finding numbers whose product

23
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,200
is equal to 7 times negative
3, and whose

24
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,140
sum is equal to 20.

25
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,120
So let's think about that.

26
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,970
Let's figure out two numbers
that if I were to add them, or

27
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,680
even better if I were to take
their product, I get 7 times

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:23,530
negative 3, which is equal
to negative 21.

29
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:27,590
And if I were to take their
sum, if I add those two

30
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:34,190
numbers, it needs to
be equal to 20.

31
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,360
Now, once again, because their
product is a negative number,

32
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,820
that means they have to be of
different signs, so when you

33
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,440
add numbers of different signs,
you could view it as

34
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,870
you're taking the difference
of the positive versions.

35
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,930
So the difference between the
positive versions of the

36
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,400
number has to be 20.

37
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,550
So the number that immediately
jumps out is we're probably

38
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,640
going to be dealing with 20
and 21, and 1 will be the

39
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,230
negative, because we want
to get to a positive 20.

40
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,710
So let's think about it.

41
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:01,980
So if we think of 20 and
negative 1, their product is

42
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,530
negative 21.

43
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,100
Sorry.

44
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:10,330
If we take 21 and negative 1,
their product is negative 21.

45
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,060
21 times negative 1
is negative 21.

46
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,200
and if you take their sum,
21 plus negative 1,

47
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,820
that is equal to 20.

48
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,940
So these two numbers right
there fit the bill.

49
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,700
Now, let's break up this 20k
right here into a 21k and a

50
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,430
negative 1k.

51
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:29,770
So let's do that.

52
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,560
So let's rewrite the
whole thing.

53
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,720
We have 5 times 7k squared, and
I'm going to break this

54
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,296
20k into a-- let me do it in
this color right here-- I'm

55
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:48,940
going to break that 20k into
a plus 21k, minus k.

56
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,270
Or you could say minus
1k if you want.

57
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,370
I'm using those two factors
to break it up.

58
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,760
And then we finally have the
minus 3 right there.

59
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,940
Now, the whole point of doing
that is so that we can now

60
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,420
factor each of the two groups.

61
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,400
This could be our first
group right here.

62
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,600
And so what can we factor out
of that group right there?

63
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,530
Well, both of these are
divisible by 7k, so we can

64
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:19,210
write this as 7k times-- 7k
squared divided by 7k, you're

65
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,990
just going to have
a k left over.

66
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:27,570
And then plus 21k divided by
7k is just going to be a 3.

67
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,330
So that factors into that.

68
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:33,290
And then we can look at
this group right here.

69
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,310
They have a common factor.

70
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,930
Well, we can factor out a
negative 1 if we like, so this

71
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:42,160
is equal to negative 1 times--
k divided by negative 1 is k.

72
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,050
Negative 3 divided by negative
1 is positive 3.

73
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,215
And, of course, we have this
5 sitting out there.

74
00:03:48,215 --> 00:03:51,850
   

75
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:55,080
Now, ignoring that 5 for a
second, you see that both of

76
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:02,380
these inside terms have
k plus 3 as a factor.

77
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,360
So we can factor that out.

78
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,150
So let's ignore this
5 for a second.

79
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,860
This inside part right here,
the stuff that's inside the

80
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,260
parentheses, we can factor k
plus 3 out, and it becomes k

81
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:24,980
plus 3, times k plus 3,
times 7k minus 1.

82
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,110
And if this seems a little
bizarre to you, distribute the

83
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,270
k plus 3 on to this.

84
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,970
K plus 3 times 7k is that term,
k plus 3 times negative

85
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,050
1 is that term.

86
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,060
And, of course, the whole
time you have

87
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,640
that 5 sitting outside.

88
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,300
You have that 5.

89
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,650
We don't even have to put
parentheses there.

90
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,770
5 times k plus 3, times
7k minus 1.

91
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,050
And we factored it,
we're done.

92
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:45,466
