1
00:00:00,415 --> 00:00:04,466
Let's review our intuition of what a limit even is.

2
00:00:04,466 --> 00:00:06,604
So, let me draw some axes here.

3
00:00:06,604 --> 00:00:12,549
Let's say this is my y axis, so try to draw my vertical line

4
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:16,952
That right over there is my y axis

5
00:00:16,952 --> 00:00:18,800
and let's say this is my x axis.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,606
I'll focus on the first quadrant, although I don't have to...

7
00:00:21,606 --> 00:00:27,117
Let's say this right over here is my x axis and let me draw a function.

8
00:00:27,117 --> 00:00:30,120
So let's say my function looks something like that.

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:36,180
It could look like anything suitable, so this is y is equal to f of x

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,914
and just for the sake of conceptual understanding

11
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,419
I'm going to say it's not defined at a point.

12
00:00:40,419 --> 00:00:42,871
I didn't have to do this, you could find the limit as X approaches a point

13
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:44,690
where the function actually is defined,

14
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,365
but it becomes that much more interesting, at least for me

15
00:00:47,365 --> 00:00:49,449
where you start to understand where a limit might be relevant

16
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,889
when a function is not defined at some point.

17
00:00:51,889 --> 00:00:54,208
So, the way I've drawn it this function is not defined

18
00:00:54,418 --> 00:00:56,961
when x is equal to c

19
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:05,297
Now, the way that we've though about a limit is,

20
00:01:05,297 --> 00:01:09,381
what does f(x) approach as x approaches c?

21
00:01:09,381 --> 00:01:10,814
So, let's think about that a little bit.

22
00:01:10,814 --> 00:01:15,175
When x is a reasonable bit lower than c,

23
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:19,915
f(x) for our function that we just drew is right over here

24
00:01:19,915 --> 00:01:22,697
y is equal to f(x)

25
00:01:22,697 --> 00:01:32,092
when x gets a little bit closer, then our f(x) is right over there

26
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,757
when x gets even closer; It's really almost at c but not quite c

27
00:01:35,757 --> 00:01:38,995
then our f(x) is right over here

28
00:01:38,995 --> 00:01:40,342
and the way we see it,

29
00:01:40,342 --> 00:01:54,410
we see that our f(x) seems to be that as x gets closer to c it looks like our f(x) is getting closer to some value.

30
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:58,249
right over there, I'll even draw it with a more solid line.

31
00:01:58,249 --> 00:01:59,446
and that was only the case

32
00:01:59,446 --> 00:02:01,845
when x was getting closer to c from the left,

33
00:02:01,845 --> 00:02:04,295
from values less than c.

34
00:02:04,295 --> 00:02:07,844
But what happens when we get closer and closer to c

35
00:02:07,844 --> 00:02:09,893
from values of x that are larger than c,

36
00:02:09,893 --> 00:02:14,008
well when x is over here, f(x) is over here.

37
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,130
That's what f(x) is

38
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:21,309
when x is over there, x gets a little bit closer to c

39
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:23,940
our f(x) is right over there,

40
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,341
when x is just very slightly larger than c,

41
00:02:28,341 --> 00:02:31,993
then our f(x) is right over there

42
00:02:31,993 --> 00:02:34,447
and you see once again it seems to be approaching

43
00:02:34,447 --> 00:02:39,363
that same value

44
00:02:39,363 --> 00:02:44,259
and we call that value, the value f(x) seems to be approaching as x approaches c,

45
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:45,872
we call that value L, or the limit

46
00:02:45,872 --> 00:02:51,511
and we'd call the limit, we don't have to call it L all the time.

47
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:55,564
and the way that we would write that mathematically is,

48
00:02:55,564 --> 00:03:08,496
the limit of f(x) as x approaches c is equal to L

49
00:03:08,496 --> 00:03:11,007
and this is a fine conceptual understanding of limits

50
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:12,599
and it really will take you very far,

51
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:15,142
and you are ready to progress and start taking a lot of limits.

52
00:03:15,142 --> 00:03:20,258
But this isn't a very mathematically rigourous definition of limits.

53
00:03:20,258 --> 00:03:21,926
This sets us up for the intuition,

54
00:03:21,926 --> 00:03:24,498
in the next few videos we will introduce

55
00:03:24,498 --> 00:03:27,278
a mathematically rigourous definition of limits.

56
00:03:27,278 --> 00:03:29,008
That will allow us to do things.

57
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:32,093
Like prove that the limit as x approaches c

58
00:03:32,093 --> 00:03:32,939
truly,

59
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:35,333
is equal to L.
