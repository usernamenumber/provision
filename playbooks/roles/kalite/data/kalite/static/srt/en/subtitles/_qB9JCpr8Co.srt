1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,010
Problem 38.

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,230
In the drawing below,

3
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,930
the figure formed by the squares with sides

4
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:09,260
that are labeled x, y, and z is a right triangle.

5
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:14,360
So the figure, so it's a right triangle.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,160
And then they ask us,

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,030
which equation is true for all values of x, y, and z?

8
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,000
So really, they're just trying to see

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,900
if you remember the Pythagorean Theorem.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,890
And that just tells us that if we have a right triangle,

11
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:39,390
that the sum of the squares of the two smaller sides,

12
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,350
so x squared plus y squared,

13
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,030
is going to be equal to the square of the longest side,

14
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,000
or the side that's opposite the right angle.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,020
Or we also call that the hypotenuse.

16
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,810
So that's equal to z squared.

17
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,040
That's what the Pythagorean Theorem tells us.

18
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,250
And so if we look down here,

19
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,710
only one of those match what I just wrote down,

20
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:06,000
are kind of my restatement of the Pythagorean Theorem.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,050
x squared plus y squared is equal to z squared.

22
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:13,030
And that's this one right there, choice B.

23
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,000
Next problem.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,020
Problem 39.

25
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:22,030
A clothing company created the following diagram for a vest.

26
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,760
So I guess this is somehow a vest.

27
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,040
Maybe it's half of the vest,

28
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,710
because I don't see how I could put that on me.

29
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,520
To show the other side of the vest--

30
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,970
OK, right, so this was half of the vest--

31
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:41,060
the company will reflect the drawing across the y-axis.

32
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,020
What will be the coordinates of C after the reflection?

33
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,480
So when they say reflection, they mean,

34
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,560
literally, just take the image of this

35
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,800
and you flip it over onto the right-hand side.

36
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,020
So I could draw it out, and draw it in blue.

37
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,620
So if I take the reflection,

38
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,020
this line right here is at negative 1.

39
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,320
It's 1 to the left of the y-axis.

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,950
So when I take its reflection, I would draw it right here,

41
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,050
1 to the right of the y-axis.

42
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,180
This line down here,

43
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:15,010
it goes from 1 to the left all the way to 4 to the left.

44
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,670
On this side, it's going to go from 1 to

45
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,060
the right all the way to 4 to the right.

46
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,040
I could keep doing it.

47
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,660
This segment right here, FE, when I flip it,

48
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,080
will become this segment right here.

49
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,030
This segment, DE, right here,

50
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,650
will become this segment.

51
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,010
It'll just look something like this when I go onto that side

52
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:43,020
And then C, right here, is 2 to the left of the y-axis.

53
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,070
So C over here will be 2 to the right of the y-axis.

54
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,410
So it's going to look something like this.

55
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,010
So the vest is going to look something like this.

56
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,000
And then of course, it just dips down like that.

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,020
So that's the right-hand side of the vest.

58
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,020
But they want to know what are the coordinates of C?

59
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,240
So this is C, and this is the C after the reflection.

60
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,010
Maybe I could call it C prime.

61
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:07,040
And so its coordinates are-- its x-coordinate is 2.

62
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,420
And we're 2 to the right;

63
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,690
before, we were 2 to the left, at minus 2.

64
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,260
And its y-coordinate is going to be the same,

65
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,430
it's going to be 7.

66
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,030
2, 7.

67
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,000
So that is choice A.

68
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,920
I'll do it in the next video.

69
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,890
Well, there's only two problems in this video.

70
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,740
So let me go to the next page.

71
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,080
Number 40.

72
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,260
What is the area, in square units,

73
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,880
of trapezoid QRST shown below?

74
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,320
So we need to figure out the area of this.

75
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,010
And they actually even give us a formula.

76
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,000
They gave us the formula for this trapezoid.

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,770
So they're calling it 1/2 times the height,

78
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,010
times base 1 plus base 2.

79
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,600
So essentially, just to give you an intuition of

80
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,710
where this comes from, you're essentially saying,

81
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,030
what's the average width of this trapezoid?

82
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:05,260
So you take 1/2 times the sum of this guy and that guy,

83
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,620
and that gives you the average width.

84
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,790
And then you multiply that times the height.

85
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,610
So just applying this formula,

86
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:16,430
it is 1/2 times my height-- my height is 8--

87
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:21,050
times base 1, let's call this base 1, 20.

88
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,030
Plus base 2.

89
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,570
Base 2 is this 6 right there.

90
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:30,010
So I have 1/2 times 8, which is 4, times 26.

91
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:36,000
And 4 times 26 is equal to 104 square units.

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,230
So that's that right there.

93
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,330
So they're really just testing

94
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,770
whether you can apply this formula.

95
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,370
Whether you can recognize what's the height

96
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,070
and what are the two bases.

97
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,020
Problem 41.

98
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,260
One millimeter is.

99
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:52,040
Well, here they're just seeing if you remember your units.

100
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,360
Let me write it this way.

101
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,050
Deci is equal to 1/10.

102
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,400
Centi is equal to 1/100.

103
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:10,000
And then milli is equal to 1/1000.

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,010
So one millimeter is 1/1000 of a meter.

105
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:19,070
They're just making sure you remember your metric prefixes.

106
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:23,000
Problem 42.

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,060
In the diagram below, hexagon LMNPQR is

108
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:37,630
congruent to hexagon STUVWX.

109
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,500
Congruent just means all the sides are equal

110
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,480
and all the measures of their angles are also equal.

111
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:50,580
So they say, which side is the same length as MN?

112
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,410
So this is MN right there, and we want to know

113
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,280
what side is the same length as that.

114
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,000
So let me make sure that they're not trying to confuse us.

115
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,260
So they start here, they say LMNPQR,

116
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:09,000
and then they say STUVWX.

117
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So they're not confusing us.

118
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,520
These points do correspond.

119
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,660
S corresponds to L, M corresponds to T,

120
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,030
and so forth and so on.

121
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:18,270
So this segment is going to be congruent to

122
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,430
that segment right there.

123
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,570
Segment TU.

124
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:24,530
So MN is the same length as TU.

125
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,190
That is choice B.
