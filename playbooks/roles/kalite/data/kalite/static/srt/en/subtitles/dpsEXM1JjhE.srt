1
00:00:03,816 --> 00:00:06,733
We're in the first room of the Uffizi

2
00:00:06,733 --> 00:00:10,717
and we're looking at the absolutely monumental painting by Cimabue of the

3
00:00:10,717 --> 00:00:14,184
Madonna enthroned originally for Santa Trinita

4
00:00:14,184 --> 00:00:17,249
right here in Florence and it's about 12 feet high

5
00:00:17,249 --> 00:00:21,683
its huge and it's so big because that's a big church Santa Trinita

6
00:00:21,683 --> 00:00:25,633
and it would've needed to be able to be seen from the back of the church

7
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:29,383
and it's important to remember that it would've been behind an altar

8
00:00:29,383 --> 00:00:32,934
raised up from the ground in the space of a church very different

9
00:00:32,934 --> 00:00:36,399
than the space that we see it in today, so all of that gold would've glistened

10
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,566
in a very different way and kind of important because the church

11
00:00:39,566 --> 00:00:43,317
is relatively dark and so that gold would've been really wonderful and luminous

12
00:00:43,317 --> 00:00:45,484
but ofcourse it also has an important symbolic value

13
00:00:45,484 --> 00:00:47,351
that's the light of heaven

14
00:00:47,351 --> 00:00:50,083
one of the things that we look at when we think about Cimabue

15
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:54,018
I think going back to Vasari who really starts his history with a renaissance

16
00:00:54,018 --> 00:00:58,351
of Cimabue is some hints of the beginnings of the renaissance

17
00:00:58,351 --> 00:01:03,684
and so when we look at this we begin to see some of that illusionism

18
00:01:03,684 --> 00:01:06,518
that we think about with the renaissance

19
00:01:06,518 --> 00:01:10,899
right now ofcourse this is 2020 hindsight and - exactly - Vasari

20
00:01:10,899 --> 00:01:14,917
was certainly not a careful art historian but I think that there

21
00:01:14,917 --> 00:01:17,050
is a space that she can sit in

22
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,918
it's not a rational space -no- and you had mentioned

23
00:01:19,918 --> 00:01:22,668
that this is the space of heaven and so I think there's

24
00:01:22,668 --> 00:01:25,317
a certain degree of liaisons now this is a painting

25
00:01:25,317 --> 00:01:28,166
that would've been hung fairly high and yet somehow

26
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:31,733
we're looking down at the step on which the Virgin's

27
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:34,350
feet rest, we're looking actually down on the seat

28
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,483
but we're looking across at the old testiment prophits down below

29
00:01:38,483 --> 00:01:42,333
and up at Mary herself and so there's all kinds of contradictions here

30
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:47,582
right and yet we can read that the sides of her throne are closer

31
00:01:47,582 --> 00:01:51,684
to us, that the parts of the throne by her shoulders are

32
00:01:51,684 --> 00:01:55,417
set back into space, and theres even a kind of velocity that moves

33
00:01:55,417 --> 00:01:59,033
her eye back into space if you look at the lines that are painted

34
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:02,382
on the steps for instance

35
00:02:02,382 --> 00:02:04,768
where the virgins feet rest, it does bring us back into space

36
00:02:04,768 --> 00:02:06,916
and it creates a kind of visual pathway

37
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:09,383
and those figures of the prophits in the fort run are even closer

38
00:02:09,383 --> 00:02:12,367
still now let's start down with them, okay, because

39
00:02:12,367 --> 00:02:15,817
this is curious they're in a kind of impossible space in the

40
00:02:15,817 --> 00:02:19,333
basement under the throne, I mean what is that? (laughs)

41
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:22,017
they did the predict the coming of Christ right?

42
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:24,500
okay so this is very much a Christian perspective and the

43
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,717
Christians are looking back to the old testament

44
00:02:26,717 --> 00:02:29,901
laying literally the foundation upon which Christianity is built

45
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:31,833
so I guess it makes sense that they're below

46
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:34,684
they're holding scrolls as opposed to books and that's how

47
00:02:34,684 --> 00:02:37,683
we can recognize instantly that they're not the evangelists

48
00:02:37,683 --> 00:02:39,899
that they're actually from the old testament

49
00:02:39,899 --> 00:02:45,150
Mary was an enormously important figure at this time

50
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:50,101
Christ was a little terrifying to the medieval mind and Mary grew

51
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:52,467
an importance what is known as the cult of the Madonna

52
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:55,549
the cult of the Virgin as an intercessor to her son

53
00:02:55,549 --> 00:02:59,066
that is people would pray to the Virgin Mary and hopefully

54
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:01,949
she would speak maybe to God on your behalf

55
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:05,484
that's right and that's exactly how Cimabue shows Mary to us here

56
00:03:05,484 --> 00:03:09,467
she's pointing to Christ in a way addressing the viewer

57
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:13,666
and then pointing to the Christ child her son and saying this

58
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,770
is the pathway to God

59
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:18,482
the pathway to salvation is through Christ

60
00:03:18,482 --> 00:03:22,250
now Christ for his part is looking back to us, you're absolutely right

61
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,102
his two fingers are raised as if he's blessing us

62
00:03:25,102 --> 00:03:28,583
now the rendering of Christ is really interesting because of course

63
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:33,082
compared to Mary he's quite small and he's the appropriate scale

64
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:37,051
the problem is, atleast to our modern eyes is that he doesn't

65
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:40,150
look like an infant his head is small in relationship to his body

66
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:44,684
and he kind of has the features of a grown man -yeah- except in a little baby

67
00:03:44,684 --> 00:03:47,733
and one of the ways our historians have acknowledged this

68
00:03:47,733 --> 00:03:53,249
is that this is a symbolic rendering that Christ is shown as

69
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:56,884
a man of wisdom and age is sometimes a way of expressing that

70
00:03:56,884 --> 00:04:01,917
symbolically then here is an all knowing God but here

71
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:03,249
is God as a child

72
00:04:03,249 --> 00:04:05,333
although later in the renaissance that can eventually

73
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,400
dissipate and we'll see a chubby baby in it's place

74
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,667
so i'm noticing that the long gated features of Mary

75
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:16,783
her long nose the sort of stylization around her eyes

76
00:04:16,783 --> 00:04:22,667
those almond shapes, her very elongated hand and that's coming from

77
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:26,616
a Byzantine tradition that Cimabue is painting in

78
00:04:26,616 --> 00:04:29,632
what's interesting Zantham which had been a source of

79
00:04:29,632 --> 00:04:33,618
power and culture in the east actually a lot of the artists

80
00:04:33,618 --> 00:04:38,799
and intellectuals had come to Italy in part because of invasions

81
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:43,768
and so there was at this moment at the end of 1200s at the beginning

82
00:04:43,768 --> 00:04:48,684
of the 1300s there was this infusion of intellectual capital

83
00:04:48,684 --> 00:04:52,900
of artistic tradition that comes into Italy and really revitalizes

84
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,467
the traditions here

85
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:58,799
so sometimes our historians refer to this period as the Italo Byzantine

86
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:02,066
on the other hand Cimabue is doing things that point toward the renaissance

87
00:05:02,066 --> 00:05:07,834
he's using gold lines to articulate the folds of drapery

88
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:11,667
but those lines instead of just sort of being flat and decorative

89
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:17,366
really begin to describe a sense of the three dimensional folds of drapery

90
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:21,382
and Mary herself begins to sort of fill out and be a little bit less

91
00:05:21,382 --> 00:05:27,833
of that thin elongated figure without any mass that we see before this

92
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:31,067
we do have a sense of Mary actually holding the Christ child to some extent

93
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:33,617
you know, keeping her -it's a little weightless-

94
00:05:33,617 --> 00:05:36,316
yeah but the figures are weightless and the striations

95
00:05:36,316 --> 00:05:39,249
of those gold lines that you were speaking about help to emphasize

96
00:05:39,249 --> 00:05:41,300
that almost two dimensionality of those figures

97
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,384
but there are traces of chiaroscuro in the neck and the nose

98
00:05:45,384 --> 00:05:47,799
perhaps in the faces of the angels

99
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:51,033
you know these are hints, they're subtle but ofcourse we can look

100
00:05:51,033 --> 00:05:54,066
back now and see that this is the beginning of a long

101
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:58,533
development of increasing naturalism which people like Vasari

102
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:01,400
will look back to Cimabue as the root of

103
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,783
look for example the two foreground angels on either side of the throne

104
00:06:04,783 --> 00:06:08,164
half of their body's behind the throne

105
00:06:08,164 --> 00:06:11,916
giving us a real illusion of space and their foot comes forward

106
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:15,602
and on the left the angels foot comes even a little off the throne

107
00:06:15,602 --> 00:06:19,283
but they are still very decorative and one could only imagine

108
00:06:19,283 --> 00:06:23,866
what those angels in the background are actually standing on (laughs)

109
00:06:23,866 --> 00:06:25,332
and you know the throne itself is so decorative

110
00:06:25,332 --> 00:06:27,999
maybe we should just take one moment and talk about the fact

111
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:31,382
that this is on wood that this is painted with tempera

112
00:06:31,382 --> 00:06:35,617
that the artist is using very thin gold leaves, so that's real gold there

113
00:06:35,617 --> 00:06:38,951
that's been attached to the wood surface

114
00:06:38,951 --> 00:06:42,606
and we shouldn't underestimate the effort that it takes to create

115
00:06:42,606 --> 00:06:46,500
a panel of wood that can survive for so many hundreds of years

116
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,567
without warping without cracking significantly

117
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:52,817
and so there's a lot of workmanship here that sometimes i think

118
00:06:52,817 --> 00:06:57,533
in the era of 21st century go to the art store and buy your supplies

119
00:06:57,533 --> 00:07:00,716
we kind of forget about this "handmadeness"

120
00:07:00,716 --> 00:07:04,032
that we have here, in all aspects of the materials

121
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:07,166
and I think that's an important point there was not so much the seperation

122
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:10,150
between the art and the craft as we understand it now

123
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,000
you know he is painter and craftsman

124
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,816
mixing his paints, working on the wood panel, preparing it

125
00:07:16,816 --> 99:59:59,999
and painting it
