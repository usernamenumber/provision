1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620
   

2
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,940
Let's review our notions
of subspaces again.

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,870
And then let's see if we can
define some interesting

4
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,230
subspaces dealing with
matrices and vectors.

5
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:16,040
So a subspace-- let's say that I
have some subspace-- oh, let

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,210
me just call it some
subspace s.

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,560
This is a subspace if the
following are true-- and this

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,670
is all a review-- that the 0
vector-- I'll just do it like

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,330
that-- the 0 vector,
is a member of s.

10
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,190
So it contains the 0 vector.

11
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:37,480
Then if v1 and v2 are both
members of my subspace, then

12
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:43,330
v1 plus v2 is also a member
of my subspace.

13
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,580
So that's just saying that
the subspaces are

14
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,530
closed under addition.

15
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,680
You can add any of their two
members and you'll get another

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,280
member of the subspace.

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,560
And then the last requirement,
if you remember, is that

18
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,950
subspaces are closed under
multiplication.

19
00:00:54,950 --> 00:01:00,320
So that if c is real number,
and it's just a scalar.

20
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,400
And if I multiply, and v1 is a
member of my subspace, then if

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,250
I multiply that arbitrary real
number times my member of my

22
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,380
subspace, v1, I'm going
to get another

23
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,110
member of the subspace.

24
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,150
So it's closed under
multiplication.

25
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,340
These were all of what
a subspace is.

26
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,110
This is our definition
of a subspace.

27
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:21,440
If you call something
a subspace,

28
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,940
these need to be true.

29
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,280
Now let's see if we can do
something interesting with

30
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,720
what we understand about matrix
vector multiplication.

31
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,340
Let's say I have the matrix
a-- I'll make it nice and

32
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,060
bold-- and it's an
m by n matrix.

33
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,510
And I'm interested in the
following situation; I want to

34
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:44,280
set up the homogeneous
equation.

35
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,660
And we'll talk about why
it's homogeneous.

36
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,760
Well, I'll tell you
in a second.

37
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,500
So let's say we set
up the equation.

38
00:01:49,500 --> 00:02:00,400
My matrix a times vector x
is equal to the 0 vector.

39
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,390
This is a homogeneous equation,

40
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,740
because we have a 0 there.

41
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,480
   

42
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,740
And I want to ask
the question-- I

43
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,870
talked about subspaces.

44
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:15,650
If I take all of the x's--
if I take the world, the

45
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:20,360
universe, the set of all of
the x's that satisfy this

46
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,420
equation, do I have
a valid subspace?

47
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,470
Let's think about this.

48
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:30,540
I want to take all of the x's
that are a member of Rn.

49
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,450
Remember, if our matrix a has
n columns, then I've only

50
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:39,090
defined this matrix vector
multiplication.

51
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,620
If x is a member of r, and if
x has to have exactly n

52
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,720
components, only then
is it defined.

53
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,720
So let me define a set of all
the vectors that are a member

54
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:54,420
of Rn where they satisfy the
equation a times my vector x

55
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,600
is equal to the 0 vector.

56
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,820
So my question is, is
this a subspace?

57
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,580
Is this a valid subspace?

58
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,730
So the first question is, does
it contain the 0 vector?

59
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,430
Well in order for this to
contain the 0 vector, the 0

60
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:13,390
vector must satisfy
this equation.

61
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:19,890
So what is any m by n matrix
a times the 0 vector?

62
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,920
   

63
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,770
Let's write out my matrix
a-- my matrix a, a[1,1]

64
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:28,820
a[1,2]

65
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,580
all the way to a[1,n]

66
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,810
and then this, as we go down
a column, we go all

67
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,470
the way down to a[m,1]

68
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,110
and then as we go all the
way to the bottom

69
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,100
right, we go to a[m,n]

70
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:45,740
and I'm going to multiply that
times the 0 vector that has

71
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,850
exactly n components.

72
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,680
So the 0 vector with n
components is 0, 0, and you're

73
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,940
going to have n of these.

74
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,165
The number of components here
has to be the exact same

75
00:03:56,165 --> 00:03:58,560
number of the number of columns
you have. But when you

76
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,100
take this product, this
matrix vector

77
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,370
product, what do you get?

78
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,790
What do we get?

79
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,500
Well, this first term up here
is going to be a[1,1]

80
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,000
time 0, plus a[1,2]

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,820
times 0, plus each of
these terms times 0.

82
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,780
And you add them
all up. a[1,1]

83
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,500
times 0, plus a[1,2]

84
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:16,800
plus a[1,2]

85
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,959
times 0, all the way to a[1,n]

86
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,470
and times 0.

87
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,130
So you get 0.

88
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,540
Now this term is going
to be a[2,1]

89
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,990
times 0, plus a[2,2]

90
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,770
times 0, plus a[2,3]

91
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,850
times 0, all the way to a[2,n]

92
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:32,560
times 0.

93
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,880
That's, obviously,
going to be 0.

94
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,630
And you're going to keep doing
that because all of these are,

95
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,880
essentially,-- you can kind of
view it as the dot product

96
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,800
of-- I haven't defined dot
products with row vectors and

97
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,710
column vectors, but I think you
get the idea-- the sum of

98
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,370
each of these elements,
multiplied with the

99
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,890
corresponding component
in this vector.

100
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,860
And, of course, you're just
always multiplying by 0 and

101
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,340
then adding up.

102
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,270
So you're going to get nothing
but a bunch of 0's.

103
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,280
So the 0 vector does satisfied
the equation.

104
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,860
A times the 0 vector is
equal to the 0 vector.

105
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,510
And this is a very
unconventional notation.

106
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,210
I'm just writing it like that,
because I don't feel like

107
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,710
bolding out my 0's all the time
to make you realize that

108
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,740
that's a vector.

109
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,550
So we meet our first
requirement.

110
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,360
The 0 vector is a member
of the set.

111
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,710
So let me define my set here.

112
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,500
Let me define it n.

113
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,120
And I'll tell you in a second
why I'm calling it n.

114
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,730
So we now know that
the 0 vector is a

115
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,440
member of my set n.

116
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,230
Now let's say I have two
vectors, v1 and v2 that are

117
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,080
members-- let me write this.

118
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:45,750
So let's say I have two factors,
v1, and v2, that are

119
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,620
both members of our set.

120
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,740
What does that mean?

121
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,950
That means that they both
satisfy this equation.

122
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:57,360
So that means that a-- my matrix
a-- times vector 1 is

123
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,160
equal to 0.

124
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,520
This is by definition.

125
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,440
I'm saying that they're a member
of the set, which means

126
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,910
they must satisfy this.

127
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:07,280
And that also means that
a times vector 2 is

128
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,070
equal to our 0 vector.

129
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:17,720
So in order for this to be
closed under addition, a times

130
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,470
vector 1 plus vector 2, the
sum of these two vectors

131
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,910
should also be a member of n.

132
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,340
But let's figure out
what this is.

133
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,010
The sum of these two vectors
is this vector right here.

134
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,060
This is equal to--
and I haven't

135
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,130
proven this to you yet.

136
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,710
I haven't made a video
where I prove this.

137
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:34,110
But it's very easy to prove just
using the definition of

138
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,510
matrix vector multiplication,
that matrix vector

139
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:40,030
multiplication does display
the distributive property.

140
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,740
And maybe I'll make a video on
that, but literally, you just

141
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,270
have to go through the mechanics
of each of the

142
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,340
terms.

143
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,580
This is equal to a[v,1]

144
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,720
plus a[v,2]

145
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,360
And we know that this is
equal to the 0 vector.

146
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,460
And this is equal
to the 0 vector.

147
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,770
And if you add the 0 vector to
itself, this whole thing is

148
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,900
going to be equal
to the 0 vector.

149
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,940
So if v1 is a member of n, and
v2 is a member of n, which

150
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,680
means they both satisfy this
equation, then v1 plus v2 is

151
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,940
definitely still
a member of n.

152
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,110
Because when I multiply
a times that, I get

153
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,830
the 0 vector again.

154
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,120
So let me write that
result, as well.

155
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:25,390
   

156
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:31,140
So we now know that v1 plus
v2 is also a member of n.

157
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,780
And the last thing we have to
show is that it's closed under

158
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,420
multiplication.

159
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:41,930
Let's say that v1 is a member
of our space that I defined

160
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,440
here, where they satisfy
this equation.

161
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:51,240
What about c times v1?

162
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,370
Is that a member of n?

163
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,350
Well let's think about it.

164
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:59,400
What's our matrix a times
the vector-- right?

165
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,690
I'm just multiplying this
times the scale.

166
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,940
I'm just going to get
another vector.

167
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,580
I don't want to write
a capital v there.

168
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,850
Lowercase v, so it's a vector.

169
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,300
What's this equal to?

170
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,600
Well, once again, I haven't
prove it to you yet, but it's

171
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,660
actually a very straightforward
thing to do,

172
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,820
to show that when you're dealing
with scalars, if you

173
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,140
have a scalar here, it doesn't
matter if you multiply the

174
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:23,750
scalar times the vector before
multiplying it times the

175
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,860
matrix or multiplying the matrix
times the vector, and

176
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,790
then doing the scalar.

177
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:31,210
So it's fairly straightforward
to prove that this is equal to

178
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:36,360
c times our matrix a-- I'll make
that nice and bold, times

179
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,980
our vector v.

180
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,720
That these two things
are equivalent.

181
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,940
Maybe I should just churn out
the video that does this, but

182
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,210
I'll leave it to you.

183
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,890
You, literally, just go
through the mechanics

184
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:46,620
component by component.

185
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,560
And you show this.

186
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:56,130
But clearly, if there's is true,
we already know that v1

187
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,460
is a member of our set, which
means that a times v1 is equal

188
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,130
to the 0 vector.

189
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,410
And so that means this will
reduce to c times the 0

190
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:09,000
vector, which is still
the 0 vector.

191
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,860
So c[v,1]

192
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,430
is definitely a member of n.

193
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,150
So it's closed under
multiplication.

194
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,960
And I kind of assumed
this right here.

195
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,660
But maybe I'll prove that
in a different video.

196
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,110
But I want to do all this to
show that this set n is a

197
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,380
valid subspace.

198
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,640
This is a valid subspace.

199
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,190
It contains a 0 vector.

200
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,560
It's close under addition.

201
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,380
It's close under
multiplication.

202
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,380
And we actually have a special
name for this.

203
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:46,240
We call this right here, we call
n, the null space of a.

204
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,590
Or we could write n is equal
to-- maybe I shouldn't have

205
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,090
written an n.

206
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,550
Let me write orange in there.

207
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:58,430
Our orange n is equal to-- the
notation is just the null

208
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,360
space of a.

209
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,180
Or we could write the null space
is equal to the orange

210
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,050
notation of n, and literally,
if I just give you some

211
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:08,010
arbitrary matrix a, and
I say, hey, find me n

212
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,810
of a, what is that?

213
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:16,500
Literally, your goal is to find
the set of all x's that

214
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,020
satisfy the equation a times
x is equal to 0.

215
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,790
And I'm going to do that
in the next video.

216
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:22,922
