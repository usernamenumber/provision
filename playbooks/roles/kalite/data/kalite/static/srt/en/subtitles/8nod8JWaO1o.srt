1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
   

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,800
Let's keep going.

3
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,230
We're on problem number six
on page 278 of the data

4
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,450
sufficiency sample questions.

5
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:07,800
So let's see.

6
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,390
They've drawn a little figure.

7
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,410
And they say, in the
figure above,

8
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,850
lines k and m are parallel.

9
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,310
I guess I better draw
lines k and m.

10
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:17,930
   

11
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,250
That's line k.

12
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,970
That's line m.

13
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,410
And then they have a
transversal line.

14
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,990
And we've gone over all of this
in the geometry playlist.

15
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,600
You might want to review
it if this looks

16
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,250
completely foreign to you.

17
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,370
And so this is line k.

18
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,400
This is line m.

19
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,250
And they're calling this angle
right here x degrees.

20
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,760
This line here is z degrees.

21
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,540
And then this angle here--
did I say line?

22
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,340
That's an angle.

23
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,030
This angle here is y degrees.

24
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,710
   

25
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,640
And the question is-- question
number six-- in the figure

26
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,480
above, if lines k and m are
parallel -- so they're both

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,709
parallel -- what is
the value of x?

28
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:05,140
OK.

29
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,100
In statement number one
they tell us that y is

30
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:15,480
equal to 120 degrees.

31
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:20,920
So if y is equal to 120-- let me
do this one in magenta-- so

32
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,050
this is based on this
is equal to 120.

33
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,610
What can we figure out?

34
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:31,290
Well, this y is supplementary
to z, right?

35
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,910
So when you add these two angles
together, it's 180

36
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:35,610
degrees, right?

37
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,590
Because you're completing
kind of a whole

38
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,010
1/2 arc, or 1/2 circle.

39
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:46,300
So z would be 60 degrees.

40
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,770
And then you could say that --
there's all these words that

41
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,090
people use in geometry class.

42
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,110
But if you have two parallel
lines and a transversal, then

43
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,220
these opposite inside angles
are going to be the same.

44
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,180
So you know that x is
equal to 60 degrees.

45
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,670
Another way you could have done
it, you could have said,

46
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:05,390
OK, if y is equal to 120
degrees, then y and this angle

47
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,150
right here are also
supplementary, right?

48
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,780
Because they complete
this whole arc.

49
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,190
So y plus this angle have
to be equal to 180.

50
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,350
So this angle would
also be 60.

51
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,530
And then you use what you
learn in geometry class.

52
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:23,230
That corresponding angles on a
transversal intersecting two

53
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,610
parallel lines, that
they're also equal.

54
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,200
So you'd also get to the
same conclusion.

55
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,660
That x is equal to 60.

56
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,890
So either way, statement number
one alone is enough to

57
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:31,740
figure out x.

58
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,360
Now, what did they give us
for statement number two?

59
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,730
And I'll do that in
a different color.

60
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:41,190
Statement number two.
z is equal to 60.

61
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,510
Well, this actually gives us the
same information as that.

62
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,810
Because if we know that z is
equal to 60, then we know that

63
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,690
y is going to be equal to 120,
even if the book never told us

64
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,550
this the first time.

65
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,310
So z is equal to 60 is the
same information as

66
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,750
y is equal to 120.

67
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,850
And so you can make the exact
same argument as you did for

68
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:57,350
the first one.

69
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:00,620
So actually point number two
alone is also enough to figure

70
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,290
out that x is equal to 60.

71
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,960
You actually didn't even
have to figure it out.

72
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,410
An important skill, eventually,
when you're when

73
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,060
you're taking the GMAT, is to
be able just look at it and

74
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,290
say, oh, I can figure that
out, and then move on.

75
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,830
Instead of actually having
to figure out that

76
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,920
x is equal to 60.

77
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,652
But anyway.

78
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:14,660
soon.

79
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,230
So this one is, either of them
alone are sufficient.

80
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,510
So that's d.

81
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:18,900
OK.

82
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,150
Problem number seven.

83
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,650
   

84
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,690
What percentage of a
group of people are

85
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,430
women with red hair?

86
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:36,320
So women with red hair,
percentage.

87
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,570
So statement number one tells
us, of the women in the group,

88
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,740
5% have red hair.

89
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:50,780
5% of women have red hair.

90
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,870
That alone doesn't tell me what
percentage of the entire

91
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,300
group are women with red hair,
because I don't know how large

92
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:57,980
the whole group is.

93
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:04,790
There could be 20 women, and
there could be 10 million men.

94
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,450
Or there could be 20
women and no men.

95
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:11,340
So that still doesn't help me
with what percentage of the

96
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,050
group are women with red hair.

97
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:17,510
   

98
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:22,360
Statement number two tells us,
of the men in the group, 10%

99
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,220
have red hair.

100
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:30,390
So 10% of men have red hair.

101
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,510
That's really useless.

102
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:37,850
Once again, I don't know
how big the group is.

103
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:38,660
Think about it.

104
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,500
If I have 20 women, then that
tells me that there's one

105
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,390
woman with red hair.

106
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,690
And I don't know I have
20 women, right?

107
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,270
But I still don't know how
many men there are.

108
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:53,010
If there are 20 women and one
has red hair, there could be a

109
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:53,950
million men.

110
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,130
There could be no man.

111
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,160
In which case this answer would
turn out very different.

112
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,850
What percentage of the group
are women with red hair?

113
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,030
So both of these combined are
fairly useless questions.

114
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,250
And actually, let me draw a Venn
diagram, because I think

115
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,660
it's useful.

116
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:13,120
So the entire group is
both women and men.

117
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,890
I'll draw a Venn rectangle
instead.

118
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:17,930
So that's women and men.

119
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:21,960
So some percentage of-- we
don't know how many women

120
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,730
there are, and how many men.

121
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,590
So this area is women.

122
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:30,200
   

123
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,780
That's the number of women.

124
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,310
And this is the number of men.

125
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,690
   

126
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,800
And this first point tells
us that 5% of the

127
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,720
women have red hair.

128
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,400
So it just tells us that 5% of
this area is red, right?

129
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,300
Which is maybe, I don't
know, I'll eyeball it.

130
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,380
It's like that.

131
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,760
And then this says 10% of
the men have red hair.

132
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,350
So maybe that area looks
something like that.

133
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,250
   

134
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,370
So we know the ratio of
this to this box.

135
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,530
And we know the ratio of this
to this box is 10%.

136
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:07,160
But we don't know the ratio of
this to the entire universe,

137
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,360
because we don't know how many--
we don't know what the

138
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,330
total population sizes,
so we'll never be able

139
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,320
to figure it out.

140
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,150
Anyway, so that is e.

141
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:17,620
All right.

142
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,670
Problem number eight.

143
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,470
Maybe I missed something.

144
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,720
Problem eight.

145
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,120
   

146
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,250
If r and s are positive
integers, you r is what

147
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,780
percent of s?

148
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:38,540
So r, s, positive integers.

149
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:43,420
And we want to know r is
what percent of s?

150
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,490
So essentially, we just want to
figure out what r over s is

151
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,210
equal to, right?

152
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,370
This'll give us some decimal.

153
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,080
And then you multiply by 100,
and you know the percentage.

154
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,800
So if you can figure out this,
you can figure out the

155
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,350
percentage of r is what
percentage of s.

156
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,960
So statement number one.

157
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,716
They tell us that r
is equal to 3/4s.

158
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:07,720
   

159
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,450
Well, let's just do a little
algebraic manipulation.

160
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,240
We're trying to get r over
s, so let's divide

161
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,390
both sides by s.

162
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:17,350
So you get r over s is
equal to 3 over 4.

163
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,110
So there we got it.

164
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,220
We got the answer.

165
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,920
That was a helpful data point.

166
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,960
All we needed was that
data point, actually.

167
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,290
Let's see what the second
data point gives us.

168
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,520
Data point two.

169
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,000
r divided by s-- well, they
wrote it like this; they wrote

170
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,160
it the way you did in second
grade-- r divided by s is

171
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,220
equal to 75 over 100.

172
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,400
Well, that's just another way
of just writing r over s is

173
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,720
equal to 75 over 100,
which is exactly the

174
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,870
same thing as this.

175
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:49,120
So these are actually equivalent
statements, almost.

176
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,400
So each of them independently
are enough to figure out r

177
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,760
over s, or what percentage
r is of s.

178
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,300
All right.

179
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,940
Problem number nine.

180
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,145
   

181
00:08:01,145 --> 00:08:03,340
I'll draw a line here, I don't
want to get too messy.

182
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,360
   

183
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,416
Is it true that a is
greater than b?

184
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:15,460
I sometimes find these
statements slightly humorous.

185
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,250
Is it true that a is
greater than b?

186
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,160
   

187
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,720
All right.

188
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:27,160
The first statement is,
2a is greater than 2b.

189
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,330
So I don't know if you remember
from algebra, but you

190
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,520
can operate on inequalities
the exact same way you can

191
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,640
operate on equalities, or I
guess you call them equations.

192
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,100
And you just have to remember
that if you multiply or divide

193
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,830
by a negative number, that
you have to swap

194
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,169
the inequality sign.

195
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:47,670
Well, luckily in this case, we
could divide both sides by a

196
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,400
positive number.

197
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,320
So if you multiplying or
dividing by a positive on both

198
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,660
sides, you don't have to
change the inequality.

199
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,230
So just divide both
sides by 2.

200
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,120
And you can test that with
numbers, just to see why that

201
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,680
make sense.

202
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,900
So you divide both sides by 2.

203
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,190
And you get a is
greater than b.

204
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,020
So that's all we needed.

205
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,290
We just needed statement one.

206
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,520
Now let's see what statement
two does for us.

207
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:13,390
Statement two tells us
that a plus c is

208
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,240
greater than b plus c.

209
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,850
Well, once again, we can
subtract c from both sides of

210
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,190
this equation, or from both
sides of this inequality,

211
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:24,190
without changing the
inequality sign.

212
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,540
So you subtract c
from both sides.

213
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,920
And once again, you get
a is greater than b.

214
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,740
So each of these statements
independently are enough for

215
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,940
us to figure out that it
is true, that a is

216
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,740
greater than b.

217
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,040
Let's do one more.

218
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,780
Actually, I've run out of
chalkboard space, so I might

219
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,160
as well just wait until
the next video.

220
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,410

221
