1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
   

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,430
So I've been sent this definite
integral problem and it seemed

3
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:06,270
as good as any, and I think the
key with this is just to

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,390
see a lot of examples.

5
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:08,820
So let's do it.

6
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:19,290
This definite integral is from
pi over 2 to pi of minus cosine

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:27,610
squared of x times sin of x dx.

8
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,770
So before we just chug
through the math and do the

9
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:33,510
antiderivatives and use the
fundamental theorem of calculus

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,970
to evaluate the definite
integral, let's think about

11
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,170
what we're even doing.

12
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,770
So I've graphed this function
right here, minus cosine

13
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,940
squared of x times sin of x.

14
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,980
And what we care about,
we're defining the definite

15
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,670
integral between pi over 2,
which is roughly here.

16
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,490
Let me see if I can make
this a little bit bigger.

17
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:57,670
So between pi over 2 which is
right there, and between pi.

18
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,190
So the definite integral of
this function between here and

19
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,970
here is essentially the area of
the curve between the

20
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:04,670
curve and the x-axis.

21
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,370
And since the a curve is below
the x-axis here, this area is

22
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,870
going to be a negative number.

23
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,400
So that gives us
immediately an intuition.

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,520
We should be getting a negative
number when we evaluate this

25
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,160
and just to prove this I
actually typed it in up here.

26
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,540
So let's now evaluate
this definite integral.

27
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,320
   

28
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,400
Now I'll rearrange some of the
terms here just to make it a

29
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,940
little bit easier to read.

30
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,860
But the way I always think
about it is, well I have

31
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,760
a cosine and a sin.

32
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,060
The cosine is squared, so all
these crazy things are

33
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:39,770
happening to it, so it seems
like I could use substitution

34
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,320
or the reverse chain
rules some out here.

35
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,820
And what was the chain rule?

36
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:52,060
The chain rule said if I took
the derivative of f of g of x

37
00:01:52,060 --> 00:02:01,750
that this is equal to f prime
of g of x times g prime of x.

38
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,610
That might completely confuse
you, but I just wrote that here

39
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:09,160
because we could say, well what
if g of x is cosine of x. f

40
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,540
prime of g of x is the cosine
of x squared, and then the

41
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,875
derivative of g of x or the
derivative of cosine

42
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,080
of x is sin of x.

43
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,270
Well it's actually minus sin of
x, and we have a minus sin

44
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,030
here, so that works
out well too.

45
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,760
If this confuse you, ignore it.

46
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,260
Well essentially we're just
going to do the same thing,

47
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,470
but we're going to do
it with substitution.

48
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,950
So let me do it
with substitution.

49
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,985
Let me a erase this if
this confuses people.

50
00:02:29,985 --> 00:02:33,360
   

51
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,580
I want to do it however it
is least confusing to you.

52
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,260
OK let me erase that.

53
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,190
Actually, let me do it with
substitution, just because the

54
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,540
way I was just doing is kind
of my shortcut back in the

55
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,530
day when I was a mathlete.

56
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,530
But it's good to be able to do
it with substitution, helps you

57
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,000
from making careless mistakes.

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,280
So let me rewrite
this first of all.

59
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,700
This is the same thing as the
integral from pi over 2 to

60
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:04,670
pi of cosine squared of x.

61
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:09,340
Actually let me write that
as cosine of x squared.

62
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,810
Same thing, right.

63
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:18,730
Times minus sin of x dx.

64
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,350
And now it should
be clearer to you.

65
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,330
What's the derivative
of cosine of x?

66
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,710
It's minus sin of x.

67
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,020
So I have a function and it's
being squared, and I have its

68
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,310
derivative, so I can figure out
its antiderivative by using

69
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,855
substitution or the
reverse chain rule.

70
00:03:31,855 --> 00:03:34,360
So let's make a substitution.

71
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,800
u is equal to cosine of x.

72
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,385
How did I know to substitute
u is equal to cosine of x?

73
00:03:40,385 --> 00:03:42,960
Well because I say, well
the derivative of this

74
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,850
function is here.

75
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,750
So when I find du, this whole
thing is going to end up

76
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,460
being du, and let me
show that to you.

77
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,502
So what is du/dx?

78
00:03:50,502 --> 00:03:57,980
du/dx is equal to
minus sin of x.

79
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,620
That hopefully we've
learned already.

80
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,480
So what is du?

81
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,750
If we multiply both sides by
the differential d of x get du

82
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:10,250
is equal to minus sin of x dx.

83
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:15,160
So if we look at the original
equation, this right here we

84
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,900
just showed is equal to du,
and this right here is what?

85
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,790
Cosine of x is u.

86
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,440
That was our original
substitution.

87
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,685
So we have u squared.

88
00:04:25,685 --> 00:04:29,650
   

89
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,100
So now let's take the integral.

90
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,450
And I will arbitrarily
switch colors.

91
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:37,900
   

92
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,160
And now this is a very
important thing.

93
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,790
If you're going to do
substitution, if we're going to

94
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,020
say u is equal to cosine of x,
we're going to have to actually

95
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,450
make this substitution
on the boundaries.

96
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,640
Or we could do the substitution
and reverse the substitution

97
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,710
and then evaluate the
boundaries, but let's do that.

98
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:55,240
So if this is going from x is
equal to pi over 2 to pi,

99
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,160
what is u going from?

100
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,070
Well when x is equal to
pi over 2, u is equal

101
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,870
to cosine of pi over 2.

102
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,640
   

103
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,390
Because u is just cosine of x.

104
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,253
And then when x is pi, i is
going to be cosine of pi.

105
00:05:10,253 --> 00:05:13,070
   

106
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,720
And now the fun part.

107
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,840
Cosine of x squared.

108
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,400
Well that's just the same
thing is u squared.

109
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,620
And minus sin of x dx,
that's the same thing

110
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,560
is du-- did that here.

111
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,170
   

112
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,800
This is pretty straightforward
and I'm just going

113
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,370
to rewrite it.

114
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,450
What's cosine of pi?

115
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,120
Cosine of pi is minus 1.

116
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,860
Cosine of pi over 2,
well that's a 0.

117
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,420
So we have the integral from u
is equal to 0 to u is equal to

118
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,280
negative 1 of u squared du.

119
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:50,050
And now this seems like
a simple problem.

120
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,710
So this is equal to the
antiderivative of u

121
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,460
squared, which is
fairly straightforward.

122
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,350
u cubed over 3.

123
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,960
You could just take the
derivative of this,

124
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,980
you get this.

125
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,900
All I did is I increased this
exponent to get the third, and

126
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,491
I divided by that exponent.

127
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:10,790
Now we're going to have to
evaluate it at minus 1 and

128
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,840
subtract from that,
it evaluated at 0.

129
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,090
So this is equal to minus 1
to the third over 3 minus

130
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:25,110
0 over 3, and so this
is equal to minus 1/3.

131
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,310
And we are done.

132
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:31,260
And if we look at this area
from our original graph, what

133
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,400
we just solved, as we said the
area of the curve between

134
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,405
here and here is minus 1/3.

135
00:06:36,405 --> 00:06:39,050
Or if we wanted the absolute
area because you can't really

136
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,670
have a negative area, it's 1/3
but we know it's negative

137
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:45,490
because this curve is
below the x-axis here.

138
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,610
And that looks about right,
that looks about 1/3.

139
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,580
I mean if this cube right
here is 1, then that

140
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,600
looks about 1/3.

141
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,520
The intuition all
works out at least.

142
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,800
So hopefully you found
that vaguely useful.

143
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,670
Actually let me-- since we
have a little bit of time.

144
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,810
Hopefully you understood this,
and if you did, don't worry

145
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,920
about what I'm going to do now,
but I want to show you how I

146
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,330
tend to do it where I
just think of it is the

147
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,040
reverse chain rule.

148
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,840
It's a little bit
quicker sometimes.

149
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,570
But it's really the same
thing as what we just

150
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,250
did with substitution.

151
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,450
So if we erase all of this.

152
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:21,380
   

153
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:27,130
And so if we have this integral
right here, what I do is I say,

154
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,690
well I have cosine
of x squared.

155
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,660
   

156
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,980
I have cosine of x squared, and
then I have minus sin of x.

157
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,240
This is the derivative of this.

158
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,040
Since the derivative is here,
I can just treat this whole

159
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,260
thing like an x term.

160
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,130
So this is the same thing.

161
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:55,330
So the antiderivative is cosine
of x to the third over 3, and I

162
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:58,140
evaluate it at pi
and pi over 2.

163
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,870
And remember, how
did I do this?

164
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,030
What allowed me to treat this
cosine of x just like an x or

165
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,200
like a u when I did it
with the substitution?

166
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,960
Well I had its derivative
sitting right here,

167
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,860
minus sin of x.

168
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,750
So that's what gave me the
license to just take the

169
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,920
antiderivative, pretend like
this cosine of x is just an x,

170
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,650
is just a u, you could even
say, and just take it's

171
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:21,110
exponent, raise it by 1 and
divide it by 3 and then

172
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,740
evaluate it from
pi to pi over 2.

173
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:31,540
So this is equal to cosine of
pi cubed over 3 minus cosine

174
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:36,470
of pi over 2 cubed over 3.

175
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,630
This is minus 1 to the third,
so this is equal to minus

176
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,990
1/3 minus this is 0.

177
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,330
So we get the same answer.

178
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,550
I just wanted to show you that.

179
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,450
It's exactly the same
with substitution.

180
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,440
It's just I didn't formally do
the substitution, but it's

181
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,320
the exact same thing.

182
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,950
Anyway, hope you
found that helpful.

183
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,300
