00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:04,501
What we're doing in this video is study a proof of the Pythagorean theorem,

2
00:00:04,501 --> 00:00:13,433
that was first discovered,as far as we know by James Garfield in 1876.

3
00:00:13,433 --> 00:00:17,703
What's exciting about this is that he was not a professional mathematician.

4
00:00:17,703 --> 00:00:22,033
You might know James Garfield as the twentieth president of the United States.

5
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:28,971
He was elected president in 1880, and then he became president in 1881.

6
00:00:28,971 --> 00:00:34,101
And he did this proof while he was a sitting member of the United States House of Representatives.

7
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:38,837
What's exciting about that is is it shows that Abraham Lincoln was not the only US politician

8
00:00:38,837 --> 00:00:46,713
or the only US president who was into geometry. And what Garfield realised is that we can construct a right triangle-

9
00:00:46,713 --> 00:01:01,503
Let's say this side over here is length 'b'(blue) and this side is length 'a'(red),

10
00:01:01,503 --> 00:01:09,837
and let's say this side, the hypotenuse of my right triangle, has length 'c'.

11
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:15,233
And let me make it clear -- it is a right triangle. He essentially flipped and rotated this triangle

12
00:01:15,233 --> 00:01:18,708
to construct another one that is congruent to the first one.

13
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:22,102
So let me construct that. So we're going to have length 'b.'

14
00:01:22,102 --> 00:01:26,834
And it's colinear with length 'a', It's along the same line as length 'a.'

15
00:01:26,834 --> 00:01:28,709
They don't overlap with each other.

16
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:42,421
So this is a side of length 'b.'
And then you have your side of length 'a'

17
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:56,302
at a right angle. And then you have your side of length 'c.'

18
00:01:56,302 --> 00:02:00,632
So the first thing we need to think about is, &quot;What's the angle between these two sides?&quot;

19
00:02:00,632 --> 00:02:07,034
What's this mystery angle going to be?

20
00:02:07,034 --> 00:02:09,441
Well, it looks like something, but let's see if we can prove

21
00:02:09,441 --> 00:02:12,353
to ourselves it really is what we think it looks like.

22
00:02:12,353 --> 00:02:17,702
If we look at this original triangle, and we call this angle 'theta,'

23
00:02:17,702 --> 00:02:22,848
what's this angle over here, the angle that's between the sides of length a and c.

24
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:26,501
what's the measure of this angle going to be?

25
00:02:26,501 --> 00:02:33,497
Well, theta plus this angle has to add up to 90, because when you add those two together, they add up to the 90.

26
00:02:33,497 --> 00:02:36,842
So 90 and 90 you get 180 degrees for the interior angles of this triangle.

27
00:02:36,842 --> 00:02:42,367
So if these two angles together is 90, then this angle is '90 minus theta'.

28
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:46,915
Well if this angle up here is congruent -- (And we've constructed it so it is congruent.) the angle corresponding to theta is also going to be theta,

29
00:02:46,915 --> 00:02:53,079
And this angle right over here is also going to be 90 - theta.

30
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:57,100
So given that this is theta and this is 90 - theta, what is our angle going to be?

31
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,437
Well they all, collectively, add up to 180 degrees.

32
00:03:01,437 --> 00:03:10,033
So you have theta + (90-theta) + our mystery angle is going to be equal to 180 degrees.

33
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:16,508
The thetas cancel out (theta - theta), and you have 90 + our mystery angle is a 180 degrees,

34
00:03:16,508 --> 00:03:21,034
We subtract 90 from both sides.) - and you are left with

35
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:25,376
your mystery angle equalling 90 degrees.

36
00:03:25,376 --> 00:03:27,332
So that all worked out well.

37
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:37,777
So let me make that clear. That's going to be useful for us.

38
00:03:37,777 --> 00:03:43,498
So now we can say definitively that this is 90 degrees. This is a right angle.

39
00:03:43,498 --> 00:03:49,501
Now what we are going to do, is we are going to construct a trapezoid.

40
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:53,704
This side 'a' is parallel to side 'b' down here the way its been constructed

41
00:03:53,704 --> 00:03:57,912
and this is just one side right over here, this goes straight up

42
00:03:57,912 --> 00:04:05,709
and now let's just connect these two sides right over there.

43
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:10,914
So there's a couple of ways to think about the area of this trapezoid.

44
00:04:10,914 --> 00:04:15,569
One is we can just think of it as a trapezoid and come up with its area,

45
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:20,034
And then we could think about it as the sum of the areas of its components.

46
00:04:20,034 --> 00:04:24,178
So let's just first think of it as trapezoid.

47
00:04:24,178 --> 00:04:26,902
So, what do we know about the area of the trapezoid?

48
00:04:26,902 --> 00:04:44,112
The area of a trapezoid,is gonna be the height of the trapezoid, which is (a+b) times, the way I think of it, the mean or average of the top and the bottom.

49
00:04:44,112 --> 00:04:59,776
So, ar(trapezoid) = (a+b) x 1/2(a+b)

50
00:04:59,776 --> 00:05:10,531
In the intuition there you are taking the height times the average of the bottom and the top, gives you the area of the trapezoid.

51
00:05:10,531 --> 00:05:15,114
Now, how can we also figure out the area with its component parts?

52
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:21,872
So as far as we do the correct things, we should come up with the same result.

53
00:05:21,872 --> 00:05:24,370
so how else can we come up with this area?

54
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:29,968
Well, we could say it's the area of the two right triangles.

55
00:05:29,968 --> 00:05:34,637
The area of each of them is one half of a times b.

56
00:05:34,637 --> 00:05:42,905
But there's two of them, Let me do that say in blue colour,

57
00:05:42,905 --> 00:05:46,976
But there's two of these right triangles, so let's multiply them by two.

58
00:05:46,976 --> 00:05:54,970
So 2 times half ab, that takes into consideration this bottom right triangle, and this top one.

59
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:01,288
and what's the area of this large one, that I'll colour in green

60
00:06:01,288 --> 00:06:08,041
Well that's pretty straightforward, it's just one half c times c.

61
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:14,301
So, plus one half c times c, which is one half c square.

62
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:20,982
Now , let's simplify this thing and see what we come up with and you might guess where all of this is going.

63
00:06:20,982 --> 00:06:41,394
So, we can rearrange this. So this one half times (a+b) squared is going to be equal to two times one half,

64
00:06:41,394 --> 00:06:52,886
well that's just going to be one, so its gonna be equal to a times b plus one half c squared.

65
00:06:52,886 --> 00:06:58,118
I don't like these one halves lying around, so let's multiply both sides, this equation, by 2.

66
00:06:58,133 --> 00:07:02,271
I'm just gonna multiply both sides by two.

67
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:11,437
So, on the left hand side, I'm just left with (a+b) squared,

68
00:07:11,437 --> 00:07:27,237
and on the right hand side, I'm left with 2ab and then two times one half c squared, i.e., plus c squared.

69
00:07:27,237 --> 00:07:32,237
What happens if you multiply out (a+b) times (a+b)? We get (a+b) squared.

70
00:07:32,237 --> 00:08:04,646
That is a sq. + 2ab+ b sq. = 2ab + c sq.

71
00:08:04,646 --> 00:08:08,646
Subtracting 2ab from both sides, we are left with, a sq. + b sq. = c sq. i.e. the Pythagorean theorem.
