1
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:08,581
This is Steven Zucker and Juliana Kreinik.

2
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:11,636
And we are talking about the "twittering machine" by Paul Klee.

3
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:15,307
- Or "Zwitschermaschine". - So this is one of my favourite works by Klee and I think

4
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:20,279
many peoples. Perhaps for me the most fancible ,most playful works of art

5
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,088
I can think of. These little figures which

6
00:00:23,088 --> 00:00:27,413
to me they look like half bird-like creature, half puppet,

7
00:00:27,413 --> 00:00:30,470
half doll, even though you can't have three halfs.

8
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:34,999
You have these different faces where you can see details if you look really closely

9
00:00:34,999 --> 00:00:38,804
each of them has a sense of individuality. They all seem

10
00:00:38,804 --> 00:00:43,268
a little bit mischievous.

11
00:00:43,268 --> 00:00:47,306
This is the perfect word. They seem mischievous and about to do something.

12
00:00:47,306 --> 00:00:51,244
And you know it is funny because I look at the characters and

13
00:00:51,244 --> 00:00:54,037
then I am thinking what is the "twittering machine"?

14
00:00:54,037 --> 00:00:58,634
Well, he has exposed for us this wonderful kind of mechanical object.

15
00:00:58,634 --> 00:01:02,421
It is drawn in this simplist pen and ink on a kind of watercolor wash

16
00:01:02,421 --> 00:01:06,939
really subtle and lovely but not too finished and still quite

17
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:09,110
sort of open. But

18
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,547
this fabulous kind of invitation for the viewer

19
00:01:12,547 --> 00:01:16,244
to somehow reach in and turn that handle and to

20
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:20,439
bring this to life. - You know what I am just thinking of? And I am thinking of

21
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:23,212
this because Klee is swiss, and I am thinking of this because

22
00:01:23,212 --> 00:01:26,311
it is turning and there is birds, so I am thinking of a cuckoo clock

23
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:31,380
- You are absolutely right. - Do you think he was maybe creating this sort of inner workings of

24
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,258
of the cuckoo clock deconstructed and sort of turned in on its head? - I think so absolutely.

25
00:01:36,258 --> 00:01:41,206
- Like the birds have been freed. - But here they are freed because this is not about

26
00:01:41,206 --> 00:01:45,003
the mechanics of time, it's not about the structure of time at all, this is

27
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:49,267
a kind of human-powered machine. We have to reach in to bring this thing to life.

28
00:01:49,267 --> 00:01:52,611
and if it was brought to life, you would get a sense of this chaos

29
00:01:52,611 --> 00:01:56,886
which is completely at odds with the notion of the precision of the Swiss

30
00:01:56,886 --> 00:02:01,334
clock. - Absolutely. It does not have this kind of precision at all.

31
00:02:01,334 --> 00:02:05,338
It is not that kind of machine. It's a machine of frivolity. - Look at the way he has done it.

32
00:02:05,338 --> 00:02:09,667
Because if you look at for instace the shapes that come out of the mouths

33
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:14,340
or the beaks of these bird. - Yes, they definetly have a beak-like quality. - They do.

34
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,789
Those are different shapes and they almost become

35
00:02:16,789 --> 00:02:20,276
visual signs,they become notations of the sounds that you can imagine

36
00:02:20,276 --> 00:02:23,088
they would be making. It would be a fracas, it would be a kind of

37
00:02:23,088 --> 00:02:26,421
cacophony. But each with a distinct kind of tone.

38
00:02:26,421 --> 00:02:29,204
- So this second figure from right

39
00:02:29,204 --> 00:02:31,250
with this spiral. I feel like

40
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,412
he would make sort of a "boing boing boing" like up and down, and up and down.

41
00:02:34,412 --> 00:02:36,282
- A spring-like sound, yes absolutely.

42
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:37,279
- Yeh, and you know some of the others

43
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:38,844
would be like "qwah qwah qwah" and you

44
00:02:38,844 --> 00:02:39,974
know you could sort of imagine

45
00:02:39,974 --> 00:02:40,700
all of this happening

46
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,147
all at once.

47
00:02:42,147 --> 00:02:43,715
- I think that's right.

48
00:02:43,715 --> 00:02:45,848
And you could also imagine sort of

49
00:02:45,848 --> 00:02:47,183
the chaos visually

50
00:02:47,183 --> 00:02:48,625
of how this would look

51
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:49,166
if you'd pull the handle

52
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,929
because each bird is perched

53
00:02:51,929 --> 00:02:53,342
on sort of a wire that sort of archs

54
00:02:53,342 --> 00:02:55,245
in space. You can get this sense of them

55
00:02:55,245 --> 00:02:57,172
sort of balancing up and down, and sort of

56
00:02:57,172 --> 00:03:01,125
gyringing and maybe that almost bowtie-like

57
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,422
double triangle.

58
00:03:02,422 --> 00:03:03,941
- They must rotate around that.

59
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:05,335
- Exactly.

60
00:03:05,335 --> 00:03:07,273
- So you'd turn it up and this whole thing spins

61
00:03:07,273 --> 00:03:08,967
around that axis.

62
00:03:08,967 --> 00:03:11,038
- So it's just incredible, it's brilliant.

63
00:03:11,038 --> 00:03:13,277
In an extatic frozen drawing

64
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:17,294
He has been able to evoke sound

65
00:03:17,294 --> 00:03:18,840
and energy

66
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,314
and motion.

67
00:03:20,314 --> 00:03:22,487
And also an invitation for us to somehow power

68
00:03:22,487 --> 00:03:25,273
the entire image.

69
00:03:25,273 --> 00:03:28,200
As a viewer so often really does.

70
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,673
- It really calls for us to interact with it

71
00:03:29,673 --> 00:03:31,709
and it calls for us to play with it

72
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:34,770
and it really seems just like an invitation to have fun.

73
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,539
- That is so interesting because Klee

74
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:39,503
is at the Bauhaus for a year now.

75
00:03:39,503 --> 00:03:41,942
And often when we think of the Bauhaus

76
00:03:41,942 --> 00:03:43,917
we think of something that is slightly dower

77
00:03:43,917 --> 00:03:45,800
something a little serious.

78
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,504
- I think it is very serious.

79
00:03:47,504 --> 00:03:49,200
I think they certainly had a lot of fun.

80
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,943
But even their fun was serious.

81
00:03:50,943 --> 00:03:52,708
Like we must make new things.

82
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,600
And we must have new parties.

83
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,671
And we must find new ways to make trouble.

84
00:03:56,671 --> 00:03:59,007
- And yes, Klee seems to be making trouble

85
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:03,007
in a just simple and wonderful playful way here.
