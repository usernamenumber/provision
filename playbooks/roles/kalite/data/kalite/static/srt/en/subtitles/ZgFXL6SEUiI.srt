1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690
   

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,430
In this video I want to
introduce you to the idea of a

3
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,680
polynomial.

4
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,720
   

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,230
It might sound like a really
fancy word, but really all it

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,580
is is an expression that has a
bunch of variable or constant

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,390
terms in them that are raised
to non-zero exponents.

8
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,510
So that also probably
sounds complicated.

9
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,330
So let me show you an example.

10
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,420
If I were to give you x squared
plus 1, this is a

11
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,260
polynomial.

12
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:30,370
This is, in fact, a binomial
because it has two terms. The

13
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,159
term polynomial is
more general.

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,350
It's essentially saying you
have many terms. Poly

15
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,300
tends to mean many.

16
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,490
This is a binomial.

17
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:45,440
If I were to say 4x to the third
minus 2 squared plus 7.

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,200
This is a trinomial.

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,970
I have three terms here.

20
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:54,330
Let me give you just a more
concrete sense of what is and

21
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,140
is not a polynomial.

22
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:03,460
For example, if I were to have
x to the negative 1/2 plus 1,

23
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,660
this is not a polynomial.

24
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,720
That doesn't mean that you won't
ever see it while you're

25
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,240
doing algebra or mathematics.

26
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:17,840
But we just wouldn't call this
a polynomial because it has a

27
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,610
negative and a fractional
exponent in it.

28
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,670
Or if I were to give you the
expression y times the square

29
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,630
root of y minus y squared.

30
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,070
Once again, this is not a
polynomial, because it has a

31
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,810
square root in it, which is
essentially raising something

32
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,030
to the 1/2 power.

33
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,680
So all of the exponents on our
variables are going to have to

34
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,680
be non-negatives.

35
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,500
Once again, neither of these
are polynomials.

36
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,130
Now, when we're dealing with
polynomials, we're going to

37
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,380
have some terminology.

38
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,660
And you may or may not already
be familiar with it, so I'll

39
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,750
expose it to you right now.

40
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,210
The first terminology is the
degree of the polynomial.

41
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:02,070
   

42
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:08,889
And essentially, that's the
highest exponent that we have

43
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:09,720
in the polynomial.

44
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,150
So for example, that polynomial
right there is a

45
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:17,910
third degree polynomial.

46
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,450
Now why is that?

47
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,510
No need to keep writing it.

48
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,910
Why is that a third
degree polynomial?

49
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:29,020
Because the highest exponent
that we have in there is the x

50
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,720
to the third term.

51
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,150
So that's where we get it's
a third degree polynomial.

52
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:43,100
This right here is a second
degree polynomial.

53
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,600
And this is the second
degree term.

54
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,750
Now a couple of other
terminologies, or words, that

55
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,190
we need to know regarding
polynomials, are the constant

56
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,160
versus the variable terms. And
I think you already know,

57
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,120
these are variable
terms right here.

58
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,520
This is a constant term.

59
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,860
That right there is
a constant term.

60
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,390
And then one last part to
dissect the polynomial

61
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,670
properly is to understand the
coefficients of a polynomial.

62
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,570
So let me write a fifth degree
polynomial here.

63
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,990
And I'm going to write it in
maybe a non-conventional form

64
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,400
right here.

65
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,690
I'm going to not
do it in order.

66
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:24,520
So let's just say it's x squared
minus 5x plus 7x to

67
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,150
the fifth minus 5.

68
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,840
So, once again, this is a
fifth degree polynomial.

69
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,710
Why is that?

70
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:35,110
Because the highest exponent
on a variable here is the 5

71
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,580
right here.

72
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:44,910
So this tells us this is a
fifth degree polynomial.

73
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,870
And you might say, well why do
we even care about that?

74
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,380
And at least, in my mind, the
reason why I care about the

75
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,590
degree of a polynomial is
because when the numbers get

76
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:57,560
large, the highest degree term
is what really dominates all

77
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,610
of the other terms. It will
grow the fastest, or go

78
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,160
negative the fastest, depending
on whether there's a

79
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,240
positive or a negative
in front of it.

80
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,790
But it's going to dominate
everything else.

81
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,470
It really gives you a sense for
how quickly, or how fast

82
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:16,269
the whole expression would grow
or decrease in the case

83
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:18,339
if it has a negative
coefficient.

84
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:20,300
Now I just used the
word coefficient.

85
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,850
What does that mean?

86
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,730
Coefficient.

87
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,900
And I've used it before,
when we were just

88
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,500
doing linear equations.

89
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,720
And coefficients are just the
constant terms that are

90
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,460
multiplying the variable
terms.

91
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,360
So for example, the coefficient
on this term right

92
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,090
here is negative 5.

93
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,140
You have to remember we have
a minus 5, so we consider

94
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,890
negative 5 to be the
whole coefficient.

95
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,570
The coefficient on
this term is a 7.

96
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,870
There's no coefficient here;
it's just a constant term of

97
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,940
negative 5.

98
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:57,170
And then the coefficient on
the x squared term is 1.

99
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,350
The coefficient is 1.

100
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,160
It's implicit.

101
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,090
You're assuming it's
1 times x squared.

102
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,180
Now the last thing I want to
introduce you to is just the

103
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,190
idea of the standard form
of a polynomial.

104
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:12,190
   

105
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,710
Now none of this is going to
help you solve a polynomial

106
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,690
just yet, but when we talk about
solving polynomials, I

107
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,520
might use some of this
terminology, or your teacher

108
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,890
might use some of this
terminology.

109
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,070
So it's good to know what
we're talking about.

110
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:28,640
The standard form of a
polynomial, essentially just

111
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,770
list the terms in
order of degree.

112
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,800
So this is in a non-standard
form.

113
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,510
If I were to list this
polynomial in standard form, I

114
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:42,990
would put this term first. So I
would write 7x to the fifth,

115
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,810
then what's the next
smallest degree?

116
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,260
Well, they have this
x squared term.

117
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,680
I don't have an x to
the fourth or an x

118
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,800
to the third here.

119
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,510
So that'll be plus 1--
well I don't have to

120
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:56,230
write 1-- plus x squared.

121
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:00,000
And then I have this
term, minus 5x.

122
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,170
And then I have this last term
right here, minus 5.

123
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:07,430
This is the standard form of the
polynomial where you have

124
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,470
it in descending order
of degree.

125
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:15,280
Now let's do a couple of
operations with polynomials.

126
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,510
And this is going to be a super
useful toolkit later on

127
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:21,730
in your algebraic, or really in
your mathematical careers.

128
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,180
So let's just simplify a
bunch of polynomials.

129
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,500
And we've kind of touched on
this in previous videos.

130
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,980
But I think this will give you
a better sense, especially

131
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,970
when we have these higher
degree terms over here.

132
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:38,290
So let's say I wanted to
add negative 2x squared

133
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:42,000
plus 4x minus 12.

134
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,030
And I'm going to add that
to 7x plus x squared.

135
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,410
Now the important thing to
remember when you simplify

136
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,430
these polynomials is that you're
going to add the terms

137
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,830
of the same variable
of like degree.

138
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,870
I'll do another example in a
second where I have multiple

139
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,750
variables getting involved
in the situation.

140
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,620
But anyway, I have these
parentheses here, but they

141
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,170
really aren't doing anything.

142
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,220
If I had a subtraction sign
here, I would have to

143
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,940
distribute the subtraction,
but I don't.

144
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,270
So I really could just write
this as minus 2x squared, plus

145
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:21,970
4x, minus 12, plus 7x,
plus x squared.

146
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,870
And now let's simplify it.

147
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,440
So let's add the terms
of like degree.

148
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,000
And when I say like degree,
it has to also

149
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,120
have the same variable.

150
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,990
But in this example, we only
have the variable x.

151
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,360
So let's add.

152
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,090
Let's see, I have this x squared
term, and I've that x

153
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,020
squared term, so I can
add them together.

154
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,130
So I have minus 2x squared--
let me just write them

155
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:46,640
together first --minus 2x
squared plus x squared.

156
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:51,560
And then let me get the
x terms, so 4x and 7x.

157
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,490
So this is plus 4x plus 7x.

158
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,560
And then finally, I just
have this constant term

159
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,650
right here, minus 12.

160
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,710
And if I have negative 2 of
something, and I add 1 of

161
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,210
something to that,
what do I have?

162
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:09,750
Negative 2 plus 1 is negative
1x squared.

163
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,420
I could just write negative
x squared.

164
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,320
But I just want to show you that
I'm just adding negative

165
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,560
2 to 1 there.

166
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:21,070
Then I have 4x plus 7x is 11x.

167
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:25,820
And then I finally have my
constant term, minus 12.

168
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,390
And I end up with a three
term, second degree

169
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,370
polynomial.

170
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,740
The leading coefficient here,
the coefficient on the highest

171
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,990
degree term in standard form--
it's already in standard form

172
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,320
--is negative 1.

173
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,760
The coefficient here is 11.

174
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,280
The constant term
is negative 12.

175
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,870
Let's do another one
of these examples.

176
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,060
I think you're getting
the general idea.

177
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:50,840
Now let me do a complicated
example.

178
00:08:50,840 --> 00:09:00,450
So let's say I have 2a squared
b, minus 3ab squared, plus 5a

179
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:09,880
squared b squared, minus 2a
squared b squared, plus 4a

180
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,110
squared b, minus 5b squared.

181
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:18,290
So here, I have a minus sign,
I have multiple variables.

182
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,990
But let's just go through
this step by step.

183
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,220
So the first thing
you want to do is

184
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,610
distribute this minus sign.

185
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:28,470
So this first part we can just
write as 2a squared b, minus

186
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:34,760
3ab squared, plus 5a
squared b squared.

187
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,180
And then we want to distribute
this minus sign, or multiply

188
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,760
all of these terms by negative
1 because we have

189
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,040
the minus out here.

190
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:48,150
So minus 2a squared b squared
minus 4a squared b.

191
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:53,300
And a negative times a negative
is plus 5b squared.

192
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,690
And now we want to essentially
add like terms. So I have this

193
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,050
2a squared b squared term.

194
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,880
So do I have any other terms
that have an a squared b

195
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,950
squared in them?

196
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,680
Or sorry, a squared b.

197
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,750
I have to be very
careful here.

198
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,860
Well, that's ab squared, no.
a squared b squared.

199
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,360
Oh!

200
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,580
Here I have an a squared b.

201
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,860
So let me write those
two down.

202
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:24,240
So I have 2a squared b
minus 4a squared b.

203
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,660
That's those two terms
right there.

204
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,940
Let me go to orange.

205
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:33,280
So here I have an
ab squared term.

206
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:37,480
Now do I have any other
ab squared terms here?

207
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,630
   

208
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,550
No, no other ab squared,
so I'll just write

209
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:46,740
it: minus 3 ab squared.

210
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,580
And then let's see, I have an a
squared b squared term here.

211
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,520
Do I have any other ones?

212
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,390
Well, yeah sure, the
next term is.

213
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,280
That's an a squared b
squared term, so let

214
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,500
me just write that.

215
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:01,810
Plus 5a squared b
squared minus 2a

216
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:04,630
squared b squared, right?

217
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,860
I just wrote those two.

218
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,120
And then finally I have that
last b squared term there,

219
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,770
plus 5b squared.

220
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,390
Now I can add them.

221
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:19,800
So this first group right here
in this purplish color, 2 of

222
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,230
something minus 4 of something
is going to be negative 2 of

223
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:23,770
that something.

224
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:28,130
So it's going to be negative
2a squared b.

225
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:31,450
And then this term right here,
it's not going to add to

226
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:34,020
anything, 3ab squared.

227
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,170
And then we can add these two
terms. If I have 5 of

228
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,870
something minus 2 of something,
I'm going to have 3

229
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,200
of that something.

230
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,880
Plus 3a squared b squared.

231
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:51,470
And then finally I have that
last term, plus 5b squared.

232
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,000
We're done.

233
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,170
We've simplified this
polynomial.

234
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,990
Here, putting it in standard
form, you can think of it in

235
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,050
different ways.

236
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,230
The way I'd like to think of
it is maybe the combined

237
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,290
degree of the term.

238
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,290
Maybe we could put this one
first, but this is really

239
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,460
according to your taste.

240
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:13,030
So this is 3a squared
b squared.

241
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,360
And then you could pick whether
you want to put the a

242
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,680
squared b or the ab squared
terms first. 2a squared b.

243
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:25,400
And then you have the
minus 3ab squared.

244
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,320
And then we have just the
b squared term there.

245
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,180
Plus 5b squared.

246
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,440
And we're done.

247
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,480
We've simplified this
polynomial.

248
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,210
Now what I want to do next is
do a couple of examples of

249
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,860
constructing a polynomial.

250
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,610
And really, the idea is to give
you an appreciation for

251
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:46,880
why polynomials are useful,
abstract representations.

252
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,570
We're going to be using it all
the time, not only in algebra,

253
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,460
but later in calculus, and
pretty much in everything.

254
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,470
So they're really good things
to get familiar with.

255
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:57,710
But what I want to do in these
four examples is represent the

256
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,360
area of each of these figures
with a polynomial.

257
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,690
And I'll try to match the colors
as closely as I can.

258
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,520
So over here, what's the area?

259
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,420
Well, this blue part right
here, the area

260
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,315
there is x times y.

261
00:13:11,315 --> 00:13:14,080
   

262
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,360
And then what's the area here?

263
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,670
It's going to be x times z.

264
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:22,130
So plus x times z.

265
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:22,930
But we have two of them!

266
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,370
We have one x times z,
and then we have

267
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,900
another x times z.

268
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,710
So I could just add
an x times z here.

269
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:31,390
Or I could just write, say,
plus 2 times x times z.

270
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:36,350
And here we have a polynomial
that represents the area of

271
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,210
this figure right there.

272
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,470
Now let's do this next one.

273
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,460
What's the area here?

274
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,870
Well I have an a times a b.

275
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,430
ab.

276
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:50,140
This looks like an a times
a b again, plus ab.

277
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:56,390
That looks like an ab
again, plus ab.

278
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:00,450
   

279
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,090
I think they've drawn
it actually,

280
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:05,460
a little bit strange.

281
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,560
Well, I'm going to ignore
this c right there.

282
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,740
Maybe they're telling us that
this right here is c.

283
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,230
Because that's the information
we would need.

284
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,860
Maybe they're telling us that
this base right there, that

285
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,240
this right here, is c.

286
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,850
Because that would help us.

287
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,580
But if we assume that this is
another ab here, which I'll

288
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,890
assume for this purpose
of this video.

289
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,380
And then we have that last ab.

290
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,610
And then we have this
one a times c.

291
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:36,770
   

292
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,550
This is the area
of this figure.

293
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,580
And obviously we can add
these four terms.

294
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:46,780
This is 4ab and then
we have plus ac.

295
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,400
And I made the assumption that
this was a bit of a typo, that

296
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,310
that c where they were actually
telling us the width

297
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,240
of this little square
over here.

298
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,210
We don't know if it's a square,
that's only if a and c

299
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,600
are the same.

300
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,180
Now let's do this one.

301
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,190
So how do we figure out the
area of the pink area?

302
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:06,010
Well we could take the area
the whole rectangle, which

303
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:10,730
would be 2xy, and then we could
subtract out the area of

304
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,240
these squares.

305
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,060
So each square has an area of
x times x, or x squared.

306
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,810
And we have two of
these squares, so

307
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:23,190
it's minus 2x squared.

308
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:27,050
And then finally let's do
this one over here.

309
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:30,430
So that looks like a dividing
line right there.

310
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,250
So the area of this point, of
this area right there, is a

311
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,130
times b, so it's ab.

312
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:43,680
And then the area over here
looks like it will also be ab.

313
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,320
So plus ab.

314
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:50,950
And the area over
here is also ab.

315
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,170
So the area here is 3ab.

316
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,700
Anyway, hopefully that gets
us pretty warmed up with

317
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,950
polynomials.

318
00:15:58,950 --> 00:15:59,270
