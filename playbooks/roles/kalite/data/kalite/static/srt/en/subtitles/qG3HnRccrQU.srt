1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,250
We already know that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,490
add up to 180 degrees

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,780
If the measure of this angle is A,

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,650
the measure of this angle over here is B, and

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:17,700
the measure of this angle is C, we know that A + B + C = 180 degrees

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:21,370
What happens when we have polygons with more than 3 sides?

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,120
a quadrilateral

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,320
probably applies to any quadrilateral with four sides,

9
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:35,320
not just things that have right angles and parallel lines

10
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,040
and all the rest

11
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,250
Actually, that looks a little too close to being parallel

12
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,580
so let me draw it like this

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,530
The way you can think about it, with the 4-sided quadrilateral is,

14
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,010
we already know about this:

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,420
the measures of the interior angles of a triangle add up to 180

16
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,850
so maybe we can divide this into 2 triangles

17
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,090
From this point right over here, if we draw a line like this,

18
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,210
Then if measure of this angle is A, measure of this is B,

19
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,320
measure of that is C

20
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:09,200
We know that A + B + C = 180 degrees

21
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:14,060
Then if we call this over here, X, this over here, Y and that, Z

22
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,440
Those are the measures of those angles

23
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:21,090
We know that X + Y + Z = 180 degrees

24
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,410
So, if we want the measure of the sum of all of the interior angles,

25
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,330
all of the interior angles are going to be:

26
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,810
plus this angle, which is going to be A + X

27
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,810
A + X is that whole angle for the quadrilateral

28
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:47,260
Plus this whole angle, which is going to be C + Y

29
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,540
And where you know A + B + C is 180 degrees

30
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:03,460
And we know that Z + X + Y = 180 degrees

31
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:08,220
So plus 180 degrees which is equal to 360 degrees

32
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,110
I think you see the general idea here

33
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,030
We just have to figure out how many triangles

34
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,680
we can divide something into

35
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,770
Then we just multiply it by 180 degrees,

36
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,900
since each of those triangles will have 180 degrees

37
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,400
can we fit into that thing

38
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,860
Let me draw an irregular pentagon

39
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:35,990
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,320
Looks more like a bit of a side-ways house there

41
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:42,310
Once again, we can draw our triangles inside of this pentagon

42
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,370
That would be one triangle there

43
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,030
That would be another triangle

44
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,450
that perfectly cover this pentagon

45
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,850
This is one triangle, the other triangle and the other one

46
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,010
We know each of those have 180 degrees,

47
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,550
if we take the sum of their angles

48
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,990
We also know the sum of all those interior angles are equal

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,290
to the sum of the interior angles of the polygon as a whole

50
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,860
To see that, clearly this interior angle is

51
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,490
one of the angles of the polygon

52
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,900
This is, as well

53
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,360
When you take the sum of this one and this one,

54
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,920
We take the sum of that one and that one, you get that entire one

55
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:24,180
Then when you take the sum of that one, plus that one,

56
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,080
plus that one, you get that entire interior angle

57
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,220
So if you take the sum of all the interior angles of

58
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,670
all of the interior angles of the polygon

59
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,570
In this case you have 1, 2, 3 triangles

60
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,850
3 times 180 degrees is equal to what?

61
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,120
300 +240 = 540 degrees

62
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:48,870
To generalize it,

63
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,900
we have up to use up four sides

64
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,780
We have to use up all the four sides of this quadrilateral

65
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:02,450
We had to use up four of the five sides right here in this pentagon

66
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,500
1, 2, and then 3, 4

67
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,540
So four sides give you two triangles

68
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,750
It seems like maybe every incremental side you have after that,

69
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,460
you can get another triangle out of it

70
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:23,910
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 sides

71
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:29,880
and I can get one triangle out of these 2 sides

72
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,000
1, 2 sides of the actual hexagon

73
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:38,450
I can get another triangle out of these 2 sides of the actual hexagon

74
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,970
And it looks like I can get another triangle

75
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,590
out of each of the remaining sides

76
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,250
So one out of that one, and then,

77
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,550
one out of that one right over there

78
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:57,230
S-sided polygon

79
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,170
or 6 sides

80
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,530
So we can assume that S is greater than 4 sides

81
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,220
I want to figure out how many non-overlapping triangles

82
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,920
that perfectly cover that polygon

83
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,430
How many can I fit inside of it

84
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,400
Then I just have to multiply the number of triangles

85
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,590
times 180 degrees

86
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,330
to figure out what are the sum of the interior angles of that polygon

87
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,830
as a function of the number of sides

88
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,990
Once again, four of the sides are going to be used

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,230
to make two triangles

90
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,910
and we have two sides right over there

91
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,660
I can have, I can draw one triangle

92
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,470
what happens to the rest of the sides of the polygon

93
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,190
You can imagine putting a big black piece of construction paper

94
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,950
There might be other sides here

95
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,240
So out of these 2 sides I can draw one triangle just like that

96
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,570
Out of these two sides, I can draw another triangle right over there

97
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:06,130
So 4 sides used for two triangles

98
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,830
Then, no matter how many sides I have left over,

99
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,640
if I have all sorts of craziness here

100
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,030
Let me draw a little bit neater than that

101
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:26,270
So I can have all sorts of craziness right over here

102
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,690
It looks like every other incremental side

103
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,340
I can get another triangle out of it

104
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:37,170
one triangle out of that side, one triangle out of that side

105
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,950
and then one triangle out of this side

106
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,320
For example, this figure that I have drawn is a very irregular

107
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:48,440
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, is that right?

108
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:54,060
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ,8 ,9 10 It is a decagon

109
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:58,320
In this decagon, four of the sides were used for two triangles

110
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,160
Then the other 6 sides I was able to get a triangle each

111
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:22,490
I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

112
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,230
Did I count, am I just not seeing something?

113
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,730
Oh I see, I have to draw another line right over here

114
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,370
These are two different sides

115
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,090
I can get another triangle out of that right over there

116
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,290
There you have it

117
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,680
I have these two triangles out of 4 sides

118
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,940
Then out of the other 6 remaining sides I get a triangle each

119
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:47,290
Plus 6 triangles, I got a total of 8 triangles

120
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,740
So we can generally think about it

121
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,690
Let me write this down

122
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,290
Our number of triangles is going to be equal to 2,

123
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,030
The remaining sides, I get a triangle each

124
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,160
The remaining sides are going to be S minus 4

125
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,350
The number of triangles are going to be 2 plus S minus 4

126
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:24,300
So, if I have an S-sided polygon, I can get S minus two triangles

127
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,430
that perfectly cover that polygon

128
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:32,320
Which tells us that an S-sided polygon if it has S minus 2 triangles,

129
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:35,690
that the interior angles in it are going to be

130
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:42,190
S minus 2 times 180 degrees, which is a pretty cool result

131
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,550
So someone told you that they had a 102-sided polygon

132
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,640
So, S is equal to 102 sides

133
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,500
You can say, okay the number of interior angles are going to be

134
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,680
Which is equal to 180, with two more zeros behind it

135
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,180
of a 102-sided polygon
