1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800
   

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:01,430
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:04,870
In the last video we were just
figuring out the volume under

4
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,990
the surface, and we had set
up these integral bounds.

5
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,280
So let's see how to
evaluate it now.

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,400
And look at this.

7
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,510
I actually realized that I can
scroll things, which is quite

8
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,790
useful because now I have
a lot more board space.

9
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,290
So how do we evaluate
this integral?

10
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:22,030
Well, the first integral I'm
integrating with respect to x.

11
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:22,280
Right?

12
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,770
I'm adding up the
little x sums.

13
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,670
So I'm forming this
rectangle right here.

14
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:27,960
Right?

15
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,550
Or you could kind of view it
I'm holding y constant and

16
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,730
integrating along the x-axis.

17
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,630
I should switch colors.

18
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,660
So what's the antiderivative of
x y squared with respect to x?

19
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:44,000
Well it's just x
squared over 2.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,080
And then I have the y
squared-- that's just a

21
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,900
constant-- all over 2.

22
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:55,890
And I'm going to evaluate that
from x is equal to 1 to x is

23
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,660
equal to the square root of y,
which you might be daunted by.

24
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,930
But you'll see that it's
actually not that bad

25
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:01,630
once you evaluate them.

26
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,540
And then let me draw the
outside of the integral.

27
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,620
This is y is equal to
0 to y is equal 1.

28
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,830
dy.

29
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,640
Now, if x is equal to 1
this expression becomes

30
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,400
y squared over 2.

31
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,470
Right?

32
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:19,030
y squared over 2, minus-- now
if x is equal to square root

33
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,320
of y, what does this
expression become?

34
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,120
If x is equal to the
square root of y, then

35
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,250
x squared is just y.

36
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,870
And then y times y squared
is y to the third.

37
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:31,180
Right?

38
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:36,210
So it's y to the third over 3.

39
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:36,830
Fair enough.

40
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,870
And now I take the integral
with respect to y.

41
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:45,520
So now I sum up all of these
rectangles in the y direction.

42
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,420
0, 1.

43
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,620
This is with respect to y.

44
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,910
And that's cool, right?

45
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:52,820
Because when you take the first
integral with respect to x you

46
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,030
end up with a function of y
anyway, so you might as well

47
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,120
have your bounds as
functions of y's.

48
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,510
It really doesn't make
it any more difficult.

49
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,850
But anyway, back
to the problem.

50
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:07,440
What is the antiderivative
of y squared over 2 minus

51
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,380
y to the third over 3?

52
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,430
Well the antiderivative of y
squared-- and you have to

53
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,130
divide by 3, so it's
y cubed over 6.

54
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:23,670
Minus y to the fourth--
you have to divide by 4.

55
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:28,480
Minus y to the fourth over--
did I mess up some place?

56
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,385
No, I think this is correct.
y to the fourth over 12.

57
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:36,080
   

58
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,530
Oh wait.

59
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,480
How did I get a 3 here?

60
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,330
That's where I messed up.

61
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,360
This is a 2, right?

62
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,490
   

63
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,520
Let's see.

64
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,800
x is square root of y.

65
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,270
Yeah, this is a 2.

66
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,150
I don't know how I ended up.

67
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:49,510
Right?

68
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,270
Square root of y squared
is y, times y squared

69
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,575
y to the third over 2.

70
00:02:53,575 --> 00:02:57,470
   

71
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,030
Right.

72
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,900
And then when I take
the integral of this

73
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,590
it's 4 times 2.

74
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,240
8.

75
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,670
Got to make sure I don't make
those careless mistakes.

76
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,440
That's the tough part.

77
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,500
I just want to make sure
that you got that too.

78
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,620
I hate it when I do that.

79
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,350
But I don't want to
re-record the whole video.

80
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:15,340
So when I evaluated
this-- right.

81
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,490
This is right, and then I take
the antiderivative of y to the

82
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:21,430
third over 2, I get y
to the fourth over 8.

83
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:26,550
And now I evaluate
this at 1 and 0.

84
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,540
And that give us what?

85
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:34,290
1/6 minus 1/8 minus-- well both
of these when you evaluate

86
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,410
them, are going to be 0's.

87
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,700
So this is going to be
another 0 minus 0.

88
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,530
So you don't have to
worry about that.

89
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,000
So what's 1/6 minus 1/8?

90
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,930
Let's see.

91
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,310
24.

92
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:50,070
That's 4 minus 3 over 24, which
is equal to 1/24-- is the

93
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,600
volume of our figure.

94
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,640
   

95
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,280
So this time, the way we just
did it, we took the integral

96
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,486
with respect to x first, and
then we did it with

97
00:04:02,486 --> 00:04:02,950
respect to y.

98
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,930
Let's do it the
other way around.

99
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,520
So let me erase some things.

100
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,390
And hopefully I won't make
these careless mistakes again.

101
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,670
I'll keep this figure, but
I'll even erase this one.

102
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:19,486
   

103
00:04:19,486 --> 00:04:21,704
Let me erase all of this stuff.

104
00:04:21,704 --> 00:04:24,280
   

105
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,430
We have room to work with.

106
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,150
So I kept that figure.

107
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,510
But let me redraw just the
xy plane, just so we get

108
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,300
the visualization right.

109
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,400
It's more important to
visualize the xy plane in

110
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,070
these problems than it
is to visualize the

111
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,090
whole thing in 3-d.

112
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,350
That's the y-axis,
that's the x-axis.

113
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:51,870
   

114
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,230
OK.

115
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:55,720
Our upper bound, you can
say, is the graph y is

116
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,460
equal to x squared.

117
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,210
   

118
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,848
Or, you could view it as
the bound x is equal to

119
00:05:00,848 --> 00:05:02,000
the square root of y.

120
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,510
That is x is equal to 1,
that's y is equal to 1.

121
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,930
And we care about the volume
above the shaded region.

122
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:10,190
Right?

123
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,750
That shaded region is this
yellow region right here.

124
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,800
And let's draw our da.

125
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,520
I'll draw a little
square actually.

126
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,025
And I'll do it in magenta.

127
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:23,490
   

128
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,190
So that's our little da.

129
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,160
And the height is dy.

130
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,370
That's a y.

131
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,260
dy.

132
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,240
And it's with this dx.

133
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,870
Right?

134
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:38,290
So the volume above this little
square-- that's the same

135
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,680
thing as this little square.

136
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,620
Just like we said before, the
volume above it is equal to

137
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,850
the value of the function.

138
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:44,090
Right?

139
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:49,210
The height is the value of the
function, which is x y squared.

140
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,390
And then we multiply it
times the area of the base.

141
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:54,700
Well the area of the base, you
could say it's da, but we know

142
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,490
it's really dy times dx.

143
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,100
   

144
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,680
I didn't have to write
that times there.

145
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,450
You can ignore it.

146
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,800
And I wrote the y first
just because we're

147
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,490
going to integrate with
respect to y first.

148
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,310
We're going to sum
in the y direction.

149
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,300
So what does summing in
the y direction mean?

150
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,920
It means we're going to
add that square to that

151
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,828
square to that square--

152
00:06:14,828 --> 00:06:16,070
[COUGHING]

153
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,800
Excuse me.

154
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,290
So we're adding all the
dy's together, right?

155
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:26,230
So my question to you is, what
is the upper bound on the y?

156
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,600
Well once again, we
bump into the curve.

157
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:28,970
Right?

158
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:32,000
So the curve is the upper
bound when we go upwards.

159
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,130
And what is the upper
bound on the curve?

160
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:37,680
Well we're holding x
fixed, so for any given

161
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,300
x what is this point?

162
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,730
Well that's going
to be x squared.

163
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42,000
Right?

164
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,940
Because this is the graph
of y equals x squared.

165
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:48,700
So our upper bound is y
is equal to x squared.

166
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,800
And what's our lower bound?

167
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,310
We can keep adding these
squares down here.

168
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,550
We're adding all the
little changes in y.

169
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,610
So what's our lower bound?

170
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,730
Well our lower bound is just 0.

171
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:57,575
That was pretty
straightforward.

172
00:06:57,575 --> 00:07:00,470
   

173
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:06,600
So this expression, as it is
written right now, is the

174
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,110
volume above this rectangle.

175
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,940
Right?

176
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,790
Let me draw it.

177
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,860
Is the volume above
this rectangle.

178
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,890
These are the same rectangles.

179
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:22,730
The volume above
that rectangle.

180
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,790
Now what we want to do is add
up all the dx's together, and

181
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,670
we'll get the volume above
the entire surface.

182
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,880
So that rectangle, now
we'll add it to another

183
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,240
dx one, dx one like that.

184
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,920
So what's the upper and
lower bounds on the x's?

185
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,070
We're going from x is
equal to 0, right?

186
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,650
We don't bump into the graph
when we go all the way down.

187
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,950
So we go from x is equal to 0.

188
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:45,060
And then our upper bound
is x is equal to 1.

189
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,520
So x is equal to 0,
x is equal to 1.

190
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,630
And in general, one way to
think about it is when you're

191
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:56,020
doing kind of the last sum or
the last integral, you really

192
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,160
shouldn't have variable
boundaries at this point.

193
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,520
Right?

194
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,120
Because our final answer has
to be a number, assuming

195
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,360
that we're not dealing with
something very, very abstract.

196
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,980
But our final answer is
going to have a number.

197
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,760
So if you had some variables
here you probably

198
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,740
did something wrong.

199
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,640
And it's always useful, I
think, to draw that little da

200
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,160
and then figure out-- OK,
I'm summing to dy first.

201
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,320
When I go upwards I
bump into the curve.

202
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,210
What is that upper bound
if x is constant?

203
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,380
Oh, it's x squared. y
is equal to x squared.

204
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,260
If I go down I bump into the
x-axis, or y is equal to 0.

205
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,410
And so forth and so on.

206
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,910
So now let's just evaluate
this and confirm that

207
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,110
we get the same answer.

208
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,600
So we're integrating with
respect to y first.

209
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:40,040
So that's x y to the
third, over three.

210
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,990
At x squared and 0.

211
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,050
And then we have our outer
integral. x goes from 0 to 1.

212
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,050
dx.

213
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:51,490
If we substitute x
squared in for y.

214
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:55,190
x squared to the third
power is x to the sixth.

215
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,800
x to the sixth times
x-- let me write that.

216
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,300
So we have x times x squared
to the third power, over 3.

217
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,540
That equals x to the seventh.

218
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,750
Right? x squared to the third--
you multiply the exponents, and

219
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:16,350
then you add these. x to the
seventh over 3, minus this

220
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,790
evaluated with y is 0.

221
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,940
But that's just going to be 0.

222
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,410
Right?

223
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:26,400
And then we evaluate
that from 0 to 1, dx.

224
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,680
We're almost there.

225
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,620
Increment the exponent.

226
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,370
You get x to the eighth over 8.

227
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:36,950
And we already have a 3 down
there, so it's over 24.

228
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,760
And you evaluate
that from 0 to 1.

229
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,290
And I think we get
the same answer.

230
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:46,100
When you evaluate it at
1 you get 1/24 minus 0.

231
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,180
So once again, when we
integrate in the other order

232
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:53,340
you still get the volume of
the figure, being 1/4,

233
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,290
whatever, cubic units.

234
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,760
Anyway, see you in
the next video.

235
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,000
