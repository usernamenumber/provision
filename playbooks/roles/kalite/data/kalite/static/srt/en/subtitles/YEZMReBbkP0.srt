00:00:00,938 --> 00:00:06,877
In the last video I talk about how both Ben's Shoes and Jason' shoes are fundamentally the same business

2
00:00:06,877 --> 00:00:09,119
but they have different capital structures.

3
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:12,786
And the way we saw that is that, their everything, their revenue, gross profit

4
00:00:12,786 --> 00:00:15,726
all the way down to their operating profit was exactly the same.

5
00:00:15,726 --> 00:00:20,126
They are generating the same economics from the operating part of their business.

6
00:00:20,126 --> 00:00:22,123
But because they have different capital structures

7
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:24,290
what happens below that line was a little different.

8
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:30,121
In particular, you saw interest expense on Jason's business and not on Ben's income statement.

9
00:00:30,121 --> 00:00:31,586
So let's look at what that means.

10
00:00:31,586 --> 00:00:33,788
So if you look at both of these guys' assets

11
00:00:33,788 --> 00:00:36,193
so this down here, this is kind of their balance sheet.

12
00:00:36,193 --> 00:00:37,919
You see that they are the same

13
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:41,120
they both have 20 thousand dollars in cash, and I've drawn it over here

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,392
this is Ben's assets, 20 thousand dollars in cash, 20 thousand dollars in cash.

15
00:00:46,392 --> 00:00:50,252
They both have one hundred thousand dollars in inventory

16
00:00:50,252 --> 00:00:54,655
and I've made the height proportional to how many dollars we're talking about

17
00:00:54,655 --> 00:01:00,211
so they both have a larger amount of inventory, and then they both have 20 thousand dollars

18
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:02,039
let me do that in that same color

19
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,798
and they both have 20 thousand dollars of equipment

20
00:01:07,798 --> 00:01:09,539
so their assets are the same

21
00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:12,131
the things that are actually generating the revenue

22
00:01:12,131 --> 00:01:14,319
and the profit are the exact same thing

23
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,879
we're assuming that they are also renting in very similar locations

24
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:21,797
that's what would have to happen for them to have such similar economics.

25
00:01:21,797 --> 00:01:25,054
Now what's different about them is what happens on the other side of the balance sheet

26
00:01:25,054 --> 00:01:28,521
and this is what I meant by them having different capital structures

27
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:32,586
so let me draw the liability's side for both of these characters

28
00:01:32,586 --> 00:01:34,876
so let's do liabilities

29
00:01:34,876 --> 00:01:36,873
liabilities there

30
00:01:36,873 --> 00:01:40,126
and liabilities over here

31
00:01:40,126 --> 00:01:43,252
now, they both have the same amount of accounts payables

32
00:01:43,252 --> 00:01:43,253
maybe the people they are buying shoes from are able to delay paying those shoes just a little bit

33
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:50,789
so by a few months, or a few weeks, or whatever

34
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:52,545
so they owe those vendors some money

35
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:56,589
so they both have 5 thousand dollars in accounts payables

36
00:01:56,589 --> 00:01:59,788
let me do that in pink

37
00:01:59,788 --> 00:02:02,212
So they both have 5 thousand dollars.

38
00:02:02,212 --> 00:02:03,919
I will try to do proportional to the size

39
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:06,251
so that right over there, that is the accounts payable

40
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,992
the five thousand dollars.

41
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:10,524
they both have that on the liability size

42
00:02:10,524 --> 00:02:12,233
now where they really diverge

43
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:13,261
so this is the same amount

44
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:14,596
5 thousand dollars

45
00:02:14,596 --> 00:02:18,385
it should be about 1/4 of the size its not exactly how I've drawn it

46
00:02:18,385 --> 00:02:20,261
but where they really diverge is that Jason

47
00:02:20,261 --> 00:02:24,455
Jason over here let me do this in an appropriate colour

48
00:02:24,455 --> 00:02:28,053
Jason over here has 100,000 dollars in debt

49
00:02:28,053 --> 00:02:30,055
and Ben has no debt

50
00:02:30,055 --> 00:02:37,259
so in his liabilities he also has 100,000 dollars in debt

51
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:41,261
this is the debt right over here, 100,000 dollars

52
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:45,322
and Ben doesn't have it so the way you can think about capital structures

53
00:02:45,322 --> 00:02:47,722
they have the same assets, capital structures tells you

54
00:02:47,722 --> 00:02:49,592
how did they pay for their assets

55
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:53,259
did they take it with debt are they deferring payments to some of their vendors

56
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:55,055
or do they have equity

57
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:56,630
and you can see whatever is left over

58
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:00,322
remember owners equity is assets minus liabilities

59
00:03:00,322 --> 00:03:03,641
so what we have left over here is the owners equity

60
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:11,473
so they both have 135,000 dollars in assets, you subtract 105,000 dollars in liabilities for Jason

61
00:03:11,473 --> 00:03:16,922
he has 35,000 dollars in owners equity

62
00:03:16,922 --> 00:03:18,659
On Ben's side he has much more

63
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:22,553
so he kind of pays more of this or more of the capital structure

64
00:03:22,553 --> 00:03:24,528
equity here, more of it is debt

65
00:03:24,528 --> 00:03:29,928
140,000 dollars in assets you have 5000 dollar liability

66
00:03:29,928 --> 00:03:34,475
here he has 135,000 dollars in equity

67
00:03:34,475 --> 00:03:37,993
so when we talk about capital structure we're saying how are we funding the assets

68
00:03:37,993 --> 00:03:43,928
and not only do we talk about the composition between debt and equity

69
00:03:43,928 --> 00:03:46,053
we also talking about the equity is composed

70
00:03:46,053 --> 00:03:50,586
and we can see in both of these their equity is split into 10,000 shares

71
00:03:50,586 --> 00:03:55,788
so each of those shares would be 1/10,000 of just the equity piece

72
00:03:55,788 --> 00:03:59,788
so you can split that into 10,000 or you can split this right here into 10,000
