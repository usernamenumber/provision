1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,530
   

2
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,970
We've talked a lot about
linear transformations.

3
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,070
What I want to do in this video,
and actually the next

4
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,550
few videos, is to show you how
to essentially design linear

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,230
transformations to do things
to vectors that you

6
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,850
want them to do.

7
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,140
So we already know that
if I have some linear

8
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:23,780
transformation, T, and it's a
mapping from Rn to Rm, then we

9
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:28,850
can represent T-- what T does
to any vector in x, or the

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:33,350
mapping of T of x in Rn to Rm--
we could represent it as

11
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:38,570
some matrix times the vector
x, where this would

12
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,200
be an m by n matrix.

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,950
   

14
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,710
And we know that we can always
construct this matrix, that

15
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,830
any linear transformation
can be represented by

16
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:51,840
a matrix this way.

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,160
And we can represent it by
taking our identity matrix,

18
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:02,570
you've seen that before, with
n rows and n columns, so it

19
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,650
literally just looks
like this.

20
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,970
So it's a 1, and then it has n
minus 1, 0's all the way down.

21
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,600
Then it's a 0, 1, and
everything else is

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,890
0's all the way down.

23
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,110
And so essentially you just
have 1's down as diagonal.

24
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,580
It's an n by n matrix.

25
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,860
All of these are 0's,
just like that.

26
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:22,700
You take your identity matrix
and you perform the

27
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,550
transformation on each
of its columns.

28
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,500
   

29
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,890
We call each of these columns
the standard basis Rn.

30
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,180
So this is column e1,
this is column e2,

31
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,890
and it has n columns.

32
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,040
en.

33
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,490
And each of these columns are
of course members of Rn

34
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:43,650
because this is n rows
and n columns matrix.

35
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:50,140
And we know that A, our matrix
A, can be represented as the

36
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,040
transformation being operated
on each of these columns.

37
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,670
So the transformation on e1, and
the transformation on e2,

38
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,930
so forth and so on,
all the way to the

39
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,880
transformation to en.

40
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,290
And this is a really useful
thing to know because it's

41
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,320
very easy to operate any
transformation on each of

42
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:15,060
these basis vectors that only
have a 1 in its corresponding

43
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,580
dimension, or with respect to
the corresponding variable,

44
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,360
and everything else is 0.

45
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,380
So all of this is review.

46
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,430
Let's actually use this
information to construct some

47
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,180
interesting transformations.

48
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:32,740
So let's start with some
set in our Rn.

49
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,880
And actually everything I'm
going to do is going to be in

50
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,070
R2, but you can extend a lot
of this into just general

51
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,130
dimensions.

52
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,390
But we're dealing with
R2 right here.

53
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,610
Obviously, it's only 2
dimensions right here.

54
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:49,470
Let's say we have a triangle
formed by the points, let's

55
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,480
say the first point
is right here.

56
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,860
Let's say it's the point 3, 2.

57
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,890
   

58
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,760
And then you have the point,
let's say that your next point

59
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,960
in your triangle, is the point,
let's just make it the

60
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,210
point minus 3, 2.

61
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:10,440
   

62
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,170
I shouldn't have written
that as a fraction.

63
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,510
I don't know why I did that.

64
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,950
3, 2.

65
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,430
Then you have the point
minus 3, 2.

66
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,050
   

67
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,300
And that's this point
right here.

68
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,710
Minus 3, 2.

69
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,320
And then let's say, just for
fun, let's say you have the

70
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:33,660
point, or the vector-- the
position vector, right?

71
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,910
3, minus 2.

72
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:39,040
   

73
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,470
Which is right here.

74
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:44,170
Now each of these are position
vectors, and I can draw them.

75
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,790
I could draw this 3, 2 as in
the standard position by

76
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,820
drawing an arrow like that.

77
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,500
I could do the minus 3,
2 in its standard

78
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,760
position like that.

79
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,960
And 3, minus 2 I could
draw like that.

80
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,170
But more than the actual
position vectors, I'm more

81
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,960
concerned with the positions
that they specify.

82
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,150
And we know that if we take
the set of all of the

83
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,640
positions or all of the position
vectors that specify

84
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,050
the triangle that is essentially
formed by

85
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,700
connecting these dots.

86
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:17,660
The transformation of this set--
so we're going to apply

87
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,850
some transformation of that--
is essentially, you can take

88
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,310
the transformation of each of
these endpoints and then you

89
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,080
connect the dots in
the same order.

90
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,870
And we saw that several
videos ago.

91
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,925
But let's actually design
a transformation here.

92
00:04:30,925 --> 00:04:33,770
So let's say we want to-- let's
just write down and

93
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,180
words what we want to
do with whatever we

94
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,430
start in our domain.

95
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:43,100
Let's say we want to reflect
around the x-axis.

96
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:49,390
Reflect around-- well
actually let's

97
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,380
reflect around the y-axis.

98
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,670
We essentially want
to flip it over.

99
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,230
We want to flip it
over that way.

100
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,690
So I'm kind of envisioning
something that'll look

101
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,475
something like that when
we flip it over.

102
00:05:02,475 --> 00:05:04,740
So we're going to reflect
it around the y-axis.

103
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:14,490
And let's say we want to stretch
in y direction by 2.

104
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:19,730
In y direction times 2.

105
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,080
So what I envision, we're
going to flip

106
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,440
it over like this.

107
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,670
What I just drew here.

108
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,775
And then we want to stretch
it, so we're going

109
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:26,710
to first flip it.

110
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,020
That's kind of a step 1.

111
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,930
And then step 2 is we're
going to stretch it.

112
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,890
So instead of looking like this,
it'll be twice as tall,

113
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,760
so it'll look like this.

114
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,960
Without necessarily
stretching the x.

115
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,570
So how can we do that?

116
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,990
So the first idea of reflecting

117
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,580
around the y axis, right?

118
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:49,030
So what we want is, this point,
that was a minus 3 in

119
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,370
the x-coordinate right there, we
want this point to have its

120
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,720
same y-coordinate.

121
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,910
We want it to still
have a 2 there.

122
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,510
And I'm calling the second
coordinate here our

123
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,100
y-coordinate.

124
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,690
I could call that our x2
coordinate, but we're used to

125
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:03,810
dealing with the y coordinate
when we graph things.

126
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,280
So I'll just keep calling
it the y-coordinate.

127
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,670
But we want is this negative
3 to turn to a positive 3.

128
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,680
Because we want this point
to end up over here.

129
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,300
And we want this positive 3
here to end up becoming a

130
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,090
negative 3 over here.

131
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,980
And we want this positive 3 for
the x-coordinate to end up

132
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,770
as a negative 3 over there.

133
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,480
So you can imagine all
we're doing is we're

134
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,070
flipping the sign.

135
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:30,160
This reflection around y, this
is just equivalent to flipping

136
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,810
the sign, flipping the sign
of the x-coordinate.

137
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:39,950
So this statement right here is
equivalent to minus 1 times

138
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,110
the x-coordinate.

139
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:45,050
So let's call that times x1.

140
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,440
Because this is x1.

141
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,480
And then stretching in
the y direction.

142
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,190
So what does that mean?

143
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:56,180
That means that whatever height
we have here-- so this

144
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,735
next step here is whatever
height we have here-- I want

145
00:06:58,735 --> 00:07:00,240
it to be 2 times as much.

146
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,030
So right here this coordinate
is 3, 2.

147
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,210
If I didn't do this first
step first, I'd want

148
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,450
to make it 3, 4.

149
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:10,860
I want to make it 2 times
the y-coordinate.

150
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,870
So the next thing I want to do
is I want to 2 times-- well I

151
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,830
can either call it, let me just
call it the y-coordinate.

152
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,720
It's a little bit different
convention that I've been

153
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,540
using, but I'm just calling
these vectors-- instead of

154
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:26,520
calling them x1, and x2, I'm
saying that my vectors in R2--

155
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,950
the first term I'm calling the
x term, or the x entry, and

156
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,010
the second term I'm calling
the y entry.

157
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,980
But it's the same idea that
we've been doing before.

158
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,460
I'm just switching to this
notation because we're used to

159
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,260
thinking of this as the y-axis
access as opposed to the x1

160
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,150
and x2 axis.

161
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,910
So how do we construct
this transformation?

162
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:49,000
I mean, I can write it down in
kind of transformation words.

163
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,140
I could say-- I could define
my transformation as T

164
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,220
of some vector x.

165
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,380
Let me write it this way.

166
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:05,690
T of some vector x, y is going
to be equal to-- I want to

167
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:09,260
take minus 1 times the x, so
I'm going to minus the x.

168
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,860
And I'm going to multiply
2 times the y.

169
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,950
So that's how I could just write
it in transformation

170
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,780
language, and that's pretty
straight forward.

171
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,740
But how would I actually
construct a matrix for this?

172
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,310
So what you do is, you
just take your--

173
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,620
we're dealing in R2.

174
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,450
So you start off with the
identity matrix in R2, which

175
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,840
is just 1, 0, 0, 1.

176
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,809
And you apply this
transformation to each of the

177
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:35,596
columns of this identity
matrix.

178
00:08:35,596 --> 00:08:40,020
   

179
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,789
So if you apply the
transformation to this first

180
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,700
column, what do you get?

181
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,130
So what we're going to do is
to create a new matrix, A.

182
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:53,030
And say that is equal to the
transformation of-- let me

183
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:59,340
write it like this--
Transformation of 1, 0.

184
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,710
That is going to be our new
column, we're just going to

185
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,130
transform this column.

186
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,720
And the second column is going
to be the transformation of

187
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,340
that column.

188
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:11,130
So it's a transformation
of 0, 1.

189
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,570
Just like that.

190
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,340
And so what are these
equal to?

191
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,850
The transformation of 1, 0.

192
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:20,830
So let me write it down
here in green.

193
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,120
So A is equal to?

194
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,150
What's the transformation
of 1, 0 where x is 1?

195
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,060
Where we just take the minus
of the x term, so

196
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,930
we get minus 1.

197
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:32,100
And then 2 times the y term.

198
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,830
So 2 times 0 is just 0.

199
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,160
Now do the second term.

200
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,920
The minus of the 0 term
is just minus 0.

201
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,560
So that just stays 0.

202
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,740
Then you multiply 2
times the y term.

203
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,235
So 2 times y is going to be
equal to 2 times 1, so it's

204
00:09:47,235 --> 00:09:48,830
equal to 2.

205
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:52,140
So now we can describe this
transformation-- so now we

206
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,960
could say the transformation
of some vector, x, y.

207
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,460
We can describe it as a
matrix-vector product.

208
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:08,040
It is equal to minus 1, 0,
0, 2, times our vector.

209
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,510
Times x, y.

210
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,880
And let's apply it to verify
that it works.

211
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,370
To verify that our
matrix works.

212
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:18,470
So this first point, and I'll
try to do it color coded,

213
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,490
let's do this first
point right here.

214
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,370
This is minus 3, 2.

215
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,910
So that's minus 3, 2.

216
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:32,200
So what is minus 3, 2-- I'll
do it right over here.

217
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,740
I could just look at that.

218
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:44,080
So what minus 1, 0, 0,
2, times minus 3, 2?

219
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,070
Well this is just a straight
up matrix-vector product.

220
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:52,570
Minus 1 times minus 3 is
positive 3 plus 0 times 2.

221
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,700
So plus 0.

222
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,260
So this is 3.

223
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:59,010
And then 0 times minus 3 is 0.

224
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,230
Plus 2 times 2.

225
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,510
This is 3, 4.

226
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:07,410
So that point right there will
now become the point 3, 4.

227
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:10,180
It now becomes that
point right there.

228
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:14,690
Let's look at this point right
here, the point 3, 2.

229
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,090
So let's take our transformation
matrix, minus

230
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:23,220
1, 0, 0, 2, times 3, 2.

231
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:29,010
This is equal to minus 1 times
3 is minus 3 plus 0 times 2.

232
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,205
So it's just minus 3.

233
00:11:30,205 --> 00:11:32,940
And you have 0 times
3, which is 0.

234
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,830
Plus 2 times 2, which is 4.

235
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,440
0 plus-- so you got
that point.

236
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,590
So this point, by our
transformation, T, becomes

237
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,970
minus 3, 4.

238
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,430
So minus 3, 4.

239
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,530
And I kind of switch
in my terminology.

240
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,460
I said, becomes, or you could
say it's mapped to if you want

241
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,510
to use the language that I used
when I introduced the

242
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,620
ideas of functions and
transformation.

243
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,720
This point is mapped to
this point in R2.

244
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,550
And then finally let's look at
this point right here, apply

245
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:06,090
our transformation matrix
that we've engineered.

246
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:12,590
Let's multiply minus 1, 0, 0,
2, times this point right

247
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,730
here, which is 3, minus 2.

248
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:17,800
   

249
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,960
Which is equal to minus
1 times 3 is minus 3.

250
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,810
And then 0 times minus
2 is just 0.

251
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,220
So this just becomes minus 3.

252
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,300
And then 0 times 3 is 0.

253
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,290
2 times minus 2 is minus 4.

254
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,470
So minus 3, minus 4.

255
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:39,320
So this point right here becomes
minus 3, minus 4.

256
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,400
Becomes that point
right there.

257
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,670
And we know that the set in R2
that connects these dots, by

258
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:49,640
the same transformation, will
be mapped to the set in R3

259
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,750
that connects these dots.

260
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,480
We've seen that already.

261
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,920
I think that was 3 videos ago.

262
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,410
So the image of this set that
I've drawn here, this triangle

263
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:03,360
is just a set of points
specified by a set of vectors.

264
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,460
The image of that set of
position vectors specifies

265
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,060
these points right here.

266
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:14,480
Specifies the points that
I'm drawing right here.

267
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,440
Let me see if I'm
doing it right.

268
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,490
There you go, just like that.

269
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,450
And low and behold, it has done
what we wanted to do.

270
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,830
We flipped it over, so that we
got this side onto the other

271
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:25,920
side, like that.

272
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,490
And then we stretched it.

273
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,060
And we stretched it in
the y direction.

274
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:32,200
And we we see that it has
stretched by a factor of 2.

275
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,340
We flipped it first, and
then we stretched it

276
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,700
by factor of 2.

277
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,940
And, in general, any of these
operations can be performed--

278
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,040
I mean, you can always go
back to the basics.

279
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,520
You can always say, look I can
write my transformation in

280
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,340
this type of form, then
I can just apply

281
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:49,590
that to my basis vectors.

282
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,420
Or the columns in my
identity matrix.

283
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:57,070
But a general theme is any of
these transformations that

284
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,725
literally just scale in either
the x or y direction, and when

285
00:14:00,725 --> 00:14:03,640
I-- or, well, you could
say, scale.

286
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,970
They can either shrink
or expand

287
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,280
in the x or y direction.

288
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,400
Or flip in the x or y direction,
creating a

289
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,280
reflection.

290
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:14,460
These are going to be
diagonal matrices.

291
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,740
Diagonal matrices.

292
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:21,830
   

293
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,430
And why are they diagonal
matrices?

294
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,870
Because they only have non-zero

295
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,395
terms along their diagonals.

296
00:14:27,395 --> 00:14:28,840
This is the 2 by 2 case.

297
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,270
If I did a 3 by 3, it would be
0's everywhere, except along

298
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,210
the diagonal.

299
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:37,020
And it makes a lot of sense
because this first term is

300
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,890
essentially what you're
doing to the x1 term.

301
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:42,130
The second term is what you're
doing to the x2 term.

302
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,900
Or the y term in our example.

303
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,640
If I had multiple terms, if this
was a 3 by 3, that would

304
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,680
be what I would do to
the third dimension.

305
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,900
Then the next term would
be what I would

306
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,020
do the fourth dimension.

307
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,430
So you could expand this idea
to an arbitrary Rn.

308
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:58,370
Anyway, the whole point of this
video is to introduce you

309
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:01,550
to this idea of creating
custom transformations.

310
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,150
And I think you're already
starting to realize that this

311
