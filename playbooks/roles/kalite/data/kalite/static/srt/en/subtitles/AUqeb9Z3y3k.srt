1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,540
   

2
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,470
We've done a lot of work
on multiplying, adding,

3
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,950
subtracting and inverting
matrices.

4
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,280
So now let's delve a little
into what a matrix is

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,250
actually good for.

6
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,800
And remember, all a matrix
is is, a way of

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,870
representing data.

8
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,120
And all of those rules we
learned, you can kind of view

9
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,890
them as human-created rules.

10
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:23,660
There's no fundamental thing in
nature that says matrices

11
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,490
have to be multiplied
the way we learned.

12
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:29,240
But I think you'll see as we
progress into applications,

13
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,220
that the way that matrix
operations have been defined

14
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,020
are actually quite useful.

15
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,230
So let's go back to our Algebra
1 or Algebra 2.

16
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,920
I forget when you tend
to learn it.

17
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,060
But let's go back to
linear equations.

18
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,680
So what were linear equations?

19
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,830
Systems of linear equations.

20
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,610
Well you had two lines, and you
essentially had to figure

21
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,370
out where the two lines
intersected.

22
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,630
So you might have had something
like-- let me think

23
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:58,955
of something-- 3x plus 2y.

24
00:00:58,955 --> 00:01:03,560
   

25
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,130
Is equal to 7.

26
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:20,730
And then you might have, minus
6x plus 6y is equal to-- I

27
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,740
need to do this in my head just
to make sure that I get

28
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,230
numbers that work out
well-- equal to 6.

29
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,760
I think this will
work out well.

30
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,060
And what was this problem
essentially?

31
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,870
Well this is a line,
and this is a line.

32
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,870
So you had to figure out
where they intersected.

33
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:38,890
And if you were to draw
those two lines--

34
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,920
Actually let's draw them.

35
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,740
Just because this is all about
getting intuition, and seeing

36
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,530
how it maps over into
the matrix world.

37
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,590
   

38
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,160
And the word 'matrix world'
has a whole new

39
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,730
meaning after 1999.

40
00:01:54,730 --> 00:02:01,730
Let's see, so if that's my
coordinate axes, what is this?

41
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,750
I always have to put everything
into y equals mx

42
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,759
plus b form for me to-- So
this equation is what?

43
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:18,240
It's y is equal to
3/2 x plus 7/2.

44
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,680
So 7/2 is what?

45
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,700
It's like 3 1/2 or something?

46
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,150
So if that's 7/2, that's going
to have a slope of 3 1/2.

47
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,580
So it's a little bit steeper
than a slope of 1.

48
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,050
So it's going to look
something like that.

49
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,300
That's that line.

50
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,480
   

51
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,800
And then this line is going
to look like what?

52
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,380
I'll do a different color.

53
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:46,230
It's going to look like-- It's
the same thing is as--

54
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:46,660
Oh, you know what?

55
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,910
I did that wrong.

56
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:54,900
   

57
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,480
Because that line, I just
realized, is equal to

58
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,710
minus 3x plus 7/2.

59
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,470
Because when you take this to
the other side, it becomes

60
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,470
minus 3x divided by 2, so
it's actually going

61
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,550
to be downward sloping.

62
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,450
So it will look something
like this.

63
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,820
It's going to be a little bit
steeper than something that

64
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,220
has a slope of negative 1, so
I'm just approximating.

65
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,820
So that line will look
something like that.

66
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:26,940
And this line, this will be y--
I'm just rewriting this--

67
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:32,590
y is equal to x plus
1, if I'm right.

68
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:32,890
Yeah.

69
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,120
Because this go to
the other side.

70
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,410
Divide everything by 6.

71
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:41,510
y is equal to x plus 1, so its
y intercept will be-- We said

72
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:45,240
this was 3 and 1/2, so
maybe if this is 1.

73
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,360
And it has a slope of 1.

74
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,080
Then it'll just look like
something like this.

75
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,900
   

76
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,780
And so when you solve a system
of equations, you're

77
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,900
essentially looking for the x
and the y values that satisfy

78
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,310
both of these equations.

79
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,180
This magenta line shows us all
the x and y values that

80
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,410
satisfy this first
linear equation.

81
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,210
And this green line shows all
of the x's and y's that

82
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,750
satisfy the second equation.

83
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,399
And of course where they
intersect shows us the

84
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:26,060
particular x and y that
satisfies both equations.

85
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,010
So that's what we did
in Algebra 1.

86
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:33,610
We'd solve both of these
equations for that.

87
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:41,650
And we'd either do it by
substitution, or we'd scale

88
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,370
them and add them together,
et cetera, et cetera.

89
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,970
As you'll see, that's
essentially just what we

90
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,290
learned in the Gauss-Jordan
elimination.

91
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,350
It's the exact same thing.

92
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,600
It's just when we did the
Gauss-Jordan elimination, we

93
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,230
just represented it a
little different.

94
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,600
But I think you know
this much.

95
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,070
But let's now do it in
the matrix world.

96
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:01,030
So how can we represent this
problem as a matrix?

97
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,580
We could write it like this,
and we'll take out a little

98
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,440
time to prove to you that
it really is the same

99
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,120
representation.

100
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,740
If you define matrices the way
we have defined them in their

101
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,850
multiplication.

102
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:23,020
You can define this problem
as 3, minus 6, 2, 6.

103
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,390
I just took the coefficients,
3, minus 6, 2, 6.

104
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:31,880
And if I were to multiply
that by soon. column

105
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,560
vector matrix xy.

106
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,130
   

107
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:42,010
And if I were to set that equal
to another column vector

108
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:47,520
matrix, 7, 6.

109
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,380
   

110
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,540
Now you might want to pause it
and actually just try to

111
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,650
multiply this out, the way
that we have learned to

112
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:55,720
multiply matrices.

113
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,250
And you will see that you
get the same thing.

114
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,660
But I will do it now,
in case you don't

115
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,740
want to do it yourself.

116
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,920
So let's just multiply
these two matrices.

117
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,025
Let's multiply this matrix
out and see what happens.

118
00:06:05,025 --> 00:06:10,940
   

119
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,440
So what do you do?

120
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,610
You get your row information
from the first matrix, column

121
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,480
information from the
second matrix.

122
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,140
And this is of course
the product matrix.

123
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:24,560
So this is saying, 3 times x
plus 2 times y is equal to 7.

124
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,820
Well that's exactly what
we wrote up here.

125
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,250
3 times x plus 2 times
y is equal to 7.

126
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,760
And similarly when you multiply
the bottom row, you

127
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,260
get minus 6 times x plus 6
times y is equal to 6.

128
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,990
So if that was a little
confusing to you, go review

129
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,210
how we multiply matrices.

130
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,240
But if you just multiply this
out, you'll get these exact

131
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,500
same equations.

132
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,840
So hopefully you understand that
this is just another way

133
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,420
of representing this problem.

134
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,580
Although we've gotten rid
of the plus signs

135
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,490
and the equals signs.

136
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,950
But of course you have to
know the representation.

137
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,425
But why is this useful?

138
00:06:55,425 --> 00:06:59,000
Why is this representation
useful?

139
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,790
Well let's call this matrix a.

140
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:07,250
   

141
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,350
Let's call this vector x.

142
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:13,190
   

143
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:13,950
It's not a variable.

144
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,480
It's a vector.

145
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,420
So maybe we'll bold it, or we'll
put a little vector sign

146
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:17,970
there or something.

147
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:18,310
Whatever.

148
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,310
But you'll see it in
your textbook.

149
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,920
It's bolded real heavy.

150
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,190
And then we call
this vector b.

151
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:27,800
And the general notation-- if
I remember it correctly-- is

152
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,540
that anything that's a matrix
or a vector is bolded.

153
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,850
And matrices that are not
vectors, that have more than

154
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,360
one dimension in either
of the dimensions,

155
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,420
they're capital letters.

156
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,410
While lower-case letters
represent vectors.

157
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,580
So these are matrices, but
they're also vectors.

158
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,560
So that's why they got the
lowercase letters.

159
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,420
And that's why this one got
the uppercase letters.

160
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,690
That's just convention.

161
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:56,370
So this equation has the form
ax equals b, where a is this

162
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,350
matrix, x is this vector-- or
this matrix, same thing-- and

163
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,420
b is this column vector.

164
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,850
So what does that do for us?

165
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,470
Well, what happens if
we knew a inverse?

166
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,020
Well actually, let me
take a step back.

167
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,150
If these were numbers,
what would we do?

168
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:17,410
If I just gave you an algebra
equation, ax is equal to b.

169
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,920
How do you solve that?

170
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,870
Well you would divide both sides
of this equation by a.

171
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,080
Or another way of saying it, you
would multiply both sides

172
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,380
of this equation by
the inverse of a.

173
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:35,720
So you would essentially say,
1/a times ax is equal

174
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,789
to 1/a times b.

175
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:42,020
And then these would cancel out,
and you would get x is

176
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,380
equal to b/a.

177
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,840
That's how we would do
it in a traditional

178
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,690
simple, linear equation.

179
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,130
So how would you do it here?

180
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:57,170
Well what's the matrix
analogy to division?

181
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,430
And I'm going to give
you the answer now.

182
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,400
What's the analogy to
multiplying by your inverse?

183
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,820
Well, it's multiplying
by your inverse.

184
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,980
So what if we knew the
matrix a inverse?

185
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,900
We could just multiply
both sides of this

186
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,280
equation by a inverse.

187
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,390
And remember, order matters.

188
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,310
So it's not like when you're
doing a linear equation you

189
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,910
could multiply 1/a
on this side.

190
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,150
But then you can do it on
the right side here.

191
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,350
But no.

192
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,700
Notice, I put it in front of
the numbers in both cases.

193
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,840
So you have to do it in front of
the numbers in both cases.

194
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,750
But if we know a inverse, and
if a inverse exists, then we

195
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,240
can multiply both sides-- you
can say the left side of both

196
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,705
sides of this equation
by a inverse.

197
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:35,160
   

198
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:44,580
a inverse times a, times the
vector x is equal to a

199
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,480
inverse times b.

200
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,550
All I did is I took this
expression, and I multiplied

201
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,160
both sides by a inverse.

202
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,880
And what's a inverse times a?

203
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,260
Well that's just the
identity matrix.

204
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,070
That's the identity matrix,
times x is equal

205
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:03,570
to a inverse b.

206
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,900
And of course that's just x.

207
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,720
The identity matrix times
any other matrix

208
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,720
is just that matrix.

209
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,540
So that's just the matrix
x, or the vector x

210
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:15,310
times a inverse b.

211
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:19,010
So, if you're given a linear
equation, and if you know the

212
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,400
inverse of this matrix, to solve
for x and y, we just

213
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,740
have to multiply this number
times the inverse.

214
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,690
And you might say, Sal,
that's such a pain.

215
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,720
Because this is such a simple
linear equation to solve.

216
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,210
Why would I go through all the
trouble of getting an inverse,

217
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,370
and then multiplying the inverse
times this number.

218
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,570
And I would agree with
you to some degree.

219
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:39,960
That for a 2 by 2 system of
equations, it is easier to

220
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,150
solve it the way that you did it
in Algebra 1 or Algebra 2.

221
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:49,170
But if you're doing it for a 3
by 3, well, finding a matrix

222
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,780
is still pretty difficult
for a 3 by 3,

223
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,460
so it's still difficult.

224
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,990
But as you get to larger and
larger numbers, it's

225
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,900
sometimes-- well, finding a
matrix can be difficult too--

226
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:01,370
But actually the real place
where it you really, really

227
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:05,980
pays off is, let's say that
you have a bunch of linear

228
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,220
equations to solve.

229
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,160
And the left hand side
stays the same.

230
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,150
But you keep changing
the right hand side.

231
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,860
So let's say you have
ax equals b.

232
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,380
And then you have another one
that says, ax equals c,

233
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,680
and ax equals d.

234
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,380
And these numbers
keep changing.

235
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,730
And these numbers
are the same.

236
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:23,080
Then it really pays off to
solve for the inverse.

237
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,200
And then every time you need
to find a new solution, you

238
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,090
just multiply your new
right-hand side times your

239
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,880
inverse, and you just
get the answer.

240
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,810
And that'll really pay
off when we view

241
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:33,950
this in another way.

242
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:34,870
But anyway, I wanted
to show you that

243
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,020
this is the same thing.

244
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,540
And so let's solve
it using what our

245
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,020
knowledge is of matrices.

246
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,070
Let me erase this here, and I
know I'm running over time,

247
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,440
but hopefully I'm not completely
boring you.

248
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,750
   

249
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,780
So I'm going to keep that there,
just because I think

250
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,080
it's nice to have that
visual representation

251
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,650
of what we're doing.

252
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,240
Always to remember
what's going on.

253
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,930
So, what's a inverse?

254
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:05,860
So first of all, the a inverse
is equal to 1 over the

255
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:12,260
determinant of a times the
adjoint of this matrix.

256
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,520
I don't want to get fancy with
terminology and all that, but

257
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,350
what was that?

258
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,950
2 by 2 is fairly easy.

259
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:21,980
You swap these two terms.
You get a 6 and a 3.

260
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,690
And then you make these
two terms negative.

261
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,100
So a minus 6 becomes a 6.

262
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,780
And a 2 becomes a minus 2.

263
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,500
   

264
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,870
And what's the determinant
of a?

265
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:36,610
The determinant of a is equal to
this times this minus this

266
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,070
times this.

267
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,830
So 3 times 6.

268
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:45,840
3 times 6 is 18 minus
this times this.

269
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,540
So 6 times 2 is 12.

270
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,430
That's a minus 6.

271
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,320
That's minus 12.

272
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,460
So minus minus 12.

273
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,280
It's equal to plus.

274
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,690
So 18 plus 12 is equal to 30.

275
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,350
So what does a inverse equal?

276
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,090
1 over 30 times this thing.

277
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:10,870
So a inverse is equal to-- we
could even keep the 1/30 on

278
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,120
the outside.

279
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,830
   

280
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,490
That might simplify things.

281
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,520
Well actually I'll put it--

282
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,890
So a inverse is equal to what?

283
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,120
This divided by 30.

284
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:33,300
So that's 1/5, minus-- Actually
I do want to keep it

285
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,180
on the outside, because that's
going to make the later

286
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,080
multiplications easier.

287
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:46,570
So anyway, a is equal to 1/30
times 6, minus 2, 6, 3.

288
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,680
That's a inverse.

289
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,370
So now let's solve
for x and y.

290
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:53,340
So we said x and y is equal
to a inverse times b.

291
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:58,990
So we could say x-- another way
to write x is like this.

292
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,820
x is just this vector.

293
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,090
x and y.

294
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:04,785
Not to get confused, this x is
different than that x, even

295
00:14:04,785 --> 00:14:05,570
though I've written
them the same.

296
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:08,430
If I was a typographer, I would
make this really bold,

297
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,040
so that you know that
this is a vector.

298
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,890
Maybe I should put a
vector notation.

299
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:12,150
I don't know.

300
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,480
You could do a bunch
of things with it.

301
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,890
It's equal to a inverse
times this.

302
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,660
So that's 1/30.

303
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,490
I did that just for the
matrix addition.

304
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:26,920
I didn't divide everything
by 30, just so the matrix

305
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,580
multiplication's a
little easier.

306
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:32,510
Minus 2, 3, times 7/6.

307
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:37,930
   

308
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,616
And so what is this equal to?

309
00:14:40,616 --> 00:14:45,700
It's equal to 1/30 times-- I
know I'm crowding this down

310
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,810
here-- let's see.

311
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:52,440
6 times 7 minus 2 times 6.

312
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:59,240
So 6 times 7 is 42.

313
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,690
Minus 2 times 6, so minus 12.

314
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,830
So that's equal to the 30.

315
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,220
And then 6 times 7
plus 2 times 6.

316
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,090
So 6 times 7, once
again is 42.

317
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,820
Plus 2 times 6.

318
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:17,420
So 42 plus 12 is 50.

319
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,620
Is that right?

320
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,990
6 times 7-- oh I'm sorry.

321
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:23,700
This is a 3.

322
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,320
That's why I was getting
confused.

323
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,700
See, it's important to
have good penmanship.

324
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:33,565
So it's 6 times 7 is
42, plus 3 times 6.

325
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:38,120
So it's 42 plus 18,
which is 60.

326
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,480
And of course you divide
both of them by 30.

327
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,770
So you get the final xy.

328
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,450
I'll write it here.

329
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,480
I don't want to erase
anything.

330
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,850
So we get xy is equal to--
divide both of those by 30--

331
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:58,410
is equal to 1 and 2.

332
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:02,420
And so that tells us that these
two linear equations

333
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:10,160
intersect at the point x is
equal to 1, y is equal to 2.

334
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,610
That might seem a little bit
like a lot of work, but that's

335
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,480
just because I took the time
to explain it and all that.

336
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,000
But if you just immediately took
that, represented it this

337
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,240
way, found the inverse, and
multiplied, it wouldn't have

338
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,050
taken you that much time.

339
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,100
And I encourage you to do
that as an exercise.

340
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,530
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.

341
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,610
And in the next video, we're
going to do this exact same

342
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,010
problem, but we're going to see
that this data represents

343
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,370
a different problem.

344
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,620
See

345
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:31,900
