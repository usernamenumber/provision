1
00:00:00,267 --> 00:00:04,400
There are many things that differentiate human beings from other species,

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:11,067
but the one thing that probably differentiates humans even from our closest relatives in the animal kingdom

3
00:00:11,067 --> 00:00:16,600
in a really big way is the notion that humans are collective learners.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,467
Collective learners.

5
00:00:18,467 --> 00:00:22,800
And to understand that, let's think about how even our closest relative in the animal kingdom,

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,067
the chimpanzee, might communicate.

7
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:28,708
So you might have one chimpanzee and over the course of his or her lifetime,

8
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:35,179
they're able to learn a bunch of cool experiences, and they're even able to learn to use tools,

9
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:37,595
manipulate tools, and who knows? Maybe even make tools.

10
00:00:37,595 --> 00:00:43,800
Maybe even get a twig someplace and take off the leaves, and then use that to go get ants out of a hole or whatever else.

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,333
So they're able to learn all of this stuff over a lifetime.

12
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:52,067
Now unfortunate for chimpanzees, well what IS fortunate for chimpanzees, is they do teach some of these

13
00:00:52,067 --> 00:00:56,933
things that they've learned to other members of their group, often their offspring.

14
00:00:56,933 --> 00:01:02,467
But what's unfortunate for chimpanzees is that they don't have a great way to communicate with each other.

15
00:01:02,467 --> 00:01:09,252
So for most chimpanzees, the way that they're able to teach is essentially by, kind of...showing.

16
00:01:09,252 --> 00:01:11,271
Not showing and telling, just showing.

17
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:18,200
And so because this is such a, this is such a, a unprecise, or, or...not exact

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,933
and, and such an inefficient way of communication,

19
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:26,815
the really...all of the nuances of what this chimpanzee might be able to accumulate over his or her lifetime

20
00:01:26,815 --> 00:01:32,600
aren't able to be conveyed to the next generation, or to the other chimpanzees around,

21
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,333
so you have tremendous energy loss.

22
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:40,641
And in particular, all that can be conveyed are maybe the specific movements, or what you might be able

23
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:42,933
to kind of observe in the present.

24
00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:46,400
All of the other things that maybe the chimpanzees are learning about...

25
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,533
the times of year where this is be appropriate, or maybe they can convey some of that by showing

26
00:01:50,533 --> 00:01:52,000
them at the right times of year.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,333
But other nuanced aspects of it, or particular ways to hold something or twist something

28
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:02,200
can only be shown. It can't be described in a very precise way.

29
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,800
So you have all of this loss of experience, just loss of information.

30
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:12,467
And then over the course of these animals' life, they may be able to learn the same amount again,

31
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:18,733
they're able to learn maybe the same amount again, but then when they need to communicate it, they have the exact same problem.

32
00:02:18,733 --> 00:02:22,667
It's hard to communicate it with their, with what they have at their disposal,

33
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:25,667
which is really just showing the other chimpanzees what they've done,

34
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:29,200
and so once again, you have a loss of information.

35
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,400
And what you have in this type of circumstance is, generation after generation,

36
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,733
even though there is learning over the course of an individual chimpanzee's life,

37
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:42,067
and even though they can communicate to, some of that, to each other,

38
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:47,744
that form of communication is so, it loses so much information, and so much nuance

39
00:02:47,744 --> 00:02:56,467
that you never have an overall accumulation of knowledge, and wisdom in this chimpanzee population.

40
00:02:56,467 --> 00:03:01,000
Now humans, on the other hand, have something called symbolic language.

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,733
And I'll talk about this in a second, but it's, it's, for now it's safe to say that human language is

42
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:12,123
far more precise and far more efficient than just being able to show someone something.

43
00:03:12,123 --> 00:03:17,333
Imagine if you had to learn how to do something without being able to communicate verbally,

44
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,800
you'd just have to look at someone else's actions.

45
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,400
And then you'd have a good idea of how difficult it is for chimpanzees to teach other other.

46
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,071
But in the case of human beings, we have this thing called symbolic language, that's a very precise,

47
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:31,929
a very efficient way of communicating.

48
00:03:31,929 --> 00:03:36,333
So from one human being to another, you could actually communicate a good deal.

49
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:40,944
Maybe not every single nuance and every single experience, but a good chunk of it.

50
00:03:40,944 --> 00:03:48,498
So right here I'm drawing about that much of it, to the next, to some other human being, maybe it is the offspring, maybe it

51
00:03:48,544 --> 00:03:51,185
is another member of the tribe, or the group, whatever it is,

52
00:03:51,185 --> 00:03:54,533
and then this human being might come up with some other innovations.

53
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:59,882
They're able to build off of all of this learning from that previous generation or from that other human

54
00:03:59,882 --> 00:04:05,667
being that's around, and they're able to come up with their own, their own nuances, and their own innovations.

55
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:10,067
And this one right over here might come up with his or her own nuances and innovations,

56
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:16,133
and because they have a good communication mechanism, this one could even communicate to that one

57
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:20,113
what he's learned, or what she's learned, and communicate a good chunk of that.

58
00:04:20,113 --> 00:04:22,779
Maybe not all of it, but maybe a reasonable bit.

59
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:26,467
They can describe exactly how they do something, the times of years,

60
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:29,800
when it's good to do it, when it's not good to do it,

61
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,267
how to plan for the future, what's the history of this new learning.

62
00:04:34,267 --> 00:04:39,800
And so what you have going on here is because of this strong communication mechanism.

63
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:50,969
So strong, precise, precise, efficient communication, efficient communication, communication.

64
00:04:50,969 --> 00:04:56,600
What you'd have is a human group, or eventually a human civilization,

65
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:03,508
is able to have a collective memory. Is able to have a collective memory,

66
00:05:03,508 --> 00:05:08,333
In the case of the chimpanzees, in every generation, every chimpanzee is having to

67
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:13,200
relearn the things that the other chimpanzees might have already done in previous generations.

68
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,067
They're not able to really move forward or build on those in significant ways.

69
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:21,954
In humans, as information is learned and experienced again,

70
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:26,267
a good bit of that is able to be passed on to other humans.

71
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:30,221
So this might be passed on. So all of this might be passed on,

72
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:32,882
or a good chunk of this could be passed on to the next generation.

73
00:05:32,882 --> 00:05:36,785
And I'm not even talking about written language yet. This could even, this could still just be

74
00:05:36,785 --> 00:05:42,400
oral communication, which is still a very strong, precise, efficient means of communication.

75
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,333
Written communication takes it to another level,

76
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:50,329
but then this person over here, maybe she comes up with other innovations.

77
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:54,067
And at some point you might say, well look, if everyone keeps having innovations and they

78
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:57,733
keep learning what everyone learned in previous generations, maybe this will tap out

79
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:01,800
the total amount of memory that a human being even has.

80
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,800
And there's actually a case, and maybe this is why humans even have larger memories,

81
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,067
because there is all of this collective knowledge to gain from one generation to another,

82
00:06:10,067 --> 00:06:11,733
from one human being to another,

83
00:06:11,733 --> 00:06:16,133
but there are some limits to this, and this is the other element where this collective aspect

84
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:20,333
of collective memory and this collective learning becomes really powerful.

85
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:24,682
A human being, because of this strong communication mechanism,

86
00:06:24,682 --> 00:06:28,348
is not just limited to the knowledge and the experience in their memory,

87
00:06:28,348 --> 00:06:34,667
they are able to tap into, so this human being right over here does not have this skill set,

88
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:38,333
and that skill set maybe gets passed on to another human being.

89
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:45,021
So let me copy and paste that, so let's say you copy...say you paste that...

90
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:47,800
This other human being that's maybe living at the same time,

91
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,246
and when that becomes relevant, when that becomes relevant, they could

92
00:06:51,246 --> 00:06:54,467
actually tap into it, and maybe they could learn it from that human being,

93
00:06:54,467 --> 00:06:59,267
or maybe it's in a different part of society, and this human being can build certain tools,

94
00:06:59,267 --> 00:07:03,838
or build certain things using this information, using that knowledge right over there

95
00:07:03,838 --> 00:07:07,067
and then this human being doesn't need to know that information,

96
00:07:07,067 --> 00:07:11,733
they can just leverage the output of that information to then build on top of it.

97
00:07:11,733 --> 00:07:16,223
So what allows human beings to do is not only convey information and build on information

98
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:20,225
from generation to generation, human to human, it allows all of the human

99
00:07:20,225 --> 00:07:24,867
brains collectively, at any given point of time, to be one collective memory bank,

100
00:07:24,867 --> 00:07:29,333
that can be used to develop or innovate in specific domains,

101
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:34,405
and adapt to specific parts of the ecosystem, or to teach other other.

102
00:07:34,405 --> 00:07:38,979
So all of a sudden, this is really unique as far as we can tell, in the animal kingdom.

103
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:45,267
All of a sudden, it's not all about the brain, or the memory, of one individual member of a species,

104
00:07:45,267 --> 00:07:50,667
it now becomes about the brain, or the memory, of the entire civilization, or the entire group of the

105
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:56,267
species. And just as an example of that, there's, as far as I know, there's no human being

106
00:07:56,267 --> 00:08:00,067
who knows how to do everything that all humans know how to do.

107
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:04,575
I could imagine that there are, there is a chimpanzee that knows how to do everything

108
00:08:04,575 --> 00:08:06,802
that any other chimpanzee knows how to do.

109
00:08:06,802 --> 00:08:15,933
There are no humans that can be a fighter pilot, a doctor, a gymnast, a...lawyer,

110
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:19,200
understands philosophy, speaks twenty different languages.

111
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:24,933
As far as I know, that human being does not exist. And that's okay, because they can tap into the experiences,

112
00:08:24,933 --> 00:08:28,267
the abilities of other human beings to build up their civilization.

113
00:08:28,267 --> 00:08:33,413
None of us, as far as we know, knows how to do everything that we need to actually build our civilization.

114
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:37,846
But the information is in our collective memory to actually do it.

115
00:08:37,846 --> 00:08:41,682
Now the next thing you might say is, okay, I started with this premise that we have a

116
00:08:41,682 --> 00:08:46,323
strong, precise, efficient means of communcation, and that other animals don't,

117
00:08:46,323 --> 00:08:50,200
but don't other animals actually have some form of language?

118
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,467
So for example, don't...for example, even monkeys,

119
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:59,600
wouldn't they screech when they're, when there's, when they're in danger?

120
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,533
That's a form of communication, maybe a form of language.

121
00:09:02,548 --> 00:09:08,600
Maybe certain animals: birds, monkeys, maybe they have a song that they sing that can convey certain things.

122
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,836
Maybe it's when they're, maybe it's when they're looking for a mate.

123
00:09:11,836 --> 00:09:14,533
Isn't that a form of communication?

124
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:18,615
And these are, these are a form of communication, and a form of language,

125
00:09:18,615 --> 00:09:22,746
but these don't really come in play in terms of the teaching-learning.

126
00:09:22,746 --> 00:09:26,067
You don't see one chimpanzee making screeching sounds for learning sounds.

127
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:29,333
They might do a little bit of it just to warn, maybe as a warning.

128
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:34,652
But there's no deep nuance, or deep precision that's being able to convey by these, by these

129
00:09:34,652 --> 00:09:38,133
one off sounds, or even one off gestures.

130
00:09:38,133 --> 00:09:43,133
And what's particularly powerful about human language is that it is a symbolic language.

131
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:45,856
It is a symbolic language.

132
00:09:45,856 --> 00:09:50,000
And when I say it's a symbolic language, I'm even saying it in a broader sense

133
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,067
than even just written symbols.

134
00:09:52,067 --> 00:09:55,133
I'm talking about even the sounds themselves.

135
00:09:55,133 --> 00:09:58,467
So let's go to a time where we did not even have writings.

136
00:09:58,467 --> 00:10:02,333
And when we talk about symbolic languages, let's think about a non-symbolic language,

137
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:07,000
so in a non-symbolic language, you might have some sound, let's call it sound one,

138
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,610
and it has some meaning. Let's call it meaning one, meaning one.

139
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:15,400
So this might be a certain type of scream, it means that a predator is approaching.

140
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,554
And then you might have something like a sound two, or gesture two,

141
00:10:19,554 --> 00:10:23,129
and then it has some other meaning, it has meaning two.

142
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:28,867
It might be a certain type of song, which means that I am in the mood to reproduce, or whatever else.

143
00:10:28,867 --> 00:10:33,800
You might have gesture three, gesture three, that has some direct meaning.

144
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:39,082
It might mean that I have found food, or something like that. So meaning three.

145
00:10:39,082 --> 00:10:43,800
What humans have, they can do this, where particular sounds have particular meanings.

146
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:50,000
So for example, in humans, you could have sound one, it refers to meaning one.

147
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,400
I'll just refer it to meaning one.

148
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,836
You could have sound two, that refers to meaning two.

149
00:10:54,836 --> 00:10:57,800
You could have sound three, that is, refers to meaning three.

150
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,667
So these are just direct representaions.

151
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:05,200
But what is really powerful about symbolic languages is that these, these, oral symbols

152
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,100
can be combined according to set rules, or grammars,

153
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,467
to have an infinite number of meanings!

154
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:16,000
So what, this is what really makes human language transcend other languages,

155
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,333
and really makes it this robust, precise communication mechanism,

156
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,600
is you could have combinations.

157
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,333
Sound one, sound two, sound three will now have another meaning, meaning four.

158
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:30,200
Then you could maybe have a combination where you have sound three, sound one, and sound two,

159
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,333
might have meaning five.

160
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:38,467
And if you have tens of thousands of sounds, and, really, our oral words are those sounds in a given language,

161
00:11:38,467 --> 00:11:42,333
then all of a sudden you can have infinite meanings by putting them in different combinations.

162
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:45,800
And if you think this is a little bit abstract, imagine that sound one is the sound,

163
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,615
me saying the word "dog".

164
00:11:47,615 --> 00:11:51,667
And I'm not even gonna write it down, 'cause I wanna imagine a world even before written communication.

165
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:54,400
So sound one is the sound "dog".

166
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,267
Sound two is the sound "eats".

167
00:11:57,267 --> 00:12:00,733
And sound three is the sound "man".

168
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:03,852
So, literally, sound one, if you heard "dog", you'd think

169
00:12:03,852 --> 00:12:10,036
okay, I'd visualize a dog of some type, and well, you'd have some visualization of a dog.

170
00:12:10,036 --> 00:12:11,733
And we all have one maybe.

171
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:15,621
Sound two, if you heard "eats", you'd say okay, I imagine eating in some way.

172
00:12:15,621 --> 00:12:18,467
And sound three, "man", you have some visualization on it.

173
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:22,333
And if it was a non-symbolic language, that's all you could get out of those three sounds,

174
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:25,267
but now, in a symbolic language, we could combine those.

175
00:12:25,267 --> 00:12:27,667
We could say "dog eats man".

176
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:31,400
So once again, we just reuse the three sounds, the three symbols,

177
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,400
but now they're referring to a whole new, a much more complex meaning

178
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,667
than just referring to certain objects or certain actions.

179
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:43,600
Or you could have "man eats dog", which is not pleasant, but I guess in a desperate situation...

180
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,600
But once again, it is another meaning that we can get out of the same sounds.

181
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,238
And what these symbolic languages do, besides giving you an infinite number of meanings,

182
00:12:53,238 --> 00:12:57,933
they're allowed to give you more nuance, and really refer to things that are abstract.

183
00:12:57,933 --> 00:13:03,333
And including,and maybe most importantly, things like the present, the future, the past,

184
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:09,133
kind of hypothetical things that really are necessary in order to really communicate,

185
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:12,875
or optimally communicate all of the experiences, or the learnings

186
00:13:12,875 --> 99:59:59,999
from one entity to another.
