1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,090
We were on problem 227 when I got a phone call

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:06,470
It was actually from Jonathan who helps me

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:07,460
with the Khan Academy

4
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,390
so I thought it was worth taking

5
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,540
He works at LinkedIn and he wanted let me know about all

6
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,720
this news that was occurring there

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,380
Anyway, I'm getting distracted

8
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:20,070
Let's go back to the GMAT problems

9
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,980
So problem 227

10
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,160
In the coordinate system above

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,100
which of the following is an equation of line l?

12
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,330
And they didn't put this 2 here and this 3 here

13
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,770
but from the drawing you can assume that

14
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,410
this is the point x is equal to 3

15
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:36,590
and this is the point y is equal to 2

16
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,920
And then frankly, you need that information to figure out

17
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,060
the equation of this line

18
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,640
So, first of all, what's the slope of the line?

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,590
Make sure my tool is right

20
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:51,060
The slope is equal to change in y over change in x

21
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,020
See, when you go from this point to this point

22
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:53,980
what's the change in y?

23
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,670
It's 0 minus 2, which makes sense

24
00:00:58,670 --> 00:00:59,780
because we went down by 2

25
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,150
and the change in x is 3 minus 0

26
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,230
Whenever you do slope, it's important remember

27
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,850
if I'm taking this as the first point on the y side

28
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:09,610
so 0 minus 2

29
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,190
I have to do the same on the bottom, 3 minus 0

30
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,140
Otherwise, we'll get the negative of the slope

31
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,070
Anyway, this is equal to minus 2/3

32
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,470
and what's the y-intercept?

33
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,460
Well, it's pretty obvious

34
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,710
When x is equal to 0, y is equal to 2

35
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,620
So we could say, y of 0 is equal to 2

36
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,800
So the equation of this line

37
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,100
at least the mx plus b form that you learned in school

38
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,440
is y is equal to minus 2/3 of the

39
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,550
slope times x plus the y-intercept

40
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,610
And that's not one of the choices

41
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:42,940
They've written it in a different form

42
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:46,480
They call it the ax plus by equals c form

43
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,580
so let's see if we can get there

44
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,670
Let's get rid of this 3 in the denominator

45
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,170
so let's multiply both sides of this equation by 3

46
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,350
I'll switch colors

47
00:01:53,350 --> 00:02:01,210
You get 3y minus 2x-- no, 3y is equal to--

48
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:05,700
sorry-- minus 2x plus 6, right?

49
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,220
I just multiplied everything by 3

50
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,500
3y is equal to minus 2x plus 6

51
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,540
Now let's add 2x to both sides

52
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:22,320
and you get 2x plus 3y is equal to 6, which is choice B

53
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,650
Next problem

54
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,200
Problem 200

55
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,310
No, what is this?

56
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:33,540
Problem 228

57
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,800
If a two-digit positive integer has its digits reversed

58
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,870
the resulting integer differs from the original by 27

59
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,570
So let's say I had AB

60
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,700
That's a two-digit number

61
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,170
And I'm going to subtract BA from it

62
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,690
and so the difference is 27

63
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,400
Since I'm assuming a positive difference

64
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,790
AB has got to be a bigger number than BA

65
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,030
So at least the way I've written it

66
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,450
what do we know about it?

67
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,160
Well A has to be greater than B, right?

68
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,010
If AB is greater than BA, A has got to be-- well, right

69
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,320
A has got to be greater than B

70
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,240
I was going to say A could be greater than or equal to B

71
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,140
but if A was equal to B

72
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,430
then this thing right here would be 0

73
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,560
So if we assume that AB minus B is a positive 27

74
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,300
then that tells us that A is greater than B

75
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,270
or B is less than A

76
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,940
So if B is less than A

77
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,440
when we're doing the subtraction problem

78
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,350
we're going to have to-- when we do this part

79
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,050
when we do the ones place, if B is less than A

80
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,290
we're going to have to borrow, right?

81
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,790
So if we borrow

82
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:43,540
this A becomes A minus 1 and the B becomes B plus 10

83
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,590
and then we'd be ready to subtract

84
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,040
So what could we say?

85
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:56,820
We could say that B plus 10 minus A is equal to 7

86
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:04,290
which tells us that B minus A is equal to minus 3

87
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,710
And that's essentially what they're asking for

88
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,090
They want to know by how much to do the two digits differ

89
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,620
Well, B minus A is equal to minus 3

90
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,410
that's saying that A minus B is equal to positive 3, right?

91
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,630
You just multiply both sides by negative 1

92
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,830
Or you could say that the absolute value of B minus A

93
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:23,080
or A minus B, or how much they differ is equal to 3, right?

94
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,560
The absolute value of B minus A is plus 3

95
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,270
And just to make sure that this all works out

96
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,470
if we do it with the tens place

97
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:37,360
A minus 1 minus B is equal to 2

98
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,970
Let's add 1 to both sides

99
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:42,830
You get A minus B is equal to 3, so it works out

100
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,540
A and B differ from each other by exactly 3

101
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,110
and that's choice A

102
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:58,510
Problem 229 The circle-- OK, let me see if I can draw this

103
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:02,180
So I have one line, I have another line

104
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,160
and then I have a circle

105
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,000
It starts right there, so it looks something like that

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,120
There's a tangent

107
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,810
It has center c right there

108
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,790
And it says the circle with center c shown above is

109
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,030
tangent to both axes

110
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,660
If the distance from o to c is equal to k--

111
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,070
I'll get a different color

112
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,330
So this is from the origin to c

113
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,240
So they label the origin as o

114
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,600
But if that is equal to k

115
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,050
what is the radius of the circle in terms of k?

116
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,100
Let's think about this

117
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,350
So this is-- this is going to deal with triangles

118
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,470
and how can we use the radius

119
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,620
and relate it to this right here?

120
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,740
Well, the first thing that might come to mind is

121
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,510
if I just drop a line straight down from here

122
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:57,220
that's equal to the radius, right?

123
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,920
That's equal to the radius

124
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,290
because it is a 90-degree angle right here, right?

125
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,190
It touches that line

126
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:06,170
So if we could figure out this distance right here

127
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,610
then we could use the Pythagorean theorem to maybe figure out

128
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,420
what the radius is

129
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,900
And luckily enough, this distance is also the radius

130
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,580
And if that's not obvious to you, think about it

131
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,950
The distance from here to here is exactly the same thing as

132
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,720
the distance from here to there, right?

133
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,940
And from here to here is the radius of the circle

134
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,650
So this is also r

135
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,870
So now we can use the Pythagorean theorem

136
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:32,630
r squared plus r squared is equal to k squared

137
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:36,550
Or 2r squared is equal to k squared

138
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,500
They wanted radius in terms of k, right

139
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:44,630
So you get r squared is equal to k squared over 2

140
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,450
Take the square root of both sides

141
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:50,330
r is equal to k over the square root of 2

142
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,820
Do they want us to rational-- nope

143
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,620
that's one of the choices

144
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,300
Sometimes they want you to get the square

145
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,240
root of 2 in the numerator

146
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,850
At least when I used to take Algebra

147
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,790
they used to harp on that little bit

148
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,100
But anyway, this is choice B

149
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:11,560
Next question, problem 230

150
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,760
In an electric circuit, two resistors with the resistances

151
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,290
x and y are connected in parallel

152
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,980
This is reminding me of the Physics videos

153
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:25,230
So they're connected in parallel

154
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:30,610
And this resistance is x and resistance y

155
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,000
In this case

156
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,370
if r is the combined resistance of these two resistors

157
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,370
then the reciprocal of r is equal to

158
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,100
the sum of the reciprocals of x and y

159
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,080
and that's what they teach you

160
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,490
So if you want to know the combined resistance of this

161
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:46,010
and let's say that's r, they say 1 over the combined

162
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:49,040
resistance is equal to 1/x x plus 1/y

163
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,870
And if you took basic circuits

164
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,560
this is one of the fundamental things

165
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,080
about parallel resistances

166
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:01,090
And then they want to know what is r in terms of x and y?

167
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:04,020
So let's see if we can solve for r

168
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:10,560
So 1/r will be equal to-- let's get a common denominator, xy

169
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,300
1/x x is y/xy

170
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,520
1/y is x/xy, right?

171
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,190
And then we can take the reciprocal of both sides

172
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:25,230
So then r/1, or r, is equal to xy over x plus y

173
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:27,240
I just switched those two around

174
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,980
And that is -- xy over x plus y-- that is choice D

175
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,390
Problem 231

176
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,110
Let me do it in this brown color

177
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,620
231

178
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:47,540
Xavier, Yvonne and Zelda, who happen to go by X, Y and Z

179
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,070
at least in my world

180
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,710
each try independently to solve a problem

181
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,730
If their individual probabilities for success are

182
00:08:54,730 --> 00:09:01,630
1/4, 1/2, and 5/8, respectively

183
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:06,870
what is the probability that Xavier and Yvonne

184
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,860
but not Zelda will solve the problem?

185
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,400
So Xavier and Yvonne, but not Zelda

186
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,010
So that's the case we're looking for

187
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,150
So we're looking for that case

188
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:19,940
So there's a 1/4 probability that Xavier solves it

189
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,960
and then there's a 1/2 probability that Yvonne does

190
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,560
but the probability that both of them do is 1/4 times 1/2

191
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,700
That's the problem that they both solve it

192
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,310
And then we want that case and-- not or--

193
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,810
and Zelda can't solve it

194
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,590
So what's the probability that Zelda doesn't solve it?

195
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,320
5/8 is the probability that she does solve it

196
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,730
so what's 1 minus this?

197
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,840
So there's a 3/8 probability that

198
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,770
Zelda does not solve the problem, right?

199
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,250
And what does this come out to?

200
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,980
This is equal to 3 over-- 4 times 2 is 8

201
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:58,270
8 times 8 is 64, which is choice E

202
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,490
And I'm out of time

203
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,000
I'll see you in the next video. video
