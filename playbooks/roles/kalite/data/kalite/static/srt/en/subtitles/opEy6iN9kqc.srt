1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,780
   

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,240
I think a little bit of a review
is in order now and

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,880
maybe just taking a little bit
of a step back to say well,

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,210
why does a company even
raise equity?

5
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,330
And why do the people who buy
the equity even do it in the

6
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,370
first place?

7
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,950
So the whole idea of what we
were doing in the last several

8
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:23,180
videos is that a company wants
to raise money to start a

9
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,790
website, or build a factory, or
do whatever else-- kind of

10
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,770
invest in the world and in its
kind of productive capacity,

11
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,040
so it can build the
things that the

12
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,380
company is meant to build.

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,665
And in every example so far--
we have the example where me

14
00:00:34,665 --> 00:00:37,300
and my buddies, we have
just a business

15
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,730
plan, that's the asset.

16
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,310
And then we own all
the equity.

17
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,540
We're the board of directors
initially.

18
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,145
So that's all the equity.

19
00:00:46,145 --> 00:00:50,570
So let's call this the
assets right now.

20
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,040
This is the equity.

21
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,700
And we could go to a venture
capitalist-- it could have

22
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,760
been an angel investor.

23
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,340
It could have been-- we
talked about Series A,

24
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,110
Series B, all of that.

25
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:03,820
And we could say OK, we need
to raise x million dollars.

26
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,430
What percentage of your company
do we have to give

27
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,010
away for that?

28
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,520
And it'll say OK, well we'll
value what you have right

29
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,240
now-- I'll do a different number
than what I did in the

30
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,260
past-- we'll value what you have
right now as $1 million.

31
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,870
And so, if you need another $2
million-- so let's say we

32
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,700
value what you have right
now as $1 million.

33
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:28,230
Let's say right now you have
one million shares.

34
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,740
So the company's pre-money
valuation is $1 million.

35
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:34,000
So you are essentially saying
that the company right now is

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,820
worth a dollar per share.

37
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,670
There's $1 million worth of
assets, and there's a million

38
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,530
shares, so a million divided by
a million is $1 per share.

39
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,250
So they're valuing it
at $1 per share.

40
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,890
And essentially they're saying
that we're willing to give

41
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,630
you, or we're willing to buy
more shares from you at $1.

42
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:55,000
So, if we give you-- let me see,
let me do green, I'll do

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,300
a different color, I'll do
purple-- we'll give you-- draw

44
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:05,130
the box-- we'll give you, I
don't know, $2 million.

45
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,130
   

46
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,820
And since we're buying it at
$1 per share, we get two

47
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,070
million shares for that.

48
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,210
   

49
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,010
And now all of this
is the equity.

50
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,270
This is what the founders had,
and this is all the equity.

51
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,330
And so now the company has
what we say was worth a

52
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:28,870
million dollars.

53
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,260
And this is kind of an arbitrary
thing, and we'll

54
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,370
talk more about how you can
actually value these

55
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,230
intangible assets and things.

56
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,410
But now they had that, and now
they have another $2 million.

57
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,770
So the post-money valuation--
pre-money was $1 million--

58
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,180
post-money is now $2 million.

59
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,560
And now, we had one million
shares, now we have three

60
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,970
million shares.

61
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,050
So essentially, for giving
$2 million, these venture

62
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,900
capitalists, or whoever-- so
these shares go to some VC or

63
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,060
angel investor-- they have
now 2/3 of the company.

64
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,580
They have two out of three
million shares, or 66% of the

65
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,400
company for giving
the $2 million.

66
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,850
So that was kind of a private
raise of capital.

67
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,040
And so you've probably heard the
words private company and

68
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,330
public company.

69
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,860
A private company is one whose
shares are not traded on a

70
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,040
public exchange.

71
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,480
So if this company wants to
raise money by selling equity,

72
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,920
the only place it can do it is
to venture capitalists or to

73
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,810
private equity firms. And we'll
talk a little bit more

74
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,250
about kind of the difference.

75
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,450
A venture capitalist really is
a private equity firm because

76
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,590
it's buying private equity.

77
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,760
But private equity tends to
invest in more established

78
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,930
business, when people
just talk about

79
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:28,990
private equity by itself.

80
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,360
But we'll do several
videos on that.

81
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,680
So this is, essentially, this
company is a private company

82
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,480
raising private equity.

83
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,290
Now, the example we did in the
last video is, let's say this

84
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,500
company grows to
a certain size.

85
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,640
Let me just do another company
so it's clean.

86
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,010
Let's say I have another
company, these are its assets.

87
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,920
And this is its-- let
me draw its current

88
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,530
equity base right there.

89
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,060
They should be the same size,
but you get the idea-- and

90
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,390
these assets, it could
be it has some cash.

91
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:05,020
It has some factories or land.

92
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,190
It could have a bunch
of stuff.

93
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,370
It could have some technology,
or we could have some

94
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,460
intellectual property.

95
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,120
Maybe it's a drug company,
or maybe it's

96
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,950
a technology company.

97
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,190
It has a bunch of patents
and stuff.

98
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,310
And then it has some
intangibles-- a brand-- who

99
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,110
knows what it has.

100
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,730
These are the assets
of the firm.

101
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,990
This is the equity
of the firm.

102
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,529
So this company right
now has no debt.

103
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:22,790
And we'll talk about that
in a second, what it

104
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,110
means to have debt.

105
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,040
And this is its current
shareholder base, maybe some

106
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,160
of these are some VCs who
invested in the company when

107
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,900
it was private.

108
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,370
Maybe the founder has
these shares.

109
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,600
But this is the equity
base right here.

110
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,460
And let's say this company wants
to raise a lot of money,

111
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,690
and as just kind of a review of
the last video, it can do

112
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:42,980
an initial public offering.

113
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,850
So right now it's private.

114
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:50,380
All of these shares right now
that are owned by the VCs and

115
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,110
the initial founders of the
company, they are not traded

116
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,020
on a public exchange.

117
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,240
This VC can't go to the NASDAQ
and sell their shares.

118
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,390
They can't go to the broker and
say hey, sell my million

119
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,130
shares I have in Company X.

120
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,040
They have to just sit on them.

121
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,510
Maybe they can find another
private equity investor to buy

122
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,940
their shares, or maybe these
founders-- there's no

123
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,700
liquidity here.

124
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,110
There's no other person they
can sell the shares to.

125
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,440
And also, if this company wants
to raise money right now

126
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,880
it has to kind of go to a VC and
do the whole process where

127
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,770
you negotiate what this
value is-- what the

128
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:21,800
pre-money value is.

129
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,250
And they have to come up with
all these legal documents, and

130
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,280
all of these stipulations
around, we'll give you this

131
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,200
money, but if this happens, then
you have to give us this

132
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,880
interest rate.

133
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,650
And just all these
type of things.

134
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,140
So, what they might want
to say is, we need to

135
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,560
raise a lot of money.

136
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,600
All of these guys want a way
for them to be able to sell

137
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,470
their shares easily
if they need to.

138
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,070
And this company says well, we
need to raise a ton of money.

139
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,130
Let's say we want to
raise $100 million.

140
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,890
And that's hard to raise from
just any one individual

141
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,070
investor, even if they are
a big institution.

142
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,050
So they'll do an initial public
offering, and that

143
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,100
really just means and-- the IPO,
and this is review of the

144
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,050
last one-- is that for the first
time this company is

145
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:04,110
going to register its shares
with the SEC, and because it

146
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,880
does, it's going to list its
shares on an exchange.

147
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,930
It will get a ticker symbol,
it will maybe be company--

148
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,740
this'll be its ticker, T-I-C-K,
or in the last video

149
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,400
could be SOCKS, because it's
going to sell socks.

150
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,620
And then people can trade these
shares on that exchange.

151
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,650
It could be on the NASDAQ
or something.

152
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,500
And I think some of you all have
had experience doing that

153
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,520
where you go on your Charles
Schwab account and you say I'm

154
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,580
going to sell SOCK.

155
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,425
Well, that company that you're
selling, at some point, did an

156
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:35,590
initial public offering, and
registered with the SEC, and

157
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,110
got listed on an exchange.

158
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,590
And the way it really works
is, it's fundamentally the

159
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,760
same as when you raise
money from a VC.

160
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:48,060
But now, instead of raising
money from a VC, all the money

161
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,160
comes from, essentially,
the public.

162
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,670
It goes through these banks
and brokerages, but it's

163
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:57,400
coming from a bunch of
small-- I'm just

164
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,710
divvying it up right here.

165
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,520
It could be coming
from millions

166
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,730
and millions of people.

167
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,740
But the same process
kind of holds.

168
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,190
In order to see what price these
shares are bought at,

169
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,760
someone has to say well, what is
the company worth before it

170
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,330
gets the money?

171
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,370
What is the company worth before
it gets this money?

172
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,740
Kind of a pre-money valuation.

173
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,280
That still has to happen,
and that's what the

174
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,265
investment bank does.

175
00:07:17,265 --> 00:07:19,905
The investment bank will
essentially do a model and

176
00:07:19,905 --> 00:07:22,680
they'll say oh, this is worth--
the company beforehand

177
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,250
was worth $50 million.

178
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,440
They'll kind of go out into the
market to say well, our--

179
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,820
and let's say the company
right now has

180
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,830
five million shares.

181
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,180
So that this piece right
here is five million.

182
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,232
So if the banks value the
company at $50 million, and it

183
00:07:41,232 --> 00:07:43,330
has five million shares, they'll
say OK, right now, the

184
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,070
pre-money valuation
is $10 a share.

185
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,180
And the bank will
go out there.

186
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,990
It'll kind of gauge interest
and say well, does it seem

187
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,070
like the market's willing
to pay $10 a share for a

188
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:53,730
company like this?

189
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:59,010
Or give this company a $50
million pre-money valuation?

190
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,880
And if so, they'll move
forth with the IPO.

191
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,640
And, hopefully, the market
actually wants to

192
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,660
not pay $10 per share.

193
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,720
The market maybe wants
to pay $20 a share.

194
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,540
So all of these guys, let's say
they'll pay $10 a share,

195
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:18,420
so let's say that they sell 10
million shares at $10 a share.

196
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,670
So the company is able to
raise $100 million.

197
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,330
10 times $10, $100 million.

198
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:27,590
Then they can do big ads
and all of that.

199
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,880
And what the bank hopes is by
selling these shares at $10 a

200
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:38,940
share-- so let's say this is
days, and this is price.

201
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,200
Let me change colors-- so what
the investment bank wants to

202
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,050
hope is that, on day one, you
sell it at $10 a share, and

203
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,100
then the price moves up.

204
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,210
That the demand was actually
to sell it for much more.

205
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,080
And there's a bit of a balancing
act, because if they

206
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,980
sell for too little, then the
company won't get as much

207
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,140
money as it deserves.

208
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,580
But if they sell for too much,
then the stock price goes

209
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,310
down, then you kind
of have a stigma

210
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,060
associated with the IPO.

211
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,800
But anyway, this begs the
question of sure, I understand

212
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,090
why the company is
selling shares.

213
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:04,720
It needs money.

214
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,210
It needs to operate.

215
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,850
It needs to build factories
or put out

216
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:08,710
advertising, and all that.

217
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,630
But why are people buying
shares to begin with?

218
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,340
Why do people buy shares
in the stock market?

219
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,420
And frankly, there's
two answers.

220
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,740
And one is kind of the obvious
one, because they think the

221
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,940
shares will go up.

222
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,150
But to some degree, that's
speculation.

223
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,980
If I'm buying a share at $10,
just because I'm hoping that

224
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,100
there's some other dude out
there who, maybe a few weeks

225
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,070
later, is going to pay $15,
I'm just speculating.

226
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,880
I'm just saying oh, IPOs
go up so let me buy it.

227
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,500
But, economically, why
was this even worth

228
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,430
$10 to begin with?

229
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,250
How do we even think about that
valuation, at a very even

230
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,270
high level, why is this
even worth $10 a

231
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,670
share to begin with?

232
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:48,490
And the idea is that these
assets-- assets are nothing

233
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:51,640
but claims on future
benefits, right?

234
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,180
A house is an asset because you
get the future benefit of

235
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,380
getting to live in it, right?

236
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,310
Or the future benefit of
not having to pay rent.

237
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,510
So, the future benefit of these
is, they'll hopefully,

238
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:05,850
at some point in the future,
generate an income stream.

239
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,650
And even more, they'll
generate cash.

240
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,510
And at some point in the future,
and a lot of companies

241
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,010
don't do it right now,
they'll actually

242
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,140
dividend out that cash.

243
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:17,210
So there's a couple of things
that will make this equity

244
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:20,420
have kind of an economic-- it'll
ground it economically.

245
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,650
And it could be these assets
starting to pump out cash, and

246
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:28,030
then each of the shareholders
will get a dividend.

247
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:30,870
A dividend is just cash that is
given to the shareholders.

248
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:34,710
So let's say that this is a
stock certificate in SOCK.

249
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:38,010
So at some point when the assets
of this company start

250
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,380
generating cash, each of the
shareholders might be getting

251
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,590
a dividend.

252
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:45,570
Or maybe a large company, at
some future date, says wow,

253
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,270
this is an awesome technology.

254
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,900
It'll complement what we
already have. And maybe

255
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,850
they'll buy out the company.

256
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,650
Maybe they'll pay $300 million
for this company.

257
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:59,350
And then, essentially, they're
paying $300 million-- and

258
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,880
there's, what, fifteen
million shares?

259
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,390
So they're paying $20 a share.

260
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,820
So those are the economic kind
of grounding points that why

261
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,170
these shares even
have a value.

262
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,940
And I'll go into a lot more
detail, I'll do a whole

263
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,770
playlist on how do you even
think about whether this is

264
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,960
worth $50 million, or is it
worth $5 million, or is it

265
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,940
worth $500 million.

266
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,620
And it's kind of an art, more
than a science, because you're

267
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,730
going to make tons of
assumptions in terms of how

268
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:27,490
fast the company grows, what's
the risk free rate of return

269
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,330
that you could get
on other assets?

270
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,380
Essentially, where else you
could you put your money?

271
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,210
When does the company dividend
out its-- there's so many

272
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,810
assumptions, so it's
more of an art.

273
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,670
So it's really kind of you try
to get a handle on things.

274
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,450
But there's no real
right answer.

275
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,190
The real right answer is kind
of what someone's willing to

276
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,320
pay for it.

277
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,240
But anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.

278
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,500
