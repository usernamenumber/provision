1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
   

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,810
We're told to graph all possible
values for h on the

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:05,590
number line.

4
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:08,510
And this is a especially
interesting inequality because

5
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,060
we also have an absolute
value here.

6
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,150
So the way we're going to do it,
we're going to solve this

7
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,240
inequality in terms of the
absolute value of h, and from

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,370
there we can solve it for h.

9
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,430
So let's just get the absolute
value of h on

10
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:22,890
one side of the equation.

11
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,800
So the easiest way to do this
is to add 19 and 1/2 to both

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,600
sides of this equation.

13
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,159
I often like putting that as an
improper fraction, but 1/2

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,670
is pretty easy to deal with,
so let's add 19 and 1/2 to

15
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,680
both sides of this inequality.

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,470
Did I just say equation?

17
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,150
It's an inequality, not an
equation, it's an inequality

18
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,600
sign, not an equal sign.

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,380
So plus 19 and 1/2.

20
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,210
On the left-hand side, these
guys obviously cancel out,

21
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,290
that was the whole point, and we
are left with the absolute

22
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:56,480
value of h on the left-hand
side is less than.

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,660
And then if we have 19 and 1/2,
essentially minus 12, 19

24
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,709
minus 12 is 7, so it's going
to be 7 and 1/2.

25
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:08,580
   

26
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,260
So now we have that the absolute
value of h is less

27
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,050
than 7 and 1/2.

28
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,030
So what does this tell us?

29
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,470
This means that the distance,
another way to interpret

30
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,960
this-- remember, absolute value
is the same thing as

31
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,340
distance from 0-- so another
way to interpret this

32
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:37,210
statement is that the distance
from h to 0 has to be less

33
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:43,130
than 7 and 1/2.

34
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,200
So what values of h are going
to have less than a distance

35
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,510
from 7 and 1/2?

36
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:51,120
Well, it could be less than 7
and 1/2 and greater than 0, or

37
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,765
equal to 0.

38
00:01:51,765 --> 00:01:53,580
So let me put it this way.

39
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:59,020
So h could be less
than 7 and 1/2.

40
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,950
But if it gets too far negative,
if it goes to

41
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,240
negative 3, we're cool, negative
4, negative 5,

42
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,420
negative 6, negative 7, we're
still cool, but then at

43
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,090
negative 8, all of a sudden the
absolute value isn't going

44
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,180
to be less than this.

45
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:16,770
So it also has to be greater
than negative 7 and 1/2.

46
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,540
If you give me any number in
this interval, its absolute

47
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,320
value is going to be less than 7
and 1/2 because all of these

48
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,650
numbers are less than 7
and 1/2 away from 0.

49
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,550
Let me draw it on the number
line, which they

50
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,820
want us to do anyway.

51
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:37,540
So if this is the number line
right there, that is 0, and we

52
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:42,200
draw some points, let's say
that this is 7, that is 8,

53
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,070
that is negative 7, that
is negative 8.

54
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:51,120
What numbers are less than
7 and 1/2 away from 0?

55
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,170
Well, you have everything all
the way up to-- 7 and 1/2 is

56
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,480
exactly 7 and 1/2 away, so you
can't count that, so 7 and

57
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,220
1/2, you'll put a circle
around it.

58
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,170
Same thing true for negative 7
and 1/2, the absolute value,

59
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,810
it's exactly 7 and 1/2 away.

60
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,940
We have to be less than 7 and
1/2 away, so neither of those

61
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,330
points are going to be included,
positive 7 and 1/2

62
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,060
or negative 7 and 1/2.

63
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,630
Now, everything in between is
less than 7 and 1/2 away from

64
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:19,310
0, so everything else counts.

65
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:22,490
Everything outside of it is
clearly more than 7 and 1/2

66
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,490
away from 0.

67
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,000
And we're done.

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,066
