1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,970
In the last video, we saw that
if we had some curve in the x-y

3
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:07,360
plane, and we just parameterize
it in a very general sense like

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,240
this, we could generate another
parameterization that

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,140
essentially is the same
curve, but goes in the

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:13,920
opposite direction.

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,350
It starts here and it goes
here, as t goes from a to b,

8
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,390
as opposed to the first
parameterization, we started

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,710
with t equals a over here,
and it went up like that.

10
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:29,410
And the question I want to
answer in this video is how a

11
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,600
line integral of a scalar field
over this curve, so this is my

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,360
scalar field, it's a function
of x and y, how a line integral

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,940
over a scalar field over this
curve relates to, that's a line

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,650
integral of that same scalar
field over the reverse curve,

15
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,130
over the curve going in
the other direction.

16
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:52,640
So the question is, does it
even matter whether we move in

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,140
this direction or that
direction when we're taking the

18
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,980
line integral of
a scalar field?

19
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,770
And in the next video, we'll
talk about whether it

20
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,020
matters on a vector field.

21
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,130
And let's see if we can get
a little intuition to our

22
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,750
answer before we even
prove our answer.

23
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,990
So let me draw a
little diagram, here.

24
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,760
Actually, let me do it a little
bit lower, because I think I'm

25
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,180
going to need a little
bit more real estate.

26
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:20,600
So let me draw the y-axis, that
is the x-axis, let me draw

27
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,140
the vertical axis, just
like that, that is z.

28
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,250
Let me draw a scalar
field, here.

29
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,720
So I'll just draw it as some
surface, I'll draw part of it.

30
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:35,910
That is my scalar field, that
is f of xy right there.

31
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,890
For any point on the x-y plane
we can associate a height that

32
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,860
defines this surface,
this scalar field.

33
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,650
And let me put a
curve down there.

34
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:50,830
So let's say that this is the
curve c, just like that.

35
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,152
And the way we define it first,
we start over here and we

36
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,910
move in that direction.

37
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,220
That was our curve c.

38
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,630
And we know from several videos
ago that the way to visualize

39
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,750
what this line integral means,
is we're essentially trying to

40
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,850
figure out the area of a
curtain that has this curve as

41
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:10,000
its base, and its ceiling is
defined by this surface,

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,860
by the scalar field.

43
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,160
So we're literally just trying
to find the area of this curvy

44
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,520
piece of paper, or wall, or
whatever you want to view it.

45
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,440
That's what this thing is.

46
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,840
Now, if we take the same
integral but we take it the

47
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,150
reverse curve, instead of
going in that direction,

48
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,810
we're now going in the
opposite direction.

49
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,950
We're not taking a curve,
we're going from the

50
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,450
top to the bottom.

51
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,290
But the idea is still the same.

52
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,010
You know, I don't know which
one is c, which one is minus c.

53
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:43,400
I could have defined this path
going from that way as c, and

54
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,260
then the minus c path would
have started here,

55
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,520
and gone back up.

56
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,320
So it seems in either case, no
matter what I'm doing, I'm

57
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,170
going to try to figure out the
area of this curved

58
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,220
piece of paper.

59
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,630
So my intuition tells me that
the either these are going to

60
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:01,260
give me the area of this curved
piece of paper, so maybe they

61
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,880
should be equal to each other.

62
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,500
I haven't proved anything very
rigorously yet, but it seems

63
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,960
that they should be equal
to each other, right?

64
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,420
In this case, let's say
I'm taking a, let me

65
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,290
just make it very clear.

66
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,120
I'm taking a ds.

67
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,720
a little change in distance,
let me do it in a

68
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,450
different color.

69
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,440
A little change in distance,
and I'm multiplying it by the

70
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,450
height, to find kind of a
differential of the area.

71
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,050
And I'm going to add a
bunch of these together

72
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,070
to get the whole area.

73
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,300
Here I'm doing the same thing.

74
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,980
I'm taking a little ds, and
remember, the ds is always

75
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,185
going to be positive, the
way we've parameterized it.

76
00:03:34,185 --> 00:03:37,490
   

77
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,650
So here, too, we're taking
a ds, and we're going to

78
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,230
multiply it by the height.

79
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,500
So once again, we
should take the area.

80
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,160
And I want to actually
differentiate that relative to,

81
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:55,030
when you take a normal integral
from a to b of, say, f of x dx,

82
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,760
we know that when we switch the
boundaries of the integration,

83
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,370
that it makes the
integral negative.

84
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,290
That equals the negative
of the integral from

85
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,570
b to a of f of x dx.

86
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:11,350
And the reason why this is the
case, is if you imagine this is

87
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,230
a, this is b, that
is my f of x.

88
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,210
When you do it this way,
your dx's are always

89
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,280
going to be positive.

90
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,540
When you go in that direction,
your dx's are always going

91
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,540
to be positive, right?

92
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,110
Each increment, the right
boundary is going to be higher

93
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,840
than the left boundary.

94
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,520
So your dx's are positive.

95
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,690
In this situation, your
dx's are negative.

96
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,450
The heights are always going to
be the same, they're always

97
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,010
going to be f of x, but here
your change in x is a

98
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,950
negative change in x,
when you go from b to a.

99
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,660
And that's why you get
a negative integral.

100
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,250
In either case here, our path
changes, but our ds's are

101
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,480
going to be positive.

102
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,310
And the way I've drawn this
surface, it's above the x-y

103
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,670
plane, the f of xy is also
going to be positive.

104
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,180
So that also kind of gives the
same intuition that this should

105
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,920
be the exact same area.

106
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,620
But let's prove
it to ourselves.

107
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:04,770
So let's start off with our
first parameterization, just

108
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,740
like we did in the last video.

109
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:12,920
We have x is equal to x of t, y
is equal to y of t, and we're

110
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,840
dealing with this from,
t goes from a to b.

111
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,615
And we know we're going to need
the derivatives of these, so

112
00:05:19,615 --> 00:05:22,970
let write that down right now.

113
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:32,240
We can write dx dt is equal to
x prime of t, and dy dt, let me

114
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:41,550
write that a little bit neater,
dy dt is equal to y prime of t.

115
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,590
This is nothing groundbreaking
I've done so far.

116
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:53,140
But we know the integral
over c of f of xy.

117
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,250
f is a scalar field,
not a vector field.

118
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:02,720
ds is equal to the integral
from t is equal to a, to t is

119
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:13,930
equal to b of f of x of t y of
t times the square root of dx

120
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:20,500
dt squared, which is the same
thing as x prime of t squared,

121
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,240
plus dy dt squared, the same
thing as y prime of t squared.

122
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,740
   

123
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,170
All that under the
radical, times dt.

124
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:34,220
This integral is exactly that,
given this parameterization.

125
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,480
   

126
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,060
Now let's do the
minus c version.

127
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,810
I'll do that in
this orange color.

128
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,850
   

129
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,250
Actually, let me do the
minus c version down here.

130
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:53,250
The minus the c version, we
have x is equal to, you

131
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,140
remember this, actually,
just from up here, this

132
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,085
was from the last video.

133
00:06:56,085 --> 00:07:10,800
   

134
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,990
x is equal to x of
a plus b minus t.

135
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:19,280
   

136
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,440
y is equal to y of
a plus b minus t.

137
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:34,430
And then t goes from a to b, t
goes from a to b, and this is

138
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,610
just exactly what we did in
that last video. x is equal to

139
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,650
x of a plus b minus t, y is
equal to y of a plus b minus t,

140
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:44,310
same curve, just going in a
different direction as

141
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,250
t increases a to b.

142
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,320
But let's get the derivative.

143
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,860
I'll do it in the
derivative color, maybe.

144
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,640
So dx dt.

145
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,970
For this path, it's going
to be a little different.

146
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,810
We have to do the
chain rule now.

147
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,750
Derivative of the inside
with respect to t.

148
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,690
Well, these are constants.

149
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,800
Derivative of minus t with
respect to t is minus 1.

150
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,830
So it's minus 1 times the
derivative of the outside

151
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,180
with respect to the inside.

152
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:16,010
Well, that's just x prime
of a plus b minus t.

153
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,840
Or, we could rewrite this as,
this is just minus x prime

154
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,160
of a plus b minus t.

155
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,230
dy dt, same logic.

156
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,500
Derivative of the
inside is minus 1 with

157
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,980
respect to t, right?

158
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,530
Derivative minus t
is just minus 1.

159
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,560
Times the derivative
of the outside with

160
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,540
respect to the inside.

161
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:43,060
So y prime of a plus b minus
t, same thing as minus y

162
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:49,130
prime a plus b minus t.

163
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:55,730
So given all of that, what is
this integral going to be equal

164
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:03,330
to, the integral of minus c of
the scalar field f of xy ds?

165
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,910
What is this going
to be equal to?

166
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,580
Well, it's going to be the
integral from, you could almost

167
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,880
pattern match it. t is equal
to a to t is equal

168
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,010
to be of f of x.

169
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:17,605
But now x is no longer
x of t. x now equals x

170
00:09:17,605 --> 00:09:19,050
of a plus b minus t.

171
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,940
   

172
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,950
It's a little bit hairy,
but I don't think anything

173
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,710
here is groundbreaking.

174
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,190
Hopefully it's not
too confusing.

175
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:29,770
And once again, y is no
longer y of t. y is y

176
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,260
of a plus b minus t.

177
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:36,090
   

178
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:39,320
And then times a square root,
I'll just switch colors,

179
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,290
times the square root
of dx dt squared.

180
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,830
What is dx dt squared?

181
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:49,700
dx dt squared is just
this thing squared, or

182
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,040
this thing squared.

183
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,800
This thing, if I have minus
anything squared, that's the

184
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,530
same thing as anything
squared, right?

185
00:09:55,530 --> 00:10:03,280
This is equal to minus x prime
of a plus b minus t squared,

186
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:07,690
which is the same thing is
just x prime of a plus b

187
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,140
minus t squared, right?

188
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,640
You lose that minus information
when you square it.

189
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:17,340
So that's going to be equal to
x prime of a plus b minus t

190
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:21,960
squared, the whole result
function squared,

191
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,130
plus dy dt squared.

192
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,870
By the same logic, that's going
to be, you lose the negative

193
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,030
when you square it.

194
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:33,472
y prime of a plus b
minus t squared.

195
00:10:33,472 --> 00:10:35,360
Let me extend the radical.

196
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,550
And then all of that dt.

197
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:48,980
So that's the line integral
over the curve c, this is

198
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,040
the line integral over
the curve minus c.

199
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,600
They don't look equal just yet.

200
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,070
This looks a lot more
convoluted than that one does.

201
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,140
So let's see if we can
simplify it little bit.

202
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,380
And we can simplify it,
perhaps, by making

203
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,040
a substitution.

204
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,390
Let's let, let me get a nice
substitution color, let's let

205
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:10,560
u equal to a plus b minus t.

206
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,360
So first we're going to have to
figure out the boundaries of

207
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,760
our integral, well actually,
let's just figure

208
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,520
out, what's du?

209
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:19,910
so du dt, the derivative of u
with respect to t is just going

210
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:24,200
to be equal to minus 1, or we
could say that du, if we

211
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,330
multiply both sides by the
differential dt, is

212
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,690
equal to minus dt.

213
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,460
And let's figure out our
boundaries of integration.

214
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:37,280
When t is equal to a,
what is u equal to?

215
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:42,860
u is equal to a plus b minus
a, which is equal to b.

216
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:49,110
And then when t is equal to b,
u is equal to a plus b minus

217
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:52,190
b, which is equal to a.

218
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:55,360
So if we do the substitution on
this crazy, hairy-looking

219
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,270
interval, let's simplify a
little bit, and it changes

220
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:02,190
our-- so this integral is going
to be the same thing as the

221
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:06,940
integral from u, when
t is a, u is b.

222
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:10,500
When t is b, u is a.

223
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:16,000
And f of, x of, this thing
right here is just u.

224
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,360
x of u.

225
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,000
So it simplified it a good bit.

226
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,730
And y of, this thing
right here, is just u.

227
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,830
y of u.

228
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:30,020
Times the square root-- let
me do it in the same color.

229
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:40,160
Times the square root of x
prime of u squared plus

230
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,010
y prime of u squared.

231
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:45,200
   

232
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,210
Instead of a dt, we have to
write a, or could write, if we

233
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,490
multiply both sides of this by
minus, we have dt is

234
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,900
equal to minus du.

235
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,100
So instead of a dt, we have
to put a minus du here.

236
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:03,330
So this is times minus du, or,
just so we don't think this is

237
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:07,140
a subtraction, let's just put
that negative sign out here in

238
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,300
the front, just like that.

239
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,110
So we're going from b to a of
this thing, right, like that.

240
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:17,370
And just to make the boundaries
of integration make a little

241
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,430
bit more sense, because we know
that a is less than

242
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,000
b, let's swap them.

243
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,110
And I said at the beginning
of this video, for just a

244
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:28,010
standard, regular, run of the
mill integral, if you swap, if

245
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:34,216
you have something going from b
to a of f of x dx, or du, maybe

246
00:13:34,216 --> 00:13:35,610
I should write it this way.

247
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,440
f of u du.

248
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,290
This is equal to the minus
of the integral from

249
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:46,410
a to b of f of u du.

250
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,220
And we did that by the logic
that I had graphed up here.

251
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:53,030
That here, when you switch the
order, your du's will become

252
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:55,830
the negatives of each other,
when you actually visualize it,

253
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,880
when you're actually finding
the area under the curve.

254
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,670
So let's do that.

255
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,995
Let's swap the boundaries
of integration right here.

256
00:14:00,995 --> 00:14:03,310
And if we do that, that
will negate this negative,

257
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,180
or make it a positive.

258
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,920
So this is going to be equal
to the integral from a to b.

259
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,800
I'm dropping the negative
sign, because I swapped

260
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,410
these two things.

261
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:11,800
So I'm going to take the
negative of a negative,

262
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,980
which is a positive.

263
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:28,070
Of f of x of u y of u times the
square root of x prime of u

264
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:37,770
squared plus y prime
of u squared du.

265
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:40,230
Now remember, everything we
just did was a substitution.

266
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:44,130
This was all equal to, just to
remember what we're doing, this

267
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:47,550
was the integral of the minus
curve of our scalar

268
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:50,430
field, f of xy ds.

269
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:54,020
Now how does this compare to
when we take the regular curve?

270
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,180
How does this compare to that?

271
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,150
Let me copy and
paste it to see.

272
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,560
You know, I'm using
the wrong tool.

273
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,490
Let me copy and paste it
to see how they compare.

274
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:08,820
Copy, then let me pick to
down here, edit, paste.

275
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,620
So how do these two
things compare?

276
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,340
Let's take a close look.

277
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,550
Well, they actually look
pretty similar, right?

278
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:21,470
Over here, for the minus curve,
we have a bunch of u's.

279
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,630
Over here, for the positive
curve, we have a bunch

280
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,130
of t's, but they're in
the exact same places.

281
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:28,610
These integrals are the
exact same integrals.

282
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,510
If you make a u-substitution
here, if you just make the

283
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:34,300
substitution u is equal to t,
this thing is going to be

284
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,610
integral from a to b of,
it's going to be the

285
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:38,490
exact same thing.

286
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:48,530
Of f of x of u, y of u times
the square root of of x

287
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:55,750
prime of u squared plus
y prime of u squared du.

288
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,930
These two things are identical.

289
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,120
So we did all the substitution,
everything, but we got

290
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,250
the exact same integrals.

291
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,660
So hopefully that satisfies you
that it doesn't matter what

292
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,630
direction we go on the curve,
as long as the shape of

293
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,500
the curve is the same.

294
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,580
Doesn't matter if we go forward
or backward on the curve, we're

295
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,950
going to get the same answer.

296
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,510
And I think that meets our
intuition, because in either

297
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:21,650
case, we're finding the
area of this curtain.

298
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:21,800
