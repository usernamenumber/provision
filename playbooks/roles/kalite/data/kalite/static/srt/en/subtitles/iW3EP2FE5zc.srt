1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:03,220
We're on problem 63.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,690
Carlotta can drive from her home to her office

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,230
by one of two possible routes.

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,610
If she must also return by one of these routes,

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,480
what is the distance of the shorter route?

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,530
So essentially she has a long route to go to her office,

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,620
that's her home, that's her office.

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,790
And then she has a short route, with fewer curves,

9
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:28,870
that's my guess.

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,850
And she can go and come back by one of two--

11
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,750
Statement number one:

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,650
when she drives from her home to her office

13
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,350
by the shorter route and returns by the longer route,

14
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,910
she drives a total of 42 kilometers.

15
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,820
So when she goes this, way shorter route this way and

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,690
then longer route back, it's 42 kilometers.

17
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:55,470
So shorter plus longer is equal to 42.

18
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,340
And that by itself doesn't let me know

19
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,220
what the distance of the shorter route is.

20
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,440
Statement number two:

21
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,500
when she drives both ways from her home to her office and

22
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,620
back by the longer route,she drives a total of 46 kilometers.

23
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,580
So if she goes by the longer route

24
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:13,970
and then by the longer route again,

25
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:19,210
so 2 times a longer route is equal to 46 kilometers.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,120
Well, this by itself helps me figure out

27
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,990
what the longer route is,

28
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,860
but they want to know the distance of the shorter route.

29
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,330
So this,

30
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,280
I could just eyeball this, the longer route is 23 kilometers.

31
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,230
But if you want to know the distance of the shorter route

32
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,220
you would need this information as well.

33
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,130
The shorter route plus 23 is equal to 42.

34
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,670
So the shorter route is 19 kilometers.

35
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:42,270
So you need both of the statements.

36
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,690
Both statements are sufficient,

37
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,540
but one by themselves are not enough to figure out

38
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,610
what the shorter route is.

39
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,400
If they ask for the longer route,

40
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,090
just statement two could have been good enough.

41
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,660
Next question. 64.

42
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,370
Is x greater than y?

43
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,900
My computer's updating something.

44
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:08,690
It's a little bit-- Is x greater than y?

45
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:16,060
Statement number one tells us that x is equal to y plus 2.

46
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,860
Well, let me think about that.

47
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,960
No matter what y is, x is going to be 2 more.

48
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,020
Even if y is a negative million,

49
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,730
x is still going to be a bigger number.

50
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,630
It's going to be 2 more than negative a million.

51
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,630
If it's y is negative 10, this will be negative 8.

52
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,350
No matter what x will be greater than y.

53
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,850
So statement one is sufficient.

54
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:49,930
Statement number two: x/2 is equal to y minus 1.

55
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,580
This doesn't look as clear there.

56
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,920
So x is equal to 2y minus 2.

57
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,320
So we just have to come up with a condition,

58
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,750
one y where y is less than x

59
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,490
and another y where y is greater than x

60
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,160
and then we would have proven our point.

61
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,230
So let's think about it.

62
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,250
When y is 0-- this is using statement number two--

63
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,670
when y is 0, what's x?

64
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,590
x is minus 2.

65
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,390
So that's a statement where y is greater than x.

66
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:24,730
And then when y is equal to 10, what's x?

67
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,150
x is 18.

68
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,660
So this is a statement where y is less than x.

69
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,980
So statement number two actually tells us nothing

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,970
about whether x is greater than y or y is greater than x.

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,560
So statement number two is useless.

72
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,330
Statement number one, alone, is sufficient.

73
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,080
Next problem.

74
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,220
65.

75
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,370
If m is an integer is m odd?

76
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:08,400
Statement number one: m divided by 2 not--

77
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,690
they write it real big and bold-- not even integer.

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,610
Well, that doesn't tell me much.

79
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,320
I mean that doesn't tell me that this is odd.

80
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:21,730
In fact,

81
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,820
it's not an even integer but if this was an odd integer

82
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,570
then that means that m is an even integer, right?

83
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:32,190
Anything that's divisible by 2 and results in an integer--

84
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,490
right, that's essentially saying that it's divisible by 2--

85
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,290
by definition is going to be even.

86
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:41,880
So for example, what if m divided by 2 is equal to 3, right?

87
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,020
3 is not an even integer but still m would equal 6.

88
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,180
And then m would be even.

89
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,990
And I mean they're not telling us much here.

90
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:57,300
m divided by 2 could be equal to 2.5 in which case m would

91
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,050
be equal to 5 so that would be an odd integer.

92
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,180
So this by itself doesn't give me much information.

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,020
Statement number two: m minus 3 is an even integer.

94
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,740
Well, this is useful, right?

95
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:20,050
If you subtract an odd number from a number

96
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,570
and you get an even number, this number is going to be even.

97
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,740
And let's think about that.

98
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,210
If I have an even number--

99
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,620
let me just write a bunch of numbers

100
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,480
Let me write x, y, and z.

101
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,760
And let's say they're consecutive, right?

102
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,910
Actually let me write it even better.

103
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:45,200
Let's say that x is even-- let's say x is odd.

104
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,760
Then x plus 1 is going to be what?

105
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,180
It's going to be even, right?

106
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:50,950
The next number will be even.

107
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:54,490
Then x plus 2 is going to be odd.

108
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:01,880
And then x plus 3 is going to be even.

109
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,810
And then if you go the other way--

110
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,440
actually I should have gone to the way first--

111
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,350
x minus 1 would be even.

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,290
x minus 2 would be odd.

113
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,520
And x minus 3 would be even, right?

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,140
If you have an odd number and you subtract out an odd number

115
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,400
and you get an even number

116
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,790
then this number is going to be odd

117
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:28,250
So this statement two by itself is actually sufficient.

118
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,160
And play around with some numbers

119
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,430
if that intuition doesn't make sense.

120
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:35,290
Statement two, by itself, is sufficient to solve this problem

121
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,800
and you don't need statement one at all.

122
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,750
Next problem.

123
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,630
66.

124
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,340
what is the area of the triangular region ABC above?

125
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,890
Well, they've drawn us a little triangle

126
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,960
so I will draw us a triangle.

127
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:59,580
base and then,it looks pretty symmetric

128
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,010
I'll try to draw it the way they drew it.

129
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:08,200
One end, that's the other end, and then this is the altitude.

130
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:09,880
Good enough.

131
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:21,820
And then they label it A, B, C, D.

132
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,340
This is a right angle.

133
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,240
This is x degrees.

134
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,440
Alright, what is the area of the triangular region?

135
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,670
So area of a triangle is base times height times 1/2.

136
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,940
So if we can do that then we're all done.

137
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,340
One: the product of BD and AC is 20.

138
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:51,850
So BD times AC-- oh no, sorry, BD times AC, oh that's it.

139
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,410
So BD is the height.

140
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,200
So area, let me just write it, area is equal to 1/2 times

141
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:05,570
this altitude, BD, times the base, times AC, right?

142
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:10,400
Statement number one, they tell us what BD times AC is.

143
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,370
They tell us that BD times AC is equal to 20.

144
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,790
So that immediately follows,

145
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,610
if this thing is equal to 20 then the area is equal to 10.

146
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:21,820
And you didn't even have to figure that out.

147
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,990
So statement number one, by itself, is sufficient.

148
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:31,750
Statement number two: x is equal to 45 degrees.

149
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,170
This one's a little bit more interesting.

150
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,060
x is equal to 45 degrees.

151
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,870
Well, I mean we could do a little angle game, we could say,

152
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:44,420
OK, this is a 90 degree angle and we could say if this is 90,

153
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,000
this is 45, and this is going to be 45--

154
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,000
actually that's about where we could stop.

155
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,470
And this tells us no information about what any of the sides

156
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,850
are so you could imagine if this is 45 degrees,

157
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,070
but this could be a million mile high triangle

158
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,140
or it could be a nanometer high triangle.

159
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,550
We don't know. It could be of any size.

160
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,380
You could scale it up or down.

161
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,800
This just tells us the degree and the angle information.

162
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,530
So two, by itself, is useless.

163
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:11,260
So for this one, statement one, alone,

164
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,750
is sufficient to answer this problem, A.

165
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,760
Next problem.

166
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,700
67.

167
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,780
What is the value of b plus c?

168
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,830
Alright, number one: they tell us that

169
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:45,240
ab plus cd plus ac plus bd is equal to 6.

170
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,220
And this by itself doesn't help us much

171
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,240
because there's all these a's and d's here

172
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,340
and they could be anything.

173
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,700
So we can't solve for b plus c.

174
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,000
But I'm already suspecting that we could factor out

175
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,910
the a's and d's somewhere.

176
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,610
So we can factor out the b's plus c's,

177
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,020
then we might be able to figure out the numbers

178
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,310
if we're given more information about a and d.

179
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,010
Statement two, and they give us more information

180
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:10,530
about a and d. a plus d is equal to 4.

181
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,990
So let me see if I can simplify this top one.

182
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,100
Let me see if I can factor out a bunch of b plus c's.

183
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,900
So if we think about it, let me think.

184
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:23,340
So if you take this term and that term

185
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,010
and you factor out the a you get a--

186
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,760
let me do it in a different color--

187
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,740
so this term and that term is equal to a times what?

188
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,190
b plus c, right?

189
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,420
You can multiply that out and you get ab plus ac.

190
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:44,490
And then plus, and let's do the same thing with this term, d.

191
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:49,330
That's d times c plus b.

192
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:52,300
But we can switch the order, b plus c--

193
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,060
and if you don't believe me that this equals this,

194
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:55,670
multiply it out.

195
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:59,170
All I did is I grouped the ab and the ac terms

196
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,480
and then factored out the a

197
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,710
and then I grouped the cd and the bd terms

198
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,750
and factored out the d.

199
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:10,130
And then now we can factor out a b plus c.

200
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:13,370
We can do the reverse distributive property again.

201
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:21,930
So now this equals a plus d times b plus c, right?

202
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,810
And if you don't believe me, just multiply b plus c times a

203
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:28,120
and then b plus c times d and you get that, right?

204
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,360
That's just the distributive property.

205
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,250
But now we're ready to solve

206
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,430
because they told us that this thing's equal to 6

207
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,450
and they tell us that this thing is equal to 4.

208
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:44,000
So b plus c is going to be equal to 6/4 or 1 and 1/2.

209
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,020
And we're done.

210
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,720
You need both statements together.

211
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,870
Both statements, together, are sufficient

212
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,440
to solve this problem.
