1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,640
   

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,750
Find the probability of rolling
even numbers three

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,740
times using a six-sided die
numbered from 1 to 6.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,860
So let's just figure out the
probability of rolling it each

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:11,490
of the times.

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,020
So the probability of rolling
even numbers.

7
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:22,690
So even roll on six-sided die.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,310
So let's think about
that probability.

9
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,360
Well, how many total
outcomes are there?

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,180
How many possible rolls
could we get?

11
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,119
Well, you get one, two, three,
four, five, six.

12
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,890
And how many of them satisfy
these conditions, that it's an

13
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,420
even number?

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,990
Well, it could be a 2,
it could be a 4, or

15
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,440
it could be a 6.

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,160
So the probability is the events
that match what you

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,830
need, your condition for right
here, so three of the possible

18
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,680
events are an even roll.

19
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,310
And it's out of a total of
six possible events.

20
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,700
So there is a-- 3 over 6 is
the same thing as 1/2

21
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,070
probability of rolling
even on each roll.

22
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,770
Now they're going to
roll-- they want to

23
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,860
roll even three times.

24
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,770
And these are all going to
be independent events.

25
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,260
Every time you roll, it's not
going to affect what happens

26
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,380
in the next roll, despite what
some gamblers might think.

27
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,730
It has no impact on what happens
on the next roll.

28
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:30,160
So the probability of rolling
even three times is equal to

29
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:38,670
the probability of an even roll
one time, or even roll on

30
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:44,410
six-sided die-- this thing over
here is equal to that

31
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:49,210
thing times that thing again.

32
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:53,510
All right, that's our first
roll-- we copy and we paste

33
00:01:53,510 --> 00:02:01,090
it-- times that thing and then
times that thing again.

34
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:01,410
Right?

35
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,560
That's our first roll,
which is that.

36
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,470
That's our second roll.

37
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,210
That's our third roll.

38
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,540
They're independent events.

39
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,150
So this is going to be equal to
1/2-- that's the same 1/2

40
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:14,560
right there-- times 1/2
times 1/2, which is

41
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,240
equal to 1 over 8.

42
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:23,080
There's a 1 in 8 possibility
that you roll even numbers on

43
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,620
all three rolls.

44
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,420
On this roll, this roll,
and that roll.
