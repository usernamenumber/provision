00:00:00,733 --> 00:00:09,984
Solve for C and graph the solution. We have have -5C is less than or equal to 15. So -5C is less

2
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:14,902
than or equal to 15. I just rewrote it a little bit bigger. So if we want to solve for C, we just want

3
00:00:14,902 --> 00:00:21,520
to isolate this C right over here, maybe on the left -hand side. Its right now being multiplied by -5

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:27,423
So the best way to just have a C on the left-hand side is we can multiply both sides of this inequality

5
00:00:27,423 --> 00:00:35,267
by the inverse of -5 or by -(1/5). So we want to multiply -(1/5)

6
00:00:35,267 --> 00:00:42,200
times -5C and we also want to multiply 15 times - (1/5). I'm just multiplying both

7
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:48,431
sides of the inequality by the inverse of -5, because this will cancel out with -5 and will leave

8
00:00:48,431 --> 00:00:54,067
me just with C. Now I didn't draw the inequality here, because we have to remember if we multiply or

9
00:00:54,067 --> 00:01:02,000
divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, you have to flip the inequality and we are doing

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,133
that. We are multiplying both sides by -(1/5), which is the equivalent of dividing both sides

11
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:14,533
by -5. So we need to turn this from a less than or equal to a greater than or equal. And now we can proceed

12
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:21,200
solving for C. So -(1/5) times -5 is 1, so the left-hand side is just going to be

13
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,748
C is greater than or equal to 15 times -(1/5). That's the same thing as 15 divided

14
00:01:27,748 --> 00:01:35,067
by -5. And so that is -3. So our solution is C is greater than or equal to -3

15
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:47,867
and let's graph it. So that is my number line. Let's say that is 0, -1, -2, -3 and that can go above

16
00:01:47,867 --> 00:01:54,972
1 too. And so C is greater than or equal to -3, so it can be equal to -3, so I'll fill that in right

17
00:01:54,972 --> 00:01:59,446
over there. Let me do it in a different color. So I'll fill it in right over there and then its greater

18
00:01:59,446 --> 00:02:07,849
than as well. So its all of these values I am filling in in green. And you can verify that it works in

19
00:02:07,849 --> 00:02:14,333
the original inequality. Pick something that should work. Well 0 should work. 0 is one of the numbers

20
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:22,501
that we filled in. -5 times 0 is 0, which is less than or equal to 15, its less than 15. Now let's try

21
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:26,677
a number that's outside of it. And I haven't drawn it here, I could continue with the number line in

22
00:02:26,677 --> 00:02:32,267
this direction. You would have a -4 here. -4 should not be included and let's verify that -4 doesn't

23
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:43,600
work. -4 times -5 is +20 and +20 is not less than 15 so its good that we did not include -4.

24
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:50,962
So this is our solution and this is that solution graphed. And I wanted to do that in the other green color.

25
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:54,529
Here you go, that's what it looks like.
