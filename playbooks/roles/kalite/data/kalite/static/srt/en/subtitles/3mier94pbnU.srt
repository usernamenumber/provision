1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,750
   

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,650
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,850
In the last video, I showed you
or hopefully, I did show

4
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,230
you that if I apply a force
of F to a stationary, an

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,990
initially stationary object with
mass m, and I apply that

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:20,920
force for distance d, that that
force times distance, the

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,460
force times the distance that
I'm pushing the object is

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:30,980
equal to 1/2 mv squared, where
m is the mass of the object,

9
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,430
and v is the velocity of the
object after pushing it for a

10
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,690
distance of d.

11
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,505
And we defined in that
last video, we just

12
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:38,810
said this is work.

13
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,830
Force times distance by
definition, is work.

14
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:47,340
And 1/2 mv squared, I said this
is called kinetic energy.

15
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,680
   

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,110
And so, by definition, kinetic
energy is the amount of work--

17
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,870
and I mean this is the
definition right here.

18
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,725
It's the amount of work you need
to put into an object or

19
00:01:00,725 --> 00:01:03,820
apply to an object to
get it from rest

20
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,550
to its current velocity.

21
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,100
So its velocity over here.

22
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,740
So let's just say I looked at an
object here with mass m and

23
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,250
it was moving with
the velocity v.

24
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,960
I would say well, this
has a kinetic

25
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,660
energy of 1/2 mv squared.

26
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,365
And if the numbers are confusing
you, let's say the

27
00:01:21,365 --> 00:01:22,760
mass was-- I don't know.

28
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,640
Let's say this was a 5 kilogram
object and it's

29
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,330
moving at 7 meters per second.

30
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:33,325
So I would say the kinetic
energy of this object is going

31
00:01:33,325 --> 00:01:40,190
to be 5-- 1/2 times the mass
times 5 times 7 squared, times

32
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:40,850
velocity squared.

33
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,890
It's times 49.

34
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:43,220
So let's see.

35
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,270
1/2 times 49, that's
a little under 25.

36
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:53,170
So it'll be approximately 125
Newton meters, which is

37
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,500
approximately-- and Newton
meter is just

38
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,220
a joule-- 125 joules.

39
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,420
So this is if we actually
put numbers in.

40
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,770
And so when we immediately know
this, even if we didn't

41
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,770
know what happened, how did this
object get to this speed?

42
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,560
Let's say we didn't know that
someone else had applied a

43
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,090
force of m for a distance of
d to this object, just by

44
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,710
calculating its kinetic energy
as 125 joules, we immediately

45
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,120
know that that's the amount of
work that was necessary.

46
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,500
And we don't know if this is
exactly how this object got to

47
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,920
this velocity, but we know that
that is the amount of

48
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,530
work that was necessary to
accelerate the object to this

49
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,620
velocity of 7 meters
per second.

50
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,330
So let's give another example.

51
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,420
And instead of this time just
pushing something in a

52
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,640
horizontal direction and
accelerating it, I'm going to

53
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,940
show you an example we're going
to push something up,

54
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,550
but its velocity really
isn't going to change.

55
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,430
   

56
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,280
Invert.

57
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,140
Let's say I have a different
situation, and we're on this

58
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,990
planet, we're not
in deep space.

59
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:01,090
And I have a mass of m and
I were to apply a force.

60
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:06,470
So let's say the force that I
apply is equal to mass times

61
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,930
the acceleration of gravity.

62
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,460
Mass times-- let's just call
that gravity, right?

63
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,140
9.8 meters per second squared.

64
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,740
And I were to apply this force
for a distance of d upwards.

65
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,500
Right?

66
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,810
Or instead of d, let's say h.

67
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,050
H for height.

68
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:27,030
So in this case, the force times
the distance is equal

69
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:31,490
to-- well the force is mass
times the acceleration of

70
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,240
gravity, right?

71
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,880
And remember, I'm pushing with
the acceleration of gravity

72
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,410
upwards, while the acceleration
of gravity is

73
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,100
pulling downwards.

74
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,045
So the force is mass times
gravity, and I'm applying that

75
00:03:45,045 --> 00:03:47,390
for a distance of h, right?

76
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,050
d is h.

77
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,810
So the force is this.

78
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,580
This is the force.

79
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,730
And then the distance I'm
applying is going to be h.

80
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,900
And what's interesting is-- I
mean if you want to think of

81
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,910
an exact situation, imagine an
elevator that is already

82
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,140
moving because you would
actually have to apply a force

83
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,330
slightly larger than the
acceleration of gravity just

84
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,270
to get the object moving.

85
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,280
But let's say that
the object is

86
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,860
already at constant velocity.

87
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,500
Let's say it's an elevator.

88
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,950
And it is just going up with
a constant velocity.

89
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,520
And let's say the mass of the
elevator is-- I don't know--

90
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,230
10 kilograms. And it moves up
with a constant velocity.

91
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:32,270
   

92
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,380
It moves up 100 meters.

93
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,280
So we know that the work done
by whatever was pulling on

94
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,370
this elevator, it probably was
the tension in this wire that

95
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,750
was pulling up on the elevator,
but we know that the

96
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,210
work done is the force necessary
to pull up on it.

97
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,330
Well that's just going to
be the force of gravity.

98
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,780
So we're assuming that
the elevator's not

99
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,040
accelerating, right?

100
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,690
Because if the elevator was
accelerating upwards, then the

101
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,690
force applied to it
would be more than

102
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,080
the force of gravity.

103
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,840
And if the elevator was
accelerating downwards, or if

104
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,250
it was slowing down upwards,
then the force being applied

105
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,850
would be less than the
acceleration of gravity.

106
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:10,360
But since the elevator is at a
constant velocity moving up,

107
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,760
we know that the force pulling
upwards is completely equal to

108
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,330
the force pulling downwards,
right?

109
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,250
No net force.

110
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,520
Because gravity and this force
are at the same level, so

111
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,050
there's no change in velocity.

112
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,020
I think I said that two times.

113
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,840
So we know that this upward
force is equal to

114
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,720
the force of gravity.

115
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,045
At least in magnitude in
the opposite direction.

116
00:05:31,045 --> 00:05:35,310
So this is mg.

117
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,500
So what's m? m is 10 kilograms.
Times the

118
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,320
acceleration of gravity.

119
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,900
Let's say that's 9.8 meters
per second squared.

120
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,750
I'm not writing the units here,
but we're all assuming

121
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,490
kilograms and meters
per second squared.

122
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:50,760
And we're moving that for a
distance of 100 meters.

123
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,490
So how much work was put into
this elevator, or into this

124
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,980
object-- it doesn't have to be
an elevator-- by whatever

125
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,210
force that was essentially
pushing up on it or

126
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,770
pulling up on it?

127
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:02,410
And so, let's see.

128
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:05,160
This would be 98 times 100.

129
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:13,820
So it's 9,800 Newton meters
or 9,800 joules.

130
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,270
After we've moved up 100 meters,
notice there's no

131
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,760
change in velocity.

132
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,220
So the question is, where
did all that work get

133
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,140
put into the object?

134
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,780
And the answer here is, is that
the work got transferred

135
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,940
to something called
potential energy.

136
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,150
And potential energy is
defined as-- well,

137
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,780
gravitational potential
energy.

138
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,150
We'll work with other types of
potential energy later with

139
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,810
springs and things.

140
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,580
Potential energy is defined
as mass times the force of

141
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,760
gravity times the height
that the object is at.

142
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,840
And why is this called
potential energy?

143
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,430
Because at this point, the
energy-- work had to be put

144
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,920
into the object to get it
to this-- in the case of

145
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,670
gravitational potential energy,
work had to be put

146
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:00,090
into the object to get
it to this height.

147
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,720
But the object now, it's not
moving or anything, so it

148
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,110
doesn't have any
kinetic energy.

149
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,510
But it now has a lot of
potential to do work.

150
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,860
And what do I mean by potential
to do work?

151
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,430
Well after I move an object up
100 meters into the air,

152
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,420
what's its potential
to do work?

153
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:19,520
Well, I could just let go of it
and have no outside force

154
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,360
other than gravity.

155
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,080
The gravity will
still be there.

156
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,190
And because of gravity, the
object will come down and be

157
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,490
at a very, very fast velocity
when it lands.

158
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,230
And maybe I could apply this to
some machine or something,

159
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,150
and this thing could do work.

160
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,400
And if that's a little
confusing, let

161
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,000
me give you an example.

162
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,300
It all works together
with our--

163
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:47,882
So let's say I have an object
that is-- oh, I don't know-- a

164
00:07:47,882 --> 00:07:53,060
1 kilogram object and
we're on earth.

165
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,230
And let's say that is 10 meters
above the ground.

166
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:58,700
   

167
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:06,070
So we know that its potential
energy is equal to mass times

168
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,510
gravitational acceleration
times height.

169
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,240
So mass is 1.

170
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,300
Let's just say gravitational
acceleration is 10 meters per

171
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,660
second squared.

172
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,435
Times 10 meters per
second squared.

173
00:08:17,435 --> 00:08:19,820
Times 10 meters, which
is the height.

174
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:25,720
So it's approximately equal to
100 Newton meters, which is

175
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,020
the same thing is 100 joules.

176
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,580
Fair enough.

177
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,700
And what do we know
about this?

178
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,500
We know that it would take about
100-- or exactly-- 100

179
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:38,799
joules of work to get this
object from the ground to this

180
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,809
point up here.

181
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:44,730
Now what we can do now is use
our traditional kinematics

182
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,480
formulas to figure out, well, if
I just let this object go,

183
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,750
how fast will it be when
it hits the ground?

184
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,645
And we could do that, but
what I'll show you is

185
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:53,380
even a faster way.

186
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,070
And this is where all of
the work and energy

187
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,440
really becomes useful.

188
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,840
We have something called the law
of conservation of energy.

189
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,550
It's that energy cannot be
created or destroyed, it just

190
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,600
gets transferred from
one form to another.

191
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,770
And there's some minor
caveats to that.

192
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,090
But for our purposes, we'll
just stick with that.

193
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,110
So in the situation where I just
take the object and I let

194
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:16,120
go up here, up here it has a
ton of potential energy.

195
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,560
And by the time it's down here,
it has no potential

196
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,530
energy because the height
becomes 0, right?

197
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:27,310
So here, potential energy is
equal to 100 and here,

198
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,870
potential energy
is equal to 0.

199
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,796
And so the natural question is--
I just told you the law

200
00:09:31,796 --> 00:09:34,930
of conservation of energy, but
if you look at this example,

201
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,330
all the potential energy
just disappeared.

202
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,160
And it looks like I'm running
out of time, but what I'll

203
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,130
show you in the next video is
that that potential energy

204
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,780
gets converted into another
type of energy.

205
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,980
And I think you might be able
to guess what type that is

206
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,030
because this object is going to
be moving really fast right

207
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,150
before it hits the ground.

208
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,030
I'll see you in the
next video.
