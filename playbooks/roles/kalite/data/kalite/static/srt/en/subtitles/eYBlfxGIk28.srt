1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,820
   

2
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:01,700
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,770
So where we left off is, there
was 1,000 people who all

4
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,800
needed, let's say, $1
million loans each.

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,260
And they were all going to
pay 10% on their loans.

6
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,990
And they borrowed it
from this bank.

7
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,900
It's kind of a standard
commercial bank.

8
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,160
And this bank says, well you
know, I just handed out $1

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,040
billion and I'm getting these
interest payments.

10
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,970
And my vaults are empty.

11
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,450
I want to have money
back in my vaults.

12
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,310
Or I want to have money back
on my balance sheet.

13
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,670
So I'm going to sell
these loans.

14
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,020
I'm going to bundle them all
together and sell them to this

15
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,189
investment bank.

16
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,140
And now what is this investment
bank going to do

17
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:35,800
with these loans?

18
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,700
And why is it doing it?

19
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,220
So let me delete this.

20
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,630
So we had the investment bank.

21
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:45,650
   

22
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,430
I randomly picked the color
green, but I think it is

23
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,680
appropriate for the
investment bank.

24
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,250
So now I have all of the, you
know, me-- that's a little

25
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,200
smiley face.

26
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:03,270
There's 1,000 of me, and we are
now going to pay the 10%.

27
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,670
We're now going to make all of
our mortgage payments, the 10%

28
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,010
payment, to this bank,
this investment bank.

29
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,280
But the investment bank, they're
not in the business of

30
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,670
servicing loans or keeping loans
on their balance sheets.

31
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,980
So what they do is, they
create a corporation.

32
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,630
They create an entity, maybe
a special purpose entity,

33
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,680
whatever you want to call it.

34
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,820
So they create a company.

35
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,170
Let me make that in purple,
another color.

36
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,420
So they created this company.

37
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,730
   

38
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:44,720
And what they do is, they will
take their rights to these

39
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,760
payments that they got.

40
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:45,960
Right?

41
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,160
They paid $1 billion to that
first bank in order to get the

42
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,250
payments from all
of these people.

43
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,030
And they say, you know what?

44
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,600
The rights on those payments--
that's the asset.

45
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,460
They bought all these loans.

46
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,050
The rights on those payments,
we are now going to transfer

47
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,690
to this special purpose
entity, to this other

48
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,560
corporation.

49
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,150
So now everyone is going to,
essentially-- all their

50
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:09,500
mortgage payments are going to
be funnelled into this entity.

51
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,190
Right?

52
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,630
And this is a corporation.

53
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,020
And so what the bank will do
is issue shares in this

54
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,550
corporation.

55
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,760
So let's say that it issues,
let's sat for simplicity, a

56
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,010
hundred shares.

57
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:26,050
   

58
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,300
So what's in this corporation?

59
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,760
   

60
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,560
The entire corporation gets the
mortgage payments on the

61
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,510
$1 billion in loans, right?

62
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,975
It has $1 billion of
loans outstanding.

63
00:02:36,975 --> 00:02:38,960
And it is going to
get 10% a year.

64
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,350
So it's going to get $100
million per year right?

65
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,140
Because it's a thousand
loans out there.

66
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,315
It's going to get $100 million
per year for 10 years.

67
00:02:47,315 --> 00:02:49,220
And at the end of the 10 years
it's also going to get $1

68
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,880
billion, right?

69
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,020
That's its asset it has.

70
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,770
Its asset is the rights on those
payments streams that

71
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,210
are going to come into
this corporation.

72
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,530
And it has 100 shares.

73
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,030
The way I think about
is you can split

74
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,270
this company 100 ways.

75
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,590
And I'm doing this to
further confuse you.

76
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,280
So what is each of those-- the
owner of each of those shares,

77
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,590
what does it entitle them to?

78
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:20,330
Well, it entitles me to 1/100 of
what this corporation gets.

79
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,400
So if I have a share-- let's
make it look like a share, a

80
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,080
stock certificate-- I'm going
to get 1/100 of this thing.

81
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,530
And normally you wouldn't
have 100 shares.

82
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,440
You would have, let's say,
a million shares.

83
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,840
Actually let me make it a
million shares, just because I

84
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,530
think that's, in some strange
way, more realistic.

85
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:39,600
So let's say there are
a million shares.

86
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,100
So if there are 1 million
shares, each share will get 1

87
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,380
millionth of the cash
flow stream that's

88
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,170
entitled to this entity.

89
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:50,180
So instead of getting $100
million every year, it gets

90
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,110
one millionth of that.

91
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:55,390
So it gets $100 per year.

92
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,940
And then on the last year,
instead of getting $1 billion

93
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,030
it gets $1000.

94
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,230
So what the bank will do is
it'll take these shares and

95
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,890
then it'll sell it to
the general public.

96
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,380
It'll IPO it, essentially.

97
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,420
You can think of it that way.

98
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,360
And tons of people will buy it,
especially hedge funds,

99
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,635
and pension funds, and mutual
funds, and bond investors.

100
00:04:15,635 --> 00:04:18,370
   

101
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:22,029
And it's important to think
about how the money's flowing.

102
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:26,960
So now when they sell these
shares in this entity, people

103
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,620
are going to give them, well,
hopefully more than what they

104
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,840
paid for it, right?

105
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,830
Maybe there's a lot of demand
for this type of asset, where

106
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,080
I get this type of
income stream.

107
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,950
So maybe once they sell all the
shares, they get, I don't

108
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,760
know, they get $1.1 billion
for them, right?

109
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,702
So this is the investors.

110
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:48,360
And the investors collectively
buy these

111
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,700
shares for $1.1 billion.

112
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:55,280
Essentially, let's say they
paid $1.1 billion for a

113
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,470
million shares, so they
paid $1,100 per share.

114
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,720
Right?

115
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,400
   

116
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,840
Each of the investors paid
$1,100 for each of these

117
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,430
shares, so that $1.1 billion
goes into this

118
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,630
special purpose entity.

119
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,630
And if you think about
it, the bank made out

120
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,620
like a bandit, right?

121
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,890
Because the bank paid $1 billion
for the rights to

122
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:23,520
these mortgage payments, and
it's getting $1.1 billion from

123
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,340
the investors.

124
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,190
And all the bank has to do is
kind of set this whole legal

125
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,150
structure up and service
the loans.

126
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,350
It actually doesn't even have
to service the loans.

127
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,580
We'll go into that later.

128
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,520
So let me summarize, I guess.

129
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,980
Just because I know this
can be a little bit

130
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,230
of a daunting subject.

131
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,280
   

132
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,800
Let me summarize.

133
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,200
And this purple I don't like.

134
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,830
Anyway.

135
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,315
So you have tons of investors.

136
00:05:50,315 --> 00:05:52,730
So, each of these
is an investor.

137
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,690
Actually a mortgage,
a borrower.

138
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,030
All of these people need
to buy houses.

139
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:59,670
These are all smiley faces.

140
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,980
They all need to buy houses.

141
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:07,370
And then they collectively
get $1 billion.

142
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,830
Right? $1 million each.

143
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:13,080
And they each use that $1
million to buy their house.

144
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:18,100
And then that $1 billion
initially came from just their

145
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,350
local bank.

146
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,790
   

147
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:25,800
And when the $1 billion came
from that local bank, all the

148
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,640
payments, the interest payments,
went to the bank.

149
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,600
But then an investment bank came
along and said, well no,

150
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,195
I want to buy the rights
to those payments.

151
00:06:33,195 --> 00:06:36,088
   

152
00:06:36,088 --> 00:06:38,910
And an investment bank came
along and says, well, I'm

153
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,160
going to give you $1 billion.

154
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,020
   

155
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,640
And now instead of
you getting the

156
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,720
payments, I get the payments.

157
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,080
And then the bank sets up a
special purpose entity.

158
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,130
Essentially it sells
a bunch of shares.

159
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,380
Let's say it sells
a million shares.

160
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:00,190
   

161
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:04,560
And let's say it was able to
sell each of those shares for

162
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:12,950
$1,100 from the investing
public.

163
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,270
So it raises $1.1
billion, right?

164
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:20,180
So the value of this company is
$1.1 billion that now goes

165
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,030
to the bank.

166
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:24,180
And now the payment stream
instead of going to-- let me

167
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,340
do a different color-- now the
payment stream goes to this

168
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,580
special purpose entity
instead of the bank.

169
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,080
And the bank essentially made
out like a bandit because it

170
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:40,920
paid $1 billion and it got $1.1
so it made $100 million

171
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,010
just for doing this
transaction.

172
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,280
I'm not saying that's how much
a bank actually would make,

173
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,150
but this shows you why every
person is kind of, what

174
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,040
they're doing in this
value chain.

175
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,600
And as I said before, this
bank also probably did

176
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,310
something similar.

177
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:57,050
They probably took some fees or
sold the loans for slightly

178
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,300
more than they issued
the loans for.

179
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:07,920
So these shares-- each of these
one million shares--

180
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,400
this is a mortgage-backed
security.

181
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,900
   

182
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,400
And it makes sense.

183
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,040
It's a security.

184
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,690
A security is an ownership
that's tradable in a company.

185
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:24,100
And that company has the right
to payments that are secured

186
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,120
by mortgages.

187
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,420
So if all these people promised
they would pay, and

188
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,590
they're going to pay to this
special purpose entity.

189
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:36,429
But if, by chance, one of these
people lose their jobs

190
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:41,000
or they can't pay, or for
whatever reason, instead of

191
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,440
the payments, this entity is
going to have the rights to

192
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,130
their property.

193
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,890
And that's why we
say that it's a

194
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,240
mortgage-backed security.

195
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,980
So it's not just a promise
to get money.

196
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,470
The money is actually backed
by people's mortgages.

197
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,660
And of course, then this entity
is going to, if this

198
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,970
guy defaults on his loan--
he's one of a million, so

199
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,200
statistically you might be
able to predict that.

200
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,900
I don't to put too much stock in
these statistical models--

201
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,780
then this entity will just have
that property auctioned

202
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,520
off or sold.

203
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,570
And the cash flow will
come back to it.

204
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,510
So that's what a mortgage-backed
security is.

205
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,980
Hopefully I didn't confuse
you too much.

206
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,260
My next presentation, I'm going
to take it to a further

207
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,430
level of confusion and show you
what a collateralized debt

208
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,430
obligation is.

209
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:27,150
And then I'll do a more
philosophical video on why

210
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,190
these things even exist, and
why they're useful, and why

211
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:35,190
people may benefit or may not
benefit from these things.
