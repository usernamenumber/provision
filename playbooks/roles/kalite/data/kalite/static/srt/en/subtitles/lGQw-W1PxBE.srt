1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,020
   

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's see if we can tackle
a slightly more difficult

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,810
hyperbola graphing problem.

4
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,150
Let's add the hyperbola.

5
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:21,180
Make this up on the fly x minus
1 squared over 16 minus y plus

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:29,660
1 squared over 4 is equal to 1.

7
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,480
So the first thing to recognize
is that this is a hyperbola and

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,410
we'll in a few videos, do a
bunch of problems where the

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,025
first point is just to identify
what type of conic section we

10
00:00:39,025 --> 00:00:41,480
have and then the second
step is actually graph

11
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,440
the conic section.

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,400
I already told you that we're
going to be doing a hyperbola

13
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,550
problem, so you know
it's a hyperbola.

14
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,500
But the way to recognize that
is that you have this minus of

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,670
the y squared term and then
we actually have it shifted.

16
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,640
The classic or the standard
non-shifted form of a hyperbola

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,940
or a hyperbola centered at 0
would look something like this.

18
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,950
Especially if it has the same
asymptotes just shifted, but

19
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:10,600
centered at 0 it would look
like this: x squared over 16

20
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,820
minus y squared over
4 is equal to 1.

21
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,830
And the difference between this
hyperbola and this hyperbola

22
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:28,670
the center of this hyperbola is
at the point x is equal to

23
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:32,250
1 y is equal to minus 1.

24
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,670
And the way to think about it
is x equals 1 makes this whole

25
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,570
term 0, and so that's
why it's the center.

26
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,720
And y equal to minus 1
makes this whole term 0.

27
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,750
And on here, of course,
the center is the origin.

28
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,030
Center is 0, 0.

29
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:53,430
So the easy way to graph this
is to really graph this one,

30
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,140
but you shift it so you use the
center being 1 minus 1 instead

31
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,770
of the center being 0, 0.

32
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:00,440
So let's do that.

33
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:06,990
So let's figure out the slope
of the two asymptotes here and

34
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,270
then we can shift those two
slopes so that it's appropriate

35
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,220
for this hyperbola right here.

36
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,140
So if we go with this one,
let's just solve for y.

37
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,480
That's what I always
like to do whenever I'm

38
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,270
graphing a hyperbola.

39
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:26,100
So we get minus y
squared over 4.

40
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,470
Subtracting x squared over
16 from both sides minus

41
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:34,730
x squared over 16 plus 1.

42
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,190
I'm working on this hyperbola
right here, not this one,

43
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,880
and then I'm going to
just shift it later.

44
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,810
And then let's say multiply
both sides by minus 4 and you

45
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:47,100
get y squared is equal to-- see
the minus cancels out with that

46
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:59,020
and then 4 over 16 is x squared
over 4 minus 4 and so y is

47
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:05,900
equal to plus or minus square
root of x squared

48
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,480
over 4 minus 4.

49
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,340
And to figure out the
asymptotes you just have to

50
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,640
think about well what happens
as x approaches positive

51
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,220
or negative infinity.

52
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,270
As x gets really positive
or x gets really negative.

53
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,040
And we've done this a
bunch of times already.

54
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,900
I think this is important.

55
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,560
This is more important than
just memorizing the formula,

56
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,640
because it gives you an
intuition of where those

57
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,750
equations for the lines of the
asymptote actually come from.

58
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,710
Because these are what this
graph or this equation or this

59
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,330
function approaches as x
approaches positive or

60
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,600
negative infinity.

61
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:47,090
As x approaches positive or
negative infinity, what is y

62
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,680
approximately equal
to, in this case?

63
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,860
Well once again, this term
is going to dominate.

64
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,110
This is just a 4 right here.

65
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:57,410
You could imagine when x is
like a trillion or a negative

66
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,650
trillion, this is going to be
huge number and this is going

67
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,230
to be just like you know
you almost view it like

68
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:01,920
the ground off area.

69
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,630
You take the square root
of that and so this

70
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,520
is going to dominate.

71
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,910
So as you approach positive or
negative infinity, y is going

72
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,570
to be approximately equal to
the square root, the positive

73
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:15,510
and negative square root,
of x squared over 4.

74
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,950
So y would be approximately
equal to positive or

75
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:25,340
negative x over 2, or 1/2x.

76
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,560
Let's do that.

77
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,525
Let's draw our asymptotes.

78
00:04:28,525 --> 00:04:31,820
And remember, these are the
asymptotes for this situation.

79
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,070
But now of course, we're
centered at 1 negative 1.

80
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:38,330
So I'm going to draw two lines
with these slopes, with

81
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,840
positive 1/2 and negative 1/2
slopes, but they're going to be

82
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,450
centered at this point.

83
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,090
I just got rid of the shift
just so I could figure out the

84
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,120
asymptotes but of course this
is the real thing that we're

85
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,480
trying to graph, so
let me do that.

86
00:04:53,480 --> 00:05:02,990
This is my y-axis this is my
x-axis and the center of

87
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,340
this is at 1 negative 1.

88
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,190
   

89
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:14,360
So x is equal to 1 y
is equal to minus 1.

90
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,530
And then the slopes of the
asymptotes were positive

91
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,420
and negative 1/2.

92
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,060
   

93
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,040
So let's do the positive 1/2.

94
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,330
So that means for every 2 you
run over, so if you go positive

95
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,770
in the positive x direction
2, you move up 1.

96
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,710
So you go to the
right 2 and up 1.

97
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,880
So that's the first one.

98
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,620
Let me draw that asymptote.

99
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,320
   

100
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,970
Looks something like that, and
then we draw it from this

101
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,610
point to that point.

102
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,790
Got to have a steady hand.

103
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:51,520
   

104
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,040
And then the other asymptote
is going to have a

105
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,850
minus 1/2 slope.

106
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,350
Remember this is our
center 1 minus 1, so if

107
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:04,350
I go down 1 and over.

108
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:07,580
So when I go over 2, I go down
1, so that will be right there,

109
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,850
Let me draw that asymptote.

110
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,790
   

111
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:18,320
And then just to continue it
in the other direction I want

112
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,280
to make the lines overlap.

113
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,230
It's going to look
something like that.

114
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,690
So we've drawn our asymptotes
for this function, and now we

115
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,830
have to figure out if it's
going to be a vertical

116
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,600
hyperbola or a
horizontal hyperbola.

117
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,860
And the easy way to think
about it is to try and make--

118
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,230
and we can do it two ways.

119
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,650
I mean if you just look at
this equation right here.

120
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,560
When you're taking the positive
square root, we're always going

121
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,720
to be slightly below
the asymptote.

122
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,890
The asymptote is this thing,
but we're always going

123
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:48,810
to be slightly below it.

124
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,550
So that tells us that were
always going to be slightly

125
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,810
below the asymptote on the
positive square root, and we're

126
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,460
always going to be slightly
above the asymptote on the

127
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,100
negative square root.

128
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,000
Because it's going to be little
less, and it's negative.

129
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,850
But I'll let you
think about that.

130
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,890
My intuition is that it's
going to be there and there.

131
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:03,600
It's more than intuition.

132
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,770
I know that we're going to be
a little bit less than the

133
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,920
negative square root, but
I'll do it the other way.

134
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,410
I'll do it the way I
did in the last video.

135
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,430
So the other way to think
about it is what happens

136
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,850
when this term is 0?

137
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:18,330
For this term to be 0, x
has to be equal to 1.

138
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,160
And does that ever happen?

139
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,680
Can x be equal to 1?

140
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,700
If x is equal to 1
here this term is 0.

141
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:33,810
And then you have a situation
where-- and then you have a

142
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:39,530
minus y squared over 4 would
have to equal 1, or this would

143
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,975
have to be a negative number.

144
00:07:40,975 --> 00:07:43,610
So x could not be equal to 1.

145
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,720
So y could be equal
to negative 1.

146
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,770
Let's try that out.

147
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:54,120
If y is equal to negative
1, this term right

148
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,680
here disappears.

149
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:01,300
   

150
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:07,800
So when y is equal to negative
1, you're just left with-- x

151
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,450
minus 1 squared over
16 is equal to 1.

152
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,270
I just canceled out this term,
because I'm saying what happens

153
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,400
when y is equal to negative 1.

154
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,970
You multiply both sides by 16.

155
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,330
Let me do it over here.

156
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:26,280
These get messy. x minus 1
squared is equal to 16.

157
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,860
Take the square root
of both sides.

158
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:34,710
x minus 1 is equal to
positive or negative 4.

159
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:38,440
And so if x is equal to
positive 4, if you add 1 to

160
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,700
that x would be equal to 5.

161
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:46,660
And then if x minus 1 would be
minus 4 and you add 1 to that

162
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,080
you will have x is equal to 3.

163
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,260
So our 2 points or our 2 points
closest to our center are the

164
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:59,830
points 5 comma negative 1
and 3 comma negative 1.

165
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,770
Let's plot those 2.

166
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:09,110
So 5, 1 2 3 4 5, negative
1 and 3, negative 1.

167
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,310
Is that right?

168
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,070
No, minus 3, because x
minus 1 could be minus 4.

169
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,210
That's what happens
when you skip steps.

170
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:24,650
   

171
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,770
If you have the minus 4
situation, then x is

172
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,570
equal to minus 3.

173
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:31,160
   

174
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,910
You go 1 2 3 minus 3, minus 1.

175
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,690
So those are both points
on this hyperbola.

176
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,980
And then our intuition was
correct, or it was what I said.

177
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:47,110
That-- the positive square root
is always going to be slightly

178
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,490
below the asymptote,
so we get our curve.

179
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,500
It's going to look
something like this.

180
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,590
It's going to get closer and
closer, and then here it's

181
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,590
going to get closer and
closer in that direction.

182
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:59,070
It keeps getting closer and
closer to that asymptote.

183
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,690
And here, it's going to keep
getting closer and closer to

184
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:06,080
the asymptote on that side
and then on that side.

185
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,760
And of course these
asymptotes keep going

186
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,600
on forever and forever.

187
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,370
If you want you could try
out some other points

188
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,100
just to confirm.

189
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,690
You could plot that point
there, or that point there

190
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,220
just to confirm that
that's the case.

191
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,720
The hard part really is just to
identify the asymptotes and

192
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,620
just to figure out do we sit on
the left and the right, or do

193
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,950
we sit on the top
and the bottom.

194
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:24,570
And then you're done.

195
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,200
You can graph your hyperbola.

196
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:27,690
See you in the next video.

197
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:28,990
