1
00:00:00,553 --> 00:00:02,140
In the last video we did some examples

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,474
were we had one digit

3
00:00:03,474 --> 00:00:04,672
repeating on and on forever

4
00:00:04,672 --> 00:00:06,410
and we were able to convert those into fractions.

5
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,073
In this video,

6
00:00:08,073 --> 00:00:10,139
we want to tackle something a little bit more interesting

7
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:13,299
which is multiple digits repeating on and on forever.

8
00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:18,951
So let's say I had 0.36 repeating,

9
00:00:18,951 --> 00:00:20,742
which is the same thing as --

10
00:00:20,742 --> 00:00:22,889
since the bar is over the three <u>and</u> the six,

11
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:26,340
both of those repeat: 3 6, 3 6, 3 6...

12
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,752
and it just keeps going on and on like that forever.

13
00:00:29,752 --> 00:00:31,876
Now the key to doing this type of problem is

14
00:00:31,876 --> 00:00:33,571
instead of multiplying --

15
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:34,871
like we did in the last video:

16
00:00:34,871 --> 00:00:36,380
we said "this is equal to x".

17
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,066
Instead of just multiplying it by 10,

18
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:40,073
ten would only shift it one over

19
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,629
We want to shift it over enough

20
00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:43,405
so that we can kind of...

21
00:00:43,405 --> 00:00:45,299
so that when we line them up,

22
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:48,575
the decimal parts will still line up with each other.

23
00:00:48,575 --> 00:00:49,887
And to do that,

24
00:00:49,887 --> 00:00:51,557
we want to actually shift the decimal space

25
00:00:51,557 --> 00:00:53,136
2 to the right.

26
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,275
And to shift it 2 to the right,

27
00:00:55,275 --> 00:00:58,736
we have to multiply it by 100, or 10^2.

28
00:00:58,736 --> 00:01:02,673
So, 100x is going to be equal to what?

29
00:01:02,673 --> 00:01:04,402
We are shifting this two to the right:

30
00:01:04,402 --> 00:01:06,226
One... two...

31
00:01:06,226 --> 00:01:10,625
So 100x is going to be equal to...

32
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:12,333
The decimal is going to be there now,

33
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:17,000
so, its going to be 36.36...36...36...

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,022
and on and on forever.

35
00:01:19,022 --> 00:01:20,829
And then let me rewrite x over here,

36
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:22,748
we are going to subtract that from the 100x.

37
00:01:22,748 --> 00:01:29,739
X is equal to 0.363636... repeating on and on forever.

38
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:31,888
And notice when we multiply it by 100,

39
00:01:31,888 --> 00:01:34,466
the 3's and the 6's still line up with each other.

40
00:01:34,466 --> 00:01:36,136
When we align the decimals,

41
00:01:36,136 --> 00:01:38,051
you want to make sure that the decimals

42
00:01:38,051 --> 00:01:39,889
line up appropriately.

43
00:01:39,889 --> 00:01:41,467
And the reason why this is valuable

44
00:01:41,467 --> 00:01:43,301
is that now, when we subtract x from 100x,

45
00:01:43,301 --> 00:01:46,005
the repeating parts will cancel out.

46
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:47,969
So, let's subtract.

47
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:50,467
Let us subtract these two things.

48
00:01:50,467 --> 00:01:53,346
On the left-hand side we have 100x - x,

49
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:56,306
so that gives us 99x.

50
00:01:56,306 --> 00:01:58,827
And then on the right-hand side,

51
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,557
this part cancels out with that part,

52
00:02:00,557 --> 00:02:03,937
and we are just left with 36.

53
00:02:03,937 --> 00:02:07,747
We can divide both sides by 99,

54
00:02:07,747 --> 00:02:14,274
and we are left with x = 36 / 99

55
00:02:14,274 --> 00:02:16,410
and both the numerator and the denominator

56
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,404
is divisible by 9, so we can reduce this.

57
00:02:20,404 --> 00:02:23,075
If we divide the numerator by 9 we get 4,

58
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:25,572
and the denominator by 9, we get 11.

59
00:02:25,572 --> 00:02:29,335
So 0.363636 forever and forever repeating

60
00:02:29,335 --> 00:02:31,936
is four elevenths.

61
00:02:31,936 --> 00:02:34,337
Now let's do another interesting one.

62
00:02:34,337 --> 00:02:36,053
Let's say we have...

63
00:02:36,053 --> 00:02:37,645
- and I will just set it equal to x -

64
00:02:37,645 --> 00:02:40,967
let's say we have the number

65
00:02:40,967 --> 00:02:45,343
the number 0.714,

66
00:02:45,343 --> 00:02:48,743
and the 14 is repeating.

67
00:02:48,743 --> 00:02:50,801
so this the same thing,

68
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:52,645
so notice the 714 isn't going to repeat,

69
00:02:52,645 --> 00:02:54,561
just the 14 is going to repeat.

70
00:02:54,561 --> 00:03:00,939
So this is 0.714, 14, 14... on and on and on.

71
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:03,202
So lets set this equal to X.

72
00:03:03,202 --> 00:03:06,396
Now you might be tempted to multiply this by 1000,

73
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:12,616
to get the decimal all the way clear of 714.

74
00:03:12,616 --> 00:03:14,547
But you actually don't want to do that.

75
00:03:14,547 --> 00:03:15,802
You want to shift it just enough

76
00:03:15,802 --> 00:03:17,971
so that the repeating pattern can be

77
00:03:17,971 --> 00:03:21,979
right under itself, when you do the subtraction.

78
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:23,498
So again in this situation,

79
00:03:23,498 --> 00:03:24,260
even though we have 3 numbers

80
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,782
behind the decimal point,

81
00:03:25,782 --> 00:03:27,442
because only two of them are repeating

82
00:03:27,442 --> 00:03:30,408
we only want to multiply it by 10^2.

83
00:03:30,408 --> 00:03:33,079
So once again, you want to multiply it by 100.

84
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:36,245
So you get 100x = ...

85
00:03:36,245 --> 00:03:38,251
- we're moving the decimal two to the right -

86
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,517
One..., two...

87
00:03:39,517 --> 00:03:52,940
So, it's going to be 71.414141 and on and on.

88
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,054
And then let me rewrite x below this.

89
00:03:55,054 --> 00:04:00,340
we have x = 0.1714, 14, 14 ...

90
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,115
And notice: now, the 14, 14, 14's

91
00:04:03,115 --> 00:04:05,449
are lined up right below each other.

92
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:08,179
so it is going to work out when we subtract.

93
00:04:08,179 --> 00:04:10,196
So, let's subtract these things:

94
00:04:10,196 --> 00:04:13,796
100x - x = 99x,

95
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:16,340
and this is going to be equal to...

96
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,256
these 14, 14's are going to cancel those 14, 14's

97
00:04:20,256 --> 00:04:23,391
and we have 71.4 - .7

98
00:04:23,391 --> 00:04:24,854
we can do this in our head

99
00:04:24,854 --> 00:04:26,526
or we can borrow if you like:

100
00:04:26,526 --> 00:04:28,659
this could be fourteen, this is a zero,

101
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:32,644
so you have 14 - 7 = 7

102
00:04:32,644 --> 00:04:34,812
and then 70 minus 0.

103
00:04:34,812 --> 00:04:39,415
So, you have 99x = 70.7.

104
00:04:39,415 --> 00:04:41,782
And then we can divide both sides by 99;

105
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,008
you could see that also something strange is happening

106
00:04:44,008 --> 00:04:45,183
because we still have a decimal,

107
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,855
but we can fix that up in the end.

108
00:04:46,855 --> 00:04:51,112
So, lets divide both sides by ninety-nine:

109
00:04:51,112 --> 00:04:55,683
You get x = 70.7 / 99.

110
00:04:55,683 --> 00:04:57,601
Now, obviously, we have not converted this

111
00:04:57,601 --> 00:04:58,925
into a pure fraction yet.

112
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:00,527
We still have a decimal in the numerator.

113
00:05:00,527 --> 00:05:02,279
But that is pretty easy to fix:

114
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,802
you just have to multiply the numerator

115
00:05:03,802 --> 00:05:05,530
and the denominator by ten

116
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,934
to get rid of this decimal.

117
00:05:06,934 --> 00:05:08,758
So lets multiply the numerator by ten

118
00:05:08,758 --> 00:05:10,731
and the denominator by ten.

119
00:05:10,731 --> 00:05:19,790
and so we get 707 / 990.

120
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,089
Let's do one more example.

121
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:27,199
Let's say we have something like

122
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,795
3.257 repeating,

123
00:05:32,795 --> 00:05:35,790
and we want to covert this into a fraction.

124
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:39,171
so once again, we set this equal to X,

125
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:40,342
and notice: this is going to be

126
00:05:40,342 --> 00:05:42,595
3.257, 257, 257...

127
00:05:42,595 --> 00:05:44,870
The 257 is going to repeat on and on and on.

128
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,867
Since we have three digits that are repeating,

129
00:05:46,867 --> 00:05:50,431
we want to think about a thousand x,

130
00:05:50,431 --> 00:05:52,592
10 to the 3rd power times x

131
00:05:52,592 --> 00:05:54,681
and that will let us shift it just right

132
00:05:54,681 --> 00:05:57,351
so that the repeating parts can cancel out.

133
00:05:57,351 --> 00:06:02,803
so 1,000x is going to be equal to what?

134
00:06:02,803 --> 00:06:04,460
We're going to shift the decimal to the right,

135
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,680
1, 2, 3...

136
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,532
so it' s going to be 3,257 point...

137
00:06:10,532 --> 00:06:12,508
and then the 257 keeps repeating:

138
00:06:12,508 --> 00:06:18,465
257, 257, 257 keeps going on and on forever.

139
00:06:18,465 --> 00:06:21,195
And then we are going to subtract X from that.

140
00:06:21,195 --> 00:06:22,436
so here is x;

141
00:06:22,436 --> 00:06:24,201
x is equal to 3.

142
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:25,282
- You want to make sure

143
00:06:25,282 --> 00:06:26,337
you have your decimals lined up -

144
00:06:26,337 --> 00:06:31,460
3.257 257 257 . . .

145
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,337
keeps going on forever.

146
00:06:33,337 --> 00:06:35,059
Notice when we multiply it by 1,000

147
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:37,795
it allowed us to line up the 257's

148
00:06:37,795 --> 00:06:38,993
so that when we subtract,

149
00:06:38,993 --> 00:06:41,130
the repeating part cancels out.

150
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,326
So let's do that subtraction.

151
00:06:43,326 --> 00:06:44,427
On the left-hand side

152
00:06:44,427 --> 00:06:46,527
a thousand of something minus One of that something,

153
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,435
You are left with 999 of that something.

154
00:06:49,435 --> 00:06:50,748
is equal to

155
00:06:50,748 --> 00:06:53,433
- this part is going to cancel out with that part -

156
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:55,276
is going to be equal to..

157
00:06:55,276 --> 00:06:57,891
Let's see, 7 - 3 = 4,

158
00:06:57,891 --> 00:07:01,932
and then you have this 5 and the 2 and the 3.

159
00:07:01,932 --> 00:07:07,260
So you have 999x = 3,254.

160
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:16,214
And then you can divide both sides of this by 999.

161
00:07:16,214 --> 00:07:23,762
And you are left with x = 3,254 / 999.

162
00:07:23,762 --> 00:07:25,666
Obviously this is improper fraction

163
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,765
the numerator is larger than the denominator.

164
00:07:27,765 --> 00:07:30,682
You could convert this to a proper fraction if you like,

165
00:07:30,682 --> 00:07:32,517
You could just try to figure out

166
00:07:32,517 --> 00:07:36,766
what the 0,257 repeating forever part is equal to

167
00:07:36,766 --> 00:07:39,218
and have 3 being the whole number part

168
00:07:39,218 --> 00:07:40,412
of the mixed fraction,

169
00:07:40,412 --> 00:07:43,477
or you can just divide 999 into 3254.

170
00:07:43,477 --> 00:07:45,930
Actually we can do that pretty straightforward:

171
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,681
it goes into it three times,

172
00:07:47,681 --> 00:07:49,640
and the remainder, ...

173
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,360
well let me just do it to go through the motions:

174
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,682
999 goes into 3254...

175
00:07:56,682 --> 00:07:58,609
it will go into it 3 times,

176
00:07:58,609 --> 00:08:01,438
we know that because this is originally 3.257

177
00:08:01,438 --> 00:08:03,529
so we are just going to find out the remainder.

178
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:06,269
So, 3 x 9 = 27,

179
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:10,532
we add the 2's, so we have 29

180
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:13,179
3 x 9 = 27,

181
00:08:13,179 --> 00:08:15,469
we add the 2's, so we have 29

182
00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:16,756
so we are left with,

183
00:08:16,756 --> 00:08:18,196
if we subtract,

184
00:08:18,196 --> 00:08:19,962
if we re-group, or borrow,

185
00:08:19,962 --> 00:08:21,610
however we want to call it,

186
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,412
this could be 14,

187
00:08:23,412 --> 00:08:25,107
this could be a 4,

188
00:08:25,107 --> 00:08:27,731
(I'll use a new color)

189
00:08:27,731 --> 00:08:29,611
this would be a 4,

190
00:08:29,611 --> 00:08:31,864
and then the 4 is still smaller than this 9,

191
00:08:31,864 --> 00:08:33,607
so we need to re-group again

192
00:08:33,607 --> 00:08:36,268
so this could be 14 and this could be 1,

193
00:08:36,268 --> 00:08:38,678
but this is still smaller then this 9 right over here,

194
00:08:38,678 --> 00:08:40,270
so we re-group it again,

195
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,198
this would be 11 and then this is a 2,

196
00:08:43,198 --> 00:08:46,179
14 - 7 = 7,

197
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:48,864
14 - 9 = 5,

198
00:08:48,864 --> 00:08:51,869
11 - 9 = 2,

199
00:08:51,869 --> 00:08:54,763
so we are left with

200
00:08:54,763 --> 00:08:56,610
did I do that right? - Yep

201
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,117
so this is going to be equal to

202
00:08:58,117 --> 00:09:03,262
3 and 257 over 999.

203
00:09:03,262 --> 00:09:04,700
And we are done.
