1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,500
   

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,530
Usually the most quoted number
people give you when they're

3
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,370
publicizing information about
their credit cards is the APR.

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,660
And I think you might guess,
or you might already know,

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,770
that it stands for annual
percentage rate.

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,840
   

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,850
What I want to do in this
video is to understand a

8
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,430
little bit more detail on what
they actually mean by the

9
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,280
annual percentage rate, and do
a little bit of math to get

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,390
the real, or the
mathematically-- or the

11
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,380
effective annual percentage
rate.

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,730
I was actually just browsing the
web, and I saw some credit

13
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:46,150
card that had an annual
percentage rate of 22.9%

14
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,640
annual percentage rate.

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:55,140
But then right next to it they
say that we have a 0.06274

16
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,240
percent daily periodic rate.

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,820
   

18
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,580
Which to me, this piece tells
me that they compound the

19
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,880
interest on your credit card
balance on a daily basis.

20
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,470
And this is the amount
that they compound.

21
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,090
So where do they get
these numbers from?

22
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:25,610
Well if you just take 0.06274
and multiply by 365 days in a

23
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:29,250
year, you should
get this 22.9.

24
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,800
And let's see if we get that.

25
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,970
And of course this
is percentage.

26
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,470
So this is a percentage here.

27
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,270
And this is a percent here.

28
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,510
Let me get out my trusty
calculator, and see if that is

29
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,220
what they get.

30
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:47,100
So if I take 0.06274-- and
remember this is a percent,

31
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,190
but I'll just ignore the percent
sign, so as a decimal

32
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,130
I would actually add
2 more 0's here.

33
00:01:51,130 --> 00:02:01,100
But 0.06274 times 365
is equal to 22.9%.

34
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,230
And you say, hey Sal, what's
wrong with that?

35
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,750
They're charging me
0.06274% per day.

36
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,360
They're going to do that
for 365 days a year, so

37
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,710
that gives me 22.9%.

38
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,990
And my reply to you
is that they're

39
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,750
compounding on a daily basis.

40
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,770
   

41
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,440
So if you were to give them $100
and if you didn't have to

42
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,690
pay some type of a minimum
balance, and you just let that

43
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:32,310
$100 ride for a year, you
wouldn't just owe them $122.9.

44
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,340
They're compounding this
much every day.

45
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,780
So if I were to write
this is a decimal.

46
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,510
So let me just write
that as a decimal.

47
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:52,630
So 0.06274% as a decimal this
is the same thing as 5 These

48
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,730
are the same thing.

49
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,310
1% is 0.01.

50
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:02,600
So 0.06% is 0.0006
as a decimal.

51
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,800
Now this is how much they're
charging every day.

52
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,220
And if you watch the compounding
interest video,

53
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,490
you know that if you want to
figure out how much total

54
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,320
interest you would be paying
over a total year, you would

55
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,800
take this number, add it to 1.

56
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:28,660
So we have 1.0006274.

57
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,100
So instead of just taking this
and multiplying it by 365, you

58
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:38,100
take this number and you take
it to the 365th power.

59
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,820
You multiply it by
itself 365 times.

60
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,480
That's because, if I have $1 in
my balance, on day 2, I'm

61
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,880
going to have to pay this much
times one dollar $1.

62
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,150
1.0006274 times $1.

63
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,190
On day 2, I'm going to have to
pay this much, times this

64
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,790
number again, times the $1.

65
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:57,700
So let me write that down.

66
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:05,910
On day 1 maybe I have
$1 that I owe them.

67
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:14,820
On day 2, it'll be $1 times
this thing, 1.006274.

68
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:25,870
On day 3, I'm going that have
to pay 1.0006274 times this

69
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,490
whole thing.

70
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:36,170
So on day 3 it'll be
$1 times 1.0006274.

71
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,800
Then I'm going to have to pay
that much interest on this

72
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,650
whole thing again.

73
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:43,590
I'm compounding, 1.0006274.

74
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,820
So you can see we've kind of
kept the balance for 2 days,

75
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,740
and I'm raising this to the
second power, if I'm

76
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,210
multiplying it by itself,
I'm squaring it.

77
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,640
So if I keep that balance for
365 days, I have to raise it

78
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,340
to the 365th power.

79
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,950
And this isn't counting
any kind of extra

80
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,140
penalties or fees.

81
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:06,070
This number, whatever it is,
once I get this and I subtract

82
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,930
1 from it, that is the
mathematically true-- that is

83
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,810
the effective annual
percentage rate.

84
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,720
So let's figure out
what that is.

85
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:29,090
So if I take 1.0006274 and
I raise it to the 365

86
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,050
power, I get 1.257.

87
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:39,610
So if I were to compound this
much interest, 0.06% for 365

88
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:47,090
days, at the end of a year I
would owe 1.257 times my

89
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,350
original principal balance.

90
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:54,900
So this right here is
equal to 1.257.

91
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,090
So I would owe 1.257 times my
original principal amount.

92
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:09,100
Or the effective interest rate,
APR, annual percent

93
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,150
rate, or the mathematically
correct annual percentage rate

94
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:16,340
here, is 25.7%.

95
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,880
And you might say, hey Sal,
that's still not too far off

96
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,360
from the reported APR, where
they just take this number and

97
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,760
multiply by 365 instead of
taking this number and taking

98
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,280
it to the 365 power.

99
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,810
You're saying, hey this
is roughly 23%

100
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,370
this is roughly 26%.

101
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,170
It's only a 3% difference.

102
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:38,370
But if you look at that
compounding interest video,

103
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,040
even the most basic one that I
put out there, you'll see that

104
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,430
every percentage point really,
really, really, really

105
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,400
matters, especially if you're
going to carry these balances

106
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,800
for a long period of time.

107
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,830
So be very careful.

108
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,670
In general, you shouldn't carry
any balances on your

109
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,820
credit cards, because these are
very high interest rates.

110
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,890
And you'll end up just paying
interest on purchases you made

111
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:55,920
many, many years ago.

112
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,350
And you a long ago lost all of
the joy of that purchase.

113
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,340
So I encourage you to not
even keep balances.

114
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,010
But if you do keep any balances,
pay very close

115
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:04,920
attention to this.

116
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,700
A 22.9% APR is still probably
not the full effective

117
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,120
interest rate, which might be
closer to 26% in this example.

118
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,900
That's before they even count
the penalties and the other

119
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,390
types of fees that they might
throw on top of everything.

120
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:29,949
