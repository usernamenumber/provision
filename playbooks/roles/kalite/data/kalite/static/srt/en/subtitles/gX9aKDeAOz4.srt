1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,910
   

2
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:03,590
I think we're now ready to
tackle the big picture and

3
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,090
what has our government
officials so

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:07,970
worried right now.

5
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,000
So what I've done is, I've just
drawn the balance sheets

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,070
for a bunch of banks.

7
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:13,090
Obviously, this is simplified.

8
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,580
And I made all of their balance
sheets look the same.

9
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,560
All of these banks, each of
these kind of represents the

10
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,470
balance sheet of a bank.

11
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,940
And just to explain it, the
left-hand side of this balance

12
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,030
sheet, so this column right
here-- and maybe I can, at

13
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,560
least for the first bank,
mark it a little bit.

14
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:35,310
So what I'm squaring off
in magenta, that's the

15
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,750
assets of that bank.

16
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,270
What I'm squaring off
in blue, that's the

17
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,580
liabilities of the bank.

18
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,730
And what I wrote here is, it has
$4 billion of liabilities.

19
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,380
Its assets, I divided it between
$3 billion of other

20
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,230
assets and $2 billion of CDOs.

21
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,810
Because we want to focus on the
CDOs, because that's the

22
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,320
crux of everything
that's going on.

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,620
And we have $5 billion in
assets, $4 billion of

24
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,590
liabilities, so you have
$1 billion in equity.

25
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,680
So that's what's left there.

26
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,800
So this is just another visual
representation that

27
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,120
liabilities plus equity
is equal to assets.

28
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:15,220
Or assets minus liabilities
is equal to equity.

29
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,940
And I've just copied and pasted
this one balance sheet

30
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,930
a bunch of times.

31
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,390
I don't know whether we're
going to use all those.

32
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,970
But let's just assume, for
simplicity, that a ton of

33
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,680
banks in the system have this
identical balance sheet.

34
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,750
Obviously, they don't have an
identical balance sheet.

35
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,790
But all of their balance sheets
might have kind of

36
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,040
similar properties.

37
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,550
   

38
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,880
This isn't always the case,
different banks have different

39
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,310
exposures to CDOs.

40
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,240
Some of them have a lot, some
of them have a little bit.

41
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,450
Some of them are valuing
them more

42
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,480
conservatively than others.

43
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,370
But just for the sake of
simplicity, I've just made all

44
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:52,710
the banks in the situation where
the book value of the

45
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,550
CDOs that they have on their
balance sheets is the larger

46
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,030
than their equity value.

47
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,040
And I did that for a reason.

48
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,890
Because it leads to the issue
of, are these banks facing

49
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,720
just a liquidity issue
or are they facing

50
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,220
just a solvency issue?

51
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,419
If you believe that these are
worth $3 billion, these

52
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:13,280
assets, these liabilities are
worth $4 billion, then the

53
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,260
crux of whether it's a liquidity
or a solvency issue

54
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,200
all falls down as to whether
these are worth

55
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,420
$2 billion or not.

56
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,140
For example, if these are worth
$2 billion, then you

57
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,520
have $1 billion of equity.

58
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,270
If these are worth $1.5 billion,
well maybe they're

59
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,460
being a little optimistic here,
but you'll still have

60
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,990
$0.5 billion of equity.

61
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,600
So you're still solvent.

62
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,080
And in that situation, in
theory, one is just if they

63
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,720
don't have the cash when some of
their debt comes due, they

64
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,140
should just be able to
borrow some money and

65
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,960
get past that hurdle.

66
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,110
And then in the future maybe
sell their assets and still

67
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,500
have positive equity.

68
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,280
However, if the true value of
those CDOs, and this is kind

69
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,940
of a philosophical question,
what's the

70
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,100
true value of anything?

71
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,870
And the best thing that we as
humans have been to be able to

72
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,290
come up with is a market.

73
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,080
The market value tends to be the
best representation of the

74
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,670
true value of something.

75
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,630
Let's say the true value of this
is $1 billion or less,

76
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,630
then we have a situation.

77
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,800
For example, if these are worth
nothing, then we only

78
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,050
have $3 billion of assets, $4
billion of liabilities, we

79
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,510
have negative equity.

80
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,790
This company is worth nothing.

81
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,220
And to lend this bank or this
company any money would just

82
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,870
be throwing good money
after bad.

83
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,600
Because that money is just going
to go into a black hole.

84
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,050
Because one of the people who
this company owes money to is

85
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,730
probably not going to
see their money.

86
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,260
And if you are the most junior
person lending the money--

87
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,700
which means that when all the
money is distributed if they

88
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,350
go into bankruptcy, you're the
last person to see the money--

89
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,780
then you're just throwing
good money after bad.

90
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,920
So that's the issue.

91
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,890
But I want you to see
the big picture now.

92
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,870
Because if it was just an
issue with one bank it

93
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,740
wouldn't be a big deal.

94
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,400
If it was just Bear Stearns
or if it was just Lehman

95
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,210
Brothers, not a big
deal, let the

96
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,960
greedy bankers go bankrupt.

97
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,510
And they probably are doing
just fine with the bonuses

98
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,320
they've collected after sourcing
these CDOs for the

99
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,020
past eight years or five
years or however long.

100
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,130
But what I want to show you in
this video is what people are

101
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,730
talking about when they
say systemic risk.

102
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:16,149
So these $4 billion in
liabilities, these are loans,

103
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:17,300
maybe from other banks.

104
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,690
In fact, probably from
other banks.

105
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:23,340
And those loans from other
banks, those are assets of

106
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:23,850
other banks.

107
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:29,800
For example, let's say this
is Bank A, this is Bank B.

108
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,156
Maybe a billion of these
are a loan from bank B.

109
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:36,290
   

110
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,180
And if this is a loan from Bank
B, Bank B would have an

111
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,660
asset called loan to Bank A.

112
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,850
On Bank B's balance sheet
we're calling this a

113
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,160
loan to Bank A.

114
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,500
This is one of its assets.

115
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,380
And then one of its liabilities
will be a loan

116
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,730
from Bank B.

117
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,050
So how can I say this?

118
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:57,310
They took this money and
they gave it to B.

119
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,680
I'm sorry, B had money, gave it
to A in the form of a loan.

120
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,590
And so that cash
ended up here.

121
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:07,555
And they got an asset called
loan to Bank A.

122
00:05:07,555 --> 00:05:09,840
And this is a liability,
loan from Bank B.

123
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,845
And they might have taken that
money and they might have lent

124
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:16,720
it to Bank C down here.

125
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,970
I think you're starting to see
how this gets pretty hairy

126
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,075
very fast. So let's say that
Bank A, one of its $3 billion

127
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:32,990
in assets, is a loan
to Bank C.

128
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:37,180
   

129
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:42,020
And so on Bank C's balance
sheet, it'll say

130
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,640
loan from Bank A.

131
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,320
Or so we owe A $1 billion.

132
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,120
And A says, C owes me $1
billion, and that's all fine.

133
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,370
And then you see that oh,
we owe B $1 billion.

134
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,550
And then we could
keep doing this.

135
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,030
Or I could just even make this
into a circle already.

136
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,850
So maybe Bank B has some money
that it owes to someone else.

137
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,220
And let's say that someone else,
just for fun, just to

138
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:08,240
make this interesting-- I think
you can extrapolate and

139
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,230
think about how this gets
complicated very fast. Bank B

140
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,880
has borrowed money
from Bank C.

141
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,600
So Bank C will have an asset
here that says, no I lent

142
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,850
money to Bank B.

143
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:22,430
   

144
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,620
Fair enough.

145
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,020
OK, so now we're in an
interesting situation.

146
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:31,060
Let's say this loan, the
loan from Bank B to

147
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,330
Bank A comes due.

148
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,723
And we've studied this
multiple times.

149
00:06:34,723 --> 00:06:39,270
   

150
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,180
And let's say for whatever
reason, all of these other

151
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,850
loans, they're not liquid.

152
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,270
They're not due yet.

153
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,315
So Bank A can't get rid
of these loans.

154
00:06:47,315 --> 00:06:51,700
   

155
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,910
So let's say this comes due,
this is $4 billion.

156
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,690
They can't sell any of this.

157
00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:01,160
So Bank A has to come up with $1
billion somehow for Bank B.

158
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,410
So that's the situation
we're dealing with.

159
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,110
I'm just going to say
that they can't sell

160
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,060
any of these assets.

161
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,280
So it all comes down
to the CDOs.

162
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,350
So there's a couple
of issues here.

163
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,760
If you think it is just an issue
of illiquidity, if these

164
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,010
are $2 billion of assets,
they're really worth $2

165
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,530
billion, but Bank A just
can't sell them.

166
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,280
Because either there's
quote-unquote

167
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,390
nobody willing to buy.

168
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,940
Although, I would argue if
no-one is willing to buy

169
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,950
something, then its true
value is probably zero.

170
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,220
But let's just say Bank A says
no-one is willing to buy,

171
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,460
we're just illiquid, this is
really worth $2 billion.

172
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,280
So one situation is they could
get a loan from someone.

173
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,460
Maybe the Fed would be willing
to take this as collateral.

174
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,140
So they would give this as
collateral to the Fed.

175
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,230
Maybe the Fed will give them
a billion dollar loan.

176
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:43,260
And then they can use
that to pay Bank B.

177
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:47,950
Let's say that's off the table
because this is just smelly

178
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,100
enough collateral that not even
the Fed, which we now

179
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,960
realize is willing to do
anything to support the

180
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,970
markets, not even the Fed is
willing to give them a loan.

181
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,520
Or enough of a loan to
pay off that loan.

182
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,080
The other situation is maybe
they can get an equity

183
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,890
infusion from a sovereign
wealth fund.

184
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,670
And we covered that a couple
of videos ago.

185
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,960
Where the sovereign
wealth fund will

186
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,900
essentially inject some cash.

187
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,400
It'll dilute the shares and then
you know maybe we had 500

188
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,370
million shares before.

189
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,830
Now we'll have 2
billion shares.

190
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:17,110
So the sovereign wealth fund
will take over roughly 80% of

191
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,810
the company.

192
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:20,260
And in exchange for 80% of the
company, would give maybe $2

193
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:23,740
billion and then you could use
that to pay off this loan.

194
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,160
But let's say that that's not
on the table anymore either.

195
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,530
Because the sovereign
wealth funds have

196
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:31,040
gotten burned so much.

197
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,990
So what happens?

198
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,010
Well we learned what happens.

199
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:37,020
If you can't get a loan, a new
loan, to replace this loan, or

200
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,220
if you can't get an equity
infusion from kind of a

201
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,799
greater fool, what happens?

202
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,470
You go into bankruptcy.

203
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:45,300
And this is what happened
to Lehman Brothers.

204
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,540
Lehman Brothers went
into bankruptcy.

205
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,010
No sovereign wealth fund, no one
else bought the company.

206
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:49,810
And I should probably
do another

207
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,260
video on that scenario.

208
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,330
And they couldn't get a loan.

209
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,410
So they went bankrupt.

210
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,210
I should call this Company
L actually.

211
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,440
But I'll call it Company
A for now.

212
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,810
Because I don't want
to impugn anyone.

213
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,040
I actually don't think Lehman
was any worse or better than

214
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,350
any of the other players here.

215
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,710
So when they go into bankruptcy,
something very

216
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,400
interesting happens.

217
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,150
Now, Bank B, they were already
worried about these CDOs.

218
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,660
These CDOs were already
an issue.

219
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,320
And they were probably thinking,
boy when when Loan C

220
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,990
comes due, I'm going
to be in trouble.

221
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,020
Or when Loan D, or F, or
whatever, I'm going to be in

222
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,280
trouble because I'm going to be
in that situation that I'm

223
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,620
essentially forcing Bank
A into right now.

224
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,760
But now I have a new problem.

225
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,320
This loan to Bank A isn't
getting paid off.

226
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,840
   

227
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,320
And who knows?

228
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,640
Bank A is going to go
into bankruptcy.

229
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,470
Maybe in bankruptcy we realize
that these are worth nothing.

230
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:48,930
And if those are worth nothing,
then maybe I'm very

231
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,580
junior in seniority in terms of
where my loan is and maybe

232
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,080
I get nothing.

233
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,840
Or I get a few pennies
on the dollar here.

234
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,280
So maybe I thought this was $1
billion and I have to write

235
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,160
this down to $0.5 billion.

236
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,620
So now I have two problems. I
have this and I have this.

237
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,630
And once again, this is
a non liquid loan.

238
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,470
Bank A is in bankruptcy.

239
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,840
And if I wanted to somehow get
the value of this I have to

240
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,890
wait for all of Bank A's assets
to go into liquidation.

241
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,620
And then whatever assets I get
I would have to sell it.

242
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,020
So this is kind of
a frozen asset.

243
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,380
So once again, I'm stuck holding
this non liquid asset.

244
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,450
So now I have this non liquid
asset that's probably not

245
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,890
worth what I thought it was,
which was a loan to A.

246
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,640
Then I also have these CDOs.

247
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:35,050
And now, God forbid, let's
say that I had another

248
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:38,750
loan to Bank D.

249
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,510
And now let's say Bank
D goes bankrupt.

250
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,190
And then I have another
loan that's bad on

251
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,070
top of these CDOs.

252
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,390
But the CDOs were the
crux of the issue.

253
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,770
That's what caused
the situation.

254
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:51,400
If Bank A could have only sold
this CDO for $2 billion, it

255
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,240
wouldn't have caused this
chain reaction.

256
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,910
And Lehman Brothers really was
the thing that catalyzed this

257
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,700
whole chain of events.

258
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,690
And then you can imagine now
Bank C is worried because now

259
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,010
Bank B has all of these illiquid
assets on top of

260
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,790
these CDOs and it starts
to look bad.

261
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:12,110
And you can imagine, now it's
even less likely that when a

262
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:15,910
bank, let's say that Bank D is
the next one to go into a dire

263
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:18,900
situation, it's even less likely
that Bank D can get a

264
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,000
loan from a third bank.

265
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,340
Because all the banks are
getting scared now.

266
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,160
All the banks are saying,
I'm not going to

267
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,050
loan money to anyone.

268
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,970
If I can get any cash from
anybody I'm just

269
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:26,840
going to keep it.

270
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,260
So that when it's my turn, when
the market starts looking

271
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,230
at me, I at least have
a little cash.

272
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,800
So everyone is frozen.

273
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,150
Everyone wants to collect their
loans from everyone else

274
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:38,560
and no one wants to give
loans to anybody else.

275
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,300
So that's the situation
we're in.

276
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,320
And that's the difficulty
that the Fed is

277
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,160
somehow trying to unwind.

278
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,780
And I realized I'm out
of time again.

279
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:51,450
I will confront that issue
in the next video.

280
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:51,900
