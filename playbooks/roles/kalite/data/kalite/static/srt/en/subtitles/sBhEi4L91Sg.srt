1
00:00:00,677 --> 00:00:03,067
I would guess that you are reasonably familiar

2
00:00:03,067 --> 00:00:04,313
with linear scales.

3
00:00:04,313 --> 00:00:07,182
These are the scales that you would typically see in most of your math classes,

4
00:00:07,533 --> 00:00:10,933
and so just to make sure we know what we are talking about

5
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:12,800
and maybe thinking about in a slightly different way

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,467
let me draw a linear number line.

7
00:00:14,467 --> 00:00:16,200
Let me start with the zero

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,467
and what we are going to do is we are gonna say:

9
00:00:17,467 --> 00:00:19,467
look if I move this distance right over here

10
00:00:19,467 --> 00:00:23,867
and if I move that distance to the right, that's equivalent to adding 10

11
00:00:23,867 --> 00:00:27,800
so if you start at zero and you add 10, that will obviously get you a 10

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,400
If If you move that distance to the right again, you're gonna add 10 again

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,600
that will get you to 20

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,400
and obviously we could keep doing it and get to 30, 40, 50 so on and so forth

15
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,200
and also just looking at what we did here

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,215
if we go the other direction

17
00:00:41,215 --> 00:00:44,662
if we start here and move that same distance to the left

18
00:00:44,662 --> 00:00:46,200
we're clearly subtracting 10

19
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,200
10 minus 10 is equal to zero

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,800
so if we move that distance to the left again,

21
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,800
we would get to negative 10 and if we did it again we would get to negative 20

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,200
so the general idea is, however many times we move that distance

23
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,400
we are essentially adding or how many times we move that distance to the right

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,667
we are essentially adding that multiple of ten

25
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,867
if we move to it twice, we're adding 2 times 10

26
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:13,000
and that not only works for whole numbers, it would work for fractions as well

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,600
where would 5 be?

28
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,400
Well, to get to 5, we only have to multiply 10

29
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,000
or I guess one way to think about it is 10 or rather

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,733
one way to think about it is 5 is half of 10

31
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:25,800
and so if we want to only go half of ten

32
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,400
we only have to go half this distance

33
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,800
so if we go half this distance,

34
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,800
if we go half this distance

35
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,600
that will get us to one half times ten

36
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,467
In this case that would be five

37
00:01:36,467 --> 00:01:37,667
If we go the left

38
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:39,267
that would get us to negative five

39
00:01:39,267 --> 00:01:40,667
and there's nothing,

40
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,200
let me draw that a little bit more centered, negative five

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,800
and there's nothing really new here

42
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,200
we're just kinda thinking about it in a slightly novel way that's going to be useful

43
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,600
when we start thinking about logarithm

44
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,800
but this is just the number line that you've always known

45
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,200
if we want to put one here, we'd move one tenth of the distance

46
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,600
cause one is one tenth of ten

47
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,267
So this would be 1,2,3,4

48
00:01:58,267 --> 00:01:59,067
I could just put

49
00:01:59,067 --> 00:01:59,800
I could

50
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,067
I could label frankly any, any number right over here

51
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:04,667
Now this was the situation when we add 10 or subtract 10

52
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:10,800
but it's completely legitimate to have an alternate way of thinking of what you do when you move this distance

53
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,885
and let's think about that

54
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,467
so let's say i have another line over here

55
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,000
and you might guess this is going to be the logarithmic number line

56
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,800
we give ourselves some space

57
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,600
and let's start this logarithmic number line at 1

58
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,400
and I'll let you think about, after this video, why I didn't start it at zero

59
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,333
and if you start at 1

60
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:29,733
and instead of moving that

61
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:32,133
so I'm still going to define that same distance

62
00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:33,333
that same distance

63
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,000
it's gonna be a little smaller

64
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
i'm still gonna to define that same distance

65
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,200
but instead of saying that that same distance is adding 10

66
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,200
when I move to the right

67
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,933
I'm gonna say when I move to the right

68
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:44,600
that distance when I move to the right on this new number line that I've created

69
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,733
that is the same thing as multiplying by 10

70
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:49,533
so if I move that distance

71
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:50,333
I start at 1

72
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:51,333
I multiply by 10

73
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,333
that gets me to

74
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,333
that gets me to 10!

75
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,133
and then if I multiply by 10 again

76
00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:57,867
if i multiply by 10 again

77
00:02:57,867 --> 00:02:59,013
If I move by that distance again,

78
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:00,282
I'm multiplying by 10 again

79
00:03:00,282 --> 00:03:01,921
and so that would get me to 100

80
00:03:01,921 --> 00:03:04,729
and I think you can already see the difference that's happening

81
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:07,175
and what about moving to the left that distance?

82
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,800
Well we already kind have said what happens

83
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,200
cause if start here

84
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,331
we start at a 100

85
00:03:12,331 --> 00:03:13,431
and move to the left by that distance

86
00:03:13,431 --> 00:03:14,759
What happens?

87
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:17,000
Well, I divided by 10

88
00:03:17,005 --> 00:03:19,708
100 divide by 10 gets me 10

89
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,069
10 divided by 10 gives me 1

90
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:24,933
and so if I move that distance to the left again

91
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:27,000
I'll divide by 10 again

92
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,656
that will get me to

93
00:03:28,656 --> 00:03:30,333
one tenth

94
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,133
and if I move that distance to the left again

95
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:38,400
that will get me to one over a hundred

96
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,933
and so the general idea is

97
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:42,800
is however many times I move that distance to the right

98
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,200
I'm multiplying my starting point by 10 that many times

99
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,538
and so for example

100
00:03:50,538 --> 00:03:52,867
when I move that distance twice

101
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:55,333
so this whole distance right over here

102
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,067
I went that distance twice

103
00:03:57,067 --> 00:03:59,733
so this is times 10 times 10

104
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:03,867
which is the same thing as times 10 to the second power

105
00:04:03,867 --> 00:04:06,800
and so really, i'm raising 10

106
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,267
I'm multiplying it, times 10 to whatever power however many times i'm jumping to the right

107
00:04:12,267 --> 00:04:13,267
Same thing

108
00:04:13,267 --> 00:04:17,944
If I go to the left that distance twice

109
00:04:17,944 --> 00:04:20,133
Let me do that in a new colour

110
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:22,933
If I go to the left that distance twice

111
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:26,267
this will be the same thing as dividing by 10 twice

112
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:28,467
dividing by 10, dividing by 10

113
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:31,667
which is the same thing as multiplying by,

114
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:32,933
well one way to think of it

115
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:35,933
1/10²

116
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:37,800
or dividing by 10²

117
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,467
is another way of thinking about it

118
00:04:39,467 --> 00:04:41,067
and so that might make a little

119
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:41,667
you know

120
00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:42,667
that might be, hopefully, a little bit intuitive

121
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:44,667
and you can already see why this is valuable

122
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:46,667
we can already, on this number line,

123
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:49,267
plot a much broader spectrum of things

124
00:04:49,267 --> 00:04:50,800
than we can on this number line

125
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,067
we can go all the way up to a 100

126
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:54,067
and then we even get some nice granularity

127
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:56,000
if we want to go down to one tenth and one hundredth

128
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,131
here we don't get the granularity at small scales

129
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,333
and we also don't get to go to really large numbers

130
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,200
and if we go a little distance more

131
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,200
we get to 1000 and then we get to 10000 so on and so forth

132
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,400
so we can really cover a much broader spectrum on this line right over here

133
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,000
but what's also neat about this

134
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
is that when you move a fixed distance

135
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,867
so when you move a fixed distance on this linear number line

136
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:20,133
you are adding or subtracting that amount

137
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:23,533
so if you move that fixed distance you are adding to, to the right

138
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:25,333
if yo go to the left you're subtracting to

139
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:28,333
when you do the same thing on a logarithmic number line

140
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,867
and this is true of any logarithmic number line

141
00:05:29,867 --> 00:05:32,333
you will be scaling by a fixed factor

142
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,933
and one way to think about what that fixed factor is

143
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:37,800
is this idea of exponents

144
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
so if you wanted to say

145
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,800
Where would 2 sit on this number line?

146
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,400
Then you would just think to yourself

147
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,800
well if i asked myself, where does 100 sit on that number line?

148
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,400
and actually, that might be a better place to start

149
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,000
if i said, If I hadn't already plot it

150
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,333
Where does 100 sit on that number line?

151
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:57,533
I'd say, how many times do I have to multiply 10 by itself to get 100?

152
00:05:57,533 --> 00:06:00,400
and that's how many times I need to move this distance

153
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,933
and so essentially I would be asking

154
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:05,800
10 to the what power is equal to 100

155
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,200
and then I would get that 'question mark' is equal to 2

156
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,200
and then I would move that many spaces to plot my 100

157
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,667
another way of stating this exact same thing is

158
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:18,000
log base 10 of 100 is equal to 'question mark'

159
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,667
and this 'question mark' is clearly equal to 2

160
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:26,000
and that says I need to plot 100 to 2 of this distance to the right

161
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,595
and to figure out where would I plot the 2 I would do the same exact same thing

162
00:06:29,595 --> 00:06:30,318
I would say

163
00:06:30,318 --> 00:06:36,000
10 to what power is equal to 2?

164
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,667
or log base 10 of 2 is equal to what?

165
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,969
and we can get the trusty calculator out

166
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:46,462
and we can just say log

167
00:06:46,462 --> 00:06:49,600
and on most calculators it's just a log without the base specified

168
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,733
they're assuming base 10

169
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:55,600
so log of 2 is equal to roughly 0.3

170
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,200
0.301

171
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,533
so this is equal to 0.301

172
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:03,133
so what this tells us is

173
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:06,733
we need to move this fraction of this distance to get to 2

174
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:07,846
If we move this whole distance

175
00:07:07,846 --> 00:07:10,533
it's like multiplying 10 times 10 to the first power

176
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:15,667
but since we only get 10 to the 0.301 power, we only want to do 0.301 of this distance

177
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:17,667
so it's going to be roughly a third of this

178
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:19,267
so let me

179
00:07:19,267 --> 00:07:20,267
it's going to be roughly

180
00:07:20,267 --> 00:07:22,133
actually a little less than a third

181
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:23,333
0.3 not 0.33

182
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,467
so 2 is going to sit

183
00:07:24,467 --> 00:07:25,800
2 is going to

184
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,333
let me do it a little more to the right

185
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,467
so 2 is going to sit right over here

186
00:07:29,467 --> 00:07:31,133
now what's really cool about it is

187
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:33,800
this distance in general, on this logarithmic number line

188
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,308
means multiplying by 2

189
00:07:37,308 --> 00:07:40,267
and so if you go that same distance again

190
00:07:40,267 --> 00:07:41,467
you're gonna get to 4

191
00:07:41,467 --> 00:07:45,267
if you multiply that same distance again, you're going to multiply by 4

192
00:07:45,267 --> 00:07:49,933
and if you go that same distance again, you are going to get to 8

193
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:51,000
and so if you said well

194
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,600
Where would I plot 5 on this number line?

195
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,800
Well there's a couple of ways to do it.

196
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,200
You could really figure out what the base 10 logarithm of 5 is

197
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,200
and figure out where it goes on the number line

198
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,733
or you could say look!

199
00:08:04,733 --> 00:08:08,595
If I start at 10

200
00:08:08,595 --> 00:08:10,533
and if I move this distance to the left

201
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:12,533
I'm going to be dividing by 2

202
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:16,467
so if I move this distance to the left I will be dividing by 2

203
00:08:16,467 --> 00:08:18,133
I know it's getting a little bit messy here

204
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:20,867
i'll maybe do another video where we learn how to draw a clean version of this

205
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:24,733
so if I start at 10 and then go that same distance I'm dividing by 2

206
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:27,733
and so this right here would be

207
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:30,333
that right over there would be 5

208
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,733
Now the next question you say

209
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:33,067
Where do I plot 3?

210
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:34,733
Well we can do the exact same thing that we did with 2

211
00:08:34,733 --> 00:08:37,302
we ask ourselves

212
00:08:37,302 --> 00:08:41,569
what power do we have to raise 10 to, to get to 3

213
00:08:41,569 --> 00:08:42,800
and to get that

214
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,200
we once again get our calculator out

215
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,667
log base 10 of 3 is equal to 0.477

216
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:50,667
so it's almost halfway

217
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:53,267
so it's almost going to be half of this distance

218
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:56,867
so half of that distance is gonna look something like right over there

219
00:08:56,867 --> 00:09:00,600
so 3 is going to go right over here

220
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,267
and you could do the logarithm

221
00:09:02,267 --> 00:09:04,000
let's see we're missing 6, 7 and 8

222
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,067
oh we have 8

223
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:05,800
we're missing 9

224
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,000
so then to get 9, we just have to mutiply by 3 again

225
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,267
so this is 3

226
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:12,000
and if we go that same distance

227
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,400
we multiply by 3 again

228
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,200
9 is gonna be squeezed in right over here

229
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,267
9 is gonna be squeezed in right over there

230
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:19,800
and if we wanna get to 6

231
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,067
we just have to multiply by 2

232
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:24,067
and we already know the distance to multiply by 2

233
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:26,467
it's this thing right over here

234
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:28,400
so you multiply that by 2

235
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,200
you do that same distance and you're gonna get to 6

236
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,667
and if you wanted to figure out where 7 is

237
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:39,323
once again you could take the log

238
00:09:39,323 --> 00:09:40,792
let me do it right over here

239
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:43,267
so you take the log of 7

240
00:09:43,267 --> 00:09:46,200
it is going to be roughly 0.85

241
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,267
so 7 is just going to be squeezed in

242
00:09:48,267 --> 00:09:51,067
roughly right over there

243
00:09:51,067 --> 00:09:53,400
so a couple of neat things you already appreciated

244
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,667
one, we can fit more on this logarithmic scale

245
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:59,800
and, as i did with the video with Vi Hart

246
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,667
where she talked about how we perceive many things with logarithmic scales

247
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:06,800
so that is actually a good way to even understand some of human perception

248
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,333
but the other really cool thing is when we move a fixed distance on this logarithmic scale

249
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:13,200
we are multiplying by a fixed constant

250
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,933
now the one kind of strange thing about this and you might have already noticed here

251
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:20,600
is that we don't see the numbers lined up the way we normally see them

252
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,333
there is a big jump from 1 to 2

253
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,200
then a smaller jump from 3 to 4

254
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,600
then a smaller jump from that from 3 to 4

255
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,333
then even smaller from 4 to 5

256
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,533
then even smaller from 5 to 6

257
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:30,600
and then 7, 8, 9

258
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,133
7 is gonna be right in there

259
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:33,400
it gets squeezed squeezed squeezed in

260
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,600
tighter and tighter and tighter

261
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,533
and then you get 10

262
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:36,933
and then you get another big jump

263
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:40,600
because once again if you wanna get to 20, you just have to multiply by 2

264
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,333
you just have to multiply by 2 again

265
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,800
so this distance again gets us to 20

266
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,800
if you go this distance over here that will get you to 30

267
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,667
cause you're multiplying by 3

268
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:54,800
so this right over here is our times 3 distance

269
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,600
so if you do that again, if you do that distance

270
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,800
then that gets you to 30

271
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,000
you're multiplying by 3

272
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,933
and then you could plot the whole same thing over here again

273
00:11:03,933 --> 00:11:07,400
but hopefully this gives you a little bit more intuition of why logarithmic number lines

274
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:07,908
look the way they do

275
00:11:07,908 --> 00:11:10,200
or why logarithmic scale looks the way it does

276
00:11:10,200 --> 99:59:59,999
and also it gives you a little bit of appreciation for why they might be useful.
