1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,790
Welcome back. I keep rushing to try to get under the wire

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,300
for these problems, but let me explain it properly.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,980
So what we did is, we said that a new student joins.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,640
And the average after he joins is equal to the median.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,910
And what we did is we figured out,

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,400
what's the average and the median before the student joins.

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,960
Well, the average before the student joined was 13/12,

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,470
and the median before the student joined was 1.

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:31,240
If the new student has 1 or 0--and we established that

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,240
the only way to bring this average down

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,870
is for the new student to have

12
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:41,680
less than the average number of siblings, right?

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,630
That's the only way we can go from 1 1/12 to 1.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,610
And I'll tell you right now that

15
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,810
he's actually going to have a 1/13 impact, right,

16
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:53,990
if he's 1 away.

17
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,210
So actually I can tell you right now he has one sibling,

18
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,560
but I'll show it to you mathematically

19
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,290
if you don't have that intuition on averages.

20
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,770
But the important thing to realize

21
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,650
is that he's either going to have 0 or 1 sibling.

22
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,040
He's going to have to have less than 1 1/12 siblings,

23
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,320
so it's either 0 or 1 in order to bring the average down.

24
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,990
And regardless of whether he has 0 or 1 sibling,

25
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,390
the median won't change.

26
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,280
If he has one sibling,

27
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,030
then we're just going to have another one here

28
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,720
and then this'll become the median.

29
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,090
If he has 0 siblings, then that's going to be a 0 there,

30
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,640
but that's still going to be a median of 1.

31
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,320
The median is not going to change.

32
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,540
So what we have to do is to figure out

33
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,280
how many siblings does he have to have

34
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,270
for the new average to be exactly 1?

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,500
So we can go back to this calculation.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,900
Let's take the average, but now let's take it with him.

37
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,670
So this was our previous average where we said well,

38
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,540
there's three students with 0 siblings,

39
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,370
six students with 1, et cetera, et cetera.

40
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,690
But now we're going to add this new student in.

41
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,290
There's one student with x siblings, right?

42
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,780
And instead of 12 in the denominator, we have 13.

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,710
Because we now have 13 students, right?

44
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,070
So what happens? You essentially have 13,

45
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:09,070
so this becomes x plus 6 plus 4 plus 3.

46
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,010
This becomes 13 plus x,

47
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,200
and then the denominator is equal to 13.

48
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,990
And actually I was wrong before,

49
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,630
he's actually going to have to have 0,

50
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,710
my intuition was a little bit off.

51
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:25,060
Because look, this is the new average, 13 plus x over 13.

52
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,830
The new average is going to be 13 plus x over 13, right?

53
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,520
13 plus x over 13.

54
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,450
And what does that new average have to equal?

55
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,660
It has to equal 1.

56
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,750
Because that's the new median.

57
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,050
Or the old median, because we said the mean doesn't change.

58
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,870
So how can 13 plus x over 13 equal 1?

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,150
Well, if you can't eyeball that,you can just say 13 plus x,

60
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,020
multiply both sides by 13, is equal to 13.

61
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,920
And then subtract 13 from both sides

62
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,250
and you get x is equal to 0.

63
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,110
So that new student has 0 siblings.

64
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,260
I know that was a little bit convoluted,

65
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,440
so let me just tell you what I did again.

66
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,570
I said what is the current median?

67
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,100
And I just listed out all of the number of siblings,

68
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,500
and I took the middle number,and that was 1.

69
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,390
Then I said well, what is the current average?

70
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,330
And the current average was 1 1/12.

71
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,200
And this might confuse you a little bit.

72
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,040
You could just say, well this is the same thing as 0,

73
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:35,470
0 plus 0 plus 0 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1

74
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:38,390
and so forth. Instead I said that's three students with 0,

75
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,560
six students with 1 sibling,

76
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,330
two students with 2 siblings, and so forth.

77
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,320
And I figured out that the current average--

78
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,710
and I divided by 12-- was 1 1/12.

79
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,200
So I said well,

80
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,360
no matter how many siblings the next student has--

81
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,320
and actually, it didn't even matter,

82
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,970
even if you had more or less,

83
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,490
one of the middle numbers still would have been the 1.

84
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,730
So the median will not change regardless of

85
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,720
where the new student falls into the mix.

86
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,430
So we said, how many siblings does that student need to have

87
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,780
for the average to come down back to 1?

88
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,200
And then I just added x to my previous average

89
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,500
and I divided by 13 instead

90
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,990
because we now have an extra student.

91
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,670
This was a 13 too.

92
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:16,980
And we got this equation:

93
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,230
13 plus x over 13 has to equal my new average, which is 1.

94
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,900
And then I solved for x, which is 0.

95
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,080
So the new student had 0 siblings.

96
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,040
Next problem.

97
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,590
And the really fast way of doing this--

98
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,710
not to harp on this problem too much,

99
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,910
and I should have done this from the beginning--

100
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,730
is to figure out that the median is 1,

101
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,240
then figure out that

102
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,520
it doesn't matter how many siblings the student has,

103
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,800
the median's still going to be 1.

104
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,730
You can insert a number anywhere in this list

105
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,570
and the median would have still been 1

106
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,520
because there's so many students with one sibling.

107
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,440
And then you just have to figure out,

108
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,370
well, how many siblings does the student have to have

109
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,540
for the average to become 1?

110
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,920
That's probably the most convoluted explanation I've given,

111
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,920
but let me just hope it helps you.

112
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,830
OK, problem number 9.

113
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:16,500
If 2 times x minus 3 is equal to 8,

114
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:24,130
what does x minus 3 over x plus 3 equal?

115
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,760
What does that equal?

116
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,510
Well, let's just solve for x.

117
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,930
So we get x minus 3

118
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,500
is equal to-- I'm just going to divide both sides by 2,

119
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,800
so 8 divided by 2 is 4, right?

120
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,510
2 divided by 2 is 1, so x minus 3 equals 4,

121
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:45,610
x is equal to 7. So you go here. What's x minus 3?

122
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,780
Well it's 7 minus 3, which is 4.

123
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,900
We also figured out that x minus 3 was 4 up here.

124
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,050
And then what's x plus 3?

125
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,390
That's 7 plus 3, so that's 10.

126
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:59,270
4/10, we can reduce that to 2/5,

127
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,630
dividing the numerator and the denominator by 2.

128
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,480
So that's our answer,2/5 or 0.4.

129
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,160
Problem 10.

130
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,310
When twice a number-- so whenever I start writing it,

131
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,180
let's say x is the number.

132
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,620
So they say when twice an number-- so when 2 times x,

133
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,530
that's twice a number-- is decreased by 3.

134
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:25,540
So, twice a number is decreased by 3, the result is 253.

135
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,090
What is the number? Well, while reading it, I set it up.

136
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,700
So now we just have to solve. So we add 3 to both sides.

137
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:40,390
2x is equal to 256, right? I added 3 to both sides.

138
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:45,560
x, divide both sides by 2. x is equal to 128.

139
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:46,930
And we are done.

140
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:54,270
Next problem. Problem 10.

141
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,590
OK, this says Outdoor Sneaker Company's July production.

142
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,420
So we have white, black,and then total.

143
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:10,620
And then they have high-tops,low-tops, and then total.

144
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,350
I don't know if people even wear high-tops anymore.

145
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,140
I used to. I guess for basketball.

146
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:24,390
OK, high-tops, low-tops,and total. I'm very not plugged-in.

147
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,600
High-tops, low-tops,and then total.

148
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,620
And what numbers do they have in the box?

149
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:49,010
So there are 3,600 here, 1,500 here, 5,500, and then 10,000.

150
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,190
So I could tell you they're just going to reading this question,

151
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,520
want us to fill in this diagram.

152
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,750
10,000 here.

153
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,900
Outdoor Sneaker Company manufactures only white

154
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,120
sneakers and black sneakers, both of which

155
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,800
are available as either high-tops or low-tops.

156
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,330
On the basis of the information in the table above,

157
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:11,780
how many black sneakers did Outdoor Sneaker Company

158
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,130
manufacture in July?

159
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,200
So how many black sneakers--

160
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,140
so they didn't differentiate with the high-tops or low-tops-

161
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,440
so they want to know, how many total black sneakers.

162
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,930
So that is black total.

163
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,410
So we need to figure out this square.

164
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,590
Total black. So let's see what we can figure out.

165
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,540
I'll do my figuring out in this magenta.

166
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,190
So if low-tops-- I need a total of 5,500 low-tops--

167
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,320
1,500 are black, how many are white?

168
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,340
Well, it's going to be 4,000,

169
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,960
right? I just took 5,500 minus 1,500. 4,000.

170
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,720
Similarly,

171
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,850
if I made a total of 10,000 sneakers and 5,500 are low-tops,

172
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,500
how many of them are high-tops?

173
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,410
Well, it's going to be 10,000 minus 5,500, so this is 4,500.

174
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,570
And out of the high-tops,

175
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:06,340
if 3,600 are white and I made a total of 4,500,

176
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,890
how many black are there?

177
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,840
Well, 4,500 total minus the white ones, that's what?

178
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,990
That's 900.

179
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,510
And so if we want to figure out the total black,

180
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,140
we now know how many high-top blacks there are

181
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,090
and how many low-top black sneakers there are,

182
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:25,390
so we just add. So 900 plus 1,500 is 2,400.

183
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:28,580
So I actually wasted both of our times figuring this out,

184
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,510
so I could have saved a few seconds I didn't do that.

185
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,230
But I was just mindlessly chugging along.

186
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,460
Anyway, I'll see you in the next video.
