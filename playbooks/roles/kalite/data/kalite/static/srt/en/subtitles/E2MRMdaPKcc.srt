99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's now attempt to apply Stokes' theorem

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so over here we have this little diagram, and we have this path

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that we're calling C, and it's the intersection of the plain Y+Z=2, so that's the plain that

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
kind of slants down like that, its the intersection of that plain

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the cylinder, you know I shouldn't even call it a cylinder

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because if you just have x^2 plus y^2 is equal to one, it would essentially be like a pole,

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
an infinite pole that keeps going up forever and keeps going down forever

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so it would never have a top or a bottom

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but we slice that pole, with y plus z is equal to 2, to get where they intersect

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we get our path C. We also have this vector field defined in this way
