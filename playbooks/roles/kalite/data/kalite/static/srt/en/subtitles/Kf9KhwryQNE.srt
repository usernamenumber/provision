1
00:00:00,636 --> 00:00:03,319
What I wanna do in this video is think about a concept

2
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:05,644
that we've already thought about multiple times

3
00:00:05,644 --> 00:00:07,471
in the context of many many videos

4
00:00:07,471 --> 00:00:10,980
and this is the idea of utility

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,577
which is really just a way of saying

6
00:00:12,577 --> 00:00:18,225
how much benefit, or satisfaction, or value

7
00:00:18,225 --> 00:00:21,410
do you get out getting a good or service

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,693
but the angle that we're gonna take in this video

9
00:00:23,693 --> 00:00:25,227
is gonna be slightly different

10
00:00:25,227 --> 00:00:28,456
in the past when we were measuring benefit or value

11
00:00:28,456 --> 00:00:30,852
we either measured in term of dollars

12
00:00:30,852 --> 00:00:31,973
or we said hey

13
00:00:31,973 --> 00:00:35,337
the benefit of getting an incremental Honda Civic

14
00:00:35,337 --> 00:00:36,652
was 5,000 dollars

15
00:00:36,652 --> 00:00:38,046
and when we're talking about incremental

16
00:00:38,046 --> 00:00:41,860
we're talking about the marginal benefit

17
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,674
or early on, when we talked about

18
00:00:43,674 --> 00:00:46,101
the production possibilities frontier

19
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:48,357
and when we talked about the marginal benefit

20
00:00:48,357 --> 00:00:49,597
of getting another squirel

21
00:00:49,597 --> 00:00:51,175
we were talking about it in terms of berries

22
00:00:51,175 --> 00:00:54,585
we were talking in terms of another good or service

23
00:00:54,585 --> 00:00:56,264
but what we're gonna do in this video

24
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,310
is just think about it in absolute terms

25
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,710
we're just gonna think of some arbitrary way

26
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,060
of measuring utility

27
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,254
and then just assign values to

28
00:01:04,254 --> 00:01:07,277
what's the value of getting one chocolate bar

29
00:01:07,277 --> 00:01:08,434
and then what's the value that we give

30
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:10,798
to the next chocolate bar and chocolate bar after that

31
00:01:10,798 --> 00:01:13,190
we're gonna do the same things about fruit

32
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,584
and from that we're gonna see

33
00:01:14,584 --> 00:01:16,623
if we can kind of built up some the things

34
00:01:16,623 --> 00:01:19,021
that we already know about demand curves

35
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:20,831
and how things relate to price

36
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,472
and the price of other goods and things like that

37
00:01:23,472 --> 00:01:31,046
and in particular we're gonna focus on marginal utility

38
00:01:31,046 --> 00:01:33,937
so obviously you could have total utility

39
00:01:33,937 --> 00:01:37,257
if I have four chocolate bars you could say that

40
00:01:37,257 --> 00:01:39,634
the total utility I am getting from all four of them

41
00:01:39,634 --> 00:01:41,548
or you can think of the marginal utility

42
00:01:41,548 --> 00:01:42,619
the utility I am getting

43
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:45,341
from the next incremental chocolate bar

44
00:01:45,341 --> 00:01:48,595
or the next incremental pound of food

45
00:01:48,595 --> 00:01:50,355
and before I move on there's one thing

46
00:01:50,355 --> 00:01:52,052
this was a point of confusion for me

47
00:01:52,052 --> 00:01:53,272
when I first learned this

48
00:01:53,272 --> 00:01:55,777
ok I am using the word marginal utility now

49
00:01:55,777 --> 00:02:00,624
-in the past I've used the word marginal benefit-

50
00:02:00,624 --> 00:02:02,400
they sound very similar

51
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,589
in fact I even used the word benefit

52
00:02:04,589 --> 00:02:06,720
when I defined marginal utility

53
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,867
How are these things different?

54
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:10,432
And the simple answer is

55
00:02:10,432 --> 00:02:11,663
conceptually they aren't

56
00:02:11,663 --> 00:02:14,200
conceptually they are the exact same thing

57
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,209
though the difference is

58
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:18,321
how the words tend to be used

59
00:02:18,321 --> 00:02:21,200
in the context of traditional microeconomics class

60
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,852
so when people talk about utility

61
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,275
they tend to measure

62
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:27,979
in terms of some type of absolute measure

63
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:28,958
that they just came up with

64
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,472
some type of you could view it as utility units

65
00:02:31,472 --> 00:02:33,093
some type of satisfaction units

66
00:02:33,093 --> 00:02:35,460
while when they talk about marginal benefit

67
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,513
they tend to measure it

68
00:02:36,513 --> 00:02:38,756
either in dollars or in terms of some other goods

69
00:02:38,756 --> 00:02:41,533
but I've seen either term used either way

70
00:02:41,533 --> 00:02:44,800
so they really do mean the exact same thing

71
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,267
but in this video we're gonna use the term utility

72
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,600
and we're gonna come up with measuring scale

73
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,333
and it's somewhat arbitrary one

74
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,873
and we're gonna use that

75
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,816
to come up with some conclusions

76
00:02:54,816 --> 00:02:58,267
about the basket of goods someone might purchase

77
00:02:58,267 --> 00:03:00,500
depending on different prices

78
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,791
so as you can imagine, I prewrote these two things

79
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,470
we're gonna talk about chocolate bars

80
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:08,783
and we're gonna talk about fruit

81
00:03:08,783 --> 00:03:10,990
so right here in these little tables here

82
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:17,092
I've shown the marginal utility of each incremental bar

83
00:03:17,092 --> 00:03:20,733
and in case of fruit of each incremental pound of fruit

84
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:22,918
so this is saying that first chocolate bar

85
00:03:22,918 --> 00:03:24,667
obviously if I have no chocolate bars

86
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:26,836
I am getting no utility from chocolate bars

87
00:03:26,836 --> 00:03:28,675
and this is saying that the first chocolate bar

88
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,296
has a marginal utility

89
00:03:30,296 --> 00:03:33,585
so the utility of that next icnremental one is a hundred

90
00:03:33,585 --> 00:03:34,925
I'm not saying a hundred dollars

91
00:03:34,925 --> 00:03:35,780
I'm not saying

92
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,308
it's equivalent to a hundred pounds of fruit

93
00:03:37,308 --> 00:03:39,374
I'm not saying it's equivalent to a hundred berries

94
00:03:39,374 --> 00:03:42,533
I'm just saying arbitrarily saying it is a hundred

95
00:03:42,533 --> 00:03:44,173
and what matters is not that

96
00:03:44,173 --> 00:03:45,935
this is a hundred or thousand or million

97
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:48,733
what matters is how this compares to others things

98
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:50,067
so for example

99
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:52,933
if I would say that this is a hundred

100
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,657
and if I know that I like fruit

101
00:03:54,657 --> 00:03:57,875
a pound of fruit 20 percent more than that first

102
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,768
or if I like an incremental

103
00:03:59,768 --> 00:04:01,125
-my first pound of fruit-

104
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,435
20 percent more

105
00:04:02,435 --> 00:04:04,319
then I would have to say that the marginal utility

106
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,200
of my first pound of fruit is 120

107
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,368
and this is what we said right over here

108
00:04:09,368 --> 00:04:12,261
and if another way to think about it is

109
00:04:12,261 --> 00:04:16,226
if the marginal utility of the second chocolate bar I get

110
00:04:16,226 --> 00:04:18,651
because I've already enjoyed a little bit of chocolate bar

111
00:04:18,651 --> 00:04:20,090
and I am a little "chocolated" out

112
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,566
is 20 percent less than that

113
00:04:21,566 --> 00:04:24,008
then if this is a hundred that this would have to be 80

114
00:04:24,008 --> 00:04:25,578
I could have said this to be 1000

115
00:04:25,578 --> 00:04:26,602
and this to be 800

116
00:04:26,602 --> 00:04:27,800
and this to be 1200

117
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,394
I could have said this to be 10

118
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,443
and this to be 8

119
00:04:30,443 --> 00:04:31,541
and this to be 12

120
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:32,621
what matters is that

121
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:35,236
they really just have the same ratios between them

122
00:04:35,236 --> 00:04:38,533
that really do reflect much actual preferences

123
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:40,260
so let's just think about this a little bit

124
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,125
my first chocolate bar I am pretty excited

125
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,491
I just call it a hundred

126
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,679
the next chocolate bar

127
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:46,703
I am a little bit less excited about it

128
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,277
I've already had some chocolate

129
00:04:48,277 --> 00:04:50,059
my craving has been satiated to some degree

130
00:04:50,059 --> 00:04:52,333
but I still like chocolate so I'll call that an 80

131
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,529
we can call it 80 satisfaction units

132
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:55,769
whatever you wanna call it

133
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:57,266
then the next chocolate bar after this

134
00:04:57,266 --> 00:04:58,934
now I am starting to get pretty stuffed

135
00:04:58,934 --> 00:05:01,333
and I am really "chocolated" out

136
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,533
and so I am not getting as much benefit from it

137
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:05,644
and then finally if you give me another chocolate bar

138
00:05:05,644 --> 00:05:06,489
it's even less

139
00:05:06,489 --> 00:05:08,292
and if we were to list fifth chocolate bar

140
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:09,580
I might not want it at all

141
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,625
my marginal utility might go to zero

142
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:12,997
for that fifth chocolate bar

143
00:05:12,997 --> 00:05:14,575
maybe for that sixth chocolate bar

144
00:05:14,575 --> 00:05:16,366
I have to somehow get rid of it

145
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:17,938
I am so tired of chocolate bars

146
00:05:17,938 --> 00:05:20,183
maybe I have a negative marginal utility

147
00:05:20,183 --> 00:05:24,200
and we can think about the same thing with fruit

148
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,413
the first pound of fruit

149
00:05:26,413 --> 00:05:27,751
I am pretty excited about fruit

150
00:05:27,751 --> 00:05:29,219
I have a fruit craving

151
00:05:29,219 --> 00:05:31,050
I like that first pound of fruit

152
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,113
even more than that first chocolate bar

153
00:05:33,113 --> 00:05:34,933
I like it 20 percent more

154
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:37,671
so I get 120, you could call it utility points

155
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,785
or whatever arbitrary you want to call it

156
00:05:40,785 --> 00:05:42,640
then my next pound of fruit

157
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,118
once again, I am having diminishing utility

158
00:05:45,118 --> 00:05:46,231
diminishing benefit

159
00:05:46,231 --> 00:05:49,667
as I get more and more incremental pound of fruit

160
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:51,718
now, it's very important to realize

161
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,667
this is marginal utility

162
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:55,267
not total utility

163
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:58,874
this is the utility I am getting from each incremental pound

164
00:05:58,874 --> 00:06:00,176
it's positive

165
00:06:00,176 --> 00:06:03,059
so I am still enjoying that next incremental pound

166
00:06:03,059 --> 00:06:05,867
I am just enjoying it little bit less than the pound before

167
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:07,867
and to realize what total utility is

168
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,067
if I were to have to pounds of fruit

169
00:06:10,067 --> 00:06:15,185
I would get 120 of utility from that first pound

170
00:06:15,185 --> 00:06:17,600
and I would get a 100 from that second pound

171
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,933
and so you would say I had a total utility of 220 utility units

172
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:26,089
from both pounds

173
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:28,231
now with just the information that I've given here

174
00:06:28,231 --> 00:06:29,420
there are few things you could say

175
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,570
you could say well look

176
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,446
my first pound of fruit I enjoy more

177
00:06:33,446 --> 00:06:34,759
20 percent more

178
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:37,000
than my first chocolate bar

179
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,215
you could also say my second pound of fruit

180
00:06:39,215 --> 00:06:42,647
I derive about the same amount of value

181
00:06:42,647 --> 00:06:44,523
as my first chocolate bar

182
00:06:44,523 --> 00:06:46,307
you could say that my second chocolate bar

183
00:06:46,307 --> 00:06:48,340
I enjoy less than my first chocolate bar

184
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,267
you could even say 20 percent less

185
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:51,467
if these numbers are good

186
00:06:51,467 --> 00:06:53,323
but it still doesn't give you a lot of information

187
00:06:53,323 --> 00:06:54,872
about how you would actually spend your money

188
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:55,804
you might say

189
00:06:55,804 --> 00:06:58,273
obviously wouldn't you just want to buy fruit

190
00:06:58,273 --> 00:06:59,235
over chocolate bars

191
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:00,639
or at least that first pound of fruit

192
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,353
over that first chocolate bar?

193
00:07:02,353 --> 00:07:03,373
well you might

194
00:07:03,373 --> 00:07:06,433
but it depends on how much fruit actually cost

195
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:08,046
just looking at this alone

196
00:07:08,046 --> 00:07:09,677
we can just make relative judgements

197
00:07:09,677 --> 00:07:12,267
about how much we prefer each incremental bar

198
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:13,518
or each incremental pound

199
00:07:13,518 --> 00:07:15,023
or them relative to each other

200
00:07:15,023 --> 00:07:16,147
but it really doesn't tell us

201
00:07:16,147 --> 00:07:18,720
how we would spend our actual money

202
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,153
so let's think about things

203
00:07:20,153 --> 00:07:22,015
let's put some prices on some of these goods

204
00:07:22,015 --> 00:07:24,600
and think about we would actually allocate our dollars

205
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,400
given these marginal utility numbers right over here

206
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:35,692
so let's say that the chocolate bars are 1 dollar per bar

207
00:07:35,692 --> 00:07:38,467
and let's say that the fruit is 2 dollars per pound

208
00:07:38,467 --> 00:07:40,678
2 dollars per pound

209
00:07:40,678 --> 00:07:41,989
so this is going to be per pound

210
00:07:41,989 --> 00:07:43,800
and this is going to be per bar

211
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,042
and what we're gonna think about is

212
00:07:45,042 --> 00:07:48,080
we're gonna think about marginal utility

213
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,200
for that incremental chocolate bar per price

214
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,066
of that incremental chocolate bar

215
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:57,741
here the price is gonna be at a dollar per pound

216
00:07:57,741 --> 00:07:59,741
so here for that first bar

217
00:07:59,741 --> 00:08:01,672
I am going to be spending a dollar

218
00:08:01,672 --> 00:08:04,104
and I am getting a hundred marginal utility points

219
00:08:04,104 --> 00:08:05,280
whatever you want to call it

220
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,133
so I am getting a 100 marginal utility points

221
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:08,032
for that dollar

222
00:08:08,032 --> 00:08:09,282
so I'm getting a hundred

223
00:08:09,282 --> 00:08:12,078
a hundred marginal utility points per dollar

224
00:08:12,078 --> 00:08:13,661
Here, same logic

225
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:15,978
I am getting 80 marginal utility points per dollar

226
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:17,279
this is pretty simple math

227
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,954
here I am getting 60 marginal utility points for the dollar

228
00:08:19,954 --> 00:08:21,662
her I am getting 40

229
00:08:21,662 --> 00:08:23,144
so that doesn't seem too interesting

230
00:08:23,144 --> 00:08:24,675
it might be a little bit more interesting here

231
00:08:24,675 --> 00:08:28,190
what is the marginal utility per incremental fruit

232
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,707
that I am getting per dollar

233
00:08:30,707 --> 00:08:31,916
per price

234
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:35,333
or I should say per price of the incremental fruit here

235
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,282
well here, the first pound of fruit

236
00:08:37,282 --> 00:08:40,952
I am getting 120 marginal utility points

237
00:08:40,952 --> 00:08:42,667
but I paid 2 dollars for it

238
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:46,667
so 120, let me write it over here

239
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:48,908
so for that first incremental fruit

240
00:08:48,908 --> 00:08:52,467
the marginal utility for that first fruit is 120

241
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:57,333
and the price for that first pound of fruit is equal to 2

242
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:01,530
so I am getting 60 marginal utility points per dollar

243
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,962
I'm getting 60

244
00:09:02,962 --> 00:09:04,867
here 100 marginal utility points

245
00:09:04,867 --> 00:09:06,381
but I am spending 2 dollars

246
00:09:06,381 --> 00:09:08,430
so it's 50 points per dollar

247
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,333
this is 25 points per dollar

248
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,667
this is 10 points per dollar

249
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:15,733
now this makes things a little bit more interesting

250
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:20,803
if I had 5 dollars to spend

251
00:09:20,803 --> 00:09:25,144
how would I want to spend my 5 dollars

252
00:09:25,144 --> 00:09:27,779
well where am I getting the most

253
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,088
you really want to just think about

254
00:09:29,088 --> 00:09:31,513
where you're getting the most satisfaction for each dollar

255
00:09:31,513 --> 00:09:34,392
where you're getting the most bang for your buck

256
00:09:34,392 --> 00:09:36,893
so where am I going to spend my first dollar

257
00:09:36,893 --> 00:09:38,282
so dollar one:

258
00:09:38,282 --> 00:09:39,836
let's think about it a little bit

259
00:09:39,836 --> 00:09:41,169
my first dollar

260
00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:42,769
so dollar one:

261
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:44,054
my first dollar

262
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:46,800
where am I going to get the most satisfaction per dollar

263
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,271
well I get the most satisfaction per dollar right over here

264
00:09:49,287 --> 00:09:51,733
I get a 100 satisfaction units per dollar

265
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:53,733
even though I like a pound of fruit more

266
00:09:53,733 --> 00:09:56,948
I am getting less satisfaction per dollar

267
00:09:56,948 --> 00:09:58,839
so I am getting less bang for my buck

268
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:02,200
so my first dollar is going to go right over there

269
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,056
I am going to buy one candy bar

270
00:10:05,056 --> 00:10:07,585
then where am I going to spend my second dollar

271
00:10:07,585 --> 00:10:08,775
dollar two:

272
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,010
so once again, I just wan to look at all my options

273
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,648
and we're gonna assume that

274
00:10:12,648 --> 00:10:14,445
I am going to spend my dollar on either of these two

275
00:10:14,445 --> 00:10:16,390
just to limit our universe

276
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,800
once again I am gonna maximize my bang for buck

277
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,200
I get 80 satisfaction points

278
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,400
or marginal utility points over here per dollar

279
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,277
and I only get 60 over here

280
00:10:25,277 --> 00:10:30,833
so I am gonna buy a second chocolate bar

281
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:31,767
let's keep going

282
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:34,200
where am I gonna spend my third dollar

283
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,769
now it gets a little bit interesting

284
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:40,733
I could spend my third dollar right over here

285
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:42,841
and get 60 points per dollar

286
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:45,193
or I could spend it over here

287
00:10:45,193 --> 00:10:47,123
and get 60 points per dollar

288
00:10:47,123 --> 00:10:48,298
I would actually get the same amount

289
00:10:48,298 --> 00:10:49,979
these are both 60 points per dollar

290
00:10:49,979 --> 00:10:51,082
so I am kind of neutral

291
00:10:51,082 --> 00:10:52,856
I am getting the same bang for my buck

292
00:10:52,856 --> 00:10:54,386
whether I get another chocolate bar

293
00:10:54,386 --> 00:10:56,087
or whether I get another fruit

294
00:10:56,087 --> 00:10:57,156
so just for simplicity

295
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,535
let's say I get another chocolate bar

296
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:00,933
I could have got the fruit too

297
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:02,808
so it's really a toss-up

298
00:11:02,808 --> 00:11:04,056
I could flip a coin

299
00:11:04,056 --> 00:11:06,262
and I choose to get another chocolate bar

300
00:11:06,262 --> 00:11:09,267
so I spent my first three dollar on three chocolate bars

301
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:11,950
now, where am I going to spend my fourth dollar

302
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,611
well my fourth dollar

303
00:11:13,611 --> 00:11:15,599
now my best bang for my buck

304
00:11:15,599 --> 00:11:17,067
isn't to get another chocolate bar

305
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:19,267
I am only going to get 40 points per buck there

306
00:11:19,267 --> 00:11:21,267
now it is to spend it on fruit

307
00:11:21,267 --> 00:11:24,933
so now the next dollar I could spend on half a pound of fruit

308
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:27,712
and I would get this

309
00:11:27,712 --> 00:11:30,933
so my fourth dollar, I could spend on this

310
00:11:30,933 --> 00:11:33,200
for half a pound of fruit

311
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,645
because it's two dollars per pound

312
00:11:34,645 --> 00:11:37,129
and then I could spend my fifth dollar there too

313
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,546
so this is my fourth and my fifth dollar

314
00:11:39,546 --> 00:11:40,638
because it's two dollars

315
00:11:40,638 --> 00:11:41,854
you could think of it we're spending

316
00:11:41,854 --> 00:11:44,249
2 dollars for one pound of fruit

317
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:46,867
and we're getting 60 utility points per dollar

318
00:11:46,867 --> 00:11:49,600
so we're getting the best bang for our buck right over there

319
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,985
but what was useful about this is that it allowed us

320
00:11:51,985 --> 00:11:53,605
without thinking money

321
00:11:53,605 --> 00:11:55,536
just say how much do we like these things

322
00:11:55,536 --> 00:11:57,405
irrespective of their actual price

323
00:11:57,405 --> 00:11:58,790
and then given a certain price

324
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,482
it allowed us to think rationally

325
00:12:00,482 --> 00:12:03,933
about how would we actually spend our money

326
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:06,667
in this case when chocolate bars are a dollar

327
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:08,400
and fruit is two dollars per pound

328
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,281
we decided to buy three chocolate bars

329
