2
00:00:05,331 --> 00:00:07,783
Here we are at the basilica of St. Denis.

3
00:00:07,783 --> 00:00:10,419
The birthplace of the Gothic.

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,357
Thanks to Suger, who was the abbot in the first half of the 12th century.

5
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:17,603
this church is incredibly important because it is the burial place of the royal families.

6
00:00:17,603 --> 00:00:22,533
And Suger himself was also an advisor to the royal family.

7
00:00:22,533 --> 00:00:26,267
We're standing in the choir, and light is pouring in the windows.

8
00:00:26,267 --> 00:00:30,233
So the choir is the space behind the altar of the church.

9
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:34,669
And the ambulatory is the aisle that would take one behind the altar.

10
00:00:34,669 --> 00:00:37,433
Actually, it is taking us around behind the altar.

11
00:00:37,433 --> 00:00:42,076
Now Suger completed the ambulatory, and also the facade of the church.

12
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:44,333
And none of this was new construction.

13
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,488
There had been a ninth century church here.

14
00:00:46,488 --> 00:00:50,714
And Suger felt it was inadequate as the burial place of the kings.

15
00:00:50,714 --> 00:00:55,567
At this historical moment, the kings of France only really controlled the Ile de France,

16
00:00:55,567 --> 00:00:57,657
that's the area immediately around Paris.

17
00:00:57,657 --> 00:01:01,233
But this was a time when the king's power was expanding, and Suger really wanted to create

18
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:07,400
an architectural style that would express the growing power of the monarch.

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,333
Now in the history of Western church architecture, the way this would generally work

20
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:15,967
is that you would have an ambulatory that would move around the back of the altar,

21
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:21,388
and that would allow pilgrims to stop at each of these small, radiating chapels.

22
00:01:21,388 --> 00:01:24,400
That is, these small rooms that would contain relics.

23
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,167
In the past, during the Romanesque period, these chapels would literally be separate rooms

24
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:31,837
with walls around them.

25
00:01:31,837 --> 00:01:39,333
And Suger's idea was instead to open up the space and allow light to flood in

26
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,567
and that's exactly how this looks.

27
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:45,667
It must have looked so different than anything anyone had seen before.

28
00:01:45,667 --> 00:01:50,900
Instead of this looking like a set of walls that are pierced by windows,

29
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,000
and in the Romanesque relatively small windows,

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,633
instead he has figured out how to engineer this structure in stone

31
00:01:58,633 --> 00:02:03,500
so that the walls can basically disappear and be replaced by glass,

32
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,700
colored glass that lets this brilliant, luminous color into the space.

33
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,448
So let's talk about two things: how he did this, and second of all, why he did this.

34
00:02:12,448 --> 00:02:15,000
Yes. Which one should we do first?

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,933
Well, let's talk about how he did it. If you look above us, there is this complex web of interlocking, pointed vaulting.

36
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:29,967
Pointed arches are really key here because for one thing, you can cover spaces of different shapes and sizes.

37
00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:37,800
Perhaps most importantly, a pointed arch doesn't push so much out as it does down.

38
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,610
And because of that, the architect didn't need to build thick walls.

39
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:49,467
A traditional Roman arch generally has to be placed on quite heavy walls because it really does push outward.

40
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:50,800
It splays.

41
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,333
What the pointed arch does is it tends to take the weight of the vaulting

42
00:02:54,333 --> 00:03:00,267
and push it more straight down, so that the weight doesn't have to be buttressed from the side.

43
00:03:00,267 --> 00:03:05,367
Looking up at those ribs, we have a sense of a pull toward the vertical.

44
00:03:05,367 --> 00:03:10,400
And all of these ribs in this vaulting rests on these thin columns.

45
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,167
So there is a real sense of elegance and openness to this space.

46
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:19,930
It's radically different from the Romanesque that came before, which felt so solid

47
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,558
and where your eye was always drawn

48
00:03:21,558 --> 00:03:25,391
around that rounded arch back down and we felt the sense of gravity.

49
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:27,524
You felt a sort of rootedness with the Romanesque.

50
00:03:27,524 --> 00:03:29,224
And it's so different here.

51
00:03:29,224 --> 00:03:34,034
You have to remember the church itself, any consecrated church is an expression

52
00:03:34,034 --> 00:03:36,091
of Holy Jerusalem.

53
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,458
It is Heaven on Earth.

54
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:43,358
So the idea is how can one transport us to a more heavenly place, to a more spiritual place.

55
00:03:43,358 --> 00:03:48,224
Abbot Suger believed that light could do this.

56
00:03:48,224 --> 00:03:55,324
Suger thought he was reading the writing of St. Denis, the patron saint of this church.

57
00:03:55,324 --> 00:03:58,458
Instead he was reading a philosopher from the sixth century.

58
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:03,524
But the important part is he took this notion of the divinity of light from that writing

59
00:04:03,524 --> 00:04:07,724
and made that practical and applicable within an architectural setting.

60
00:04:07,724 --> 00:04:14,824
Right. That writing that he thought was by St. Denis talked about how light was connected to the divine.

61
00:04:14,824 --> 00:04:23,091
So what Suger wanted was to open up those walls and allow in the light that would allow a type of thinking

62
00:04:23,091 --> 00:04:31,491
on the part of the visitors where they would move from the contemplation of light to God.

63
00:04:31,491 --> 00:04:37,558
This was a radical and new notion and actually flew in the face of other theological theories of the time.

64
00:04:37,558 --> 00:04:42,391
If you think about the ideas that are being established by St. Bernard of Clairvaux,

65
00:04:42,391 --> 00:04:45,424
who is saying we have to get rid of all the decorative.

66
00:04:45,424 --> 00:04:48,176
We have to get rid of everything that will distract us.

67
00:04:48,176 --> 00:04:51,691
Suger is moving in the other direction and saying no, in fact.

68
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:53,491
We can transport people.

69
00:04:53,491 --> 00:05:00,091
That the visual is not a distraction but a way of transporting us to the divine.

70
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:07,591
I have to say that I think Suger was incredibly successful. This is startlingly beautiful, and I feel transported.
