1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620
   

2
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,850
We're told that for the past
few months, Old Maple Farms

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,690
has grown about 1,000 more
apples than their chief rival

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,000
in the region, River Orchards.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,180
Due to cold weather this year,
the harvests at both farms

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,920
were down by about a third.

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,050
However, both farms made up for
some of the shortfall by

8
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,980
purchasing equal quantities
of apples from farms in

9
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,540
neighboring states.

10
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,950
What can you say about
the number of apples

11
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,130
available at each farm?

12
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,800
Does one farm have more than the
other, or do they have the

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,670
same amount?

14
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,200
How do I know?

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,410
So let's define some
variables here.

16
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:57,220
Let's let M be equal to number
of apples at Maple Farms. And

17
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,310
then who's the other guy?

18
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:59,260
River Orchards.

19
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,750
So let's let R be equal
to the number of

20
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:12,030
apples at River Orchards.

21
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,690
So this first sentence, they
say-- let me do this in a

22
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,540
different color-- they say for
the past few years, Old Maple

23
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:22,560
Farms has grown about 1,000 more
apples than their chief

24
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,650
rival in the region,
River Orchards.

25
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:31,500
So we could say, hey, Maple is
approximately Old River, or M

26
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,680
is approximately River
plus 1,000.

27
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,190
Or since we don't know the exact
amount-- it says it's

28
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,940
about 1,000 more, so we don't
know it's exactly 1,000 more--

29
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:44,080
we can just say that in a normal
year, Old Maple Farms,

30
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:49,880
which we denote by M, has a
larger amount of apples than

31
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,170
River Orchard.

32
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,750
So in a normal year, M is
greater than R, right?

33
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,620
It has about 1,000 more apples
than Old Maple Farms.

34
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,660
Now, they say due to cold
weather this year-- so let's

35
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,570
talk about this year now-- the
harvests at both farms were

36
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:03,995
down about a third.

37
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:07,930
   

38
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,620
So this isn't a normal year.

39
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,660
Let's talk about what's going
to happen this year.

40
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,700
In this year, each of these
characters are going to be

41
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,280
down by 1/3.

42
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,710
Now if I go down by 1/3, that's
the same thing as being

43
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,510
2/3 of what I was before.

44
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,380
Let me do an example.

45
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:26,700
If I'm at x, and I take away
1/3x, I'm left with 2/3x.

46
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,400
   

47
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,800
So going down by 1/3 is the same
thing as multiplying the

48
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,910
quantity by 2/3.

49
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,760
So if we multiply each of these
quantities by 2/3, we

50
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,880
can still hold this inequality,
because we're

51
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,010
doing the same thing to both
sides of this inequality, and

52
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,340
we're multiplying by
a positive number.

53
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,680
If we were multiplying by a
negative number, we would have

54
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,460
to swap the inequality.

55
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,400
So we can multiply both
sides of this by 2/3.

56
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,525
So 2/3 of M is still going to
be greater than 2/3 of R.

57
00:02:59,525 --> 00:03:02,620
And you could even draw that in
a number line if you like.

58
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,280
Let's do this in
a number line.

59
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,450
This all might be a little
intuitive for you, and if it

60
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,980
is, I apologize, but if it's
not, it never hurts.

61
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,440
So that's 0 on our
number line.

62
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,490
So in a normal year, M is
has 1,000 more than R.

63
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,330
So in a normal year, M might
be over here and

64
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,310
maybe R is over here.

65
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,950
I don't know, let's say
R is over there.

66
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:29,050
Now, if we take 2/3 of M, that's
going to stick us some

67
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,340
place around, oh, I
don't know, 2/3

68
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,840
is right about there.

69
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,250
So this is M-- let me write
this-- this is 2/3 M.

70
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,910
And what's 2/3 of
R going to be?

71
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,250
Well, if you take 2/3 of this,
you get to right about there,

72
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,970
that is 2/3R.

73
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:56,360
So you can see, 2/3R is still
less than 2/3M, or 2/3M is

74
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,220
greater than 2/3R.

75
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:04,890
Now, they say both farms made
up for some of the shortfall

76
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,900
by purchasing equal quantities
of apples from farms in

77
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,200
neighboring states.

78
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:21,579
So let's let a be equal
to the quantity

79
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:26,235
of apples both purchased.

80
00:04:26,235 --> 00:04:29,240
   

81
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,430
So they're telling
us that they both

82
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,870
purchased the same amount.

83
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,840
So we could add a to both sides
of this equation and it

84
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,410
will not change the
inequality.

85
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,670
As long as you add or subtract
the same value to both sides,

86
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,640
it will not change
the inequality.

87
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:46,000
So if you add a to both sides,
you have a plus 2/3M is a

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,150
greater than 2/3R plus a.

89
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:52,980
This is the amount that Old
Maple Farms has after

90
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:57,080
purchasing the apples, and this
is the amount that River

91
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,380
Orchards has.

92
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,440
So after everything is said
and done, Old Maple Farms

93
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,200
still has more apples, and
you can see that here.

94
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,690
Maple Farms, a normal year, this
year they only had 2/3 of

95
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,180
the production, but then they
purchased a apples.

96
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,510
So let's say a is about, let's
say that a is that many

97
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:18,040
apples, so they got back
to their normal amount.

98
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,810
So let's say they got back
to their normal amount.

99
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,610
So that's how many apples
they purchased, so

100
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,590
he got back to M.

101
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:29,360
Now, if R, if River Orchards
also purchased a apples, that

102
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,110
same distance, a, if you go
along here gets you to right

103
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,370
about over there.

104
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,960
So once again, this is-- let
me do it a little bit

105
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,010
different, because I don't like
it overlapping, so let me

106
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:42,740
do it like this.

107
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,260
So let's say this guy, M-- I
keep forgetting their names--

108
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,900
Old Maple Farms purchases a
apples, gets them that far.

109
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,360
So that's a apples.

110
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,700
But River Orchards also
purchases a apples, so let's

111
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,700
add that same amount.

112
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,700
I'm just going to copy and paste
it so it's the exact

113
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,950
same amount.

114
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,310
   

115
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:07,450
So River Orchards also purchases
a, so it also

116
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,470
purchases that same amount.

117
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,980
So when all is said and done,
River Orchards is going to

118
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,390
have this many apples in the
year that they had less

119
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,800
production but they went
and purchased it.

120
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,420
So this, right here, is--
this value right here

121
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:26,120
is 2/3R plus a.

122
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,380
That's what River
Orchards has.

123
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,830
And then Old Maple Farms has
this value right here, which

124
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,290
is 2/3M plus a.

125
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,590
Everything said and done,
Old Maple Farms

126
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,660
still has more apples.

127
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:38,666
