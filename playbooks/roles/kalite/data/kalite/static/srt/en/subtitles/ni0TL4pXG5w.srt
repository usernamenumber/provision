1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,237
In the last video we finished up asking ourselves

2
00:00:03,237 --> 00:00:04,886
how much do we produce

3
00:00:04,886 --> 00:00:11,646
if the market price is at 45 cents

4
00:00:11,646 --> 00:00:12,765
and just going with the logic

5
00:00:12,765 --> 00:00:14,337
that we introduced in the last video

6
00:00:14,337 --> 00:00:16,277
you want to produce as much as possible

7
00:00:16,277 --> 00:00:18,646
to spread out the fixed costs

8
00:00:18,646 --> 00:00:20,025
but you don't want to produce so much

9
00:00:20,025 --> 00:00:22,123
that the marginal cost is higher

10
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:23,659
than your marginal revenue

11
00:00:23,659 --> 00:00:25,804
and your marginal revenue is your market price

12
00:00:25,804 --> 00:00:27,741
every unit, every incremental unit

13
00:00:27,741 --> 00:00:29,768
you're going to get 45 cents

14
00:00:29,768 --> 00:00:32,299
So you wanna look at the quantity

15
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:35,132
where your marginal revenue, the 45 cents

16
00:00:35,132 --> 00:00:36,943
is equal to your marginal cost

17
00:00:36,943 --> 00:00:37,966
and you can look at it over here

18
00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:40,612
so, if you look at our marginal revenue

19
00:00:40,612 --> 00:00:44,220
so, let's say 45 cents is right over there

20
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,154
you wanna look

21
00:00:45,154 --> 00:00:47,916
where the 45 cents is equal to your marginal costs

22
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:50,643
It looks like it is right over there.

23
00:00:50,643 --> 00:00:51,897
You can even see it in our table

24
00:00:51,897 --> 00:00:54,822
When does our marginal cost equal 45 cents?

25
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:56,451
It equals that

26
00:00:56,451 --> 00:01:03,122
when we produce 8,000 gallons of our juice

27
00:01:03,122 --> 00:01:05,071
Now, the reason why this is somewhat interesting

28
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:06,920
is that at that point

29
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,695
the amount of revenue that we're getting per unit

30
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:10,796
our marginal revenue

31
00:01:10,796 --> 00:01:14,480
is less than our total cost per unit

32
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,645
We're selling each unit at 45 cents

33
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:19,882
but our total cost for each of those units

34
00:01:19,882 --> 00:01:21,832
is 48 cents, on average

35
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:24,637
So this right over here is our total cost

36
00:01:24,637 --> 00:01:25,891
So you might say

37
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:28,305
look! I'm making a loss on every unit!

38
00:01:28,305 --> 00:01:29,745
The total amount of revenue I'm getting

39
00:01:29,745 --> 00:01:31,974
is a smaller rectangle over here

40
00:01:31,974 --> 00:01:36,061
It's the quantity times the marginal revenue per unit

41
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:39,312
so, this is the amount of revenue that I'm getting

42
00:01:39,312 --> 00:01:40,984
let me colour it in carefully

43
00:01:40,984 --> 00:01:43,956
That is the amount of revenue that I'm getting

44
00:01:43,956 --> 00:01:46,138
while my costs are this larger rectangle

45
00:01:46,138 --> 00:01:51,572
My quantity times my average total cost per unit.

46
00:01:51,572 --> 00:01:53,894
and so, what I end up with

47
00:01:53,894 --> 00:01:57,722
is if you take that revenue

48
00:01:57,722 --> 00:01:59,202
and you subtract that quantity

49
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:03,866
you end up with a loss of exactly this much

50
00:02:03,866 --> 00:02:09,190
you're operating in this situation at a loss

51
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,602
when you are producing 8,000 units

52
00:02:11,602 --> 00:02:14,843
and you're getting 45 cents per unit

53
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,975
So, does it make sense for you to do this?

54
00:02:16,975 --> 00:02:18,228
And we can even figure out the loss

55
00:02:18,228 --> 00:02:20,225
You're producing 8,000 units

56
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:22,872
and you're selling them for 45 cents a unit

57
00:02:22,872 --> 00:02:26,109
and it costs you 48 cents per unit to produce them

58
00:02:26,109 --> 00:02:27,034
on average

59
00:02:27,034 --> 00:02:28,399
when you put all the costs in

60
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:29,560
48 cents per unit

61
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:36,500
So you're losing 3 cents per unit

62
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,087
per, I guess, gallon

63
00:02:38,087 --> 00:02:39,345
we're talking about orange juice here

64
00:02:39,345 --> 00:02:43,909
times 8,000 gallons

65
00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:47,936
means that we are losing 240 dollars

66
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:51,307
8,000 times 3 cents is 24,000 cents

67
00:02:51,307 --> 00:02:53,957
which is the same thing as 240 dollars

68
00:02:53,957 --> 00:02:56,679
so, does it make sense for us to do this?

69
00:02:56,679 --> 00:02:58,148
Well, one way to think about it

70
00:02:58,148 --> 00:02:59,188
let's say we didn't do it

71
00:02:59,188 --> 00:03:00,265
Let's say we're just like

72
00:03:00,265 --> 00:03:01,882
hey, I'm not going to produce any gallons

73
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:03,647
well, then what's going to be our loss?

74
00:03:03,647 --> 00:03:05,922
Well, we're assuming that this is our fixed cost

75
00:03:05,922 --> 00:03:08,076
we've already committed ourselves

76
00:03:08,076 --> 00:03:09,869
to this expenditure right over here

77
00:03:09,869 --> 00:03:13,585
Whether we produce no drops of orange juice

78
00:03:13,585 --> 00:03:15,814
we are still going to be spending 1,000 dollars

79
00:03:15,814 --> 00:03:18,380
So we if produce nothing

80
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,376
we are garuanteeing ourselves

81
00:03:20,376 --> 00:03:23,117
a weekly loss of 1,000 dollars

82
00:03:23,117 --> 00:03:24,916
And this is at least better than that

83
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,795
So by starting to produce some units

84
00:03:27,795 --> 00:03:30,210
we are at least able to offset some of that loss

85
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,557
and we're spreading out that fixed cost

86
00:03:31,557 --> 00:03:33,879
over more and more and more gallons

87
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,226
And you might say

88
00:03:35,226 --> 00:03:37,223
hey! Why don't I just produce more and more units?

89
00:03:37,223 --> 00:03:40,891
Why don't I go here, maybe I'll produce 9,000 units

90
00:03:40,891 --> 00:03:43,167
where the marginal cost, all of a sudden

91
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:45,117
is higher than our marginal revenue

92
00:03:45,117 --> 00:03:47,765
and the reason why that won't make any sense to do

93
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:49,901
is because if you produce that many units

94
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:51,501
then all of a sudden

95
00:03:51,501 --> 00:03:53,192
each of the incremental units

96
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:55,835
that you're producing beyond the 8,000

97
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:57,525
you're losing money on those

98
00:03:57,525 --> 00:03:59,429
That 8,000 and first unit

99
00:03:59,429 --> 00:04:01,190
the marginal cost is going to be higher

100
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,430
than the marginal revenue

101
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,924
that you're bringing in on that unit

102
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:05,597
so you're going to be losing money

103
00:04:05,597 --> 00:04:09,266
You're going to start having a lower profit

104
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:11,714
than even the negative 240 dollar loss

105
00:04:11,714 --> 00:04:14,142
so we'll start going into negative 240 something

106
00:04:14,142 --> 00:04:15,999
negative 250 and so forth and so on

107
00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:19,701
so you still don't wanna produce beyond that point

108
00:04:19,701 --> 00:04:22,299
and we'll touch more deeply on that in future videos

109
00:04:22,299 --> 00:04:24,870
but this is essentially what differentiates

110
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,146
the short term supply curve

111
00:04:27,146 --> 00:04:29,050
from the long run supply curve

112
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,995
In the short term

113
00:04:30,995 --> 00:04:33,511
we're going to assume that we have these fixed costs

114
00:04:33,511 --> 00:04:34,762
and so, it's just going to make sense

115
00:04:34,762 --> 00:04:36,898
to produce equivelent to our marginal costs

116
00:04:36,898 --> 00:04:39,637
But over the long run

117
00:04:39,637 --> 00:04:41,434
maybe our fixed items

118
00:04:41,434 --> 00:04:42,218
our capital

119
00:04:42,218 --> 00:04:44,270
our machinery wears off

120
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,790
or maybe the contract for my emplyees wears off

121
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,972
and then we have a different cost structure

122
00:04:48,972 --> 00:04:50,273
over the long term

123
00:04:50,273 --> 00:04:52,327
and we'll think about that in another video

124
00:04:52,327 --> 00:04:54,523
But the simple answer is

125
00:04:54,523 --> 00:04:57,055
assuming these really are your fixed costs

126
00:04:57,055 --> 00:04:59,886
you still want to produce as many units as possible

127
00:04:59,886 --> 00:05:03,455
so that your marginal cost

128
00:05:03,455 --> 00:05:06,056
is equal to your marginal revenue

129
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,595
which in this case, is the market price

130
00:05:07,595 --> 00:05:09,527
We are price takers

131
00:05:09,527 --> 00:05:11,535
so it actually is a rational thing

132
00:05:11,535 --> 00:05:14,886
to produce 8,000 units and take a loss on that

133
00:05:14,886 --> 00:05:17,486
and take 240 dollar per week loss

134
00:05:17,486 --> 00:05:21,062
as opposed to producing nothing

135
00:05:21,062 --> 00:05:23,199
and taking a thousand dollar per week loss

136
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,234
now, it might not be rational

137
00:05:25,234 --> 00:05:27,365
once these things have been worn out

138
00:05:27,365 --> 00:05:29,421
like your robots and your employee's contracts

139
00:05:29,421 --> 00:05:31,089
it might not be rational

140
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:33,255
to continue them past their term

141
00:05:33,255 --> 00:05:35,873
and we'll think about that more in another video

142
00:05:35,873 --> 00:05:37,874
because, obviously, we are running at a loss

143
00:05:37,874 --> 00:05:40,521
and this is not necessarily a good business to be in

144
00:05:40,521 --> 00:05:42,239
but now that we've gotten int the business

145
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:43,539
we might as well stay in it

146
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:46,675
in order to recoup some of our costs here

147
00:05:46,675 --> 00:05:48,183
or at least spread them out

148
00:05:48,183 --> 00:05:53,003
or at least not have a thousand dollar per week loss

149
00:05:53,003 --> 00:05:54,680
Anyways. See you in the next video
