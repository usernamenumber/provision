1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,630
   

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,230
We figured out the eigenvalues
for a 2 by 2 matrix, so let's

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,240
see if we can figure
out the eigenvalues

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,920
for a 3 by 3 matrix.

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,730
And I think we'll appreciate
that it's a good bit more

6
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,420
difficult just because the math
becomes a little hairier.

7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:22,830
So lambda is an eigenvalue
of A.

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,810
By definition, if and only if--
I'll write it like this.

9
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:33,180
If and only if A times some
non-zero vector v is equal to

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,075
lambda times that non-zero
vector v.

11
00:00:36,075 --> 00:00:41,040
Let we write that for
some non-zero.

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,790
   

13
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,930
I could call it eigenvector v,
but I'll just call it for some

14
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,820
non-zero vector v or
some non-zero v.

15
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,480
Now this is true if and only if,
this leads to-- I'll write

16
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,220
it like this.

17
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,520
This is true if and only if--
and this is a bit of review,

18
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,880
but I like to review it just
because when you do this 10

19
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,760
years from now, I don't want you
to remember the formula.

20
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,230
I want you to just remember the
logic of how we got to it.

21
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,910
So this is true if and only if--
let's just subtract Av

22
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:15,270
from both sides-- the 0 vector
is equal to lambda- instead of

23
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,840
writing lambda times v, I'm
going to write lambda times

24
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,340
the identity matrix times v.

25
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,580
This is the same thing.

26
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,890
The identity matrix
times v is just v.

27
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,660
Minus Av.

28
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,280
I just subtracted Av from both
sides, rewrote v as the

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,140
identity matrix times v.

30
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:37,760
Well this is only true if and
only if the 0 vector is equal

31
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:44,630
to lambda times the identity
matrix minus A times v.

32
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,740
I just factored the vector v out
from the right-hand side

33
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,540
of both of these guys, and
I'm just left with some

34
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,700
matrix times v.

35
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,900
Well this is only true-- let
me rewrite this over here,

36
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,110
this equation just in a form
you might recognize it.

37
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,110
Lambda times the identity
matrix times A.

38
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,330
This is just some matrix.

39
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:09,000
This matrix times v has got
to be equal to 0 for some

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,910
non-zero vector v.

41
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:16,020
That means that the null space
of this matrix has got to be

42
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,070
nontrivial.

43
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:21,880
Or another way to think about it
is that its columns are not

44
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,310
linearly independent.

45
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,800
Or another way to think about it
is it's not invertible, or

46
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,550
it has a determinant of 0.

47
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:31,250
So lambda is the eigenvalue of
A, if and only if, each of

48
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,550
these steps are true.

49
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,780
And this is true if and only
if-- for some at non-zero

50
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:43,560
vector, if and only if, the
determinant of lambda times

51
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,630
the identity matrix minus
A is equal to 0.

52
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,560
And that was our takeaway.

53
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,160
I think it was two videos
ago or three videos ago.

54
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:56,620
But let's apply it now to
this 3 by 3 matrix A.

55
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,680
We're going to use the 3
by 3 identity matrix.

56
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,985
So we want to concern ourselves
with-- lambda times

57
00:03:01,985 --> 00:03:05,650
the identity matrix is just
going to be-- times the 3 by 3

58
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,410
identity matrix is just
going to be-- this is,

59
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:09,900
let me write this.

60
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,920
This is lambda times the
identity matrix in R3.

61
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,950
So it's just going to be
lambda, lambda, lambda.

62
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,100
And everything else is
going to be 0's.

63
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,400
The identity matrix had 1's
across here, so that's the

64
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,200
only thing that becomes
non-zero when you

65
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,230
multiply it by lambda.

66
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,760
Everything else was a 0.

67
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,690
So that's the identity
matrix times lambda.

68
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:36,700
So lambda times the identity
matrix minus A is going to be

69
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,230
equal to-- it's actually pretty

70
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,550
straightforward to find.

71
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,170
Everything along the diagonal is
going to be lambda minus--

72
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,060
let's just do it.

73
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,900
Lambda minus minus 1-- I'll
do the diagonals here.

74
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,230
Lambda minus minus 1
is lambda plus 1.

75
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,040
And then 0 minus 2-- I'll do
that in a different color.

76
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,250
0 minus 2 is minus 2.

77
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,190
0 minus 2 is minus 2.

78
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,620
0 minus 2 is minus 2.

79
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,270
Let's do this one.

80
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:07,380
0 minus 2 is minus 2.

81
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:12,460
0 plus or minus minus 1 is
0 plus 1, which is 1.

82
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,560
And then let's just
do this one.

83
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,460
0 minus minus 1.

84
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,810
That's one.

85
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,700
Let me finish up the diagonal.

86
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,695
And then you have
lambda minus 2.

87
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:24,320
   

88
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,900
And then you have
lambda minus 2.

89
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,280
So lambda is an eigenvalue
of A if and only if the

90
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,740
determinant of this matrix
right here is equal to 0.

91
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,570
Let's figure out its
determinate.

92
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,050
And the easiest way, at least
in my head to do this, is to

93
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,025
use the rule of Sarrus.

94
00:04:43,025 --> 00:04:45,620
So let's use the rule of
Sarrus to find this

95
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,650
determinant.

96
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,460
So I just rewrite these
rows right there.

97
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,070
I could just copy and
paste them really.

98
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:55,640
I just take those two rows.

99
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,070
And then let me paste them,
put them right there.

100
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,720
It's a little bit too close
to this guy, but I

101
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,310
think you get the idea.

102
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,130
And now the rule of Sarrus I
just take this product plus

103
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:13,090
this product plus this product
and then I subtract out this

104
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,110
product times this product
times this product.

105
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,570
We'll do that next.

106
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:24,220
So this product is lambda plus
1 times lambda minus 2 times

107
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,020
lambda minus 2.

108
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,400
That's that one there.

109
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,470
And then plus, let's see,
minus 2 times minus 2.

110
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,216
That's plus 4.

111
00:05:32,216 --> 00:05:34,640
And then we have minus 2 times
minus 2 plus 4 times 1.

112
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,790
So that is plus 4 again.

113
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:43,910
And then we do minus this column
times this column.

114
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,840
Minus this column minus this
column and then-- or I

115
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,210
shouldn't say column,
but diagonal really.

116
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,890
So we say minus 2
times minus 2.

117
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,750
Let me write this.

118
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,510
Minus 2 times minus
2, which is 4.

119
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:03,670
Times lambda minus 2.

120
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,490
That was this diagonal.

121
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,970
And then we have minus-- what
is this going to be?

122
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,510
Going to be minus 1 times
lambda plus 1.

123
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,840
So minus lambda plus 1.

124
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,010
And then you go down
this diagonal.

125
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,410
Minus 2 times minus 2 is 4.

126
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,410
So it's going to be 4 times
lambda minus 2 and we're

127
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:21,840
subtracting.

128
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,750
So minus 4 times
lambda minus 2.

129
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,200
And let's see if we
can simplify this.

130
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,660
So this blue stuff over here--
let's see, these guys right

131
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:36,230
here become an 8 and then
this becomes-- this

132
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,510
becomes lambda plus 1.

133
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:43,550
Times-- if I multiply these two
guys out, lambda squared

134
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,860
minus 4 lambda.

135
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,440
Minus 2 lambda and then
minus 2 lambda.

136
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,690
So minus 4 lambda.

137
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,200
Plus 4.

138
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,190
And then I have this
plus 8 here.

139
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,130
And then I have-- let's see.

140
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,900
I have minus 4 times lambda.

141
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,260
Let me just multiply
everything out.

142
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:07,900
So I have minus 4 lambda plus 8
minus lambda minus 1 minus 4

143
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:14,450
lambda plus 8.

144
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,800
And then let me simplify
this up a little bit.

145
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,310
So this guy over here--
let's see.

146
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:24,305
The constant terms, I have an 8,
I have a minus 1, I have an

147
00:07:24,305 --> 00:07:26,220
8 and I have an 8.

148
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,680
So that's 24 minus 1.

149
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,910
So that is a 23.

150
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:36,220
And then the lambda terms
I have a minus 4 lambda.

151
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,090
I have a minus lambda and
I have a minus 4 lambda.

152
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,320
So it's minus 8, minus 1.

153
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,750
So I have minus 9 lambda.

154
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,670
Plus 23.

155
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,530
And now I have to simplify
this out.

156
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,020
So first I can take lambda and
multiply it times this whole

157
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,910
guy right there.

158
00:07:51,910 --> 00:08:00,000
So it's going to be lambda cubed
minus 4 lambda squared

159
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,770
plus 4 lambda.

160
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,895
And then I can take this
one and multiply

161
00:08:03,895 --> 00:08:05,400
it times that guy.

162
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,440
So plus lambda squared.

163
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,980
Minus 4 lambda plus 4.

164
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,990
And now of course, we have
these terms over here.

165
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,740
So we're going to have
to simplify it again.

166
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,100
So what are all of our
constant terms?

167
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,880
We have a 23 and we
have a plus 4.

168
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,790
So we have a 27.

169
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,350
Plus 27.

170
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,220
And then, what are all
of our lambda terms?

171
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,559
We have a minus 9 lambda and
then we have a-- let's see.

172
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:37,090
We have a minus 9 lambda, we
have a plus 4 lambda, and then

173
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,120
we have a minus 4 lambda.

174
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,429
So these two cancel out.

175
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:45,140
So I just have a
minus 9 lambda.

176
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,840
And then, what are my lambda
squared terms?

177
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,300
I have a plus lambda squared
and I have a

178
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,190
minus 4 lambda squared.

179
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,500
So if you add those two
that's going to be

180
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,025
minus 3 lambda squared.

181
00:08:57,025 --> 00:09:00,720
   

182
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,130
And then finally, I have only
one lambda cubed term, that

183
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,670
right there.

184
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:10,450
So this is the characteristic
polynomial for our matrix.

185
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:15,170
So this is the characteristic
polynomial and this represents

186
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:18,350
the determinant for
any lambda.

187
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,410
The determinant of this
matrix for any lambda.

188
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:25,210
And we said that this has to be
equal to 0 if any only if

189
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,820
lambda is truly an eigenvalue.

190
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,260
So we're going to set
this equal to 0.

191
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,570
And unlucky or lucky for us,
there is no real trivial--

192
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,380
there is no quadratic.

193
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,990
Well there is, actually, but
it's very complicated.

194
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,600
And so it's usually
a waste of time.

195
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,300
So we're going to have to do
kind of the art of factoring a

196
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,440
quadratic polynomial.

197
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,270
I got this problem out of a book
and I think it's fair to

198
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:51,020
say that if you ever do run into
this in an actual linear

199
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,970
algebra class or really, in an
algebra class generally-- it

200
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:55,380
doesn't even have to be in the
context of eigenvalues, you

201
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,920
probably will be dealing
with integer solutions.

202
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,740
And if you are dealing with
integer solutions, then your

203
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,540
roots are going to be factors
of this term right here.

204
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,960
Especially if you have a
1 coefficient out here.

205
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,140
So your potential roots-- in
this case, what are the

206
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,145
factors of 27?

207
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:18,720
So 1, 3, 9 and 27.

208
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,230
So all these are potential
roots.

209
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,410
So we can just try them out.

210
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:24,280
1 cubed is 1 minus 3.

211
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,900
So let me try 1.

212
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:31,300
So if we try a 1, it's 1 minus
3 minus 9 plus 27.

213
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,630
That does not equal 0.

214
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,640
It's minus 2 minus
9 is minus 11.

215
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,510
Plus 16.

216
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,580
That does not equal 0.

217
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,490
So 1 is not a root.

218
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:46,060
If we try 3 we get 3
cubed, which is 27.

219
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,960
Minus 3 times 3 squared
is minus 3 times 3,

220
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,800
which is minus 27.

221
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,320
Minus 9 times 3, which
is minus 27.

222
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,470
Plus 27.

223
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,820
That does equal 0.

224
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,450
So lucky for us, on our second
try we were able to

225
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,790
find one 0 for this.

226
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:06,070
So if 3 is a 0, that means that
x minus 3 is one of the

227
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,550
factors of this.

228
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,310
So that means that this is going
to be x minus 3 times

229
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,070
something else.

230
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,010
Or I should say,
lambda minus 3.

231
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,240
So let's see what the
other root is.

232
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:22,310
So if I take lambda minus 3 and
I divide it into this guy

233
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:30,250
up here, into lambda cubed minus
3 lambda squared minus 9

234
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,870
lambda plus 27, what do I get?

235
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,800
Lambda goes into lambda cubed
lambda squared times.

236
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,220
Lambda squared times that.

237
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,650
Lambda squared times lambda
is lambda cubed.

238
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:48,710
Lambda squared times minus 3
is minus 3 lambda squared.

239
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:53,280
You subtract these guys,
you get a 0.

240
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,270
You get 0.

241
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:57,100
And then we can put here--
well, we could

242
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:57,810
do it either way.

243
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:01,030
We could put it down
the minus 9.

244
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,690
We could bring down
everything really.

245
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:09,980
So now you have minus
9 lambda plus 27.

246
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,910
You can almost imagine we just
subtracted this from this

247
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,960
whole thing up here.

248
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,480
And we're just left with
these terms right here.

249
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,380
And so lambda minus
3 goes into this.

250
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:23,160
Well lambda minus 3 goes
into 9 lambda.

251
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,110
It goes into 9 lambda
minus 9 times.

252
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:30,160
So I'll just write
minus 9 here.

253
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:38,820
Minus 9 times lambda minus 3
is minus 9 lambda plus 27.

254
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,550
So it went in very nicely.

255
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:45,650
So you get to 0.

256
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:53,150
Our characteristic polynomial
has simplified to lambda minus

257
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:58,730
3 times lambda squared
minus 9.

258
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,070
And of course, we're going to
have to set this equal to 0 if

259
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,850
lambda is truly an eigenvalue
of our matrix.

260
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,890
And this is very
easy to factor.

261
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:12,770
So this becomes lambda minus 3
times-- lambda squared minus 9

262
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:18,310
is just lambda plus 3 times
lambda minus 3.

263
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,870
And all of that equals 0.

264
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,650
And these roots, we already
know one of them.

265
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,010
We know that 3 is a root and
actually, this tells us 3 is a

266
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:24,980
root as well.

267
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:30,500
So the possible eigenvalues of
our matrix A, our 3 by 3

268
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,960
matrix A that we had way up
there-- this matrix A right

269
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:38,040
there-- the possible eigenvalues
are: lambda is

270
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:44,410
equal to 3 or lambda is
equal to minus 3.

271
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:47,140
Those are the two values that
would make our characteristic

272
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:52,710
polynomial or the determinant
for this matrix equal to 0,

273
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:56,120
which is a condition that we
need to have in order for

274
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:02,540
lambda to be an eigenvalue of a
for some non-zero vector v.

275
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,050
In the next video, we'll
actually solve for the

276
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,840
eigenvectors, now that we know
what the eigenvalues are.

277
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,480
