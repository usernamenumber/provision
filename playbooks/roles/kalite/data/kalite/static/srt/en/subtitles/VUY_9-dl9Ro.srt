1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690
   

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,750
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:03,650
We are now going to start
a new section.

4
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,270
This is going to be section 6.

5
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:11,430
It starts on page 407 of the
official SAT study guide.

6
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,120
Let's get started with some
problems. So let's see this

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,150
first problem.

8
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,640
Just so you know, they tend to
be tricky, but really fast

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,550
problems. And sometimes they're
just really easy and

10
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,870
fast. But they tend to be
problems that you should be

11
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,770
able to get, hopefully,
in a few seconds.

12
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,020
So if your plan of attack
immediately tells you will

13
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,970
take you three or four minutes,
your plan of attack

14
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,130
might be non-optimal.

15
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,190
It maybe correct,
but non-optimal.

16
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:44,270
So the first question
is, x plus 2/x is

17
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:49,440
equal to 5 plus 2/5.

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,520
And I was actually just looking
at this problem right

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,490
before we started this video.

20
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,200
And well, anyway, this is a
pretty neat problem because

21
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,020
this falls into the category
of, there's two plans of

22
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,540
attacks here.

23
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,900
One will take you some time,
and involves quadratics.

24
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:07,660
The other plan of attack is
ultra fast, so this is, if x

25
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:12,970
plus 2/x is equal to 5 plus 2/5,
then x can equal which of

26
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:13,490
the following?

27
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,560
And they give some choices.

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,100
They give the choice, 1/5.

29
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,300
They give the choice, 4/5.

30
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:24,140
They give the choice, 1,
5/2, and 5, right?

31
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,190
These are the choices
they give.

32
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,110
So if you see this on a algebra
test, your natural

33
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,390
reaction is, well, let
me solve for x.

34
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,720
And so you would add 5 plus
2/5, you get some fraction

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,990
there, 27/5.

36
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,040
You'd multiply both
sides by x.

37
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,160
You'd get x squared plus 2
is equal to 27 over 5x.

38
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,470
You'd have a quadratic.

39
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,955
You would want to factor that or
use quadratic equations, et

40
00:01:45,955 --> 00:01:47,620
cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

41
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,930
That would take you some time,
and considering this is the

42
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,000
first problem, that's
not going to

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,730
be the plan of attack.

44
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,260
So let me ask you, do you
see a pattern here?

45
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,990
Do these two sides
look the same?

46
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,180
Well, they kind of do, right?

47
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,020
We have an x here, an x here.

48
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,070
We have a 2 here, right?

49
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,010
We have a 2 in both places.

50
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,710
We have a plus in both places.

51
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,420
But the only difference is,
wherever I see an x on the

52
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,810
left hand side, I see a 5
on the right hand side.

53
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,620
So does something
jump out at you?

54
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,580
Well sure, if I just replace x
with 5, it's going to equal

55
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,230
this, right?

56
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,540
Because if I just put 5-- x
equals 5-- you get 5 plus 2/5

57
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,460
is equal to 5 plus 2/5.

58
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,630
So this is the answer.

59
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,400
So it could have literally taken
you about two seconds.

60
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,360
And I have to admit, when I
first looked at this, I

61
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,400
thought, the first question
is a quadratic?

62
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,540
I said, that can't be the way.

63
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,360
And I looked at it a little
bit longer, about three

64
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,450
seconds longer, and I
said, oh, this is

65
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,900
just pattern matching.

66
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:50,650
Let's move on to the next
question-- Image, clear image.

67
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:55,980
Image, invert colors--
OK, so they have a

68
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,916
right triangle here.

69
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,806
Let be draw the right
triangle.

70
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:04,490
   

71
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,623
Not a wrong triangle,
a right triangle.

72
00:03:06,623 --> 00:03:09,870
   

73
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,640
Let me get the paint tool.

74
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,420
I'll draw this edge now
with my free hand,

75
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,810
my shaky free hand.

76
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,060
And they say this side
is 2, this side is y.

77
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,760
this side is x.

78
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,370
This , of course, is
the hypoteneuse.

79
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,570
And they say, in the right
triangle above, If x is equal

80
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:30,390
to 3, what is the value of y?

81
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,840
Well, this is just straight up
Pythagorean theorem, right?

82
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,460
This is the hypoteneuse,
y is the hypoteneuse.

83
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:43,080
So y squared is going to equal
this side, 4-- 2 squared--

84
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,340
plus this side, 3 squared.

85
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:51,270
So y squared is going
to equal 4 plus 9.

86
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:55,510
y squared is going
to equal 13.

87
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:59,200
y is equal to the square
root of 13.

88
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,970
And that is choice A.

89
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,690
This was just straight up
Pythagorean theorem, nothing

90
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:07,210
tricky there, you just kind of
kind of chug through it.

91
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,420
I'm assuming I didn't
do something wrong.

92
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,745
Well anyway, let's assume that
and then move forward.

93
00:04:11,745 --> 00:04:17,820
   

94
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,650
I will now switch colors for
the sake of variety.

95
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:23,900
OK, number 3.

96
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,460
   

97
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,530
It says all numbers that are
divisible by both 2 and 6, are

98
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,180
also divisible by 4.

99
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,060
Right.

100
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,010
OK, that's cool.

101
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,370
Which of the following numbers
can be used to show that the

102
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,070
statement above is false?

103
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,760
So they're saying all numbers
that are divisible by both 2

104
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:53,470
and 6-- so this is what the
statement is saying.

105
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,700
Then it means that you're
going to be

106
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,320
divisible by 4, right?

107
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,580
So we want to prove that this
statement is wrong.

108
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,750
So what we have to find is, some
number that is divisible

109
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:09,720
by 2 and 6, that's not
divisible by 4.

110
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,210
And we could actually just
look at the choices.

111
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:19,150
They give us some choices,
4, 8, 12, 18, 24.

112
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,810
Well, 4 isn't even divisible
by 2 and 6, so

113
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,750
that doesn't work.

114
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,010
8 isn't even divisible by 2 and
6, so that doesn't work.

115
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:30,020
12 is divisible by 2 and 6, but
it's also divisible by 4,

116
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,400
so it doesn't disprove
this statement.

117
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,210
So, you can't say that.

118
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:38,900
18 is divisible by
2 and 6, right?

119
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,470
Is it divisible by 4?

120
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,590
No.

121
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,230
So this is our answer.

122
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,700
The example 18 is an example of
a number divisble by 2 and

123
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,880
6, and is not divisible by 4.

124
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,600
So this proves that this is
an incorrect statement.

125
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,850
Number 4.

126
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:58,640
   

127
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,640
In the figure above, let me draw
this figure above, and

128
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,890
I'll switch colors.

129
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:07,030
   

130
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:11,340
This is my rectangle, and then
there's going to be a circle.

131
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:17,126
   

132
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:20,330
I have a shaky hand.

133
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,040
The circle looks something
like that.

134
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,270
   

135
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:37,490
OK, and then we have side
B, A, C, and D.

136
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,810
It says, in the figure above,
the circle is tangent to sides

137
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,790
BC and AD-- tangent means
it just touches

138
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,960
at one point, right?

139
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,820
of the 8 by 12 rectangle ABCD.

140
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,800
So they're saying this is
an 8 by 12 rectangle.

141
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,160
And is it's approxmately drawn--
well can assume that

142
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,890
this is going to be the 8 side
and this is the 12 side

143
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,650
because it's longer.

144
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:03,290
What is the area
of the circle?

145
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,700
Well, what's the formula
for area of a circle?

146
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:11,476
Its area is equal to pi r
squared, where r is the radius

147
00:07:11,476 --> 00:07:13,010
of the circle.

148
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,830
So let's draw that radius
of the circle.

149
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,765
So the radius of the circle is
going to be this line right

150
00:07:18,765 --> 00:07:20,015
here, right?

151
00:07:20,015 --> 00:07:25,940
   

152
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,040
That's the radius, which
is half the diameter.

153
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,720
Well, what's the diameter?

154
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,030
Well, the diameter is
this whole length.

155
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,030
So the diameter is 8, right?

156
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,150
So the radius is going
to be half of 8.

157
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,080
So we know the radius
is 4, and then we

158
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,030
just use the formula.

159
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:42,580
We know this is going to be 4
because this is also 4, right?

160
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,810
This is also 4, because
its side is 8.

161
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,580
This top side could have been
12 billion units wide and it

162
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,230
wouldn't have mattered, right?

163
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:57,640
So we know the radius is 4, so
we say, area is equal to pi

164
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,450
times 4 squared.

165
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:07,680
Area is equal to 16 pi,
and that is choice A.

166
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,540
All right, the next problem
looks like it's more involved,

167
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,500
and I only have two minutes left
in this video, so I will

168
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,090
do it in the next video.

169
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,550
I'll see you soon.

170
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:16,833
