1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,850
At the beginning of the week,

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:03,783
Stewart's checking account had a balance

3
00:00:03,783 --> 00:00:07,200
of negative fifteen dollars and eight cents.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,800
On Monday morning he deposited a check

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,733
for four hundred twenty-six dollars and ninety cents.

6
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:15,488
On Tuesday morning he deposited another check

7
00:00:15,488 --> 00:00:17,160
for [one] hundred dollars.

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,692
How much was in Stewart's checking account

9
00:00:19,692 --> 00:00:24,861
after the second deposit, so after both of these deposits right over here?

10
00:00:24,861 --> 00:00:27,237
So, he starts off with a negative balance,

11
00:00:27,237 --> 00:00:28,200
so a negative balance means

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,131
that he's overdrawn his checking account.

13
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:32,017
He actually owes the bank money now.

14
00:00:32,017 --> 00:00:34,918
Luckily, he's now going to put some money in his bank account,

15
00:00:34,918 --> 00:00:38,615
so he'll actually have a positive balance in his checking account.

16
00:00:38,615 --> 00:00:43,467
So, he starts off with negative fifteen dollars and eight cents,

17
00:00:43,467 --> 00:00:45,302
and then to that, he adds

18
00:00:45,302 --> 00:00:49,889
four hundred twenty-six dollars and ninety cents.

19
00:00:49,889 --> 00:00:51,867
And then he adds another hundred dollars.

20
00:00:52,317 --> 00:00:59,791
So, he started off with negative fifteen dollars and eight cents,

21
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:03,507
and then to that, he adds four hundred twenty-six dollars

22
00:01:03,507 --> 00:01:04,867
and ninety cents and a hundred dollars.

23
00:01:04,867 --> 00:01:09,358
So, that's five hundred and twenty-six dollars and ninety cents.

24
00:01:09,358 --> 00:01:11,473
And so, how much is he going to have in his bank account?

25
00:01:11,473 --> 00:01:14,838
He started, owing fifteen dollars and eight cents,

26
00:01:14,838 --> 00:01:15,674
and then he's going to add

27
00:01:15,674 --> 00:01:18,832
five hundred twenty-six dollars and ninety cents.

28
00:01:18,832 --> 00:01:20,086
So, one way to visualize it,

29
00:01:20,086 --> 00:01:23,000
is if you think about it on the number line,

30
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,798
and this is zero right over here.

31
00:01:25,798 --> 00:01:31,000
He starts off at negative fifteen-point-zero-eight,

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,160
but then he's going to add

33
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,222
five hundred and twenty-six dollars [and ninety cents].

34
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:40,733
This is fifteen-point-zero-eight to the left,

35
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:41,817
that's how much he owes,

36
00:01:41,817 --> 00:01:43,631
and to that, he's going to add

37
00:01:43,631 --> 00:01:46,333
five hundred and twenty-six [dollars and ninety cents].

38
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:47,950
So, I'm not drawing this to scale,

39
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,203
but to that he's going to add

40
00:01:49,203 --> 00:01:54,358
five hundred and twenty-six dollars and ninety cents.

41
00:01:54,358 --> 00:01:55,962
So, the amount that he's going to be in the positive

42
00:01:55,962 --> 00:01:57,284
is going to be

43
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:59,420
five hundred twenty-six dollars and ninety cents,

44
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,021
minus the fifteen-point-zero-eight.

45
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:03,275
And, so, essentially it's going to be this length right over here,

46
00:02:03,275 --> 00:02:09,726
that's how much he's going to be in the positive,

47
00:02:09,726 --> 00:02:13,733
That's going to be five hundred twenty-six dollars and ninety cents,

48
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:16,510
minus fifteen dollars and eight cents.

49
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,467
So, that's going to be--

50
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:20,225
and we can even just rewrite this

51
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:21,851
so that it actually looks exactly like that.

52
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:24,219
That's the exactly the same thing as

53
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:26,495
five hundred twenty-six dollars and ninety cents,

54
00:02:26,495 --> 00:02:27,076
minus--

55
00:02:27,076 --> 00:02:27,656
minus--

56
00:02:27,656 --> 00:02:31,928
adding a negative is the same thing

57
00:02:31,928 --> 00:02:32,883
as subtracting a positive--

58
00:02:32,883 --> 00:02:35,267
minus fifteen-point-oh-eight.

59
00:02:35,267 --> 00:02:37,200
--I will do this in another color--

60
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,200
Five hundred and twenty-six dollars and ninety cents,

61
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,956
minus fifteen dollars and eight cents.

62
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:46,557
Let's see, zero is less than eight,

63
00:02:46,557 --> 00:02:48,972
let's make that a ten and borrow from this nine,

64
00:02:48,972 --> 00:02:50,551
so that becomes an eight--

65
00:02:50,551 --> 00:02:51,619
or I guess you could say, we are regrouping--

66
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:54,173
Everything up here is larger than everything there,

67
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,356
so ten minus eight is two,

68
00:02:56,356 --> 00:02:58,445
eight minus zero is eight,

69
00:02:58,445 --> 00:02:59,421
we have our decimal.

70
00:02:59,421 --> 00:03:01,603
Six minus five is one.

71
00:03:01,603 --> 00:03:04,111
Two minus one is one,

72
00:03:04,111 --> 00:03:06,067
and then you have five minus nothing.

73
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:07,640
So, he is left

74
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,733
with five hundred eleven dollars and eighty-two cents,

75
00:03:10,733 --> 99:59:59,999
after his second deposit.
