1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,570
   

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,260
Let's say I have a path in the
xy plane that's essentially

3
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:03,990
the unit circle.

4
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,860
   

5
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:15,080
So this is my y-axis, this is
my x-axis, and our path is

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,780
going to be the unit circle.

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:21,550
   

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,070
And we're going to traverse
it just like that.

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,940
We're going to traverse
it clockwise.

10
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:33,470
   

11
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,460
I think you get the idea.

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,530
And so its equation
is the units circle.

13
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,600
So the equation of this is x
squared plus y squared is

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,440
equal to 1; has a radius
of 1 unit circle.

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,690
And what we're concerned
with is the line integral

16
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,700
over this curve c.

17
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,310
It's a closed curve c.

18
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,580
   

19
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:11,400
It's actually going in that
direction of 2y dx minus 3x dy.

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,760
So, we are probably
tempted to use Green's

21
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,520
theorem and why not?

22
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,200
So let's try.

23
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,970
So this is our path.

24
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:25,510
So Green's theorem tells us
that the integral of some curve

25
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:33,640
f dot dr over some path where f
is equal to-- let me write

26
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,020
it a little nit neater.

27
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:46,650
Where f of x,y is equal to P
of x, y i plus Q of x, y j.

28
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:53,960
That this integral is equal to
the double integral over the

29
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,510
region-- this would be the
region under question

30
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,780
in this example.

31
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:10,140
Over the region of the partial
of Q with respect to x

32
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:18,170
minus the partial of
P with respect to y.

33
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:22,250
All of that dA, the
differential of area.

34
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,110
And of course, the region
is what I just showed you.

35
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:30,690
Now, you may or may not
remember-- well, there's a

36
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,500
slight, subtle thing in
this, which would give

37
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,590
you the wrong answer.

38
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,370
In the last video we said that
Green's theorem applies when

39
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,220
we're going counterclockwise.

40
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,905
Notice, even on this little
thing on the integral I made

41
00:02:40,905 --> 00:02:42,410
it go counterclockwise.

42
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,740
In our example, the
curve goes clockwise.

43
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,430
The region is to our right.

44
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,295
Green's theorem-- this applies
when the region is to our left.

45
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:55,620
   

46
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,000
So in this situation when the
region is to our right and

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,340
we're going-- so this
is counterclockwise.

48
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,020
   

49
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,140
So in our example, where we're
going clockwise, the region is

50
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,960
to our right, Green's theorem
is going to be the

51
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,730
negative of this.

52
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:14,970
So in our example, we're going
to have the integral of c and

53
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,670
we're going to go in the
clockwise direction.

54
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:21,910
So maybe I'll draw it like that
of f dot dr. This is going

55
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,000
to be equal to the double
integral over the region.

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,960
You could just swap these two--
the partial of P with respect

57
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:35,880
to y minus the partial of
Q with respect to x da.

58
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,650
So let's do that.

59
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,480
So this is going to be equal
to, in this example, the

60
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,420
integral over the region--
let's just keep it

61
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,000
abstract for now.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,420
We could start setting the
boundaries, but let's just

63
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,930
keep the region abstract.

64
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:51,790
And what is the partial of P
with respect-- let's remember,

65
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:55,650
this right here is our-- I
think we could recognize right

66
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,010
now that if we take f dot dr
we're going to get this.

67
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,940
The dr contributes
those components.

68
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,330
The f contributes
these two components.

69
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,570
So this is P of x,y.

70
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,370
   

71
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:13,370
And then this is Q of x,y.

72
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:13,865
And we've seen it.

73
00:04:13,865 --> 00:04:16,010
I don't want to go into the
whole dot dr and take the dot

74
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:16,950
product over and over again.

75
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,120
I think you can see that
this is the dot product

76
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,570
of two vectors.

77
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,310
This is the x component
of f, y component of f.

78
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:28,300
This is the x component of dr,
y component of dr. So let's

79
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,290
take the partial of P
with respect to y.

80
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,740
You take the derivative of this
with respect to y, you get 2.

81
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,740
Derivative of 2y is just 2.

82
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,590
So you get 2, and then,
minus the derivative of

83
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,270
Q with respect to x.

84
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,100
Derivative of this with
respect to x is minus 3.

85
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,800
So we're going to get minus
3, and then all of that da.

86
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,430
And this is equal to the
integral over the region.

87
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,540
What's this, it's
2 minus minus 3?

88
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,510
That's the same
thing as 2 plus 3.

89
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:01,190
So it's the integral over
the region of 5 dA.

90
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,280
5 is just a constant, so we can
take it out of the integral.

91
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,230
So this is going to turn out
to be quite a simple problem.

92
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:11,790
So this is going to be equal to
5 times the double integral

93
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,870
over the region R dA.

94
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,080
Now what is this thing?

95
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,610
What is this thing right here?

96
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,880
It looks very abstract,
but we can solve this.

97
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,770
This is just the
area of the region.

98
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,550
That's what that double
integral represents.

99
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,470
You just sum up all
the little dA's.

100
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,490
That's a dA, that's a dA.

101
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,270
You sum up the infinite
sums of those little

102
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,150
dA's over the region.

103
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,580
Well, what's the area
of this unit circle?

104
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,730
Here we just break out a little
bit of ninth grade-- actually,

105
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,630
even earlier than that--
pre-algebra or middle

106
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,860
school geometry.

107
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,960
Area is equal to pi r squared.

108
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,360
What's our radius?

109
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,800
So unit circle,
our radius is 1.

110
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,980
Length is 1.

111
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,200
So the area here is pi.

112
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,290
So this thing over here,
that whole thing is

113
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,350
just equal to pi.

114
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:06,460
So the answer to our line
integral is just 5 pi, which

115
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,570
is pretty straightforward.

116
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,420
I mean, we could have taken the
trouble of setting up a double

117
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,870
integral where we take the
antiderivative with respect to

118
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,990
y first and write y is equal to
the negative square root of 1

119
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,990
minus x squared y is equal to
the positive square root.

120
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,810
x goes from minus 1 to 1.

121
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:26,060
But that would have been
super hairy and a huge pain.

122
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,250
And we just have to realize,
no, this is just the area.

123
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,000
And the other interesting thing
is I challenge you to solve

124
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,170
the same integral without
using Green's theorem.

125
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:38,310
You know, after generating a
parameterization for this

126
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,230
curve, going in that direction,
taking the derivatives

127
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,660
of x of t and y of t.

128
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,880
Multiplying by the appropriate
thing and then taking the

129
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,540
antiderivative-- way hairier
than what we just did using

130
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,810
Green's theorem to get 5 pi.

131
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,645
And remember, the reason why
it wasn't minus 5 pi here

132
00:06:54,645 --> 00:06:57,980
is because we're going in
a clockwise direction.

133
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,040
If we were going in a
counterclockwise direction we

134
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,330
could have applied the straight
up Green's theorem, and we

135
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,200
would have gotten minus 5 pi.

136
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,530
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.

137
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:06,533
