1
00:00:00,395 --> 00:00:04,621
Part C, write but do not evaluate an integral expression

2
00:00:04,621 --> 00:00:07,733
for the volume of the solid generated when R -

3
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:09,868
- so that's this region right over here -

4
00:00:09,868 --> 00:00:14,884
when R is rotated about the horizontal line y=1.

5
00:00:14,884 --> 00:00:18,228
So y=1 is right over there.

6
00:00:18,228 --> 00:00:20,933
So, the way I like to think about it - let's think about

7
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:24,265
the volume if I were to just take the bottom function - if I were

8
00:00:24,265 --> 00:00:28,026
to just take f(x) - if I were to just take f(x) - and if I were

9
00:00:28,026 --> 00:00:32,400
to rotate that function around y=x - if I were to rotate

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,525
this thing around - sorry, around y=1 - what would

11
00:00:36,525 --> 00:00:39,636
the volume of that be, and then I'm going to subtract

12
00:00:39,636 --> 00:00:42,516
from that the volume if I were to take the top function - if

13
00:00:42,516 --> 00:00:44,652
I were to take g(x) and rotate it around.

14
00:00:44,652 --> 00:00:47,345
So let's first of all think about what volume I would get -

15
00:00:47,345 --> 00:00:49,342
and this is really the disk method, and I go into it

16
00:00:49,342 --> 00:00:51,525
in much more detail earlier in the calculus playlist, but

17
00:00:51,525 --> 00:00:54,265
let's think about the volume if f(x) is rotated around

18
00:00:54,265 --> 00:00:58,677
that axis. And to do that, let's imagine each of - each

19
00:00:58,677 --> 00:01:03,599
sliver of that volume. So this is - let me draw a little thing

20
00:01:03,599 --> 00:01:06,711
right over here - and you could imagine once this little

21
00:01:06,711 --> 00:01:11,216
silver is rotated it forms the bo- it forms the or you should -

22
00:01:11,216 --> 00:01:13,863
you could imagine - you could imagine - this length is

23
00:01:13,863 --> 00:01:17,733
the radius of a disk. And so - and just to imagine that

24
00:01:17,733 --> 00:01:19,807
let me draw the entire disk.

25
00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:22,361
So if this is rotated around - if this is rotated around

26
00:01:22,361 --> 00:01:27,655
it will become a disk - it will become a disk - it will

27
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:31,278
become a disk that looks something like that, and

28
00:01:31,278 --> 00:01:36,340
I'll just call the depth of the disk - so the disk if you

29
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,337
imagine it a coin this is kind of the side of the coin,

30
00:01:38,337 --> 00:01:42,330
the depth of the coin - the depth of the coin right over there.

31
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:47,021
I know I can draw that better than that. So the depth

32
00:01:47,021 --> 00:01:51,990
of the coin is just like that. It's a fixed depth, and I'm going

33
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,008
to call that dx - so it's just this distance right over here

34
00:01:55,008 --> 00:01:59,095
it is the dx - and what is going to be the area of that coin?

35
00:01:59,095 --> 00:02:02,346
Well the area of the surface of this is coin - so let me -

36
00:02:02,346 --> 00:02:07,083
let me do it like this... in a different color. So I want to

37
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:11,355
do it in blue - the area of this coin is just pi times the radius

38
00:02:11,355 --> 00:02:15,024
of that coin, squared. And what is the radius of the coin?

39
00:02:15,024 --> 00:02:18,089
Well, the radius of the coin is this height - is this

40
00:02:18,089 --> 00:02:20,467
height right over here. And what is that height?

41
00:02:20,467 --> 00:02:26,123
Well it is 1-f(x). So that is equal to the radius.

42
00:02:26,123 --> 00:02:30,495
So the area - the surf- the area - the kind of the face

43
00:02:30,495 --> 00:02:32,795
of this coin is going to be pi - the area of the face of this

44
00:02:35,086 --> 00:02:39,033
coin is going to be pi times the radius squared,

45
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:46,092
which is equal to pi times one minus f of x - one minus f of x squared -

46
00:02:46,092 --> 00:02:49,111
that's this blue area right over here, and if I want to

47
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:52,269
find the volume of this coin I would multiply it by -

48
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:56,913
by the depth of the coin. So times - so times dx.

49
00:02:56,913 --> 00:03:00,767
And if I wanted to find the volume of this entire solid -

50
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:04,761
this entire rotated, i would want to find the sum of

51
00:03:04,761 --> 00:03:06,467
all of these volumes. So this is just the disk right

52
00:03:06,467 --> 00:03:09,359
over here but I can have another disk, a similar

53
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:12,749
disk that I do right over here, I could have another

54
00:03:12,749 --> 00:03:15,133
disk right over here, and I want to take the sum

55
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:19,668
of ALL of those disks. So I want to take - I want to

56
00:03:19,668 --> 00:03:22,594
take - so the volume is going to be the sum over all

57
00:03:22,594 --> 00:03:26,495
of those disks - so x goes from 0 - which is this bounding

58
00:03:26,495 --> 00:03:35,272
point - to x is equal to 1/2, times pi(1-f(x))^2 - this is

59
00:03:35,272 --> 00:03:39,266
the area of e- the fa- the area of the face of each of those disks

60
00:03:39,266 --> 00:03:41,774
and then I multiply time the depth of each of those disks -

61
00:03:41,774 --> 00:03:44,282
no this gives the volume of each of those disks, and

62
00:03:44,282 --> 00:03:46,418
I'm taking the sum of all of them.

63
00:03:46,418 --> 00:03:49,436
So this is the volume - this is the volume if I were to just

64
00:03:49,436 --> 00:03:54,034
rotate f(x) around y=1 - actually I should just write

65
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:57,424
dx here - and so this right over here - this expression -

66
00:03:57,424 --> 00:04:00,721
I just did that so they really are equal - this is

67
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:02,733
obviously just the volume of each of those disks.

68
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:07,037
So this is the volume if I were to take f(x) around y=1.

69
00:04:07,037 --> 00:04:10,752
Let's figure out - so let me call this volume of f(x) -

70
00:04:10,752 --> 00:04:14,096
and by the same logic - the same exact logic - we can

71
00:04:14,096 --> 00:04:18,200
figure out the volume if we take g(x) - if we rotate g(x)

72
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:23,268
around - if we rotate g(x) - if we construct disks like this

73
00:04:23,268 --> 00:04:27,819
and rotate them around y=1. And so the volume -

74
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:33,438
if I take g(x) around y=1 would be 0 to 1/2 times

75
00:04:33,438 --> 00:04:39,011
pi(1-g(x) - cause 1-g(x) is each of these radius' right

76
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:44,166
over here - each of these radius' - that squared, dx.

77
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:47,138
And so the volume of what they're asking us - the

78
00:04:47,138 --> 00:04:50,389
volume of the solid generated when R is rotated - well

79
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:53,872
R is kind of the space in between f(x) and g(x) - so

80
00:04:53,872 --> 00:04:56,449
so what's going to be - is g- the volume is going

81
00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:58,771
to be the difference between these volumes - it's

82
00:04:58,771 --> 00:05:01,093
going to be this volume - this is kind of the outer

83
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:03,183
volume, and we're going to take out its hollow core -

84
00:05:03,183 --> 00:05:05,459
we're going to hollow it out be subtracting this volume.

85
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:08,524
So the volume of that region is going to be the integral -

86
00:05:08,524 --> 00:05:13,028
I'll do this in a new color - integral from 0 to 1/2 of

87
00:05:13,028 --> 00:05:25,149
pi(1-f(x))^2 dx MINUS the integral from 0 to 1/2 of pi(1-g(x))^2 dx

88
00:05:25,149 --> 00:05:28,200
and this is completely valid answer but you might want to simplify it

89
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,022
we have the same bounds of integration - we have the same

90
00:05:32,022 --> 00:05:34,530
variable of integration - and actually we have this pi over here

91
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,805
so we could just factor that out - and so this is

92
00:05:36,805 --> 00:05:40,196
the same thing as pi times the integral from 0 to 1/2

93
00:05:40,196 --> 00:05:49,994
of (1-f(x))^2 MINUS (1-g(x))^2 -

94
00:05:49,994 --> 00:05:55,428
and then all of that dx. And then - and actually you probably

95
00:05:55,428 --> 00:05:57,146
would want to do the - you probably would want to do

96
00:05:57,146 --> 00:06:00,258
this while taking the AP Exam, not just leaving it in

97
00:06:00,258 --> 00:06:02,200
terms of f(x) and g(x) - you would actually want to write

98
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,388
the expression for what f(x)... f(x) and g(x) are.

99
00:06:06,388 --> 00:06:08,803
So really the best answer would probably be:

100
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:12,843
pi times the integral from 0 to 1/2, times

101
00:06:12,843 --> 00:06:18,694
[1(1-... well f(x) is 8x to the third power - 8x to the

102
00:06:18,694 --> 00:06:23,152
third power, squared. Minus, (1-g(x)... and g(x) is

103
00:06:23,152 --> 00:06:30,165
sin of pi x. That squared - that squared times dx.

104
00:06:30,165 --> 00:06:33,137
And that would be our answer and you could see why

105
00:06:33,137 --> 00:06:34,670
they didn't want us to go through the trouble

106
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,434
of evaluating it - they just wanted us to set up

107
00:06:36,434 --> 99:59:59,999
this integral.
