1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:01,690
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:03,180
Well we're now on number 4.

3
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,000
And just so you know how considerate I am of your time,

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,510
I drew this very fancy graphic before the video just so not

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,790
to waste your valuable time.

6
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:13,970
So let's read the question.

7
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:18,270
This is the graph that they--and this X right here is

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,520
number of children.

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,280
And these are years.

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,120
So the question says, the graph above shows how the

11
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:34,270
Jackson family continued to grow between 1991 and 1998 by

12
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,980
indicating the total number of children in the family at the

13
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,450
end of each year.

14
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:42,070
The Jackson's have one set of twins who were born to Miss

15
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:45,460
Jackson one year-- because they couldn't have been born

16
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,850
to Mr. Jackson-- who
are born to Miss

17
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,700
Jackson one year in July.

18
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,170
During what year were
the twins born?

19
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,020
Well let's see, this graph, you see the years, each year

20
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,320
they say how many children
are in the family.

21
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,850
So we can figure out how many children are born in each year

22
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:05,220
just by figuring out how much does the graph move up.

23
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,450
For example, there were-- let me say children born.

24
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:14,020
And you could do this in your head during the exam because

25
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,270
you have to do it really, really
fast. But I'll explain

26
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,510
it a little bit more basically
so that you can make

27
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,680
sure you get it.

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,610
So in 1991 were any
children born?

29
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,290
Well no, because they
had no children.

30
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,970
In '92 they went from
having 0 children in

31
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,520
'91 to having 1 child.

32
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,150
So the 1 child was born in
'92, and then how many

33
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,700
children were born in '93?

34
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,240
Well they had 1 child in '92 and
they had 1 child in '93,

35
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,870
so no children were
born in '93.

36
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,750
I think you see what
I'm doing.

37
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,210
I'm getting the difference between one year and the next

38
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,240
because that's how
many children are

39
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,420
born in that year.

40
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,510
From '93 to '94, we went from 1 to 2 children, so 1 child

41
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,470
was born that year.

42
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,170
So there was 1 child born.

43
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,630
Same thing in '95.

44
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,830
The number of children
increased by 1.

45
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,710
So there was 1 child born.

46
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,180
'96, the number of children
stayed the same.

47
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,260
No new children were born.

48
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,220
We had 3 at the end of
'95, and we had 3

49
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,100
at the end of '96.

50
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,500
So no new children were born.

51
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,199
So that's a 0.

52
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,986
And then in '97, we go from having 3 children at the end

53
00:02:11,986 --> 00:02:14,300
of '96 to having 5.

54
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,640
So 2 children must have
been born that year.

55
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,620
And then in '98, we had the same number of children.

56
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,950
And of course, they should have said in the question, but

57
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,780
we can assume that no children
died during the

58
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,650
course of this problem.

59
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,320
I don't want to be morbid.

60
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,890
But anyway, so no children
were born in '98, so 0.

61
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,850
So the question is, what year were the twins born?

62
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,930
Well twins, that's 2 children,
if my biology is correct.

63
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,500
So the year is 1997, which
is choice number D.

64
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,600
I feel very bad having to erase
this beautiful drawing,

65
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,695
but the things I do in the
name of education.

66
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,780
Number 5-- no drawing
for Sal in number 5.

67
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,860
The average arithmetic
mean of X and Y is 5.

68
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:08,940
So average-- let me write mean because if has fewer letters.

69
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,610
They should have another math term called nice I think.

70
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:17,270
But the mean of x and
y is equal to 5.

71
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,100
And what does that mean?

72
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,540
That means that the average-- so we also know that x plus y

73
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,750
over 2 is equal to 5-- I just took the average of them.

74
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,100
And the average of
x, y and z is 8.

75
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,870
What is the value of z?

76
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,950
Fascinating.

77
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:42,790
So we also know that the mean of x, y and z is equal to 8.

78
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,930
And then they want to
know what is z?

79
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,750
Well the mean of x, y and z is equal to 8-- that's just if we

80
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,580
took the average of them.

81
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:59,190
That's x plus y plus z
over 3 is equal to 8.

82
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,500
This is the exact same
way of saying this.

83
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,470
You can review the average
play-- I think it's in my

84
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,630
pre-algebra playlist
if you don't

85
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,210
remember how to take averages.

86
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:11,570
But how do we solve for z here, because we have three

87
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,850
variables and only two
equations, it seems very

88
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:14,850
complicated.

89
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,600
But I'll show you a trick,
and this is actually a

90
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,750
very common SAT trick.

91
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,360
So you take this first equation
and we can't solve

92
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,380
for x and we can't solve
for y, but we can

93
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,790
solve for x plus y.

94
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:31,590
So we just multiply both sides of that equation by 2 and we

95
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:36,350
get x plus y is equal to 10.

96
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:41,640
x plus y is equal to 10.

97
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:47,960
And then we can substitute the whole x plus y here.

98
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,050
This is something you seldom see in your algebra classes

99
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,540
because you're always solving for one variable for other.

100
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,170
Now you can almost use x
plus y as a variable.

101
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,610
Like the whole thing
is a variable.

102
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,200
It's kind of strange,
but that's

103
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,550
how you do this problem.

104
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,050
Algebra, there's nothing
fancy here.

105
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,510
I'm saying x plus y is equal to 10, literally in English.

106
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,600
So we could say well this
x plus y is equal to 10.

107
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:17,540
So we could re-write this top
equation as 10 plus z over 3

108
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,460
is equal to 8.

109
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:25,250
And then if we multiply both sides by 3 you get 10 plus z

110
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,750
is equal to 24.

111
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,600
And then you subtract 10 from both sides and you get z is

112
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,170
equal to 14, and we are done.

113
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,620
That wasn't too bad, was it?

114
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,130
Good, the choice exists,
choice B for number 5.

115
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,050
All right, number 6.

116
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:40,540
So I'm drawing for Sal.

117
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,490
I like these, these are fun.

118
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,740
Let me draw in magenta.

119
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,930
That's the big figure.

120
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,900
In the figure above-- I don't know how to change my

121
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,150
background color.

122
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,500
In the figure above,
a small square is

123
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,990
inside a larger square.

124
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,080
What is the area in terms of x of the shaded region?

125
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:24,390
Well let me just work with what I have. So they have a

126
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,040
smaller one here,
then a smaller.

127
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,040
And then let me use
this thing.

128
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,270
Create a shaded region.

129
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,400
Let me create a shaded region.

130
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,665
Look at that-- look at the
amazing tool I'm using.

131
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:40,005
It's called paint.

132
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,580
So what was I doing.

133
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,380
Oh, this is x.

134
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,040
Oh, I'm using the same color.

135
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,480
Let me use a vivid color.

136
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,300
One side of this is x, one
side of this is x.

137
00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:00,420
And then the sides of the
big square are 5 and 5.

138
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,490
And they just want to know, what is the area in terms of x

139
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,990
of the shaded region?

140
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,700
Well the shaded region, that's this brown area, the area of

141
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,490
that is going to be the area of this entire square minus

142
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,590
the area of the smaller square, right, because we took

143
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:17,390
this out of the shaded region.

144
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:21,180
So the area of the big square--
well the area of a

145
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,500
square or a rectangle is just the height times the width.

146
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,570
So that's 5 times 5, so it's 25, minus the area of the

147
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:30,880
smaller square.

148
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,140
And that's just going to be x times x, which is x squared.

149
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,580
That equals the area, and
that is choice E.

150
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,070
All that drawing for such
an easy problem.

151
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,860
I hope you don't find that I'm being cocky when I call it an

152
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,750
easy problem.

153
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,820
If you find it difficult,
it wasn't that easy, I

154
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,440
understand.

155
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,650
Anyway, number 7.

156
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,810
Let me erase my drawing.

157
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,130
If rstv equals 1.

158
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,380
Let me write that down.

159
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,455
And stuv equals 0.

160
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,970
Which of the following
must be true?

161
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:19,980
Let me write these down.

162
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:23,130
So they're saying choice
A-- I'm going to

163
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,150
write all the choices.

164
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:31,650
Choice A, r is less than 1.

165
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:36,960
Choice B is s is less than 1.

166
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:44,260
Choice C is t is greater
than 1/2.

167
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:50,790
Choice D, u is equal to 0.

168
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:57,480
And choice E, v is equal to 0.

169
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,500
So which of the following
must be true?

170
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,890
Well the first thing we know, we know rstv is equal to 1.

171
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:09,270
So we know that none of rst or v can be 0, because if any of

172
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,180
them were 0 than when you multiply them out, they

173
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,190
couldn't equal 0, right?

174
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:19,310
So rstv all must be
some non-0 number.

175
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:23,000
So if we go back here, we know that s is non-- and then if we

176
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,940
go into this equation we know that one of them must be 0, at

177
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,880
least 1, because when you multiply them you get 0.

178
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,430
Because 0 times any
number is 0.

179
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:38,630
So we know that s is not
0 because it's up here.

180
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,990
Because we said all of these numbers cannot be 0.

181
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,250
We know t cannot be 0 because
it's up here.

182
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,230
Because if it was 0, this
would have been 0.

183
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,800
And we know v cannot be 0
because it's up here.

184
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,080
And all we're left with is
that u is equal to 0.

185
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,460
I'll see you in the
next video.
