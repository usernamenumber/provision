1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,333
You have 8 coins in a bag

2
00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:09,375
Three of them are unfair in that they have a 60% chance of coming up heads when flipped

3
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:11,736
The rest are fair coins

4
00:00:11,752 --> 00:00:14,605
So 3 are unfair, the rest are 8 coins

5
00:00:14,605 --> 00:00:15,436
When I say,

6
00:00:15,436 --> 00:00:17,417
or when this problem says that they are fair coins,

7
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:22,152
It means that they have a 50/50 chance of coming up either heads or tails

8
00:00:22,152 --> 00:00:25,575
You randomly choose one coin from the bag

9
00:00:25,575 --> 00:00:27,000
and flip it two times

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,800
What is the percent probability of getting 2 heads?

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,087
This is an interesting question

12
00:00:34,087 --> 00:00:36,667
but if we break it down essentially with the decision tree

13
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:39,133
it will help break it down a bit better

14
00:00:39,133 --> 00:00:40,467
So let's say that

15
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:42,133
So we have a bag

16
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:43,400
three of them are unfair

17
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,267
So we can do is visualize the bag

18
00:00:45,267 --> 00:00:46,867
You don't have to do this all the time

19
00:00:46,867 --> 00:00:48,200
So we have

20
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,733
I'll do the fair coins in white

21
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:54,600
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 fair coins

22
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,467
And we have three unfair coins

23
00:00:56,467 --> 00:00:58,467
1, 2, 3

24
00:00:58,467 --> 00:01:01,400
This whole thing is my bag right over here

25
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,467
That is my bag of coins

26
00:01:03,467 --> 00:01:04,267
If I were to

27
00:01:04,267 --> 00:01:05,133
When I take my hand in,

28
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:07,067
if I were to take any of these white coins,

29
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,733
there's a 50% chance that it gets heads on any flip

30
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:14,867
The odds of getting two heads in a row would be 50% times 50%

31
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,067
for these white coins

32
00:01:16,067 --> 00:01:18,133
But I don't know if I'm going to get a white coin

33
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:21,733
If I get one of these orange coins, I have a 60% chance

34
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:22,533
of coming up heads

35
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:24,600
And the odds of coming up 60% heads

36
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,138
if I have picked one of these orange coins

37
00:01:28,138 --> 00:01:29,631
The probability of getting heads twice

38
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,200
would be 60% times 60%

39
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,867
So how do I factor in this idea

40
00:01:34,867 --> 00:01:37,200
that I don't know if I've picked a

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,400
white fair coin or an orange unfair coin

42
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,308
Well we'll assume that the coins actually aren't white and orange

43
00:01:43,308 --> 00:01:45,082
They all look like regular coins

44
00:01:45,082 --> 00:01:46,877
So what I'll do is I'll draw

45
00:01:46,877 --> 00:01:49,667
a little bit of a decision tree here

46
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:52,267
And maybe I'll call it a probability tree

47
00:01:52,267 --> 00:01:59,210
So there's some probability that I pick a fair coin

48
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:04,129
And there's some probability that I pick an unfair coin

49
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:07,533
And so what is the probability that I pick a fair coin

50
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:13,708
Well; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 out of the total 8 coins are fair

51
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:18,790
So there is a 5/8 probability

52
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,133
I'll write it here on the branch actually

53
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:25,000
So there's a 5/8 chance that I pick a fair coin

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,400
And then there is a 3

55
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,882
1, 2, 3 out of 8 chance that I pick an unfair coin

56
00:02:30,882 --> 00:02:33,195
So if I were just to tell you what's the probablity

57
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:34,929
of picking a fair coin you'd say, oh 5/8!

58
00:02:34,929 --> 00:02:36,852
So what's the probability of an unfair coin? 3/8

59
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:37,985
And you could convert that to a

60
00:02:37,985 --> 00:02:40,431
decimal or a percentage or whatever you like

61
00:02:40,431 --> 00:02:41,225
Now,

62
00:02:41,225 --> 00:02:44,133
given that I have picked a fair coin

63
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:47,400
What is the probability that I,

64
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,800
that I will get heads twice

65
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,467
So, let me write it this way

66
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:54,600
This is just notation right here

67
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,662
So the probability of,

68
00:02:56,662 --> 00:02:58,800
I'll call it heads heads

69
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,595
So I get two heads in a row

70
00:03:00,595 --> 00:03:07,021
Given that I have a fair coin

71
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:08,918
It looks like very fancy notation

72
00:03:08,918 --> 00:03:09,729
but it's just like look

73
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:12,271
If you knew for a fact that that coin

74
00:03:12,271 --> 00:03:14,267
you had is absolutely fair

75
00:03:14,267 --> 00:03:16,800
That it has a 50% chance of coming up heads,

76
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,733
what is the probability of getting two heads in a row?

77
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,082
Well then, we can just say,

78
00:03:21,082 --> 00:03:22,400
well that's just going to be

79
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,902
50%

80
00:03:23,902 --> 00:03:29,825
So 50% times 50%

81
00:03:29,825 --> 00:03:35,221
Which is equal to 25%

82
00:03:35,221 --> 00:03:39,452
Now, what is the probability that you

83
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,590
So if you want to know what is the probability

84
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,200
that you picked a fair coin

85
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,467
and you got two heads in a row

86
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:49,898
So given that you have a fair coin, with a 25% chance

87
00:03:49,898 --> 00:03:51,569
that you have 2 heads in a row

88
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:53,667
For the probability of picking a fair coin

89
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:56,975
and then given the fair coin get two heads in a row

90
00:03:56,975 --> 00:03:59,800
will be the 5 eighths times the 25%

91
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,467
So the probability,

92
00:04:01,467 --> 00:04:04,000
So this whole branch,

93
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,508
I should be able to draw it this way

94
00:04:05,508 --> 00:04:09,071
The probability of this whole series of events happening

95
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:11,200
So starting with you picking the fair coin

96
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,933
and then getting two heads in a row

97
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:13,867
Will be

98
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:15,800
I'll write it this way

99
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,410
It will be

100
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:20,933
5/8 times this right over here

101
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:25,400
times the 0.25

102
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,600
I want to make it very clear

103
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,867
the 0.25 is the probability of getting two heads in a row

104
00:04:29,867 --> 00:04:33,200
given that you knew you got a fair coin

105
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,800
For the probability of this whole series of events happening,

106
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,867
you would have to multiply this

107
00:04:36,867 --> 00:04:41,333
times the probability that you actually got a fair coin

108
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:44,036
So another way of thinking about it is

109
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:50,677
this is the probability that you got a fair coin

110
00:04:50,677 --> 00:04:55,492
and you have two heads in a row

111
00:04:55,492 --> 00:04:59,175
Now let's just do the same thing for the unfair coin

112
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:00,533
So the probability

113
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:03,431
I'll do that in the same color

114
00:05:03,446 --> 00:05:06,354
The probability that I get heads heads

115
00:05:06,354 --> 00:05:11,298
given that my coin is unfair

116
00:05:11,298 --> 00:05:14,533
So if you were to somehow know that your coin is unfair,

117
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:18,733
what is the probability of getting two heads in a row?

118
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:21,769
Well this unfair coin has a 60% chance

119
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:23,067
of coming up heads

120
00:05:23,067 --> 00:05:25,467
So it will be equal to

121
00:05:25,467 --> 00:05:29,667
0.6 times 0.6

122
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:32,559
which is 0.36

123
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:34,487
So if you have an unfair coin

124
00:05:34,487 --> 00:05:37,067
if you know for a fact you have an unfair coin

125
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:38,133
that is a given,

126
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:42,600
you have a 36% chance of getting two heads in a row

127
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,056
Now if you want to know the probability

128
00:05:44,056 --> 00:05:45,800
of this whole series of events

129
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,000
The probability that you picked an unfair coin

130
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,400
and you get two heads in a row

131
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,800
So the probability of unfair

132
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,333
unfair and two heads in a row

133
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,800
given that you had an unfair coin

134
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,559
You would multiply this 3/8 times the 0.36

135
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:10,375
So this will be equal to

136
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:17,467
the 3/8 times 0.36

137
00:06:17,467 --> 00:06:19,333
And so let's get a calculator out

138
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,600
to calculate these

139
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:29,800
So if I take 5 divided by 8 times 0.25,

140
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,267
I get fifteen point--

141
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,533
I'll just write it as a decimal

142
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:36,615
0.15625

143
00:06:36,615 --> 00:06:40,528
So this is equal to 0.15625

144
00:06:40,528 --> 00:06:43,333
And then if I do the other part

145
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:50,333
so if I have 3 divided by 8 times 0.36,

146
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:53,867
that gives me 0.135

147
00:06:53,867 --> 00:06:57,267
So this is 0.135

148
00:06:57,267 --> 00:06:58,887
So if someone were to ask you

149
00:06:58,887 --> 00:07:01,933
what's the probability of picking a fair coin

150
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:04,867
and then getting two heads in a row with that fair coin,

151
00:07:04,867 --> 00:07:06,185
you would get this number

152
00:07:06,185 --> 00:07:07,862
If someone were to say what's the probability

153
00:07:07,862 --> 00:07:09,605
you pick the unfair coin

154
00:07:09,605 --> 00:07:12,159
and then get two heads in a row with that unfair coin

155
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,729
you would get this number

156
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:15,082
Now, if someone were to say

157
00:07:15,082 --> 00:07:17,425
either way,

158
00:07:17,425 --> 00:07:20,067
what's the probability of getting two heads in a row

159
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:21,533
because that's what they're asking us here

160
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:24,000
What is the probability of getting 2 heads?

161
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,267
So we could get it through this method

162
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:28,467
by chance picking the fair coin

163
00:07:28,467 --> 00:07:29,800
Or through this method

164
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
by chance picking the unfair coin

165
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,600
So since we can do it either way,

166
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,333
we can sum up the probabilites

167
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:39,400
Either of these events meet our constraints

168
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,933
so we can just add these two things up

169
00:07:41,933 --> 00:07:43,267
So let's do that

170
00:07:43,267 --> 00:07:47,133
So we can add 0.135

171
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:52,133
plus 0.15625

172
00:07:52,133 --> 00:07:55,333
gives us 0.29125

173
00:07:55,333 --> 00:08:00,467
So 0.29125

174
00:08:00,467 --> 00:08:09,231
That's when we add 0.15625 plus 0.135 will equal this

175
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:11,133
And if you want to write it as a percentage,

176
00:08:11,133 --> 00:08:14,431
you essentially just multiply this times a 100

177
00:08:14,431 --> 00:08:16,667
and add the percentage sign there

178
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:22,533
So this is equal to 29.125% or if we were to round

179
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:25,200
to the nearest hundredths then this would be,

180
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,815
well this would be the exact number

181
00:08:26,815 --> 00:08:30,533
or we could say it's the approximately 29.13%

182
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:33,067
depending on how much we need to round it

183
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:36,533
So we have a little less than a third chance of this happening

184
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:37,800
And the reason why,

185
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,200
remember if it was a fair coin,

186
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
there would only be,

187
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,200
if everything in the bag was a fair coin,

188
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,000
there'd be a 25% chance of this happening

189
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Because you would just say okay,

190
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,867
any of these

191
00:08:46,867 --> 00:08:48,400
They're all the same,

192
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,467
flip it twice

193
00:08:49,467 --> 00:08:51,200
25% chance

194
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,933
Our chances is a little bit higher

195
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,200
because there's some probability

196
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,000
There's a 3/8 chance that we pick a coin

197
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,261
that has a higher than even chance of coming up heads
