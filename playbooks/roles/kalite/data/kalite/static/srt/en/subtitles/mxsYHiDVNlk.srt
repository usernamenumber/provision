1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,480
Welcome.

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:04,160
Well there's been a lot of news
lately about what's going

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,850
on with Bear Stearns and
Carlyle Capital.

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,080
And I go to these parties, and
I start explaining to people

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,000
because it's very exciting.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,520
It's actually very important,
to all of our collective

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,890
futures and the whole health of
the financial system, and I

8
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,790
feel like people's eyes
start to glaze over.

9
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,330
So with that in mind, I decided
to take a little bit

10
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,820
of a hiatus from the core math
and physics videos, and

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,250
actually do some accounting
and finance videos.

12
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,700
Because I think what's happening
in the world right

13
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,560
now is extremely important.

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,090
And I'm not just going to go
straight into what's going

15
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,770
into Carlyle and Thornburg and
all of these characters.

16
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,900
Because I think the newspapers
do that, but a lot of people

17
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,650
don't understand the
basic accounting.

18
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,490
What is a write-down, what does
it mean when you don't

19
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,630
have liquidity, in really
tangible ways.

20
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,500
So I'm going to use the same
Khan Academy techniques to

21
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,130
hopefully explain
some of this.

22
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,080
So I'm going to start with just
a very basic accounting

23
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,470
concept of the balance sheet.

24
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,210
You might have a sense
of what it is.

25
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:57,980
So let's say a scenario.

26
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,060
Let's say I want
to buy a house.

27
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,780
So this is, let me
draw a house.

28
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,650
So let's say this is the
house I want to buy.

29
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,540
And the owner of this house
is asking for $1

30
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,790
million for this house.

31
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,420
And I like the house, and I
think that's a fair price.

32
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,092
Other houses in the neighborhood
also went for $1

33
00:01:13,092 --> 00:01:14,180
million, whatever.

34
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,230
Maybe they went for more,
so I think it's

35
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,620
actually a good deal.

36
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:30,320
But all I have in my pocket is,
let's say I have $250,000.

37
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,680
So what I'm going to do is, I'm
going to create my balance

38
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,520
sheet before I do anything.

39
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,720
Before I go to try
to get the house.

40
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,170
What is my before-house
balance sheet?

41
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,290
What are my assets?

42
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,540
I'm going to write
down Assets.

43
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,700
Well before we know what my
assets are, let me tell you

44
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,510
what an asset is.

45
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:55,040
An asset is something that's
going to give you some future

46
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,200
economic benefit.

47
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,250
So for example, cash
is an asset.

48
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,220
Why is cash an asset?

49
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,720
Because in the future you can
use that cash to get stuff

50
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,170
from people, or make them
do things, or buy stuff.

51
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,570
You can, in a month from now,
you can use your cash.

52
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,620
And you can make someone
dance for you.

53
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,290
Or you can buy a car, or
you can go on vacation.

54
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,430
So there's all sorts of
things you can do.

55
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,010
I don't know if someone dancing
for you is an actual

56
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,260
economic benefit, but
you get the idea.

57
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,820
So cash could be an asset.

58
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,020
A house could be an asset,
because the economic benefit

59
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,730
you get in the future is, you
get to live in it, and not

60
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,190
freeze when it's freezing
outside.

61
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,690
So that's what an asset is.

62
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,760
So what are my assets, before
I buy the house, or get a

63
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,650
loan, or all of the things
that are about to happen?

64
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:43,550
Well I have cash, I have
$250,000 worth of cash.

65
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,000
What are my liabilities?

66
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,980
I'm going to write the
liabilities on

67
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,470
the left-hand side.

68
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,180
I think that's the convention,
but I forget.

69
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,460
It doesn't matter.

70
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,270
What are my liabilities?

71
00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:00,320
Well, a liability is something
that's an economic obligation

72
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,270
to someone else.

73
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,370
So if I take a loan from
someone, I owe them interest,

74
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,610
or I have to pay them back
the actual value of

75
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,790
the loan one day.

76
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,990
Say I have an IOU where I
promise to dance for someone

77
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,880
in the future.

78
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,250
That could be a liability.

79
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,140
It'd be hard to value, but
that's something that I have

80
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,550
to do in the future.

81
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,690
But what are my liabilities
here?

82
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:21,420
Well in the example I gave, I'm
just Sal, I have no debt,

83
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,860
I paid off my college
loans, everything.

84
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,850
And I have $250,000 in cash.

85
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,440
So what are my liabilities
before I buy the house?

86
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,290
Well, nothing.

87
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,810
I don't have any liabilities.

88
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,260
I don't owe anybody anything.

89
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,320
And that's, actually,
that to me is the

90
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,360
definition of freedom.

91
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,580
So I have zero liability.

92
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,630
So what is my equity?

93
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,630
And you've probably heard this
word, people borrowing their

94
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,010
equity, and all of
these things.

95
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,510
So I'm going to give you a
little equation, actually,

96
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,340
just to take a little
bit of a tangent.

97
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:56,020
That assets, A for assets,
is equal to

98
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,900
liabilities plus equity.

99
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,890
So in this case, our assets
are $250,000.

100
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:06,810
My liabilities are what?

101
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,130
I owe nothing to nobody.

102
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,510
I don't know if that was
correct, but anyway.

103
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,200
I owe nothing to anyone.

104
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,270
So my liabilities are zero.

105
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:23,000
So my equity must be $250,000.

106
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,450
So in this case, if I made a
balance sheet before I enter

107
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,430
into any transactions -- let me
make it look a little bit

108
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,380
like a balance sheet.

109
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,100
My assets are $250,000.

110
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,630
I have no liabilities.

111
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:40,610
And then my equity would
be $250,000.

112
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,380
And if I were to draw this
graphically-- actually, I

113
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,210
should probably draw
it like this.

114
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:43,770
I have no liabilities.

115
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,180
So let me draw another little
mini balance sheet here.

116
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,700
That's a neat square.

117
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,200
You probably can't
see that square.

118
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,270
So I put my assets on
the right-hand side.

119
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,370
And I'll say, there, I have
$250,000 of cash.

120
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,100
And on the left-hand side,
I have no liabilities.

121
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,520
And I'll just say I have equity,
I have $250,000.

122
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,510
Now, equity might not make a lot
of sense to you right now,

123
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,010
because I'm just saying, well,
my equity is equal to my cash.

124
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,060
in general, equity is
just what you own.

125
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,890
After all of your assets and
liabilities are kind of

126
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,190
resolved, or they're
cleared up, what do

127
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,410
you have left over?

128
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,270
That's equity.

129
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,020
So in this situation, after I
pay off all of my debts, what

130
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,860
do I have left over?

131
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,080
Well I have no debts, so I have
$250,000 in cash, total.

132
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,020
This will start to make sense
when I go to the bank now to

133
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,060
get a loan to buy this house.

134
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,190
So this house is a $1 million
house, right?

135
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,770
So how much of a
loan do I need?

136
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,780
Well, I have $250,000 cash, so
I'll go to the bank for a loan

137
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,490
for the remainder,
for $750,000.

138
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:49,650
So let me draw the bank.

139
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,650
This is the bank.

140
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,610
The big dollar sign is made out
of granite, to show you

141
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,690
that it can never fail.

142
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,700
It's going to be there forever,
even if they do silly

143
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,890
things, like-- well I won't go
into all the silly things that

144
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,410
they do, but they do
many silly things.

145
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,570
We'll go into that later.

146
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:12,380
But the bank is going to give
me another $750,000 in cash.

147
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:17,700
And in return, I'm giving
them essentially an IOU.

148
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,090
And I'm going to pay interest.
So they're going to hold this

149
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:23,960
little security that says,
Sal owes me $750,000.

150
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,290
And he has to give me 10%
interest every year.

151
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,570
So $75,000 a year, or
something like that.

152
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,280
And in return I get
$750,000 in cash.

153
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,870
So what does my balance
sheet look like now?

154
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,780
Well, let me draw it.

155
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:41,130
Let me make sure my balance
sheet now looks, let me draw

156
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,680
it like a square, because
I think the visual

157
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:51,000
representation is helpful,
and then I will split it.

158
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,060
So what are all my assets now?

159
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,010
I had $250,000 and
I got another

160
00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:00,260
$750,000 from the bank.

161
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,480
So now, what are my assets?

162
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,740
Well, $250,000 plus $750,000.

163
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,530
I now have cash of $1 million.

164
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,820
What are my liabilities?

165
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,460
Well, my liability, that's
something that I owe to

166
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,000
someone else.

167
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,700
I owe the bank $750,000.

168
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,125
So liabilities, I'll just say L,
L for liabilities, because

169
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,560
I'm running out of space.

170
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,240
My wife was complaining that I
make these things very hard to

171
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,060
read, but what can I do.

172
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:28,390
Anyway.

173
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:31,130
So my liabilities-- I owe
the bank $750,000.

174
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,700
So that's a liability.

175
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,140
And then the equity is,
essentially-- we would look at

176
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:37,890
this formula.

177
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,480
Assets equal liabilities
plus equity.

178
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,170
This is $1 million,
this is $750,000.

179
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,500
What do I have left over?

180
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,670
Well, I have $250,000
left over.

181
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,970
That's my equity.

182
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,820
And I think hopefully the
concept of equity is starting

183
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,300
to make a little more sense.

184
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:58,320
Now we have-- I could say that
I have $1 million, and some

185
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,120
people are like that.

186
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,760
They think they're millionaires
when they have $1

187
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,000
million in assets.

188
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,580
But they don't consider, well
they might have $1 million of

189
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,050
assets, but they might owe
other people $900,000.

190
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,040
So I wouldn't consider that
person a millionaire.

191
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,690
They're more of a hundred
thousand-aire.

192
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,140
Your assets might be $1 million,
but you're not nearly

193
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,620
a millionaire, because
you still owe

194
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,810
other people $750,000.

195
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,490
What you have left over, that
really is your net worth, or

196
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,220
what you can have claim to.

197
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,190
And that's your equity.

198
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,810
Sometimes it's called
owners' equity.

199
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,676
Or if there was a bunch of
people pitching together, it

200
00:08:27,676 --> 00:08:29,030
would be called shareholders'
equity.

201
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,960
And maybe I'll do a little bit
more on that in the future.

202
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,760
But hopefully now you can see
that the balance sheet is

203
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,330
starting to seem a little
bit useful.

204
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:42,620
I have the cash, and I took the
loan from the bank, but

205
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,410
now I still haven't bought
the house yet.

206
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,430
So what am I going to do?

207
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:49,490
Well I'm going to give my cash
to the old owner of the house.

208
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,450
Or maybe this Toll Brothers,
they just built this

209
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,960
McMansion for me.

210
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,060
So I give them $1 million, and
in return they give me the

211
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,140
deed to the house.

212
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,140
I could just say they
give me the house.

213
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,270
The house is always there, but
you know it's really just a

214
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,440
contract and all the legal
structure that I get around

215
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,500
it, and all the property
rights and all of that.

216
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,910
But that's getting too
philosophical.

217
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,390
So now what does my balance
sheet look like?

218
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,530
Instead of cash-- I think I'm
running out of space and time

219
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,850
to draw another balance sheet--
I don't have cash

220
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,460
worth $1 million.

221
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,740
I now have a house
worth $1 million.

222
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,200
Assuming that it really is worth
it, and that was the

223
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,420
correct price, I didn't
overpay, whatever.

224
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,120
I now have, my assets are
a $1 million house.

225
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,500
And I owe the bank $750,000.

226
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:39,000
So what's left over for me
is $250,000 of equity.

227
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,260
I'm about to run out of time.

228
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,280
So I'm going to leave
you from this video.

229
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,830
In the next video, I'm going
to start explaining what

230
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,330
happens if the value of the
house goes up or down, or you

231
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,420
need cash, and all of these
interesting things.

232
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,240
And we'll start to learn a
little bit more about what's

233
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,210
going on in the world.

234
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,640
See you soon.
