1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,481
We're asked to graph f(x) is equal to the natural log of

2
00:00:04,481 --> 00:00:08,545
2x, and I'll use a calculator here to find a table of values

3
00:00:08,545 --> 00:00:12,817
for different x values, what does f(x) equals, but then I'll hand draw the graph

4
00:00:12,817 --> 00:00:14,373
which might be a little bit ironic

5
00:00:14,373 --> 00:00:16,742
because I'll be using a graphic calculator to come up with the values.

6
00:00:16,742 --> 00:00:19,156
But I won't use the graphing function to graph it,

7
00:00:19,156 --> 00:00:21,316
we'll do that part by hand.

8
00:00:21,316 --> 00:00:23,452
So let's draw here a little table of values.

9
00:00:23,452 --> 00:00:25,310
Of x values and of y values.

10
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,912
And see what we get.

11
00:00:26,912 --> 00:00:31,509
So these are my x values and let's just say y = f(x)

12
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:33,878
So whatever the output is I'm going to set that equal

13
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:36,920
to our dependent variable and plot it on the vertical axis

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,870
and we call that dependent variable y.

15
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:42,005
So let's just try really small numbers.

16
00:00:42,005 --> 00:00:44,327
So actually first, let's remind ourselves what's the domain?

17
00:00:44,327 --> 00:00:47,810
What's the set of valid inputs for x, that we can put in right there?

18
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,595
So the natural logarithm is just logaritm base e.

19
00:00:51,595 --> 00:00:56,680
And any logarithm is only defined when input into the logaritm,

20
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,372
in this case 2x, is greater than zero.

21
00:01:00,372 --> 00:01:02,462
You can't even take the logarithm of zero.

22
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,621
You can raise something to a very negative exponent,

23
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:08,151
negative bilion power, it will get pretty close to zero

24
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,055
but you can never get to zero.

25
00:01:10,055 --> 00:01:13,352
If you take a positive base there is no exponent you can raise it to

26
00:01:13,352 --> 00:01:17,694
to get to the zero or get to a negative number.

27
00:01:17,694 --> 00:01:21,432
So the 2x here, the input into our logarithm function,

28
00:01:21,432 --> 00:01:23,545
in this case the natural logarithm function,

29
00:01:23,545 --> 00:01:25,937
it has to be greater than zero.

30
00:01:25,937 --> 00:01:28,584
And if that's greater than zero, divide both sides by 2.

31
00:01:28,584 --> 00:01:30,720
That means x is greater than zero.

32
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,157
So that is essentially the constraint on our domain.

33
00:01:34,157 --> 00:01:38,453
Our domain is all real numbers greater than zero.

34
00:01:38,453 --> 00:01:41,843
So let's try something pretty close to zero.

35
00:01:41,843 --> 00:01:45,047
Just so we see what happens, the behaviour as we approach

36
00:01:45,047 --> 00:01:46,858
as we are close to zero.

37
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:49,343
And especially as input here is less than one.

38
00:01:49,343 --> 00:02:00,813
So let's try 0.1, 0.5, 1.

39
00:02:00,813 --> 00:02:05,806
And let's try, I don't know - let's try 5...

40
00:02:05,806 --> 00:02:07,408
Oh, I don't actually want to get too far,

41
00:02:07,408 --> 00:02:10,310
cause I want to be able to see the resolution down here.

42
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:15,976
So let's try 1.5 and let's try 3.

43
00:02:15,976 --> 00:02:19,157
So those will be our inputs that we'll try.

44
00:02:19,157 --> 00:02:21,967
That's sounds good enough.

45
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:25,728
And then let me draw my axes and then we'll plot the points.

46
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:29,002
So our domain is positive x values

47
00:02:29,002 --> 00:02:33,089
so we don't really have to draw much on the negative x values.

48
00:02:33,089 --> 00:02:35,411
But we will have some negative values here,

49
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:38,337
so let me give ourselves some room to work with.

50
00:02:38,337 --> 00:02:40,287
And out x values go up to 3.

51
00:02:40,287 --> 00:02:44,885
So this is 1, 2 and 3.

52
00:02:44,885 --> 00:02:50,388
This is 0.5, 1.5 and this is 2.5 (which we do not use).

53
00:02:50,388 --> 00:02:54,869
And then let's see what our y values are, f(x) are going to be equal to

54
00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:56,890
So get out our TI-85

55
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,048
So if we take the natural log -- remember, we have to take

56
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:02,161
2 times x and then natural log of that.

57
00:03:02,161 --> 00:03:07,408
So if we take the natural log of 2 times 0.1,

58
00:03:07,408 --> 00:03:09,730
which is obviously 0.2, what do we get?

59
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:14,281
We get negative 1.61, I'll say.

60
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:17,462
Negative 1.61.

61
00:03:17,462 --> 00:03:25,682
And then if we input 0.5, what do we get?

62
00:03:25,682 --> 00:03:27,563
Let me get the calculator back.

63
00:03:27,563 --> 00:03:31,603
So we're going to take the natural log of 2 times 0.5.

64
00:03:31,603 --> 00:03:33,484
We can do it in out heads.

65
00:03:33,484 --> 00:03:35,388
Actually I'll just write it out just so it's clear what we're doing.

66
00:03:35,388 --> 00:03:39,429
2 times 0.5, that's the natural log of one.

67
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:41,054
And you should be able to do that in your head.

68
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,653
What power you have to raise any positive base to, to get to one?

69
00:03:44,653 --> 00:03:47,068
Well, you raise e to the zero power and you get one.

70
00:03:47,068 --> 00:03:50,203
So I'll write it over here.

71
00:03:50,203 --> 00:03:56,008
We should've been able do to that one in our heads.

72
00:03:56,008 --> 00:03:58,051
Now let's do the next one.

73
00:03:58,051 --> 00:04:07,432
What happens when we have the natural log of 2 times 1.

74
00:04:07,432 --> 00:04:09,313
Which is obviously just going to be 2.

75
00:04:09,313 --> 00:04:11,426
So it's te natural log of 2.

76
00:04:11,426 --> 00:04:14,746
Gets us .69. Which makes sense that this is less than 1.

77
00:04:14,746 --> 00:04:19,297
Because 2 is less than e. e is 2.71 and so on and so forth.

78
00:04:19,297 --> 00:04:21,596
So this is .69.

79
00:04:21,596 --> 00:04:30,071
Now let's try the natural log of 2 times 1.5.

80
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:37,804
Natural log of 3.

81
00:04:37,804 --> 00:04:43,121
And that gets us to 1.10, I'll round to the hundedths.

82
00:04:43,121 --> 00:04:46,859
So this is 1.10.

83
00:04:46,859 --> 00:04:54,406
And finally the natural log of 2 times 3.

84
00:04:54,406 --> 00:04:58,818
2 times x, x is 3.

85
00:04:58,818 --> 00:05:01,720
What do I get? This is going to be natural log of 6.

86
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,017
Which is 1.79.

87
00:05:05,017 --> 00:05:08,013
This is going to be, I'll choose a new color.

88
00:05:08,013 --> 00:05:13,051
This is going to be 1.79.

89
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:19,228
So in terms of the coordinates we run as low as -1.61 and as high as 1.79.

90
00:05:19,228 --> 00:05:26,217
So let's call this right over here -1

91
00:05:26,217 --> 00:05:31,209
and then down here would be -2.

92
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:34,971
I'll extend the y axis down a little bit.

93
00:05:34,971 --> 00:05:39,383
So this is the x axis and this is out y = f(x) axis.

94
00:05:39,383 --> 00:05:43,028
And then let's call this right over here positive 1.

95
00:05:43,028 --> 00:05:45,838
And this over here is positive 2.

96
00:05:45,838 --> 00:05:47,881
And this would be half way between those

97
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:51,550
just cause it looks like we gonna have to be able to see that as well.

98
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:55,614
And so this first point is 0.1, -1.61.

99
00:05:55,614 --> 00:05:58,145
So 0.1, that's one tenth,

100
00:05:58,145 --> 00:06:00,443
that's gonna be right around there.

101
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,603
And then we have -1.61.

102
00:06:02,603 --> 00:06:06,875
It's gonna sit right about there.

103
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:19,089
So that is the point (0.1, -1.61). Fair enough.

104
00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:22,108
That's the first point right there.

105
00:06:22,108 --> 00:06:24,848
Now let's do this one.

106
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:26,821
0.5, 0

107
00:06:26,821 --> 00:06:29,817
When x is 0.5, y is 0.

108
00:06:29,817 --> 00:06:33,718
That's (0.5, 0). Fair enough.

109
00:06:33,718 --> 00:06:42,866
When x is equal to 1, y is 0.69.

110
00:06:42,866 --> 00:06:44,886
Which might be right about there.

111
00:06:44,886 --> 00:06:48,880
Just approximating it, so a little bit closer to 1 that is close 0.5.

112
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,272
Actually a little bit closer to 0.5 than it is to 1.

113
00:06:51,272 --> 00:06:54,290
So let me put it right over there.

114
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:59,608
This would be (1, 0.69)

115
00:06:59,608 --> 00:07:06,249
And then we have the point, when x is 1.5 - f(x) is 1.10.

116
00:07:06,249 --> 00:07:13,586
When x is 1.5, f(x) is 1.1, which takes us right above there.

117
00:07:13,586 --> 00:07:18,323
So that is the point and I think you see where this curve is going.

118
00:07:18,323 --> 00:07:21,736
(1.5, 1.10)

119
00:07:21,736 --> 00:07:24,221
And finally, so that was that point.

120
00:07:24,221 --> 00:07:26,009
We'll do this last one in yellow

121
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:28,493
when x is 3, y is 1.79.

122
00:07:28,493 --> 00:07:33,811
So a little bit closer to 2.0 than to 1.5.

123
00:07:33,811 --> 00:07:36,528
So it's gonna be right about there.

124
00:07:36,528 --> 00:07:40,823
It's gonna be coordinate (3, 1.79).

125
00:07:40,823 --> 00:07:42,750
And now we can connect the dots

126
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,538
and I'll do that in white.

127
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:48,672
And so as we get x values that are closer and closer to 0

128
00:07:48,672 --> 00:07:52,619
Our graph of our function is gonna get more and more negative

129
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:57,170
And it's gonna get closer and closer to the y axis without ever touching it.

130
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:01,535
So it's gonna get less close from the y axis, slowly break away

131
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:05,738
and then curve out like this.

132
00:08:05,738 --> 00:08:10,080
Curve out just like that.

133
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,681
And just keep on going down like this.

134
00:08:12,681 --> 00:08:16,164
And what happens here is pretty cool, as x gets smaller and smaller

135
00:08:16,164 --> 00:08:21,388
The functions becomes more...infinetely negative as x aproaches 0.

136
00:08:21,388 --> 00:08:24,477
But x can never be 0.

137
00:08:24,477 --> 00:08:27,658
There is no power you can raise e or any positive base to,

138
00:08:27,658 --> 00:08:32,882
to actually get zero. You can raise it to raise to a very large negative exponent

139
00:08:32,882 --> 00:08:40,475
I you raise e to the negative one billion, you'll get a number

140
00:08:40,475 --> 00:08:43,540
That's very close to 0, because it is the same as

141
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,886
1 over e to the one bilionth power.

142
00:08:45,886 --> 00:08:49,578
So this is a number that's very close to 0.

143
00:08:49,578 --> 00:08:51,598
But you're never going to approach zero.

144
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:53,548
You can make this number more and more negative

145
00:08:53,548 --> 00:08:55,359
it'll just get smaller and smaller numbers

146
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:59,074
but you'll never quite approach 0.

147
00:08:59,074 --> 00:09:03,788
So you can never a logarithm of zero. You just approach it.

148
00:09:03,788 --> 00:09:07,666
We're done! This is the graph of natural log of 2x.

149
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,336
And it has a typical shape, cause it's just a logarithm.

150
00:09:10,336 --> 99:59:59,999
It has a shape of a logarithmic graph.
