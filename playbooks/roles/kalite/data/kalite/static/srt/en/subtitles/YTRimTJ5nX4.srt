1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,780
   

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:11,240
Let's say we've got a rectangle
and we have two diagonals

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,140
across the rectangle-- that's
one of them, and then we have

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,910
the other diagonal --and this
rectangle has a height of h--

5
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:25,080
so that distance right there is
h --and it has a width of w.

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,200
   

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,050
What we're going to show in
this video is that all of

8
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:35,890
these four triangles
have the same area.

9
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,595
Now right when you look at it,
it might be reasonably obvious

10
00:00:38,595 --> 00:00:47,060
that this bottom triangle will
have the same area as the top

11
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,440
triangle, as this top kind
of upside down triangle.

12
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,710
That these to have the same
area, that might be reasonably

13
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,110
obvious. they have the same
dimension for their base, this

14
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,860
width, and they have the same
height because this distance

15
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:04,840
right here is exactly half of
the height of the rectangle.

16
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,270
They are symmetric; they
are equal triangles.

17
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,800
They have the same proportions.

18
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,520
Now it's probably equally
obvious that this triangle on

19
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:21,340
the left has the same area as
this triangle on the right.

20
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,200
That's probably
equally obvious.

21
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,960
What is not obvious is that
these orange triangles angles

22
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,020
have the same area as these
green, blue triangles.

23
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,320
And that's what we're
going to show right here.

24
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,930
So all we have to do is really
calculate the areas of

25
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:35,690
the different triangles.

26
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,070
So let's do the orange
triangles first. and before

27
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,310
doing that let's just
remind ourselves what the

28
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,060
area of a triangle is.

29
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,200
Area of a triangle is equal
to 1/2 times the base of

30
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,030
the triangle times the
height of the triangle.

31
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:52,260
That's just basic geometry.

32
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,530
Not with that said, let's
figure out the area of

33
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,660
the orange triangle.

34
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,250
   

35
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,690
It's going to be 1/2
times the base.

36
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,620
So the base of the orange
triangle is this distance

37
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,400
right here: it is w.

38
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,734
So 1/2 times w.

39
00:02:09,734 --> 00:02:12,250
   

40
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,800
I want to do that in a
different color; the

41
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,770
color I wrote the w in.

42
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,040
Now what's the height here?

43
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,820
   

44
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,580
Well we already talked about
it: it's exactly half way up

45
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,300
the height of the rectangle.

46
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,815
So times 1/2 times the
height of the rectangle.

47
00:02:32,815 --> 00:02:36,270
   

48
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,700
So what's that going to be?

49
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:43,295
You have 1/2 times 1/2 is 1/4
times width times height.

50
00:02:43,295 --> 00:02:46,280
   

51
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,820
So the area of that triangle
is 1/4 width height.

52
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,810
So is that one.

53
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,790
Same exact argument;
they have equal area.

54
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,300
Now what's the area of
these green or these

55
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,020
green/blue triangles?

56
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:04,440
Well once again-- we'll do
this in a green color --area

57
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,980
is equal to 1/2 base.

58
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,680
So these guys are
turned on their side.

59
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,550
The best base I can think of
is this distance right here.

60
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,110
Or if you look at this triangle
it's this distance right here;

61
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,900
it is the height of the
rectangle So now we're dealing

62
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:25,080
with, the base in this case is
the height of the rectangle.

63
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,890
Don't want you to
get too confused.

64
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:31,210
The height is now
going to be what?

65
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,950
So these triangles are turned
on the side, so what is

66
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:36,170
this distance right here?

67
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,640
Well it is exactly half
of the width, right?

68
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,190
We're going exactly half of
this distance right here.

69
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,740
This point right here is
exactly halfway between

70
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,570
these two sides and halfway
between those two sides.

71
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,880
So this distance right
here is 1/2 the width.

72
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,400
Or the height of these sideways
triangles are 1/2 of the width.

73
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,410
   

74
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,900
Little confusing: the base is
equal to the height of the

75
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,960
rectangle, the height is equal
to 1/2 of the width. but if you

76
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,870
do the math here, area is equal
to 1/2 times 1/2, which is

77
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,450
1/4, height times width.

78
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,560
Or you can just write that as
1/4 width times height, which

79
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,040
is the exact same area.

80
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:25,110
So the area here is 1/4 width
times height, which is the

81
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,870
exact same area as each of
these orange triangles.

82
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,570
And it makes sense because
each of them are exactly 1/4

83
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,460
the area of the rectangle.

84
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,540
Hopefully you enjoyed that.
