1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,670
   

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:06,150
Write 18% as a decimal and as
a fraction in simplest form.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:12,550
So let's do it as a decimal
first. So 18% is the same

4
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:18,050
thing as 18 per 100,
or 18 per cent.

5
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,230
I'm actually separating out the
percent, it's only going

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,460
to be one word, but
I'm writing it as,

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,120
literally, per cent.

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,120
Cent means the same
thing as 100.

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,130
So this literally means
18 per 100.

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,580
Actually, I said I would do the
decimal first, but we can

11
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,180
start putting it into a fraction
first. 18 per 100 as

12
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,790
a fraction literally
means 18/100.

13
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,235
We're literally doing the
fraction first. This literally

14
00:00:42,235 --> 00:00:48,270
means 18 per 100, or
18 hundredths.

15
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,830
From here we can go straight
to a decimal or we could do

16
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,570
this fraction in
simplest form.

17
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,470
Let's do the decimal first, just
because that's actually

18
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,800
what I said I would do first.
Let's do that first. This is

19
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:06,710
the same thing as
18 hundredths.

20
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,100
And we know how to write
that in decimal form.

21
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,230
It's 0.18.

22
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:16,030
You could view this as 1 tenth
and 8 hundredths, which is the

23
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,410
same thing, or 10 hundredths and
8 hundredths, which is 18

24
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,260
hundredths.

25
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,470
So this is written
in decimal form.

26
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,795
And if we write it as a
simplified fraction, we need

27
00:01:24,795 --> 00:01:29,800
to see if there is a common
factor for 18 and 100.

28
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,750
And they're both even numbers,
so we know they're both

29
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,300
divisible by 2, so let's divide
both the numerator and

30
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,300
the denominator by 2.

31
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:41,260
So we have 18 divided by 2
over 100 divided by 2.

32
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,390
And we're going to get
18 divided by 2 is 9.

33
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,840
100 divided by 2 is 50.

34
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,700
And I don't think these guys
share any common factors.

35
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,310
50 is not divisible by 3.

36
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,880
9 is only divisible
by 3 and 1 and 9.

37
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,050
So this is the fraction
in simplest form.

38
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:05,420
So we have 18% is the same thing
as 0.18, which is the

39
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,889
same thing, in simplest
form, as 9/50.

40
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:12,780
Now, I went through a lot of
pain here to show you that

41
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,520
this really just comes
from the word, from

42
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,440
percent, from per 100.

43
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,990
But if you ever were to see this
in a problem, the fast

44
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:23,010
way to do this is to immediately
say, OK, if I have

45
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,910
18%, you should immediately say,
anything in front of the

46
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,950
percent-- that's that anything,
whatever this

47
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,060
anything is-- it should be
equal to that anything.

48
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,250
In this case it's 18/100.

49
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,180
And another way to think
about it, you could

50
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:45,920
view this as 18.0%.

51
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,530
I just added a trailing zero
there, just so that you see

52
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,970
the decimal, really.

53
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,810
But if you want to express this
as a decimal without the

54
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,770
percent, you just move
the decimal to

55
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,720
the left two spaces.

56
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,200
So if we move the decimal to the
left two spaces, one, two,

57
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,400
this becomes 0.18.

58
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,700
Or you could immediately
say that 18% as

59
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,640
a fraction is 18/100.

60
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,240
When you put it in simplified
form, it's 9/50.

61
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,060
But you should also see that
18/100, and we have seen this,

62
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:27,180
is the exact same thing as
18 hundredths, or 0.18.

63
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,770
Hopefully, this made some
connections for you and didn't

64
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,490
confuse you.

65
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:31,867
