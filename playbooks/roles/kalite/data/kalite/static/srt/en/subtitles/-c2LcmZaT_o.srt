1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,830
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,630
Or maybe you didn't even watch the last video,

3
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,340
but anyway, we are on problem number 15.

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,680
The Acme Plumbing Company will send a team of three plumbers

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,770
to work on a certain job.

6
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,930
The company has four experienced plumbers and four trainees.

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,800
If a team consists of one experienced plumber

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,550
and two trainees,

9
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,920
how many such teams are possible?

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,080
So we're going to send three plumbers, right?

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,000
Three plumbers. So it's one, two, three.

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,340
And one of them has to be experienced, right?

13
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,740
And then these are inexperienced, these are trainees.

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,340
So this is the team, one experienced and two trainees.

15
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,720
And now we're going to have to pick from a set.

16
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,620
Let's say my four experienced plumbers

17
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,140
are plumbers A, B, C, D.

18
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,830
These are experienced.

19
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:12,860
And let's say my trainees are E, F, G, H.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,650
So these four are trainees.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,820
So how many different experienced plumbers

22
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,410
can I have heading up the team?

23
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,720
Well, there's four possibilities, right?

24
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,190
So there's four different people I can stick in here.

25
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,570
Four choices, or four possibilities.

26
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,760
Now, independent of who I put into the experienced slot,

27
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,150
how many trainees--

28
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,470
let's say this is trainee slot one and trainee slot two,

29
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,760
not that there's a difference--

30
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,720
so now if I'm picking who can go into trainee slot one,

31
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,290
how many choices do I have?

32
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,160
Well, I have four choices

33
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,770
because none of them have been staffed yet.

34
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,780
So I can put four people here.

35
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,190
Not four people, I'm putting one person,

36
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,370
but I can pick one of four,

37
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,900
so there's four possibilities here.

38
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,640
Once I've already filled trainee slot one,

39
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,850
one of these people are going to disappear.

40
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,750
Then the set is going to be one less, right?

41
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,520
There's only going to be three trainees left

42
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,130
once I've filled slot one.

43
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,290
So how many trainees can I put in slot two?

44
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,660
Well, there's only three possibilities I could put

45
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,300
because I already stuck one in slot one.

46
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,880
So there's four possible experienced people,

47
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,460
four possible choices for trainee in slot one.

48
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,090
And then

49
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,310
since one trainee will already have been staffed in slot one,

50
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,760
there's only three choices for slot two.

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,830
So it's 4 times 4 times 3. So what is that?

52
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,730
4 times 12, which is 48 possibilities.

53
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,230
Next problem.

54
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,490
And the trick here is just realizing that

55
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,450
once you staff one of the trainees, you only have 3 left

56
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,580
that you can put in the other one,

57
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,160
in the second trainee slot.

58
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:58,600
Next problem. Problem 16.

59
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,690
All right, we've got some circles going on here.

60
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,130
Let me draw a circle.

61
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,290
So they have one circle like that.

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And they have a bigger circle that looks something like--

63
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,820
oh, I don't know if I--no, let me undo that.

64
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,940
Edit, undo.

65
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,450
OK, let me see if I can make it more even.

66
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,500
That's pretty good.

67
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,080
OK, let me fill it in with a pleasant color.

68
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,300
All right.

69
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,550
The figure above consists of two circles

70
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,940
that have the same center.

71
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:45,240
If the shaded area is 64 pi square inches

72
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,980
and the smaller circle has a radius of 6 inches,

73
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,920
so that distance right there is 6,

74
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,600
what is the radius in inches of the larger circle?

75
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,790
So, we want to figure out radius of the larger circle.

76
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:05,710
Radius of the larger circle I'll do in this green color.

77
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,210
Let's call that x.

78
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,600
So what's going to be the area of the shaded circle?

79
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,620
How would we figure it out

80
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,700
if we knew the radius of the larger circle?

81
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,890
What would be the area of the large circle?

82
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:23,490
Area of the large circle minus the area of the small circle

83
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,040
is going to equal 64 pi, right?

84
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,030
Because if the whole thing was filled in in mauve

85
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,250
or whatever color this is,

86
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,190
then it would just be the area of the large circle,

87
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,810
but we're subtracting out the area of the small circle

88
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,810
to get the mauve region.

89
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,160
So what's the formula for the area of the large circle?

90
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,820
It's pi times its radius squared.

91
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,330
So we already set that radius to be equal to x,

92
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,940
so it's pi x squared-- and that's what we're trying to

93
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,160
figure out in this problem--

94
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,780
minus the area of the small circle.

95
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,000
What's the area of the small circle?

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,290
Well, its radius is 6 so it's pi r squared,

97
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,850
so it's pi times 6 squared.

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,180
And that is going to be equal to 64 pi.

99
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,280
And just to simplify things,

100
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,650
we can just divide both sides by pi

101
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:11,560
just to get them out of the way.

102
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,110
But you don't have to do that,

103
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,530
that just simplifies things for my simple mind.

104
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:24,500
So you get x squared minus 36 is equal to 64.

105
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:30,290
Add 36 to both sides, you get x squared is equal to 100.

106
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,130
So x could be equal-- if you just solved it,

107
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,980
it would be plus or minus 10, and of course,

108
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,100
a radius can't be negative, so it's plus 10.

109
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:41,200
So x is 10, or the radius of the larger circle is 10.

110
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,550
Next problem. Problem 17.

111
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,750
If p, r, and s are three different prime numbers

112
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,860
greater than two-- p, r, and s--

113
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,860
let me just write them down, p, r, and s--

114
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,400
three different prime numbers greater than two

115
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,260
and n is equal to p times r times s,

116
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:13,230
how many factors including one and n does n have?

117
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:16,410
How many factors? This is a good problem.

118
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:24,820
This is essentially the prime factorization of n, right?

119
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,460
And we want to know

120
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,780
how many positive factors including 1 and n, right?

121
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,730
So what are all of the factors here?

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,430
So if we just made a factor tree--

123
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,590
let's make a combination of all the numbers that

124
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,500
when I multiply the pair can equal n.

125
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,510
So one times n is equal to n.

126
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,620
Another number that would equal n is

127
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:57,260
pr times s would also equal n, right?

128
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,430
Because obviously p times r times s is n,

129
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,890
so p times r times s is n,

130
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:05,000
but I'm saying p times r is a number, right?

131
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,580
Hopefully that makes some sense.

132
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:14,600
Similarly, we could say that p times rs is equal to n.

133
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,150
Same logic. I'm saying r times s is a number, right?

134
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:17,810
Some number.

135
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:25,020
And then finally we could say that sp times r,

136
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:32,450
with sp as a number, is also equal to n, right?

137
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:42,560
So all of these numbers that I said--1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

138
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,310
all of these numbers are factors of n.

139
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,200
So that's how many factors there are,

140
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,450
there are eight factors including 1 and n.

141
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,300
If this seemed a little bit abstract to you,

142
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,170
try it out with some numbers.

143
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,690
Let's say. Actually,

144
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,430
that's the best way you could do it if this was too abstract.

145
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:08,340
You could say, what if p is 3, r is 5, and s is 7.

146
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,710
Then what is n?

147
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,420
Well, n is going to be 15 times 7.

148
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,930
So n is 15 times 7,what is that?

149
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,860
70 plus 35, n is 105.

150
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,710
So if n is 105, this is 1 times 105.

151
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,080
pr, this is 15 times 7.

152
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,690
This would be 3 times 35.

153
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:38,010
Is that right? Oh no, sorry, 85. No, sorry.

154
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:48,730
If 5 times 7 is 35 times 3, oh right, it's 105, right?

155
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:57,180
So we would write 3 times 35, and sp is 21 times 5.

156
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,760
So those would be the actual numbers.

157
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,950
So hopefully that makes a little bit more sense to you.

158
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,650
But this is the way you could do it in a general way.

159
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,840
It looks like I'm running out of time,

160
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,360
so I will do number 18 in the next video.

161
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,990
But this is a little bit of a non-intuitive problem.

162
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,810
Just remember, this is the prime factorization,

163
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,450
and then you can construct its--

164
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,260
what I call the normal factorization--

165
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,050
you can construct that

166
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,160
by just taking combinations of the prime numbers.

167
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,130
And hopefully

168
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,310
the actual numbers make a little bit more sense to you.

169
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,020
See you in the next video.
