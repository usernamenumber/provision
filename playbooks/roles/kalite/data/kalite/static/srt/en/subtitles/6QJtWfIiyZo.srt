00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,270
Welcome to the presentation
on simplifying radicals.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,475
So let's get started with getting a little terminology out of the way.

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:11,341
You're probably just wondering what a radical is and I'll just let you know.

4
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:13,111
I've got to get the pen settings right.

5
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:15,282
A radical is just that.

6
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:18,808
Or you're probably more familiar calling that the square root symbol.

7
00:00:18,808 --> 00:00:20,572
So with the terminology out of
the way,

8
00:00:20,572 --> 00:00:23,877
let's actually talk about what it means to simplify a radical.

9
00:00:23,877 --> 00:00:25,728
And some people would argue that what we're going to actually be doing

10
00:00:25,728 --> 00:00:26,890
is actually making it more complicated.

11
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,463
But let's see.

12
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:32,819
Let me erase that.

13
00:00:32,819 --> 00:00:36,898
So if I were to give you the square root of 36,

14
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,610
you'd say hey, that's easy.

15
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,175
That's just equal to 6 times 6

16
00:00:40,175 --> 00:00:43,850
or you'd say the square root of 36 is just 6.

17
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:50,682
Now, what if I asked you what
the square root of 72 is?

18
00:00:50,682 --> 00:00:54,590
Well, we know that
72 is 36 times 2, right?

19
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,680
So let's write that.

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:04,358
Square root of 72 is the same thing as the square root of 36 times 2.

21
00:01:04,372 --> 00:01:07,992
Right? We just rewrote seventy-two as thirty-six times two.

22
00:01:07,992 --> 00:01:11,582
And the square root, if you remember from level 3 exponents.

23
00:01:11,582 --> 00:01:14,920
square root is the same thing as something to the one half power.

24
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,860
So let's write it that way.

25
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:20,279
And I'm just writing it this way just to show you how this radical simplification works,

26
00:01:20,279 --> 00:01:22,965
and that it's really not a new concept.

27
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:29,488
So this is the same thing as
36 times 2 to the one half power.

28
00:01:29,488 --> 00:01:33,210
Right? Because it's just a square root
is the same thing as one half power.

29
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,291
And we learned from the exponent rules that when you multiply two numbers

30
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:39,875
and then you raise that to the one half power,

31
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:47,102
that that's the same thing as raising each of the numbers to the one half power

32
00:01:47,102 --> 00:01:50,454
and then multiplying. Right?

33
00:01:50,454 --> 00:01:58,482
Well that right there, that's the same thing as saying the square root is 36 times the square root of 2.

34
00:01:58,482 --> 00:02:00,780
And we already figured out what
the square root of 36 is.

35
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,810
It's 6.

36
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:07,953
So that just equals 6 times
the square root of 2.

37
00:02:07,953 --> 00:02:11,568
And you're probably wondering why I went through this step of changing the radical,

38
00:02:11,568 --> 00:02:13,525
the square root symbol, into the one half power.

39
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,022
And I did that just to show you that this is just an extension of the exponent rules.

40
00:02:17,022 --> 00:02:19,035
It isn't really a new concept.

41
00:02:19,035 --> 00:02:24,690
Although, I guess sometimes it's not so obvious that
they are the same concepts.

42
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,480
I just wanted to
point that out.

43
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,470
So let's do another problem.

44
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:33,251
I think as we do more and more problems, these will become more obvious.

45
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:37,820
The square root of 50.

46
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,028
Well, the square root of 50 --

47
00:02:40,028 --> 00:02:47,150
50 is the same thing as 25 times 2.

48
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:51,652
And we know, based on what we just did and this is really just an exponent rule,

49
00:02:51,652 --> 00:02:58,408
The square root of 25 times 2 is the same thing as the square root of 25

50
00:02:58,408 --> 00:03:01,070
times the square root of 2.

51
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,580
Well we know what the
square root of 25 is.

52
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,170
That's 5.

53
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:09,700
So that just equals 5 times
the square root of 2.

54
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,148
Now, you might be saying, "Hey,
Sal, you make it look easy,

55
00:03:14,148 --> 00:03:17,856
but how did you know to split 50
into 25 and 2?"

56
00:03:17,856 --> 00:03:23,102
Why didn't I say that 50 is equal to the square root of 5 and 10?

57
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:28,800
Or that 50 is equal to the square root
-- actually, I think 1 and 50?

58
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,529
I don't know what
other factors 50 has.

59
00:03:30,529 --> 00:03:32,570
Well, anyway, I won't go
into that right now.

60
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:37,052
The reason why I picked 25 and
2 is because I wanted a factor of 50--

61
00:03:37,052 --> 00:03:40,871
I actually wanted the largest factor of 50 that is a perfect square.

62
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,860
And that's 25.

63
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,862
If I had done 5 and 10, there's really nothing I could have done with it,

64
00:03:45,862 --> 00:03:47,992
because neither 5 nor 10 are perfect squares

65
00:03:47,992 --> 00:03:50,610
and the same thing's with 1 and 50.

66
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:51,839
So the way you should think
about it,

67
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:55,052
think about the factors of the original number

68
00:03:55,052 --> 00:03:57,890
and figure out if any of those factors are perfect squares.

69
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,370
And there's no real
mechanical way.

70
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,280
You really just have to learn
to recognize perfect squares.

71
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,940
And you'll get familiar
with them, of course.

72
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:17,873
They're 1, 4, 9, 25, 16,
25, 36, 49, 64, et cetera.

73
00:04:17,873 --> 00:04:21,288
And maybe by doing this module, you'll actually learn to recognize them more readily.

74
00:04:21,288 --> 00:04:26,638
But if any of these numbers are a factor of the number under the radical sign

75
00:04:26,638 --> 00:04:28,037
then you'll probably want to factor them out.

76
00:04:28,037 --> 00:04:30,084
And then you can take them out of the radical sign

77
00:04:30,084 --> 00:04:32,620
like we did up in this problem.

78
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:37,592
Let's do a couple more.

79
00:04:37,592 --> 00:04:43,455
What is 7 times the square root of 27?

80
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,066
And when I write the 7 right
next to it,

81
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:47,725
that just means times the square root of 27.

82
00:04:47,725 --> 00:04:50,496
Well, let's think about what
other factors of 27 are,

83
00:04:50,496 --> 00:04:52,050
and whether any of them are a perfect square.

84
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,710
Well, 3 is a factor of 27, but
that's not a perfect square.

85
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,260
9 is.

86
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,215
So, we could say 7 --

87
00:05:01,215 --> 00:05:08,782
that's equal to 7 times the square root of 9 times 3.

88
00:05:08,782 --> 00:05:11,352
And now, based on the rules we just learned,

89
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:17,572
that's the same thing as 7 times the square
root of 9

90
00:05:17,572 --> 00:05:21,140
times the square root of 3.

91
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:26,399
Well that just equals 7 times 3
because the square root of 9 is 3

92
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,270
times the square root of 3.

93
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:34,670
That equals 21 times
the square root of 3.

94
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,830
Done.

95
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,918
Let's do another one.

96
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:46,075
What is nine times the square root of eighteen?

97
00:05:46,075 --> 00:05:48,406
Well, once again, what are the factors of eighteen?

98
00:05:48,406 --> 00:05:50,522
Well do we have 6 and 3?

99
00:05:50,522 --> 00:05:52,280
1 and 18?

100
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,550
None of the numbers I mentioned
so far are perfect squares.

101
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,540
But we also have 2 and 9.

102
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,010
And 9 is a perfect square.

103
00:05:59,010 --> 00:05:59,770
So let's write that.

104
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:07,020
That's equal to 9 times the
square root of 2 times 9.

105
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,560
Which is equal to 9 times the
square root of 2 --

106
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,580
that's a 2, times the square root of 9.

107
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,295
Which equals 9 times the square
root of 2 times 3, right?

108
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,828
That's the square root of 9 which equals

109
00:06:22,828 --> 00:06:27,250
27 times the square root of 2.

110
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,130
There we go.

111
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,160
Hopefully, you're starting to
get the hang of these problems.

112
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,070
Let's do another one.

113
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:40,015
What is 4 times the
square root of 25?

114
00:06:40,015 --> 00:06:41,883
Well, twenty-five itself is a perfect square.

115
00:06:41,883 --> 00:06:45,091
This is kind of a problem that's so easy that it's a bit of a trick problem.

116
00:06:45,106 --> 00:06:47,252
25 itself is a perfect square.

117
00:06:47,252 --> 00:06:51,196
The square root is 5, so this is just equal to 4 times 5,

118
00:06:51,196 --> 00:06:52,910
which is equal to 20.

119
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:57,020
Square root of 25 is 5.

120
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,220
Let's do another one.

121
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:04,688
What's 3 times the
square root of 29?

122
00:07:04,688 --> 00:07:06,192
Well 29 only has two factors.

123
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:06,870
It's a prime number.

124
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,450
It only has the
factors 1 and 29.

125
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,750
And neither of those numbers
are perfect squares.

126
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,220
So we really can't simplify
this one anymore.

127
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:19,340
So, this is already in
completely simplified form.

128
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,357
Let's do a couple more.

129
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:32,134
What about 7 times the square root of 320?

130
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,700
So, let's think about 320.

131
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,797
Well we could actually do it in steps when we have larger numbers like this.

132
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:43,290
I can look at it and say, well
it does look like 4 --

133
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:47,385
actually it looks like 16 would go into this because 16 goes into 32.

134
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:48,380
So let's try that.

135
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:58,003
So that equals 7 times the
square root of 16 times 20.

136
00:07:58,003 --> 00:08:04,294
Well, that just equals 7 times the square root of 16

137
00:08:04,294 --> 00:08:06,960
times the square root of 20.

138
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,590
7 times the square root of 16.

139
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,380
The square root of 16 is 4.

140
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,630
So 7 times 4 is 28.

141
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:17,110
So that's 28 times the
square root of 20.

142
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,100
Now are we done?

143
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,800
Well actually, I think I can factor 20 even more

144
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,680
because 20 is equal to 4 times 5.

145
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:33,558
So I can say this is equal to 28 times the square root of 4 times 5.

146
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:38,270
The square root of 4 is 2 so
that could just take the 2 out

147
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:43,662
and that becomes 56 times
the square root of 5.

148
00:08:43,662 --> 00:08:44,450
I hope that made sense to you.

149
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,980
And this is actually a
pretty important technique

150
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,890
I just did here.

151
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,060
Immediately when I look at 320.

152
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,160
I don't know what the largest
number is that goes into 320.

153
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,150
It actually turns
out that it's 64.

154
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,604
But just looking at the number, I said, well I know that 4 goes into it.

155
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,705
So I could have just pulled out 4,

156
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,628
and then said, "Oh, that's equal to 4 times 80."

157
00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:03,210
And then I would have had to work with 80.

158
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,483
In this case, I saw 32 and I was like, it looks like 16 goes into it

159
00:09:06,483 --> 00:09:08,660
and I factored out 16 first.

160
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,890
And when I took out the square root of 16, I multiplied the outside by 4

161
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,160
and that's how I got the 28.

162
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,285
But then I reduced the number
on the inside and said,

163
00:09:15,285 --> 00:09:17,430
"Oh, well that still is divisible by a perfect square.

164
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,055
It's still divisible by 4." And
then I kept doing it

165
00:09:20,055 --> 00:09:27,696
until I was left with essentially, a prime number or a number that couldn't be reduced anymore under the radical.

166
00:09:27,696 --> 00:09:29,950
And it actually doesn't
have to be prime.

167
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:34,232
So hopefully, that gives you a good sense of how to do radical simplification.

168
00:09:34,232 --> 00:09:37,851
It's really just an extension of the exponent rules that you've already learned,

169
00:09:37,851 --> 00:09:41,872
and hopefully as you do the module, you'll get good at it.

170
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,420
Have fun!
