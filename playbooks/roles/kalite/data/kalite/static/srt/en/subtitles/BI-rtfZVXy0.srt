00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01,760
Hello.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,230
I will now introduce you to the
concept of similar triangles.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,210
Let me write that down.

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:14,150
6
00:00:14,15 --> 00:00:16,35
So in everyday life what
does similar mean?

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:26,890
8
00:00:26,89 --> 00:00:29,47
Well, if two things are similar
they're kind of the same but

6
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,620
they're not the same thing or
they're not identical, right?

7
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,650
That's the same thing
for triangles.

8
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:40,960
So similar triangles are
two triangles that have

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,270
all the same angles.

10
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:50,460
14
00:00:50,46 --> 00:00:57,35
For example, let me draw
two similar triangles.

11
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,543
I'll try to make them look kind
of the same because they're

12
00:00:59,543 --> 00:01:02,350
supposed to look kind of the
same, but just maybe

13
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,980
be different sizes.

14
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:12,350
So that's one, and I'll draw
another one that's right here.

15
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,900
I'm going to draw it a little
smaller to show you that

16
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,120
they're not necessarily the
same size, they just are

17
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,980
same shape essentially.

18
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,020
One way I like to think about
similar triangles are they're

19
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,080
just triangles that could be
kind of scaled up or down in

20
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,260
size or flipped around or
rotated, but they all have

21
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,500
the same angles so they're
essentially the same shape.

22
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,470
For example, these two
triangles, if I were tell you

23
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,240
that this angle -- and this is
how they do it in class.

24
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,990
29
00:01:39,99 --> 00:01:44,27
If I were to tell you this
angle is equal to this angle

25
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:49,640
and I told you that this angle
here is equal to this angle.

26
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,520
32
00:01:52,52 --> 00:01:54,01
Well, a couple of things.

27
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,020
You already know that this
angle's going to be equal to

28
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,430
this angle, and why is that?

29
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,170
Well because if two angles
are the same, then the third

30
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,400
has to be the same, right?

31
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,540
Because all three
angles add up to 180.

32
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,870
For example, if this is x,
this is y, this one has to be

33
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:16,060
180 minus x minus y, right?

34
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,550
That's probably too
small for you to see.

35
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,300
But that's the same thing here.

36
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,420
If this is x and this is
y, then this angle right

37
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:28,200
here is going to be 180
minus x minus y, right?

38
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,880
So if we know that two angles
are the same in two triangles,

39
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,712
so we know that the third one's
also going to be to same.

40
00:02:33,712 --> 00:02:38,270
So we could also say this angle
is identical to this angle.

41
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:42,160
And if all the angles are the
same, then we know that we are

42
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,970
dealing with similar triangles.

43
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,590
What useful thing can we
now do once we know that

44
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,320
a triangle is similar?

45
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,150
Well, we can use that
information to kind of figure

46
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,690
out some of the sides.

47
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:00,210
So, even though they don't have
the same sides, the ratio

48
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,550
of corresponding side
lengths is the same.

49
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,750
I know I've just confused you.

50
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,340
Let me give you an example.

51
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:15,970
For example, let's say that
this side is -- this side is 5.

52
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,167
Let's say that this side is,
I don't know, I'm just going

53
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:21,370
to make up some number, 6.

54
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:26,630
And let's say that this
side is 7, right?

55
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:30,840
And let's say we know that, I
don't know, let's say we know

56
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,970
that this side here is 2.

57
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,990
64
00:03:37,99 --> 00:03:40,18
So we know the ratio
of corresponding

58
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:40,950
sides is the same.

59
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,990
So, if we look at these two
triangles, they have completely

60
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:47,400
different sizes but they
have corresponding sides.

61
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:53,010
For example, this side
corresponds to this side.

62
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,130
How do we know that?

63
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,560
Well, in this case, they
just happen to have

64
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,340
the same orientation.

65
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,330
But we know that because
these sides are opposite

66
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,940
the same angle, right?

67
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,940
This is opposite angle y,
and then this side is

68
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,350
opposite angle y again.

69
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,850
This whole triangle might be
too small for you to see, but

70
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,650
hopefully you're getting
what I'm saying.

71
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,180
So these are
corresponding sides.

72
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:20,490
Similarly, this side, this
blue side, and this blue side

73
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,730
are corresponding sides.

74
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:22,160
Why?

75
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,180
Not because they're kind of on
the top left because we could

76
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,940
have rotated this and flipped
it and whatever else.

77
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,980
It's because it's
opposite the same angle.

78
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,810
86
00:04:32,81 --> 00:04:33,895
That's the way I always
think about triangles.

79
00:04:33,895 --> 00:04:35,160
It's a good way to think about
it, especially when you

80
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,100
start doing trigonometry.

81
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,310
So what does that us?

82
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,220
Well, the ratio between
corresponding sides

83
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,810
is always the same.

84
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,270
So let's say we want to figure
out how long this side of

85
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,110
the small triangle is.

86
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,040
Well there's a bunch of
ways we could do it.

87
00:04:52,040 --> 00:05:00,450
We could say that the ratio of
this side to this side, so x to

88
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:07,505
7 is going to be equal to the
ratio of this side to this side

89
00:05:07,505 --> 00:05:11,680
-- is equal to the
ratio of 2 to 5.

90
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,440
And then we could solve it.

91
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,150
And the only reason why we can
do this -- you can't do this

92
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,150
with just random triangles, you
can only do this with

93
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,100
similar triangles.

94
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,090
So we could then solve for x,
multiply both sides but 7 and

95
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:26,200
you get x is equal
to 14 over 5.

96
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,910
So it's a little
bit less than 3.

97
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:32,180
So 14 over 5, so 2.8 or
something like that,

98
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,550
that equals x.

99
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,640
And we could do the same thing
to figure out this yellow side.

100
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,200
So if you know two triangles
are similar, you know all the

101
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,775
sides of one of the triangles,
you know one of the sides of

102
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:44,760
the other triangle, you can
figure out all the sides.

103
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,720
I think I just confused
you with that comment.

104
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,730
So, this side, so
let's call this y.

105
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,710
you're doing one triangle's
going to be the denominator

106
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,260
here, then that same
triangle has to be the

107
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,520
denominator on the--.

108
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,400
If one triangle is the
numerator on the left hand side

109
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,590
of the equal sign, right, so
the smaller one's

110
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,570
the numerator.

111
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,900
Then it's also going to be the
numerator on the right hand

112
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,030
side of the equal sign.

113
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,620
I just want to make sure
you're consistent that way.

114
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,870
If you flip it then you're
going to mess everything up.

115
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,180
And then we can just solve for,
so y is equal to 12 over 5.

116
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:30,736
127
00:06:30,736 --> 00:06:33,92
So, let's use this information
about similar triangles

117
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,300
just to do some problems.

118
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:44,750
130
00:06:44,75 --> 00:06:47,68
So let's use some of the
geometry we've already learned.

119
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:58,340
I have two parallel lines, then
I have a line like that, then

120
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,650
I have a line like this.

121
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,390
What did I say, I said that the
lines are parallel, so this

122
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:09,010
line is parallel to this line.

123
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:24,990
And I want to know if this side
is length 5, what is -- well,

124
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,180
let's say this length is length
5, let's say that this length

125
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,030
is -- let me draw
another color.

126
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:37,790
This length is, I
don't know, 8.

127
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:45,370
140
00:07:45,37 --> 00:07:48,33
I want to know what
this side is.

128
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:52,030
Actually no, let me give you
one more side just to make sure

129
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,320
you know all of one triangle.

130
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,090
Let's say that this side is 6,
and what I want to do is I want

131
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:05,570
to figure out what this side is
right here, this purple side.

132
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,540
So how do we do this?

133
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,390
So before we start using any of
that ratio stuff, we have to

134
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:15,610
prove to ourselves and prove in
general, that these are

135
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,580
similar triangles.

136
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,280
So how can we do that?

137
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,510
Let's see if we can figure
out which angles are

138
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,090
equal to other angles.

139
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:26,020
So we have this angle here.

140
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,330
Is this angle equal to any
of these three angles

141
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,820
in this triangle?

142
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,455
Well, yeah sure.

143
00:08:31,455 --> 00:08:33,990
It's opposite this angle right
here, so this is going to be

144
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:37,570
equal to this angle
right here, right?

145
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,900
So we know that its opposite
side is it's corresponding

146
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,380
side, so we know that it
corresponds to -- we don't know

147
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,040
its length, but we know it
corresponds to this

148
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,170
8 length, right?

149
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,200
I forgot to give you
some information.

150
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,860
I forgot to tell you that
this side is -- let me

151
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,150
give it a neutral color.

152
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,340
Let's say that this side is 4.

153
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,470
Let's go back to the problem.

154
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,340
So we just figured out these
two angles are the same, and

155
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,570
that this is that angle's
corresponding side.

156
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:05,590
Can we figure out any other
angles are the same?

157
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:09,430
Let's say we know
what this angle is.

158
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:12,200
172
00:09:12,2 --> 00:09:15,1
I'm going to do kind of a
double angle measure here.

159
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,480
So what angle in this triangle
-- does any angle here

160
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,990
equal that angle?

161
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,410
Sure.

162
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:23,850
We know that these are parallel
lines, so we can use alternate

163
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,180
interior angles to figure out
which of these angles

164
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,830
equals that one.

165
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,430
But I just saw the time
and I realize I'm

166
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,390
running out of time.

167
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,140
So I will continue this
in the next video.

168
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:33,597
