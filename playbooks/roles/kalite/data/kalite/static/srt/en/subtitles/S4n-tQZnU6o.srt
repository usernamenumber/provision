1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:05,690
We will now embark on what is
probably my least favorite

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:08,300
exercise or computation in
mathematics-- and I think

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,750
you'll see why-- where we will
invert a 3 by 3 matrix.

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,200
And in my mind, the only thing
less pleasant than inverting a

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,990
3 by 3 matrix is inverting
a 4 by 4 matrix.

6
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,260
It very quickly becomes obvious
to you that it's

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,240
probably better for a
computer to do this.

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,020
But you need to learn
how to do it.

9
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,020
And it's a good exercise
for me to do.

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,040
And if I keep doing it my whole
life, it'll prevent my

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,439
brain from degrading.

12
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,310
But as you'll see, this is
almost an exercise in not

13
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,870
making careless mistakes.

14
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,160
So let's start with a
3 by 3 matrix and

15
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,630
try to take the inverse.

16
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,770
So let's say I have matrix A.

17
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,570
I think I'm going to need a lot
of space here, so I'll try

18
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,930
to do this small, without
being confusing.

19
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,640
Matrix A.

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,510
Let's say it's 1, 0-- and I'm
specifically choosing this

21
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:04,640
matrix because the numbers are
reasonably non-hairy-- 0, 2,

22
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,470
1, 1, 1, 1.

23
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,443
So the first thing that I do
when I take an inverse of a 3

24
00:01:13,443 --> 00:01:16,780
by 3 matrix, I create what I
call-- or not what I call,

25
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,270
what everyone calls--
a matrix of minors.

26
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,450
So let me write that down.

27
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,700
Matrix of minors.

28
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,750
Let me draw that out.

29
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,310
So it's going to be another
3 by 3 matrix.

30
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,570
And what it is, so this
element, this top left

31
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:48,050
element, is essentially going
to be the determinant.

32
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:52,180
If I were to take my original
matrix, and I were to cross

33
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:57,240
out this position's
row and column.

34
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,710
So for example, this 1, 1
position, row 1, column 1.

35
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,500
I cross out row 1
and column 1.

36
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,730
What numbers do I have left?

37
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,190
I have this 2, 1, 1, 1.

38
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,590
I have this right here.

39
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,090
So it's the determinant
of 2, 1, 1, 1.

40
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,320
And actually maybe I'll
write that down.

41
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,210
So it's the determinant
of 2, 1, 1, 1.

42
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,870
So I'm gonna run out
of space I'm sure.

43
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:23,110
It's going to be 2, 1, 1, 1.

44
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,120
The determinant.

45
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,530
The absolute value sign says
it's the determinant.

46
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,100
Remember, all I did is, I said,
OK, in position 1,1, let

47
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,550
me cross out the column and
the row 1,1, and take the

48
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,950
determinant of what's left.

49
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,320
Or the minor of this matrix.

50
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,650
And then I will take the
determinant-- so when I go to

51
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:47,150
this position, I'm in
row 1, column 2.

52
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,810
I'm essentially going to
take the determinant.

53
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:54,615
If I were to cross out row
1 and column 2, what

54
00:02:54,615 --> 00:02:55,440
do I have left over?

55
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,750
I have 0, 1, 1, 1.

56
00:03:02,402 --> 00:03:04,777
It might be confusing, but just
remember-- I wish I had

57
00:03:04,777 --> 00:03:06,070
something I could
cover this with.

58
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,500
Unfortunately my fingers can't
show up on this video.

59
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,015
But if you cross this row and
this column out, you're just

60
00:03:12,015 --> 00:03:15,170
left with this 0, this 1,
this 1, and this 1.

61
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,670
And you take the determinant
of that minor.

62
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,690
And we'll keep going.

63
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,650
I'm probably going to run out of
space here, but I will try

64
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,790
my best. And so when you go to
this position-- row 1, column

65
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:26,950
3-- what do you do?

66
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,610
Well you cross out
row 1, column 3.

67
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,090
And then the determinant, or the
minor that you have to do,

68
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,760
is 0, 2, 1, 1.

69
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:44,070
So the determinant of that
two by two matrix.

70
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,010
And then you keep doing that,
so forth and so on.

71
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,200
And I'm going to run
out of space.

72
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,250
But what I'm going to
do is I'm just going

73
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,080
to calculate it.

74
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,940
I think you understand
how to do it.

75
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,400
Well you don't understand how to
do it, but I think when we

76
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,940
calculate it it'll make
a little more sense.

77
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,580
Let me actually just
calculate it out.

78
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,920
Because if I were to write these
2 by 2 matrices, I would

79
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,110
run out of space.

80
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,260
But anyway, let's go back
to this position 1, 1.

81
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,390
Cross out the first row, first
column, I want the determinant

82
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,330
of this thing right here.

83
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,810
So what's the determinant
of this 2 by 2?

84
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,080
That's not too hard.

85
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,510
It's 2 times 1, minus
1 times 1.

86
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,890
So what's 2 times 1,
minus 1 times 1?

87
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,740
Well it's just 1.

88
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,230
Then when we go to row 1,
column 2, I want the

89
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:31,610
determinant of 0, 1, 1, 1.

90
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,770
So it's 0 times 1,
minus 1 times 1.

91
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:40,290
So 0 times 1 is 0, minus
1 times 1 is minus 1.

92
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,290
And that's just this determinant
right here.

93
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,710
I'm just kind of reshowing you
how I visualize when I cross

94
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,000
out the rows and columns.

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,410
So it's 0 times 1,
minus 1 times 1.

96
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,610
And in this position of course,
you cross out this

97
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:55,690
row, this column, and 0 times
1 minus 1 times 2.

98
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,170
So that's minus 2.

99
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,890
Let's keep going.

100
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:02,790
All right.

101
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:07,740
So now, when we're in row 2,
column 1, we cross out row 2,

102
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,820
cross out column 1.

103
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,490
And we're left with this 0,
this 1, this 1 and this 1.

104
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,170
So it's 0 times 1, which is 0.

105
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,000
Minus 1 times 1.

106
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,510
So we're at minus 1.

107
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,030
Then when we get row 2, column
2, we cross those two out, and

108
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,480
we take the matrix of the
minor that's left.

109
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:36,600
So that's 1 times 1,
minus 1 times 1.

110
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,850
So that's 0.

111
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,620
Almost. We're halfway done.

112
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,070
OK, so then we're in
row 2, column 3.

113
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,680
So we cross out row
2, column 3.

114
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,660
And what we have left is 1
times 1, minus 1 time 0.

115
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,000
So that is just 1.

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,120
Last row.

117
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,290
OK, so we're in row
3, column 1.

118
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,660
So we cross out row
3, column 1.

119
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,980
You're left with
0 times 1 is 0.

120
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,260
Minus 2 times 1.

121
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,510
So that's minus 2.

122
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,760
Then we're in row 3, column 2.

123
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,110
So we cross out row
3, column 2.

124
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:24,390
And you have 1 times
1, minus 0 times 1.

125
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:27,110
So that's just 1.

126
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,730
Last one.

127
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,900
Row 3, column 3.

128
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,440
So we cross out row 3, we
cross out column 3.

129
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,680
And you're just left with 1
times 2, minus 0 times 0.

130
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,080
So that is 2.

131
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,450
And if I haven't made any
careless mistakes, that is our

132
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:41,700
matrix of minors.

133
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:48,270
Now we now have to convert
this to what we call the

134
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,930
matrix of cofactors.

135
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,480
And actually this step is
fairly straightforward.

136
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,820
So to convert from a matrix
of minors to a matrix of

137
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,170
cofactors, you just have to
remember this pattern.

138
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:03,690
This pattern applies to
any 3 by 3 matrix.

139
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:08,630
Plus, minus, plus, minus,
plus, minus,

140
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:11,270
plus, minus, plus.

141
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,050
And so you can kind of just
imagine this as kind of a

142
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,960
checkerboard of pluses
and minuses.

143
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,470
And you apply that to this.

144
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,670
So what do I mean by that?

145
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:21,530
Well that means, when you start,
it's a checkerboard,

146
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,300
and you start with a plus
at the top left.

147
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,800
And then you just keep
alternating plus, minus.

148
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,470
So if you applied this
to this, you get

149
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,020
the matrix of cofactors.

150
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,270
Let me write that down.

151
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,800
You can imagine this is a bit of
a marathon of computation.

152
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,840
OK, so the matrix of cofactors
is essentially applying this

153
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,880
pattern to the matrix
of minors.

154
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,430
So what do you do?

155
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:59,860
You say this plus
1 times 1 is 1.

156
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,680
But now we have a minus.

157
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,240
So that's minus times minus
1 is positive 1.

158
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,812
Then you have plus times
minus 2 is minus 2.

159
00:08:09,812 --> 00:08:11,500
Then you have a minus here.

160
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,990
Minus times minus
1 is positive 1.

161
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,790
Plus times 0 is still 0.

162
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:22,820
Minus times 1 is minus 1.

163
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:27,200
Plus times minus 2 is minus 2.

164
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,690
Minus applied to 1 is minus 1.

165
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,460
And then plus applied
to 2 is just 2.

166
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,510
And we have our matrix
of cofactors.

167
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,299
And we are more than
halfway done with

168
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:39,000
inverting this matrix.

169
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,720
And I just want to
take a note here.

170
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,200
What we're doing is kind of
just a magic formula.

171
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,600
It might seem a little bit
like voodoo for you.

172
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,740
But I just want you to keep in
mind that in future videos, I

173
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,090
will show you where
this comes from.

174
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,630
Although it will be quite
hairy to prove

175
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,500
it for a 3 by 3.

176
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,750
But I'll definitely show
it to you for a 2 by 2.

177
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,030
And actually, I'll show you
other algorithms that might

178
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,890
make a little bit more intuitive
sense for doing it

179
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,040
for a 3 by 3.

180
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,680
But I just wanted to show you
how to do it this way, so that

181
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,530
at least when you see it on your
Algebra 2 exam-- because

182
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,430
I think they actually teach this
in Algebra 2-- you could

183
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,470
at least, if the teacher asks
you, solve for the matrix of

184
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,730
minors or the cofactors or solve
for the determinant of

185
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,740
the inverse, you can do it.

186
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,430
And then we'll worry about
getting the intuition, which

187
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,010
is not how I normally like
to teach things.

188
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,630
But this is an exception.

189
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,910
But anyway, back
to the problem.

190
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,100
This is the matrix
of cofactors.

191
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:34,410
Now from this, we take the
adjoint of matrix a-- or I

192
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,570
learned from Wikipedia, the
correct term is the adjugate

193
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,630
of matrix a.

194
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:46,660
But this is determined the
notation is the adjugate of a.

195
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,030
And all this is is
the transpose of

196
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,510
the matrix of cofactors.

197
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,970
And I know I'm throwing out a
lot of weird terminology here.

198
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,300
But the transpose, all that
means is that you switch the

199
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,550
rows and the columns.

200
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:08,010
So this one right here is
in row 1, column 1.

201
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,100
But you know, so the rows and
columns are the same, so that

202
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:10,950
just stays the same.

203
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,170
So actually anything on the
diagonal stays the same.

204
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,260
Because this is row
2, column 2.

205
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,910
This is row 3, column 3.

206
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:19,480
So the diagonals
stay the same.

207
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,880
And then you switch places.

208
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,130
You kind of flip across
the diagonal.

209
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,470
And what do I mean by that?

210
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:29,880
Well this 1 was in
row 1, column 2.

211
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:37,350
So it'll then be moved
to row 2, column 1.

212
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:41,680
So this 1 right here
will go here.

213
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,400
So you can kind of say that it
flipped over the diagonal.

214
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,910
And similarly, this right here
is in row 1, column 3.

215
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:54,840
It's going to be switched
to row 3, column 1.

216
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,090
So it's going to go here.

217
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,450
And you can kind of see that it
just flipped over that end.

218
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,890
So this minus 2 isn't
this one.

219
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,040
It's this one over here.

220
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,400
And actually, we see that this
matrix is symmetric.

221
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,330
When you flip it, you actually
get the same thing.

222
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,490
So maybe it was a bad example.

223
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,230
But I want you to understand
that the transpose is where--

224
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:19,830
if something like this number,
if it's in a row 1, column 2,

225
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:22,180
then it moves to row
2, column 1.

226
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,080
So you're switching the
rows and columns.

227
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,480
But anyway, we could
keep doing that.

228
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,080
But essentially you're just
flipping over the diagonal.

229
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,710
So let's see.

230
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:32,040
So then this number will be
flipped to this position, so

231
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,970
it goes there.

232
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,340
This is in row 2, column 1.

233
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:40,820
So it will go to column 2,
row 1, which is that.

234
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,610
And then if we go here, that's
going to be flipped down here,

235
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,870
flipped across the diagonal.

236
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,060
So that's minus 1.

237
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,870
This is going to be flipped
all the way up there.

238
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,680
So that's minus 2.

239
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,245
And then this will
be flipped there.

240
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:54,730
This is minus 1.

241
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,780
We are almost done.

242
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:00,530
So this is the adjoint
of matrix a.

243
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,630
So to get the inverse of a-- and
let me actually erase some

244
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,880
of this, because we're going to
run out of space otherwise.

245
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:13,520
And as you can see, I'll be very
impressed if I have not

246
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,060
introduced a careless
mistake yet.

247
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:26,111
So let me erase all of this.

248
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:28,370
I'm building an appetite just
doing this problem.

249
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:31,360
It's so taxing on me.

250
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:39,020
So the inverse of matrix a
is equal to 1 over the

251
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:44,320
determinant of a times
the adjugate, or

252
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,590
adjoint, of matrix a.

253
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,680
So we solved for this part.

254
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,760
So now let's solve for
the determinant.

255
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,640
So the determinant of a-- and I
kept the matrix of cofactors

256
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:04,350
here for a reason-- the
determinant of a is-- if you

257
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,740
go across-- you can actually go
across any row-- but just

258
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,820
for simplicity, just remember
it this way.

259
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,380
You go across the top row, and
you multiply each term times

260
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:17,000
its corresponding cofactor,
and you add them.

261
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,780
So in this case, it'll be 1
times its corresponding

262
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,710
cofactor, which is 1.

263
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:29,160
Plus 0 times its corresponding
cofactor, which is 1.

264
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:34,030
Plus 1 times its corresponding
cofactor plus minus 2.

265
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:40,070
So this is 1 plus 0 minus 2.

266
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,550
It equals minus 1.

267
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,740
And thank God it was a
relatively straightforward

268
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,510
determinant.

269
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,560
And if you didn't have this
matrix of cofactors, the other

270
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,040
way you could think about it--
and this is good because it

271
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,040
gives you an intuition of how
we even got to the matrix of

272
00:13:51,040 --> 00:14:00,150
cofactors-- you could view this
as the same thing as 1

273
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:03,570
times the determinant
of its minor.

274
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,060
So if you cross out the row
and the column, it's this

275
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:06,640
determinant.

276
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:11,640
So it's 2, 1, 1, 1.

277
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,850
And remember there
was that pattern.

278
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,700
You have plus, and then
you go minus.

279
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,770
So minus 0 times the determinant
of its minor.

280
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,280
So you cross out that
row, that column.

281
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,890
So 0, 1, 1, 1.

282
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,280
And then we switch again.

283
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,570
We go back to plus.

284
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:33,540
Plus 1 times the determinant
of its minor.

285
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,310
So you cross out that
row, that column.

286
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,560
You get 0, 2, 1, 1.

287
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,160
And you could compute
this out.

288
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:47,110
And this is this cofactor.

289
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:51,080
This, with a minor sign,
this is just a minor.

290
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,360
And then when you apply
the minus sign, it

291
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,850
becomes this cofactor.

292
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,380
And then this is that minor.

293
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,980
And since it's a plus sign
there, that's that cofactor.

294
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,875
But anyway, I just wanted to
explain that, and hopefully it

295
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:00,450
hasn't confused you.

296
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:03,720
But we're ready now to solve
the inverse of a.

297
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,310
We know that the determinant
of a is equal to minus 1.

298
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:11,260
We know that the adjugate of
a is this number here.

299
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,810
So we now can solve
for the inverse.

300
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:14,630
And let's do that.

301
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,110
Let me erase all
of this stuff.

302
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,300
Cause actually, after I solve
for the inverse, I want to

303
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,670
prove to you that it is
the inverse-- maybe.

304
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,760
If I have enough time.

305
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,900
Because I just realized I'm
running pretty long.

306
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,410
That might be a good
exercise for you.

307
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,340
OK.

308
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:39,900
So the inverse of a is equal
to 1 over the determinant.

309
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,850
We figured out the determinant
is negative 1 times the

310
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,640
adjugate of a.

311
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:50,780
1, 1, minus 2.

312
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,840
1, 0, minus 1.

313
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,650
Minus 2, minus 1, 2.

314
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,350
So this is just minus
1, right?

315
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:02,250
So we just apply minus
1 times everything.

316
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,270
So we get-- if I haven't made
any careless mistakes-- minus

317
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:18,290
1, minus 1, plus 2, minus
1, 0, 1, 2, 1, minus 2.

318
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:23,860
I think that I have-- let's see,
I just did a minus times

319
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,610
everything.

320
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,730
That looks right.

321
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,140
And so that is a inverse.

322
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,160
And it only took
us 17 minutes.

323
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,050
And I will leave you there,
because it will probably take

324
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,469
me another 5 or 10 minutes
to even prove,

325
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,800
but that might be a good
exercise for you --

326
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,750
to multiply this matrix times
this matrix, and make sure

327
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,840
that you get the identity
matrix.

328
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,250
I will see you in
the next video.
