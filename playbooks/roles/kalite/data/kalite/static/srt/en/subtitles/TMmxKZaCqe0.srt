1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:04,100
Well, welcome back! I'm going to show you the last two logarithm properties now.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:04,890
So this one--

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,560
and I always found this one to be in some ways the most obvious one.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,440
But don't feel bad if it's not obvious.

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,110
Maybe it'll take a little bit of introspection.

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,690
And I encourage you to really experiment with all these logarithm properties,

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,210
because that's the only way that you'll really learn them.

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,350
And the point of math isn't just to pass the next exam,

9
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,470
or to get an A on the next exam.

10
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,840
The point of math is to understand math

11
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,400
so you can actually apply it in life later on

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,980
and not have to relearn everything every time.

13
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,260
So the next logarithm property is,

14
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:43,070
if I have A times the logarithm base B of C, if I have A times this whole thing,

15
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:59,160
then that equals logarithm base B of C to the A power.

16
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:00,520
Fascinating.

17
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,290
So let's see if this works out.

18
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:17,210
So let's say if I have three times logarithm base two of eight.

19
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,850
So this property tells us that this

20
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:30,240
is going to be the same thing as logarithm base two of eight to the third power.

21
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,200
And that's the same thing.

22
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:38,150
Well, that's the same thing as-- we could figure it out.

23
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,490
So let's see what this is.

24
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,480
three times log base-- what's log base two of eight?

25
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,540
The reason why I kind of hesitated a second ago is

26
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,060
because every time I want to figure something out,

27
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,770
I implicitly want to use log and exponential rules to do it.

28
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,200
So I'm trying to avoid that.

29
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,660
Anyway, going back.

30
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,350
What is this?

31
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,537
two to the what power is eight?

32
00:01:58,537 --> 00:02:00,550
two to the third power is eight, right?

33
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,880
So that's three.

34
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,060
We have this three here, so three times three.

35
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,310
So this thing right here should equal nine.

36
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,690
If this equals nine,

37
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,960
then we know that this property works at least for this example.

38
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,570
You don't know if it works for all examples,

39
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,620
and for that maybe you'd want to look at the proof we have in the other videos.

40
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,960
But that's kind of a more advanced topic.

41
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,480
But the important thing first is just to understand how to use it.

42
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,770
Let's see, what is two to the ninth power?

43
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,240
Well it's going to be some large number.

44
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,740
Actually, I know what it is-- it's two hundred and fifty-six.

45
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,890
Because in the last video we figured out that two to the

46
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,110
eighth was equal to two hundred and fifty-six.

47
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:43,170
So two to the ninth should be five hundred and twelve.

48
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,880
So two to the ninth should be five hundred and twelve.

49
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,810
So if eight to the third is also five hundred and twelve then we are correct, right?

50
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:57,770
Because log base two of five hundred and twelve is going to be equal to nine.

51
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,680
What's eight to the third?

52
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,640
It's sixty-four-- right.

53
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:05,430
eight squared is sixty-four, so eight cubed-- let's see.

54
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,730
four times eight. so, it's two and three.

55
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,410
six times eight-- looks like it's five hundred and twelve.

56
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,140
Correct.

57
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,650
And there's other ways you could have done it.

58
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,550
Because you could have said eight to the third

59
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,940
is the same thing as two to the ninth.

60
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,120
How do we know that?

61
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,630
Well, eight to the third

62
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:25,230
is equal to two to the third to the third, right?

63
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,020
I just rewrote eight.

64
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,290
And we know from our exponent rules that two to the third to the third

65
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:35,280
is the same thing as two to the ninth.

66
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,140
And actually it's this exponent property, where you can multiply--

67
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,380
when you take something to exponent and then take that to an exponent,

68
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,000
and you can essentially just multiply the exponents--

69
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:50,630
that's the exponent property that actually leads to this logarithm property.

70
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,080
But I'm not going to dwell on that too much in this presentation.

71
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,450
There's a whole video on kind of proving it a little bit more formally.

72
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,820
The next logarithm property I'm going to show you--

73
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,580
and then I'll review everything and maybe do some examples.

74
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:11,570
This is probably the single most useful logarithm property if you are a calculator addict.

75
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,690
And I'll show you why.

76
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:26,380
So let's say I have log base B of A

77
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:40,470
is equal to log base C of A divided by log base C of B.

78
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,210
Now why is this a useful property if you are calculator addict?

79
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,340
Well, let's say you go class, and there's a quiz.

80
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:51,160
The teacher says, you can use your calculator,

81
00:04:51,160 --> 00:05:03,380
and using your calculator I want you to figure out the log base seventeen of three hundred and fifty-seven.

82
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:08,460
And you will scramble and look for the log base seventeen button on your calculator,

83
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,520
and not find it.

84
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,140
Because there is no log base seventeen button on your calculator.

85
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,400
You'll probably either have a log button

86
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,040
or you'll have an ln button.

87
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,800
And just so you know, the log button on your calculator

88
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,510
is probably base ten.

89
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:28,460
And your ln button on your calculator

90
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,550
is going to be base e.

91
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,730
For those you who aren't familiar with e, don't worry about it

92
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,070
but it's 2.71 something something.

93
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,030
It's a number.

94
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:40,870
It's an amazing number, but we'll talk more about that in a future presentation.

95
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,570
But so there's only two bases you have on your calculator.

96
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,360
So if you want to figure out another base logarithm,

97
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,010
you use this property.

98
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,160
So if you're given this on an exam,

99
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:57,540
you can very confidently say, oh, well that is just the same thing as--

100
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,880
you'd have to switch to your yellow color in order to act with confidence--

101
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,650
log base-- we could do either e or ten.

102
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:11,280
We could say that's the same thing as log base ten of three hundred and fifty-seven

103
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:15,800
divided by log base ten of seventeen.

104
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:19,740
So you literally could just type in three hundred and fifty-seven in your calculator

105
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,420
and press the log button

106
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,220
and you're going to get blah blah blah.

107
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,220
Then, you know, you can clear it,

108
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,530
or if you know how to use the parentheses on your calculator, you could do that.

109
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,220
But then you type seventeen on your calculator,

110
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,520
press the log button, you get blah blah blah.

111
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,390
And then you just divide them, and you get your answer.

112
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:37,360
So this is a super useful property for calculator addicts.

113
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,920
And once again, I'm not going to go into a lot of depth.

114
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,690
This one, to me it's the most useful,

115
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:48,120
but it doesn't completely--

116
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,040
it does fall out of, obviously, the exponent properties.

117
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,930
But it's hard for me to describe the intuition simply,

118
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,350
so you probably want to watch the proof on it,

119
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,320
if you don't believe why this happens.

120
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,130
But anyway, with all of those aside,

121
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:03,120
and this is probably the one you're going to be using the most in everyday life.

122
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,840
I still use this in my job.

123
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:09,390
Just so you know logarithms are useful.

124
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:14,100
Let's do some examples.

125
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:19,220
Let's just rewrite a bunch of things in simpler forms.

126
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:36,520
So if I wanted to write the log base two of the square root of--

127
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,850
let me think of something.

128
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:50,550
Of thirty-two divided by the cube-- no, I'll just take the square root.

129
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,120
Divided by the square root of eight.

130
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,080
How can I rewrite this so it's reasonably not messy?

131
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,180
Well let's think about this.

132
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:04,450
This is the same thing, this is equal to--

133
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,790
I don't know if I'll move vertically or horizontally.

134
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,310
I'll move vertically.

135
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:13,120
This is the same thing as the log base two of thirty-two

136
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:17,740
over the square root of eight to the one half power, right?

137
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,130
And we know from our logarithm properties, the third one we learned,

138
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:25,910
that that is the same thing as one half

139
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:33,830
times the logarithm of thirty-two divided by the square root of eight, right?

140
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,840
I just took the exponent

141
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,570
and made that the coefficient on the entire thing.

142
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,400
And we learned that in the beginning of this video.

143
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,640
And now we have a little quotient here, right?

144
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,330
Logarithm of thirty-two divided by logarithm of square root of eight.

145
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,020
Well, we can use our other logarithm--

146
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,470
let's keep the one half out.

147
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:56,470
That's going to equal, parentheses, logarithm--

148
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,580
oh, I forgot my base.

149
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:02,480
Logarithm base two of thirty-two minus, right?

150
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,000
Because this is in a quotient.

151
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,310
Minus the logarithm base two of the square root of eight.

152
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,650
Right?

153
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,400
Let's see.

154
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,860
Well here once again we have a square root here,

155
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:22,190
so we could say this is equal to one half times log base two of thirty-two.

156
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,560
Minus this eight to the one half,

157
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,850
which is the same thing as one half log base two of eight.

00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,380
We learned that property in the beginning of this presentation.

159
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,740
And then if we want, we can distribute this original one half.

160
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:42,170
This equals one half log base two of thirty-two minus one fourth--

161
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,800
because we have to distribute that one half--

162
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,840
minus one fourth log base two of eight.

163
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:52,490
This is five halves minus, this is three.

164
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,120
three times one fourth minus three fourths.

165
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,440
Or ten fourths minus three fourths is equal to seven fourths.

166
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,140
I probably made some arithmetic errors, but you get the point.

167
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,720
See you soon!
