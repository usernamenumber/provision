1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
   

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:09,240
I've talked a lot about what
fractional reserve banking is,

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,260
but I have kind of reserved
making any commentary on it,

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,310
and that's what I'm actually
going to do in this video.

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,760
So just as a bit of a review on
the whole banking playlist,

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,610
I started off with a
very simple example

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,390
of we're on an island.

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,600
Let's say you had all of the
gold on an island and you give

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,530
it to me for safekeeping.

10
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:32,000
So now, I have this asset called
gold, and let's say

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,740
it's 100 gold pieces
that you gave me.

12
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,610
And I also have a liability.

13
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:41,950
This is my primitive island
bank, and my liability is that

14
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,580
you could demand this gold from
me whenever you want, so

15
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,150
this is my liability.

16
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,660
If I were to draw your
balance sheet, this

17
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:50,510
would be your asset.

18
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:55,435
So this would be an
IOU to depositor.

19
00:00:55,435 --> 00:00:58,960
   

20
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,730
So at any point in time, I've
told you, look, I have this

21
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,290
nice safe, this vault there,
but you can come to me any

22
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,180
time and take as much of
your gold as you want.

23
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,640
And we, of course, know from the
fractional reserve banking

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,150
playlist that there's a slight
discrepancy between what I

25
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,790
told you, the depositor, and the
reality of the situation,

26
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,440
because the first thing that I'm
going to do when you take

27
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,490
this is, you know, I've taken
your deposits and I could

28
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,220
charge you for keeping your
money with me, but I've come

29
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:33,390
up with a slightly sneakier
scheme, where I say, hey, I've

30
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,620
seen your behavior.

31
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,990
You never withdraw more than 10
gold pieces out at a time.

32
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,960
So what I do is I lend out all
but 10 of your gold pieces.

33
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,210
So we end up with
the situation.

34
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:47,990
   

35
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:55,810
I have an IOU to you of 100 gold
pieces like that, and I

36
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,600
take the other 90 gold pieces
and I lend it out to random

37
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,900
entrepreneurs on our island.

38
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:05,480
   

39
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:10,930
So loan to A and that
is loan to B.

40
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,910
And I think this is great,
because I obviously collect

41
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:17,080
interest from these guys, and
assuming that these guys don't

42
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,040
blow the money, I'll get all the
money back, so you'll get

43
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,210
all your money back and I'll get
some interest, and I can

44
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,880
say, hey, I'm keeping
your money for free.

45
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,460
You get safekeeping, and I
collect the interest on it,

46
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,450
and maybe that helps to fund
making the vault nice, and

47
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,550
everyone's happy.

48
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,720
But clearly here, there
is a discrepancy.

49
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,650
What did I tell you?

50
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,125
What did I tell you,
the depositor?

51
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:40,530
   

52
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,990
I told you that you can
withdraw 100 gold

53
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,240
pieces at any time.

54
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:54,030
   

55
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,280
Now, what is the reality?

56
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,190
   

57
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:07,830
The reality is you can withdraw
10 gold pieces at any

58
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:12,250
time, and clearly, this is-- I
don't know if you want to call

59
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,250
this a lie or not,
but this isn't

60
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,460
completely true right here.

61
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,660
And I know some of you might be
saying, hey, Sal, this is

62
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,190
kind of a very primitive example
of gold pieces, but

63
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,990
our current banking system
doesn't work quite like this.

64
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:29,220
And just to make sure that you
understand that the analogy

65
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,570
isn't completely off from our
current baking system, our

66
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:35,660
current banking system is more
like this: You have 10 gold

67
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,080
pieces that you give me.

68
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,320
I'll draw it here.

69
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,930
This is the modern
banking system.

70
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:49,780
What you do is you give me a
deposit of 10 gold pieces like

71
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,686
that, and so I say that,
yeah, sure, I

72
00:03:54,686 --> 00:03:56,960
owe you 10 gold pieces.

73
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,610
So this is my IOU to you.

74
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:02,120
Everything looks nice and clean
right now, but what I

75
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,230
then do is then I issue checking
deposits to other

76
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:09,030
people, and my limit on how many
checking deposits I can

77
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,400
issue is based on the reserve
requirements and all of that.

78
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,660
But let's say I have to keep
at least 10% reserves, just

79
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,540
keep the math simple.

80
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:24,470
So what I do in our modern
system is I make a loan to B

81
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:30,190
like that and I gave B a
checking account that is

82
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,910
equivalent to your
checking account.

83
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,350
So this is an IOU to B.

84
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,410
So this is essentially a promise
to B that, look, this

85
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,290
is a checking account, and
any time you can come

86
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,830
and get this much.

87
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:47,680
Maybe this was 40, maybe
this is 50 gold pieces.

88
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,760
This means that you can come
at any time and get 40 gold

89
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,590
pieces from me.

90
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,850
But we know the reality that
people actually don't actually

91
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:54,940
get the gold pieces.

92
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,820
In our modern system, we're not
even dealing with gold.

93
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,270
This will be reserve currency,
but it's the same idea that

94
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:05,480
people are getting money that
really isn't necessarily in

95
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:05,980
the reserves.

96
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:12,650
And, of course, I'm going to
make another loan to person A,

97
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,130
and I'm just going to
create a checking

98
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,890
account deposit for them.

99
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:21,070
I'm just going to create an IOU
to A for 50, and the whole

100
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:25,140
reason why this works is because
people use these

101
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,980
checking account deposits
as a form of money.

102
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,690
When I write you a check,
notice what's happening.

103
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,420
I'm just transferring one of
these checking account

104
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:41,080
deposits from me to you without
any gold or without

105
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,720
any reserve currency actually
changing hands.

106
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,530
So that's how it works.

107
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,120
But if you look at these two
balance sheets, one is kind of

108
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,790
the primitive example.

109
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,570
On my island where I had 100
gold pieces and I lent

110
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,460
out 90, I owe 100.

111
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,660
I've told people, maybe it's
just one person, that hey, you

112
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,560
can come to me at any time and
get your 100 gold pieces, but

113
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,180
the reality is I've lent
all but 10 of it

114
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,490
out to other people.

115
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,460
Now what's the situation
in the modern?

116
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,550
Well, I've told people that
there's 100 gold pieces that

117
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,940
can come from me, right?

118
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,190
10 to the original depositor,
40 to this guy that I gave a

119
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,490
loan to, and another 50 to that
guy, but the reality is

120
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,540
that I only have 10 gold pieces
in my vault and my

121
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,340
other assets are just
loans to people.

122
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,000
So if you look at these two
balance sheets, you see that

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,980
they are equivalent.

124
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,130
I always like to start with this
one because this one at

125
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,320
least makes more sense.

126
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,910
If you were to just walk up to a
five-year-old and say, look,

127
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,230
this is what fractional reserve
banking is, this one

128
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,830
starts to seem even a little
bit even shadier, because

129
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,750
you're creating these loans and
you're creating these IOUs

130
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,490
out of thin air, but your end
result is that they're equally

131
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:46,320
shady because they both
have the same

132
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,300
resulting balance sheet.

133
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,850
So your next question is, hey
Sal, what's wrong with this?

134
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:55,410
And I could ask my son, once
he learns to talk, what's

135
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,640
wrong with this is that there's
a discrepancy between

136
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,800
what I told the depositor-- so
in this case, I told the

137
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,460
depositor you can withdraw 100
gold pieces at any time, when

138
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,250
the reality is they
can withdraw 10.

139
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:11,680
Here, I'm telling the depositor,
you can take your

140
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:21,800
money whenever, where the
reality in this modern system

141
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,150
is that you can demand
whenever-- and I would throw

142
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:37,970
an asterisk there-- as long as
no more than 10% ask for the

143
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,220
money at the same time.

144
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:47,270
   

145
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,460
Now, obviously, I think this
is-- everyone already becomes

146
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,270
a little uncomfortable when
you say this, but you say,

147
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:56,310
look, this is what our modern
financial system is based on

148
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:00,150
and what this allows is this
guy, this bank, however you

149
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,680
want to view it, is allowed to
be an intermediary between the

150
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,780
savers, the people who are
giving their deposits, and the

151
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,360
people who need to invest the
capital in building new

152
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,340
projects and whatever else.

153
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,130
And the counterargument to that
for someone who's against

154
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,160
fractional banking is there's
nothing to stop

155
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,330
you from doing this.

156
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,390
All you have to do is tell
this guy the truth.

157
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:23,940
What you do is, you do this
exact same scenario.

158
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,580
   

159
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,410
You don't tell him you
can withdraw 100 gold

160
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,940
pieces at any time.

161
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:39,330
You tell him you can withdraw 10
gold pieces at any time and

162
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:47,030
that maybe another 40 gold
pieces will be available

163
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,540
whenever this guy is supposed to
pay back his loan, maybe in

164
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:58,210
a year, and that the other 50
gold pieces would be available

165
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,970
whenever this guy pays
his loan back.

166
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,460
Maybe it's in two years.

167
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,960
So the question is why
doesn't this happen?

168
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:11,830
Well, the reality is because if
you told the depositor that

169
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,140
they can't have all of their
money on demand,

170
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,760
he'd say, OK, fine.

171
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,770
One, assuming that you're giving
these guys-- these are

172
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:21,890
legitimate people to give your
money to-- I want some of the

173
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,720
interest that you're taking
because you're just lending

174
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,330
out my money.

175
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:34,530
If you were to lock up your
money for longer, people would

176
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,740
want interest for this.

177
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,390
But when the bank is allowed
to kind of tell this

178
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:41,220
half-truth, they don't have to
give as much interest on it,

179
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,440
because when people say, oh, I
can get my money whenever I

180
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,790
want, they say, well, then I
don't need that much interest

181
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,160
on it, because it's on demand.

182
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,730
But the reality is they
can't get all of their

183
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:49,740
money at any time.

184
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,680
They can only get some
fraction of their

185
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,300
money at any time.

186
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,110
So the next thought might be,
OK, you're being a little bit

187
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,970
disingenuous when you tell the
depositor that it's on demand

188
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,230
and because you're being
disingenuous, you're allowed

189
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,220
to kind of not give them as
much interest as you would

190
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,350
have to give them if you told
them that their money is

191
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:12,980
locked up, but what's wrong
as long as you are a good

192
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,030
investor and that you put
this money to good use?

193
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,570
Doesn't the whole
world benefit?

194
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:22,030
And that might be true most of
the time, assuming everything

195
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,250
I just told you, but imagine
a situation where we have

196
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,530
multiple banks in
our universe.

197
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:28,400
   

198
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,800
Let me draw my multiple banks.

199
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:39,390
So this is bank one, I have bank
two, and then bank three.

200
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,360
And bank one and bank
two are very

201
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,370
honest and good investors.

202
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,470
And we all know it's very hard
to know who's a good or a bad

203
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,170
investor, especially when times
are good, because then

204
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,650
most loans tend to
come out good.

205
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,190
So they're good investors.

206
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:59,210
But bank three takes
on extra risk.

207
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,870
Let me write it down.

208
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,980
And what's their incentive
for taking extra risk?

209
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,950
Let's say that bank three is
willing to lend to people that

210
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:11,210
banks one and two weren't
willing to lend to.

211
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:14,190
So bank three's balance sheet
here, these loans, are going

212
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,800
to be riskier loans.

213
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,830
Now why would they do that?

214
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,950
Because when you give it to
riskier people, you're able to

215
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,430
take more interest from them.

216
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:29,820
So they take extra risk, which
leads to extra interest. And

217
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,740
actually, if you were to look at
these banks, you would say

218
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,050
that this guy's the most
profitable bank.

219
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:40,020
   

220
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,180
Even worse, because he's getting
extra interest, he can

221
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,580
actually share more of that
extra interest with their

222
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,790
depositors.

223
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,340
So you can give higher yielding
checking accounts, I

224
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,010
guess I could call it.

225
00:11:52,010 --> 00:12:00,090
Higher interest on deposits.

226
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,620
So in this situation, the person
who's taking the most

227
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,240
risk is going to be the most
profitable and they're going

228
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,690
to give the higher interest
and that might actually

229
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:10,910
attract the most deposits,
right?

230
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,100
If all these guys look the same
to me, and we all know

231
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,930
it's very hard to know what
banks are actually doing with

232
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,250
their money, then I'll say,
hey, I'm going to give my

233
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,410
money to this guy right
over there.

234
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:24,090
But then what happens as
soon as things go bad?

235
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,320
As soon as the world gets a
little bit of difficult, this

236
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,180
extra risk actually starts
rearing its ugly head and then

237
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,600
this guy becomes insolvent.

238
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,040
So this guy's-- let me see if I
can draw his balance sheet.

239
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,170
His balance sheet will look
something like that.

240
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,650
He has a bunch of loans out.

241
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:43,470
He's got some reserves right
there and then he's got a

242
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:49,050
bunch of deposits that you or
I might have given him.

243
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,710
These are our IOUs to us.

244
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,840
These are his loans out.

245
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,210
As soon as things start going
bad, some of these loans are

246
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,190
going to go bad.

247
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:59,440
As soon as one of those loans
go bad, I'm going to hear

248
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,775
about it on the news, and I'm
going to run over to the bank,

249
00:13:02,775 --> 00:13:05,400
and I'm going to say, let me get
my money back as quickly

250
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:05,990
as possible.

251
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,950
And let's say I'm the first
one there and I

252
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:08,870
get my money back.

253
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,120
They promised it to me.

254
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,460
   

255
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,500
So I withdraw my account right
there, and I get all my money

256
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,780
back, and I essentially
deplete the reserves.

257
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,500
Now the next guy's going
to come along.

258
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,980
This guy was a little bit of
a slower runner than me.

259
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,680
He comes to the bank, and he
says give me back my reserves.

260
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,910
And the bank says there
are no reserves.

261
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,820
And then this guy is mad.

262
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,850
He has no reserves.

263
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,920
And, of course, the whole time
this guy's assets are just

264
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,980
becoming worthless because he's
loaned it to people who

265
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,440
invested it badly.

266
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,235
And so you have all of these
people-- when he finds out

267
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,450
that this guy didn't get his
money, all of these people are

268
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,780
going to go there and demand
their money and the bank is

269
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,340
going to be insolvent.

270
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,490
It's going to be two things.

271
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,330
It's going to be illiquid
and insolvent.

272
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,170
And I've explained the
difference, but illiquid might

273
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:55,980
mean the loans might be good--
and actually I'll reiterate it

274
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,980
in this video-- but the loans
might be good, it just doesn't

275
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,900
have the cash.

276
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,100
Insolvent means that these loans
aren't good, that the

277
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,690
value of these loans aren't
equal to these deposits.

278
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,190
So I'll say that this risky
bank is insolvent.

279
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:09,640
   

280
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,430
Now, you might say these guys
right here deserve it.

281
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:17,760
They guys deserve what they got
because they were greedy.

282
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,310
They invested in this risky
bank that was doing shady

283
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,010
things just to get a
little bit higher

284
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,470
interest on their deposits.

285
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,780
But what happens when
this happens?

286
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:30,010
Well, you have these good banks
over here that maybe did

287
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,370
really conservative lending.

288
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,970
   

289
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,110
So this is what their balance
sheets-- maybe both of their

290
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,050
balance sheets look like this.

291
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,450
They have some reserves
right there.

292
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:44,190
They've made out some good loans
to good entrepreneurs

293
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,450
and then you have their
depositors.

294
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:49,660
   

295
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,270
But as soon as this guy finds
out about what happened at

296
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,370
that bank, he's like, things
are really bad.

297
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:58,060
Let me just be careful and go
to my bank-- let's say it's

298
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,490
this depositor right here-- and
take my money out and put

299
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,800
it into my mattress.

300
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,500
So he goes to the bank and
he's the first one there.

301
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,500
He's the fastest runner of
all of the depositors.

302
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,970
So he claims his deposit.

303
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:11,120
So his deposit, he
withdraws, and he

304
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,370
depletes all of the reserves.

305
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,050
   

306
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,750
Now, he wasn't the only
guy who was afraid.

307
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,610
This guy was afraid as well.

308
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,330
So he comes running to the bank,
and the bank now says,

309
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:25,820
gee, I know I made this promise
to you that you have

310
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:30,150
an on-demand account, but that
guy you saw leaving the bank

311
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,360
with the running shoes on, he
actually just took all of the

312
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,200
reserves, and I guess I have
to admit now that I lied to

313
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,130
you, that it isn't completely
on demand.

314
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,390
I actually loaned out the
rest of your money.

315
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,620
But I was a good banker.

316
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,680
These are actually good loans.

317
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,340
These loans are still worth
what they want.

318
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,970
If you just wait long enough,
you'll get your money back.

319
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,280
And, of course, this guy's
going to be not so happy

320
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,590
because he was lied to.

321
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,430
And that's not going
to be the only guy.

322
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,390
Slightly slower runners are
going to come there and also

323
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,550
demand their money.

324
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,200
And this is known
as a bank run.

325
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,640
   

326
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,950
Where because one maybe bad
apple in the system actually

327
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:10,220
is insolvent, everyone becomes
afraid and comes and says,

328
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,420
give me my money, and because
we have this fractional

329
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,700
reserve system, the
money isn't there.

330
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,200
It just will not be there
because 90% of it is lent out.

331
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,230
And so once this happens there,
then you're going to

332
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,830
have a run on bank two, and then
everyone is going to take

333
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,610
their money out of the
banking system.

334
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,240
So the whole banking system,
this situation right here

335
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,810
where the assets maybe still
are worth the same or more

336
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:35,780
than the liabilities, this guy's
still solvent, but he

337
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,720
doesn't have any money to pay
these on-demand accounts, so

338
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,460
this guy is running into
a liquidity problem.

339
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,620
   

340
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,460
He doesn't have the reserves,
and that's why we have the

341
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,920
whole Federal Reserve that's
a lender of last resort.

342
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,140
This guy can walk to the Federal
Reserve and say, hey,

343
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,630
I have some people knocking
on my door.

344
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,590
Give me some loans.

345
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:02,870
The Federal Reserve will lend
this guy some money, and, of

346
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:08,020
course, then this guy's going
to have another lender to it

347
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,319
called the Federal Reserve and
he can use this to pay off

348
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,400
these guys.

349
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,420
But that leaves another
question: How does the Federal

350
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:16,510
Reserve really know the
difference between this guy--

351
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,650
he might say, OK,
this guy's good.

352
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,810
Let me just lend to him to make
sure that he doesn't have

353
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,010
a liquidity problem.

354
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,940
How does the Federal Reserve
really know the difference

355
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,750
between this guy and this
guy right here?

356
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,480
This guy's going to also run
to the Federal Reserve.

357
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,260
Hey, Federal Reserve, these
loans are still good.

358
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,940
Just give me a loan so I can pay
these people right there.

359
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,640
So the Federal Reserve says,
hey, you look good.

360
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,500
You're a nice clean banker in a
nice, fancy building wearing

361
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,680
a Rolex on your arm.

362
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,650
You must be good for it.

363
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:46,460
So the Federal Reserve will also
lend this guy, and now

364
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:50,170
this guy also owes the Federal
Reserve some money.

365
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,920
We can already see that in
this fractional reserve

366
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,750
banking system, you have two
problems. You have an unstable

367
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:04,370
equilibrium, where one bad apple
can lead to a run on the

368
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,620
entire system.

369
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:14,970
   

370
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,590
And I'll talk about what's been
engineered to fix this

371
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:20,310
problem: essentially
banking insurance.

372
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,000
I'll probably wait for that
to the next video.

373
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,130
So this is the first
problem right here.

374
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:29,520
And then the second problem is
that it really becomes hard to

375
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,710
differentiate between the
good and bad banks.

376
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:37,730
   

377
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:40,810
I mean, it's not so hard to
differentiate at face-- well,

378
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,790
it is hard to differentiate at
first and becomes even harder

379
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,610
to differentiate when you
always have the Federal

380
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:48,320
Reserve willing to be a
lender of last resort.

381
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,500
And when I talk about the
Federal Reserve insurance,

382
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,740
that makes it even harder to
differentiate, and because

383
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,345
it's harder to differentiate,
there's a huge incentive for

384
00:18:55,345 --> 00:18:56,630
banks to take on risk.

385
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:59,430
Because when times are good,
they'll make more money than

386
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:03,630
everyone else, and then when
times are bad, it's really

387
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:06,510
hard, that they'll all
suffer equally.

388
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,560
So in the video, I'll talk about
some of what has been

389
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,960
engineered to fix these problems
and see if they

390
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,770
actually make sense.
