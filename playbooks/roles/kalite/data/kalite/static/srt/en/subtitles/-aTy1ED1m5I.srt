Graph the inequality y minus 4x is less than negative 3

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the first thing we can do is we can kind of put this in mx plus b form or slope-intercept form

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but as an inequality, so let's start with y minus 4x is less than negative 3

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we can add 4x to both sides of this inequality

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let's add 4x to both sides of this inequality

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then we'll just have a y on both sides

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
these guys cancel out

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so you have y is less than 4x minus 3

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we can have negative 3 plus 4x

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but we want to write 4x first

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because that's a form that we're more familiar with
