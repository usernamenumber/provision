1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,510
   

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,320
Solve the system of equations
by graphing.

3
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,800
Check your solution
algebraically.

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,810
Let's graph each of these, and
let's start-- let me find a

5
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,620
nice dark color to
graph these with.

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,180
Let me graph this top equation
in blue, this parabola.

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,170
The first thing to think about
is this going to be an upward

8
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,690
opening-- one, how did I
know it's a parabola?

9
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,180
That's because it's a quadratic
function: we have an

10
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,510
x squared term, a second
degree term, here.

11
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:26,870
Then we have to think about:
it is going to be upward

12
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,370
opening, or downward
opening parabola?

13
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,940
You see that it's a negative
coefficient in front of the x

14
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:34,520
squared, so it's going to be a
downward opening parabola.

15
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,500
What is going to be
its maximum point?

16
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,330
Let's think about that
for a second.

17
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:44,410
This whole term right here is
always going to be negative,

18
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,540
or it's always going
to be non-positive.

19
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,710
x squared will be non-negative
when you multiply it by a

20
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,240
negative, so it's going
to be non-positive.

21
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,560
So, the highest value that this
thing can take on is when

22
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,100
x is going to be equal to 0--
the vertex of this parabola is

23
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,560
when x is equal to 0,
and y is equal to 6.

24
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,640
So, x is equal to 0, and
y is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

25
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,710
So that right there is the
highest point of our parabola.

26
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,480
Then, if we want, we can a
graph a couple of other

27
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,810
points, just to see
what happens.

28
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:21,950
So let's see what happens when
x is equal to-- let me just

29
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:27,680
draw a little table here--
2, what is y?

30
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,020
It's negative x squared
plus 6.

31
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,090
So when x is 2, what is y?

32
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,430
You have 2 squared, which is
4, but you have negative 2

33
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,200
squared, so it's negative 4
plus 6-- it is equal to 2.

34
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,120
It's the same thing when
x is negative 2.

35
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,500
You put negative 2 there, you
square it, then you have

36
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,430
positive 4, but you have a
negative there, so it's

37
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,510
negative 4 plus 6 is 2.

38
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:51,930
You have both of those points
there, so 2 comma 2, and then

39
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,450
you have a negative 2 comma 2.

40
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,720
   

41
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,590
If I were to graph it, Let's try
it with 3, as well-- if we

42
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,190
put a 3 there, 3 squared is 9.

43
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,419
It then becomes a negative 9
plus 3, it becomes negative 3,

44
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,770
and negative 3 will also
become a negative 3.

45
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,230
Negative 3 squared is positive
9, you have a negative out

46
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,250
front, it becomes negative 9
plus 6, which is negative 3.

47
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:23,850
You have negative 3, negative
3, and then you have 3,

48
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:24,780
negative 3.

49
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,690
So those are all good points.

50
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,000
Now we can graph our parabola.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,820
Our parabola will look
something-- I was doing well

52
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:39,480
until that second part --like
that, and let me just do the

53
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,475
second part.

54
00:02:40,475 --> 00:02:48,610
That second part is hard to
draw-- let me do it from here.

55
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:52,530
It looks something like that.

56
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,960
We connect to this dot
right here, and then

57
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,820
let me connect this.

58
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,310
So that it looks something
like that.

59
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,150
That's what our parabola looks
like, and obviously it keeps

60
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,990
going down in that direction.

61
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,180
So that's that first graph.

62
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,180
Let's graph this second one
over here: y is equal to

63
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,660
negative 2x minus 2.

64
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,830
This is just going
to be a line.

65
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,510
It's a linear equation, and the
highest degree here is 1.

66
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:16,420
Our y-intercept is negative
2, so 0, 1, 2.

67
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,440
Our y-intercept is negative 2.

68
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,820
Our slope is negative 2.

69
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,420
If we move 1 in the x direction,
we're going to go 2

70
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,480
in the y-direction, and if we
move 2 in the x direction,

71
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,600
we're going to move down
4 in the y direction.

72
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,580
If we move back 2, we're going
to move up 2 in the y

73
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,800
direction, and it looks like we
found one of our points of

74
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,090
intersection.

75
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,370
Let's just draw that line, so
that line will look something

76
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,135
like-- It's hard for my hand to
draw that, but let me try

77
00:03:47,135 --> 00:03:48,520
as best as I can.

78
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:56,280
   

79
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,780
This is the hardest part.

80
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,690
It will look something like
that right there.

81
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,820
The question is, where
do they intersect?

82
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,100
One point of intersection does
immediately pop out at us,

83
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,330
because they asked us to
do it graphically.

84
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:14,420
That point right there, which
is the point negative 2, 2.

85
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,675
   

86
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:19,690
It seems to pop out at
us, so this is the

87
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,190
point negative 2, 2.

88
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,440
Let's see if that makes sense.

89
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,150
When you have the point negative
2, when you put x is

90
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,540
equal to negative 2 here,
negative 2 times negative 2 is

91
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,370
4 minus 2, and y
is equal to 2.

92
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,860
When you put negative 2 here, y
is also equal to 2, so that

93
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,860
makes sense.

94
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,070
There's going to be some other
point way out here where they

95
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,520
also intersect.

96
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,090
There's also going to be some
other point way out here if we

97
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,210
keep making this parabola.

98
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:50,600
When y is equal to positive 4,
and you have negative 16 plus

99
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,680
6, you get negative 10.

100
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,760
So, positive 1, 2, 3, 4, and
then you go down 10.

101
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:02,290
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

102
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,300
That looks like that might
be our other point of

103
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,680
intersection, so let me connect
this right there.

104
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,140
Our other point of intersection

105
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,210
looks to be right there.

106
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,670
If we just follow this red
line it looks like we

107
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,850
intersect there.

108
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,490
Let's verify that
it works out.

109
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,130
So 4, negative 10.

110
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,980
We know that that's on this
blue line, so let's see if

111
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,940
it's on this other line.

112
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:28,370
So negative 2 times 4 minus 2,
that is negative 8 minus 2,

113
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,180
which is equal to negative 10.

114
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,000
The point 4, negative 10,
is on both of them.

115
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,070
When x is equal to 4, y is
negative 10 for both equations

116
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:43,670
here, so they both definitely
work out.

117
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:43,933
