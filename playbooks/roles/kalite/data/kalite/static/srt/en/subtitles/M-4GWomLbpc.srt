1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,180
   

2
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:04,050
Everything we've covered so far
dealt in a world of only

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:08,000
one bank and we all know that
there are more than one bank

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,750
in this world.

5
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,360
Let's see what happens
in that example.

6
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,810
So I've drawn the balance sheets
for three hypothetical

7
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:17,660
banks in a world where gold is
the reserve currency and let's

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,450
see what happens
in that world.

9
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,210
So let me show you all of the--
so that's the first one

10
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,090
and that's the last one.

11
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,990
They all didn't fit on the
screen, but just so you

12
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,560
understand and a bit of review
of what we covered in the last

13
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,840
several videos, in these balance
sheets, of course the

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,170
left side are the assets, the
right-hand side, up until

15
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,490
here, is liability.

16
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,165
So from here to here,
that's liabilities.

17
00:00:37,165 --> 00:00:38,910
And what's left over
is the equity.

18
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,960
So in every balance sheet, just
to be consistent, I made

19
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,690
this blue color equal
to the equity.

20
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:45,940
Let me write that down.

21
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,700
   

22
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,830
And just to be consistent, I
made this little orange color

23
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,830
the building, brown
for building.

24
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,080
And this yellow or this gold
color-- that's actually the

25
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,500
gold reserves of that bank.

26
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,830
And each of these lines, these
divide the various other

27
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:03,700
assets of the bank.

28
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,100
In this case, they're just
loans, maybe to different

29
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,250
entrepreneurs.

30
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,650
And then these green lines
separate the different demand

31
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,040
deposits or checking accounts
that are with that bank and

32
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,220
then the green-- this filled in
green, for example, in this

33
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,870
middle bank-- that shows
its notes outstanding.

34
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,140
Remember, there's two ways that
you could essentially

35
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,080
give someone an IOU
from this bank.

36
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,400
One is to say, oh, you have a
checking account and you can

37
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,200
write checks against it.

38
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,280
The other way is to issue this
bank note and someone can come

39
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,010
back later with this bank note
and you should have to give

40
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,450
them an equivalent
amount of gold.

41
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,450
So in this middle bank, this
green area, that shows its

42
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,610
bank notes outstanding.

43
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,630
This purple area in this bank,
that's its bank notes

44
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:44,660
outstanding.

45
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,740
And then down here, this
off-white color is its bank

46
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,700
notes outstanding.

47
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,390
Fair enough.

48
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,540
We've created a world
with three banks

49
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,550
Now what is the problem here
or, are there any problems?

50
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,840
Well, there are a couple
that I see immediately.

51
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,960
The first is, all of
them might have

52
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,830
different reserve ratios.

53
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,770
In the last video, I kind of
talked about a world with

54
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,220
regulation, but let's say in
this world, since every bank

55
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,020
is kind of a separate
entrepreneur, maybe it was

56
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,130
originally the goldsmith, they
all just made their own rule

57
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:20,460
of thumb that if I have this
amount of demand deposits

58
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,190
based on how my customers act
or whatever or based on my

59
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,000
liabilities or however it works,
I'm going to keep this

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,570
amount of gold.

61
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:31,490
So maybe this guy's reserve
ratio-- I don't know what the

62
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:37,140
ratio of this to this is, but
maybe his reserve ratio is 8%.

63
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,650
So for every 100 gold pieces
of demand deposits and bank

64
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,500
notes, he keeps eight gold
pieces on reserve.

65
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,330
Maybe this guy is 10%.

66
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,370
Looks a little bit better.

67
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,990
Maybe this guy up here is
keeping a 12% reserve ratio.

68
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,460
So there's no consistent
reserve ratio.

69
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,000
So let me write that down.

70
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:07,850
   

71
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,180
And there's a couple things
that that might lead to.

72
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,440
Maybe this guy right here, he
was the first bank to start--

73
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,020
or maybe this guy.

74
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,830
This guy had a 12% reserve
ratio-- and people really

75
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,120
trusted it for a long time.

76
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,440
Every time they deposited money
and then they came back

77
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,810
later, they were able
to find it.

78
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,790
He really lent money
really well.

79
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,830
So that there was never any
scare on this bank.

80
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,150
No one ever felt afraid to
keep their deposit there.

81
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,650
But as the banking business got
more and more profitable,

82
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,160
more and more risky people
showed up and this guy only

83
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,190
has an 8% reserve ratio.

84
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:44,010
And maybe one day, 9% of their
checking accounts want their

85
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,750
money back and this guy's
not good for it.

86
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,770
This guy up here, the 12% guy,
he knew that 9% could happen.

87
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,770
That on any given day 9% of
your demand deposits might

88
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:52,430
want their gold back.

89
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,180
So that's why he kept 12%.

90
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,820
But this guy kept an 8% so he
could get extra interest on

91
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,890
more loans.

92
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,290
So one day, he can't
give his gold back

93
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,530
and that scares everyone.

94
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,230
So everyone comes and you have
a run on this bank, but he's

95
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,050
not the only bank.

96
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,430
Everyone starts having less
trust in the banking system as

97
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,260
a whole and so there are runs
on all of these banks.

98
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,180
And that's unfortunate
for two reasons.

99
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,210
One, these guys were
safe to begin with.

100
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,350
They kept enough reserve
ratio so that people

101
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,540
could get their gold.

102
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,390
And then the other sad thing
about it is, if this guy just

103
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,670
needed another 1%-- I keep going
off the video screen--

104
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:29,980
if this guy just needed another
1% of gold, he could

105
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,870
have borrowed it from that top
guy and then you would have

106
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,540
prevented this whole
banking crisis.

107
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,600
He could have borrowed it
from either this guy

108
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,100
or that guy, right?

109
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,070
If this guy's gold gets depleted
and more people still

110
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,980
want money, this guy would
clearly rather lend the money

111
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,090
to this guy as long as he's
still solvent than have a

112
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,525
systemic run on all banks.

113
00:04:48,525 --> 00:04:57,960
   

114
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,190
Bank runs affect everyone.

115
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,310
So in this world that we're
dealing with right now, just

116
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,100
one weak link in the chain can
break the whole chain.

117
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,410
If you just have one
irresponsible bank, it'll

118
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,440
create a bank run on all of them
even though some of the

119
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,350
more capital rich banks could
have lent to the other ones.

120
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,090
And then finally-- and I did
this here and this is a

121
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,450
situation that we're not
familiar with today, but it's

122
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,290
a situation that's happened
many times in history.

123
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,740
It happened in the colonies
before we had our

124
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,170
independence.

125
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,300
Is that you had a bunch of
different banks each issuing

126
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,450
their own bank notes as
a form of currency.

127
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:36,660
So this one up here issues the
purple bill, this bank here

128
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,380
issues a green bill, and this
bank here issues this

129
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,660
off-white bill.

130
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,770
Besides the confusion, you're
always going to have all these

131
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,420
exchange rate differences,
et cetera, et cetera.

132
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:49,250
You don't know ahead of time--
this guy's the riskiest bank

133
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,370
so maybe his bills should be
worth a little bit less than

134
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,390
this guy up here.

135
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:56,530
But you don't have-- it really
just becomes a big mess to the

136
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,850
economy for someone in a cash
register to keep track of.

137
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,650
In this case, I only have three
banks, but imagine if

138
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,110
all 13 colonies each had their
own banks that were each

139
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,510
issuing their bank notes and
you always had to translate

140
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,230
between them.

141
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:12,250
And then one bank defaults and
their bank notes are worth

142
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,780
nothing and you have to
worry about that.

143
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,000
So you have another problem;
inconsistent currency.

144
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,120
Inconsistent paper currency.

145
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:26,840
   

146
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,920
And I think you know where
I'm going with this.

147
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,940
So what's the solution
to all of this?

148
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,590
Well, what if there were a way--
and I guess you could do

149
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,550
this without any extra
institutions.

150
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,190
You could just regulate
reserve ratios.

151
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:39,960
So that's easy to do.

152
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,830
That's just government
intervention.

153
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,000
Just say, if you want to be a
bank in our world, you have to

154
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,570
keep at least 10%
reserve ratios.

155
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,680
But we have to think about who
regulates that and who sets

156
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,100
that reserve ratio, but it's
fair enough that we need

157
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,000
someone to regulate it.

158
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,750
We don't need a separate
institution.

159
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,380
But how could we do this
mechanism where we can

160
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,370
prevent bank runs?

161
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,550
Especially when there's
money to lend from

162
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,270
one bank to the other.

163
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,380
And if we could use a mechanism
that prevents this

164
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,250
and provides a consistent
currency, then we're all set.

165
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,185
Well, the only way you can
provide a consistent currency

166
00:07:09,185 --> 00:07:12,300
is if you only had one bank
issuing currency.

167
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,970
So let's call that bank
a reserve bank.

168
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:22,860
   

169
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,640
There you go.

170
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,900
So let's say these three banks
get together-- all the banks

171
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,590
in this world get together and
say, let's start a new

172
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:33,290
institution where we all keep
our gold reserves there.

173
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,380
So what happens is, this guy,
this guy, this guy, they all

174
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,215
keep their gold reserves
at this central bank.

175
00:07:39,215 --> 00:07:54,350
   

176
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,230
And now with these guys,
instead of having gold

177
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,160
reserves here, what
do they have?

178
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,370
They have checking accounts
with the reserve bank.

179
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,620
Let me write that down.

180
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:21,890
   

181
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,800
Let me erase the top of that
balance sheet just because I

182
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,500
don't want to make
things confusing.

183
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:32,500
So that's the balance sheet that
our reserve bank now has.

184
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,270
Now what does this do?

185
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:37,049
Well, it definitely solves that
bank run problem because

186
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,440
now in this world-- and of
course we're regulating it

187
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,440
now-- and I kind of threw that
out there because this guy

188
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,530
will be the regulator.

189
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,360
This central bank will be the
regulator, but what you could

190
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,480
say now-- is if for some
reason-- let's say 11% of

191
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,490
these demand deposits come due,
11% of these people want

192
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,250
their money all of a sudden--
this guy, he just has to go to

193
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,060
his reserve bank account and he
can borrow from one of the

194
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:00,520
other players.

195
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,920
The gold is all centrally
in one place.

196
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,320
Now the notes issue-- how
do we solve that?

197
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:13,320
Well, what if by government law,
from now on only one bank

198
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,920
can issue bank notes and that's
this central bank.

199
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,470
Let's say this middle guy--
instead of having just a

200
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,520
checking account, maybe he took
half of it as a checking

201
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,500
account and half of his gold
deposits, he gets in these

202
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,960
bank notes of this
reserve bank.

203
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:34,420
So now these turn into bank
notes of the reserve bank and

204
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,050
these bank notes of the reserve
bank are the only

205
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,340
currency that's allowable.

206
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,140
So we've already solved two
problems. We've solved an

207
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:43,980
inconsistent currency.

208
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,240
And now think about what
starts to happen.

209
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,820
The reserves of these banks
no longer become gold.

210
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,130
The reserves at the banks that
people actually interact with

211
00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:01,890
now become these bank notes, the
bank notes of this central

212
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,310
reserve bank.

213
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:08,160
And this gold is just sitting in
some big vault someplace in

214
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,640
this world right now.

215
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,680
So let's just-- I know it's a
little bit disjointed-- so

216
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,860
reserve ratios.

217
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:19,840
Now you have a central banking
authority where they all

218
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,750
chipped in a little bit of
money, created this big vault,

219
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:27,180
and this central bank dictates
reserve ratios.

220
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:31,510
It prevents bank runs because if
for whatever reason-- let's

221
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,820
say on some day all of this
bank's customers get scared

222
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:38,390
and want their gold back, this
bank can just go to its

223
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:42,020
checking account and borrow gold
from the other banks and

224
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,410
it'll get transferred to it.

225
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,500
But if you think about it, in a
world where people get used

226
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:52,630
to enough of this one central
bank note, then people

227
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,420
probably won't even want
that gold back.

228
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,300
They'll probably start viewing
this one currency as the

229
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,610
equivalent of gold.

230
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,300
So when people actually want
their money back, they don't

231
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,500
even have to give gold.

232
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,050
They can just give bank notes,
but there's this one

233
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:10,860
consistent bank note now from
this central reserve bank.

234
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,870
Anyway, I think I said the word
central and reserve too

235
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,720
much, but I will see you
in the next video.

236
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,880
Hopefully it wasn't too
complicated and I think you

237
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,750
see where this is going.

238
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,110
We'll slowly extend this to
getting off the gold standard

239
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,900
and how this relates to the
Federal Reserve or central

240
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,160
banks as we know them today.

241
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,410
See you soon.

242
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:27,720
