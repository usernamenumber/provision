1
00:00:00,813 --> 00:00:03,599
Let's say that we have the number 5 and we're asked...

2
00:00:03,599 --> 00:00:08,052
what number do we need to add to the number 5 to get to 0

3
00:00:08,052 --> 00:00:10,628
and you might already know this but let's draw it out

4
00:00:10,828 --> 00:00:17,067
so let's say we have a number line over here and 0 is sitting right over there

5
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:20,533
we are already sitting here at 5

6
00:00:20,533 --> 00:00:25,067
so to go from 5 to 0 we have to go 5 spaces to the left

7
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:33,200
and if we are going 5 space to the left that means we are adding negative 5 (-5)

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:41,133
so if we add negative 5 right here than that is going to bring us back to 0

9
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:43,310
and you probably already knew this

10
00:00:43,371 --> 00:00:46,440
and this is a pretty... maybe common sense thing here

11
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,620
but there is a fancy word for it called the additive inverse property

12
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,178
and i'll just right it down, i think it's ridiculous that this is given such a fancy word for such a simple idea

13
00:00:56,275 --> 00:01:01,929
additive inverse property, and it is just the idea that if you have a number and if you add the additive

14
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:06,733
inverse of the number, which most people call the negative of the number

15
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:11,733
you add the negative of your number you will get back to 0

16
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:14,933
because they have the same size, you could view it that way,

17
00:01:14,933 --> 00:01:21,000
they both have a magnitude of 5, but this is going 5 to the right and this is going 5 to the left

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:32,052
Similarly, if you started at negative 3 (-3) if your starting over here at -3

19
00:01:32,052 --> 00:01:34,790
so you already moved 3 spaces to the left.

20
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:41,333
and someone says... "What do i have to add to -3 to get back to 0?"

21
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:43,533
well i have to move 3 spaces to the right now.

22
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:45,867
and 3 spaces to the right is in the positive direction

23
00:01:45,867 --> 00:01:48,400
so i have to add positive 3 (+3)

24
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,067
so if i add positive 3 to negative 3 i will get 0

25
00:01:52,067 --> 00:01:55,667
so in general, if i have any number...

26
00:01:55,667 --> 00:02:01,000
1 million seven hundred twenty five thousand three hundred and fourteen (1,725,314)

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,667
and i say... what do i need to add to this to get back to zero

28
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:09,933
well i have to essentially go in the opposite direction, i have to go in the leftwards direction

29
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:12,667
so i'm going to subtract the same amount.

30
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:16,933
or i can say i can add the additive inverse or add the negative version of it.

31
00:02:16,933 --> 00:02:24,133
so this is going to be the same thing as adding -1,725,314

32
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:27,600
and that will get me back to zero (0)

33
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,733
similarly, what number do i need to add to -7 to get to 0.

34
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:37,267
well if i'm already at -7 i need to add positive 7 ( 7 to the right)

35
00:02:37,267 --> 00:02:40,400
so this is going to be equal to 0

36
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,600
and this all comes form the general idea.

37
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:48,267
5+-5 : 5+ the - of 5: or 5 + the additive inverse of 5

38
00:02:48,267 --> 00:02:52,400
you can just view this, and as another way as 5 - 5

39
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,667
and if you have 5 of something then you take you take away 5

40
00:02:54,667 --> 99:59:59,999
then you learned many many years ago that, that is going to get you 0
