1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,470
   

2
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,490
We spent a good deal of time on
the idea of a null space.

3
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,720
What I'm going to do in this
video is introduce you to a

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,090
new type of space that can be
defined around a matrix, it's

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,930
called a column space.

6
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,770
And you could probably guess
what it means just based on

7
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:16,760
what it's called.

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,200
But let's say I have
some matrix A.

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,600
Let's say it's an
m by n matrix.

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,270
So I can write my matrix A and
we've seen this multiple

11
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:30,300
times, I can write it as a
collection of columns vectors.

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,430
So this first one, second one,
and I'll have n of them.

13
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,110
How do I know that
I have n of them?

14
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,330
Because I have n columns.

15
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,070
And each of these column
vectors, we're going to have

16
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,500
how many components?

17
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,650
So v1, v2, all the way to vn.

18
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,840
This matrix has m rows.

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,660
So each of these guys are going
to have m components.

20
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:56,380
So they're all members of Rm.

21
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:01,250
So the column space is defined
as all of the possible linear

22
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,860
combinations of these
columns vectors.

23
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:09,270
So the column space of A, this
is my matrix A, the column

24
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,780
space of that is all the linear
combinations of these

25
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,790
column vectors.

26
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:13,940
What's all of the linear

27
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,780
combinations of a set of vectors?

28
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,090
It's the span of
those vectors.

29
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,430
So it's the span of vector
1, vector 2, all the

30
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,360
way to vector n.

31
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,210
And we've done it before
when we first talked

32
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,240
about span and subspaces.

33
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,980
But it's pretty easy to show
that the span of any set of

34
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,980
vectors is a legitimate
subspace.

35
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,180
It definitely contains
the 0 vector.

36
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,760
If you multiply all of these
guys by 0, which is a valid

37
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,250
linear combination added up,
you'll see that it contains

38
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,430
the 0 vector.

39
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:54,780
If, let's say that I have some
vector a that is a member of

40
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,560
the column space of a.

41
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,680
That means it can be represented
as some linear

42
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,910
combination.

43
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:05,710
So a is equal to c1 times vector
1, plus c2 times vector

44
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:10,320
2, all the way to Cn
times vector n.

45
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,360
Now, the question is, is this
closed under multiplication?

46
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,200
If I multiply a times some new--
let me say I multiply it

47
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,880
times some scale or s, I'm just
picking a random letter--

48
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,090
so s times a, is this
in my span?

49
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:35,240
Well s times a would be equal
to s c1 v1 plus s c2 v2, all

50
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,900
the way to s Cn Vn Which is
once again just a linear

51
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,150
combination of these
column vectors.

52
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:47,880
So this Sa, would clearly
be a member of the

53
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,950
column space of a.

54
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,650
And then finally, to make sure
it's a valid subspace-- and

55
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,260
this actually doesn't apply just
to column space, so this

56
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,470
applies to any span.

57
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,700
This is actually a review of
what we've done the past. We

58
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,000
just have to make sure it's
closed under addition.

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,690
So let's say a is a member
of our column space.

60
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:06,510
Let's say b is also a member
of our column space, or our

61
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,950
span of all these
column vectors.

62
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:18,150
Then b could be written as b1
times v1, plus b2 times v2,

63
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,470
all the way to Bn times Vn.

64
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:29,830
And my question is, is a plus b
a member of our span, of our

65
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,150
column space, the span
of these vectors?

66
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:41,670
Well sure, what's a plus b? a
plus b is equal to c1 plus b1

67
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:50,420
times v1, plus c2 plus
v2 times v2.

68
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,310
I'm just literally adding
this term to that

69
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,610
term, to get that term.

70
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,945
This term to this term
to get this term.

71
00:03:55,945 --> 00:04:01,710
And then it goes all the way
to Bn and plus Cn times Vn.

72
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,710
Which is clearly just
another linear

73
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,110
combination of these guys.

74
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:10,530
So this guy is definitely
within the span.

75
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,870
It doesn't have to be
unique to a matrix.

76
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,200
A matrix is just really just
a way of writing a

77
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,140
set of column vectors.

78
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,029
So this applies to any span.

79
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:21,700
So this is clearly
a valid subspace.

80
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:27,800
So the column space of a is
clearly a valid subspace.

81
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,280
Let's think about other ways we
can interpret this notion

82
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,930
of a column space.

83
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:39,150
Let's think about it in terms of
the expression-- let me get

84
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:43,900
a good color-- if I were to
multiply my-- let's think

85
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,660
about this.

86
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:50,470
Let's think about the set of all
the values of if I take my

87
00:04:50,470 --> 00:05:00,790
m by n matrix a and I multiply
it by any vector x, where x is

88
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:04,550
a member of-- remember x has
to be a member of Rn.

89
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:07,350
It has to have n components in
order for this multiplication

90
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,070
to be well defined.

91
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:12,770
So x has to be a member of Rn.

92
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,260
Let's think about
what this means.

93
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:19,180
This says, look, I can take any
member, any n component

94
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,840
vector and multiply it by a,
and I care about all of the

95
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,060
possible products that this
could equal, all the possible

96
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,830
values of Ax, when I can
pick and choose any

97
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,380
possible x from Rn.

98
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,630
Let's think about
what that means.

99
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,490
   

100
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,470
If I write a like that, and if
I write x like this-- let me

101
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:45,180
write it a little bit better,
let me write x like this-- x1,

102
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,680
x2, all the way to Xn.

103
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,320
What is Ax?

104
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,680
Well Ax could be rewritten as
x1-- and we've seen this

105
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:09,640
before-- Ax is equal to x1 times
v1 plus x2 times v2, all

106
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:17,950
the way to plus Xn times Vn.

107
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,200
We've seen this multiple
times.

108
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,980
This comes out of our
definition of

109
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,190
matrix vector products.

110
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:28,350
Now if Ax is equal to this,
and I'm essentially saying

111
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,740
that I can pick any vector x in
Rn, I'm saying that I can

112
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,590
pick all possible values of the
entries here, all possible

113
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,400
real values and all possible
combinations of them.

114
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,800
So what is this equal to?

115
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,290
What is the set of
all possible?

116
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:46,420
So I could rewrite this
statement here as the set of

117
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:57,750
all possible x1 v1 plus x2 v2
all the way to Xn Vn, where

118
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:03,300
x1, x2, all the way to Xn, are
a member of the real numbers.

119
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,320
That's all I'm saying here.

120
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,910
This statement is the
equivalent of this.

121
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,590
When I say that the vector x can
be any member of Rn, I'm

122
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,840
saying that its components
can be any

123
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,340
members of the real numbers.

124
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,690
So if I just take the set of all
of the, essentially, the

125
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,320
combinations of these column
vectors where their real

126
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,570
numbers, where their
coefficients, are members of

127
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,270
the real numbers.

128
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,010
What am I doing?

129
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:28,070
This is all the possible linear
combinations of the

130
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,740
column vectors of a.

131
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:42,000
So this is equal to the span
v1 v2, all the way to Vn,

132
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,920
which is the exact same thing
as the column space of A.

133
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,930
So the column space of A, you
could say what are all of the

134
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:53,170
possible vectors, or the set of
all vectors I can create by

135
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,860
taking linear combinations of
these guys, or the span of

136
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,770
these guys.

137
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:00,300
Or you can view it as, what are
all of the possible values

138
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,580
that Ax can take on if
x is a member of Rn?

139
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,010
So let's think about
it this way.

140
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:12,830
Let's say that I were to tell
you that I need to solve the

141
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:20,340
equation Ax is equal to-- well
the convention is to write a b

142
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,590
there-- but let me
put a special b

143
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:24,560
there, let me put b1.

144
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,340
Let's say that I need to
solve this equation

145
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,000
Ax is equal to b1.

146
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,070
And then I were to tell you--
let's say that I were to

147
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:35,870
figure out the column space of
A-- and I say b1 is not a

148
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:40,710
member of the column space of
A So what does that tell me?

149
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:45,550
That tells me that this right
here can never take on the

150
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:49,940
value b1 because all of the
values that this can take on

151
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,900
is the column space of A.

152
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,000
So if b1 is not in this, it
means that this cannot take on

153
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,200
the value of b1.

154
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,710
So this would imply that this
equation we're trying to set

155
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:04,283
up, Ax is equal to b1,
has no solution.

156
00:09:04,283 --> 00:09:06,850
   

157
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:18,710
If it had a solution, so let's
say that Ax equals b2 has at

158
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,960
least one solution.

159
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:25,820
   

160
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,150
What does this mean?

161
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:31,570
Well, that means that this, for
a particular x or maybe

162
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,540
for many different x's,
you can definitely

163
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,110
achieve this value.

164
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,600
For there are some x's that when
you multiply it by a, you

165
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,660
definitely are able
to get this value.

166
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:46,020
So this implies that b2 is
definitely a member of the

167
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,480
column space of A.

168
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,000
Some of this stuff on some level
it's almost obvious.

169
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,410
This comes out of
the definition

170
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,280
of the column space.

171
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,570
The column space is all of the
linear combinations of the

172
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,740
column vectors, which another
interpretation is all of the

173
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,260
values that Ax can take on.

174
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,420
So if I try to set Ax to some
value that it can't take on,

175
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,690
clearly I'm not going to
have some solution.

176
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:12,120
If I am able to find a solution,
I am able to find

177
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,590
some x value where Ax is equal
to b2, then b2 definitely is

178
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:20,140
one of the values that
Ax can take on.

179
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,580
Anyway, I think I'll
leave you there.

180
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,830
Now that you have at least a
kind of abstract understanding

181
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,330
of what a column space is.

182
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,080
In the next couple of videos
I'm going to try to bring

183
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,060
everything together of what we
know about column spaces, and

184
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,970
null spaces, and whatever else
to kind of understand a matrix

185
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:39,280
and a matrix vector product from
every possible direction.
