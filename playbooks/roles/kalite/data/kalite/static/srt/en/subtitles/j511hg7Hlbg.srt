1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,970
   

2
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:02,930
A lot of what you'll learn in
differential equations is

3
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,640
really just different
bags of tricks.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,930
And in this video I'll show
you one of those tricks.

5
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,360
And it's useful beyond this.

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,050
Because it's always good when,
if maybe one day, you become a

7
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,129
mathematician or a physicist,
and you

8
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:17,500
have an unsolved problem.

9
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,890
Some of these tricks that solved
simpler problems back

10
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,950
in your education might be a
useful trick that solves some

11
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,730
unsolved problems. So
it's good to see it.

12
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,260
And if you're taking
differential equations, it

13
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,240
might be on an exam.

14
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:29,910
So it's good to learn.

15
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,140
So we'll learn about integrating
factors.

16
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,810
So let's say, we have an
equation that has this form.

17
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,120
Let's say this is my
differential equation.

18
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:44,610
3xy-- I'm trying to write it
neatly as possible-- plus y

19
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:58,540
squared plus x squared plus xy
times y prime is equal to 0.

20
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,950
So, especially since we've
covered this in recent videos,

21
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,700
whenever you see an equation
of this form where you have

22
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,310
some function of xy, then you
have another function of x and

23
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:11,350
y times y prime equals 0, you
said, oh, this looks like this

24
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,440
could be an exact differential
equation.

25
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,680
And how do we test that?

26
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,460
Well, we can take the partial
derivative of this with

27
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,120
respect to y, and we
could call this

28
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,990
function of x and y, M.

29
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:27,470
So the partial of that, with
respect to y, so M partial

30
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:33,760
with respect to y, would
be 3x plus 2y.

31
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,670
And if this function right here,
that expression right

32
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:41,530
there, that's our function
N, which is a

33
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,740
function of x and y.

34
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,520
We take the partial with respect
to x, and we get that

35
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,776
is equal to 2x plus y.

36
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,620
And in order for this to have
been an exact differential

37
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,440
equation, the partial of this
with respect to y would have

38
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,170
to equal the partial of this
with respect to x.

39
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,120
But we see here, just by looking
at these two, they

40
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,510
don't equal each other.

41
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,600
They're not equal.

42
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,150
So, at least superficially, the
way we looked at it just

43
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,940
now, this is not an exact
differential equation.

44
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:14,410
But what if there were some
factor, or I guess some

45
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,710
function that we could multiply
both sides of this

46
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,980
equation by, that would
make it an exact

47
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,150
differential equation?

48
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,870
So let's call that mu.

49
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,790
So what I want to do is I want
to multiply both sides of this

50
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,970
equation by some function mu,
and then see if I can solve

51
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,320
for that function mu that
would make it exact.

52
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,260
So let's try to do that.

53
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,450
So let's multiply both
sides by mu.

54
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,360
And just as a simplification,
mu could be a

55
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,560
function of x and y.

56
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,670
It could be a function of x.

57
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,560
It could be a function
of just x.

58
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,270
It could be function
of just y.

59
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,880
I'll assume it's just
a function of x.

60
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,810
You could assume it's just
a function of y and

61
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,810
try to solve it.

62
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,150
Or you could just assume it's
a function of x and y.

63
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,710
If you assume it's a function
of x and y, it becomes a lot

64
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,500
harder to solve for.

65
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,340
But that doesn't mean that
there isn't one.

66
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,530
So let's say that mu
is a function of x.

67
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,340
And I want to multiply it by
both of these equations.

68
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:16,910
So I get mu of x times 3xy plus
y squared plus mu of x

69
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:24,460
times x squared plus
xy times y prime.

70
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,750
And then, what's 0 times
any function?

71
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,990
Well, it's just going
to be 0, right?

72
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,010
0 times mu of x is just
going to be 0.

73
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:34,160
But I did multiply the right
hand side times mu of x.

74
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,720
And remember what we're doing.

75
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,220
This mu of x is-- when we
multiply it, the goal is,

76
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,640
after multiplying both sides
of the equation by it, we

77
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,210
should have an exact equation.

78
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:49,180
So now, if we consider this
whole thing our new M, the

79
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,960
partial derivative of this with
respect to y should be

80
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,070
equal to the partial derivative
of this with

81
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,570
respect to x.

82
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,550
So what's the partial derivative
of this with

83
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:01,490
respect to y?

84
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,280
Well, if we're taking the
partial with respect to y

85
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,550
here, mu of x, which is only
a function of x, it's not a

86
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,570
function of y, it's just
a constant term, right?

87
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,060
We take a partial with respect
to y. x is just a constant, or

88
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,730
a function of x can be viewed
just as a constant.

89
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,779
So the partial of this with
respect to y is going to be

90
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:31,170
equal to mu of x, you could just
say, times 3x plus 2y.

91
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,940
That's the partial of this
with respect to y.

92
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,010
And what's the partial of
this with respect to x?

93
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,110
Well, here, we'll use
the product rule.

94
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,810
So we'll take the derivative of
the first expression with

95
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,370
respect to x. mu of x is no
longer a constant anymore,

96
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,050
since we're taking the partial
with respect to x.

97
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,350
So the derivative of mu of
x with respect to x.

98
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:55,470
Well, that's just mu prime
of x, mu prime, not U.

99
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,980
mu prime of x.

100
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,975
mu is the Greek letter.

101
00:04:58,975 --> 00:05:02,560
It's for the muh sound, but
it looks a lot like a U.

102
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,450
So mu prime of x times a second
expression, x squared

103
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:12,570
plus xy, plus just the
first expression.

104
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,150
This is just the product
rule, mu of x.

105
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,410
Times the derivative of
the second expression

106
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,390
with respect to x.

107
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:26,900
So times-- ran out of space
on that line-- 2x plus y.

108
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,760
And now for this new equation,
where I multiplied

109
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,690
both sides by mu.

110
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,810
In order for this to be exact,
these two things have to be

111
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,300
equal to each other.

112
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,960
So let's just remember
the big picture.

113
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,790
We're kind of saying, this
is going to be exact.

114
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,340
And now, we're going to
try to solve for mu.

115
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,070
So let's see if we
can do that.

116
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:57,310
So let's see, on this side, we
have mu of x times 3x plus 2y.

117
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,210
And let's subtract this
expression from both sides.

118
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:07,050
So it's minus mu of
x times 2x plus y.

119
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,850
You'll see a lot of these
differential equation problems

120
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:09,470
that get kind of hairy.

121
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,100
They're really just
a lot of algebra.

122
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,350
And that equals-- what
do we have left?

123
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,780
I'll write it in yellow.

124
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,270
That equals-- I'm going
to run out of space.

125
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,700
I'm going to do it a
little bit lower.

126
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,670
That equals, just this
term right here.

127
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:29,830
That equals mu prime of x
times x squared plus xy.

128
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:35,020
And let's see, if we factor out
a mu of x here, we get mu

129
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:46,860
of x times 3x plus 2y minus 2x
minus y is equal to mu prime

130
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,780
of x, the derivative of mu with
respect to x, times x

131
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,085
squared plus xy.

132
00:06:52,085 --> 00:06:55,160
   

133
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,200
Now, we can simplify this.

134
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:05,520
So we get mu of x times-- what
is this-- 3x minus 2x is x.

135
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,840
2y minus y, so x plus y, is
equal to-- and I'm just going

136
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,130
to simplify this side a
little bit-- is equal

137
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,960
to mu prime of x.

138
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,950
Let's factor out an x here.

139
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,260
And the reason why I'm doing
that is because it seems like

140
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,630
if I factor out an x here,
I'll get an x plus y.

141
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:29,180
So this is mu prime of x
times x times x plus y.

142
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,710
x times x plus y is
x squared plus xy.

143
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,160
So that's why I did it, and I
have this x plus y on both

144
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,540
sides equation, which I will
now divide both sides by.

145
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,560
So if you divide both sides by
x plus y, we could maybe

146
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,240
assume that it's not 0.

147
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,850
That simplifies things
pretty dramatically.

148
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:54,710
We get mu of x is equal to
mu prime of x times x.

149
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,460
   

150
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,730
And now, just the way my brain
works, I like to rewrite this

151
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:05,440
expression just in our operator
form, where instead

152
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,930
of writing it mu prime
of x, we could write

153
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,660
that as d mu dx.

154
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,790
So let's do that.

155
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:17,420
So we could write mu of x is
equal to d, the derivative of

156
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:22,250
mu with respect to x, times x.

157
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,970
And this is actually a separable
differential

158
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,520
equation in and of itself.

159
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,320
It's kind of a sub-differential
equation to

160
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,290
solve our broader one.

161
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,840
We're just trying to figure
out the integrating factor

162
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,720
right here.

163
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,039
So let's divide both
sides by x.

164
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:41,600
So we get mu over x, this is
just a separable equation now,

165
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:46,010
is equal to d mu dx.

166
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,790
And then, let's divide both
sides by mu of x, and we get 1

167
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:57,220
over x is equal to 1 over mu.

168
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,490
That's mu of x, I'll just write
1 over mu right now, for

169
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:03,810
simplicity, times d mu dx.

170
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,080
I'm actually going to go
horizontal right here.

171
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:12,150
Multiply both sides by dx, you
get 1 over x dx is equal to 1

172
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,170
over mu of x d mu.

173
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:18,670
Now, you could integrate both
sides of this, and you'll get

174
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,890
the natural log of the absolute
value of x is equal

175
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,830
to the natural log of the
absolute value of mu, et

176
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,250
cetera, et cetera.

177
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,660
But it should be pretty clear
from this that x is equal to

178
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,070
mu, or mu is equal
to x, right?

179
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:29,930
They're identical.

180
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:32,400
If you look at both sides of
this equation there, you can

181
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,160
just change x for mu, and it
becomes the other side.

182
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,560
So, this is obviously telling us
that mu of x is equal to x.

183
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,650
Or mu is equal to x.

184
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,590
So we have our integrating
factor.

185
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,470
And if you want, you can take
the antiderivative of both

186
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,310
sides with the natural logs,
and all of that.

187
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,870
And you'll get the
same answer.

188
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:55,270
But this is just, by looking at
it, by inspection, you know

189
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,420
that mu is equal to x.

190
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,500
Because both sides of
this equation are

191
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,180
completely the same.

192
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,810
Anyway, we now have our
integrating factor.

193
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,300
But I am running out of time.

194
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,230
So in the next video, we're
now going to use this

195
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,010
integrating factor.

196
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,650
Multiply it times our original
differential equation.

197
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,690
Make it exact.

198
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,110
And then solve it as
an exact equation.

199
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,540
I'll see you in the
next video.

200
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:15,900
