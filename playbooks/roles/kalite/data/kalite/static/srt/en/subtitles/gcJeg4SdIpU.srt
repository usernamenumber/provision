1
00:00:01,562 --> 00:00:06,015
We the last video we took the Mclaurin series of

2
00:00:06,805 --> 00:00:07,840
representation of e to the x.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,650
Now let's do it with a couple
of other functions and we'll

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,880
see in a few videos it all fits
together like a giant puzzle.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,720
Let's do cosine of x.

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:25,690
Let's set f of x, f of x
is equal to cosine of x.

7
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,000
What's f prime of x?

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,290
What's the first derivative
of cosine of x?

9
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:34,230
Well that just equals
minus sine of x.

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,550
Minus sine of x.

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,300
What's the second derivative?

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,410
Well that's just minus times
derivative of sine of x.

13
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,170
So the derivative of sine
of x is cosine x, it's

14
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,590
minus cosine of x.

15
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,980
And what's the
third derivative?

16
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,150
f 3 of x.

17
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,500
The derivative of cosine x is
minus sine of x, we already

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,585
have a minus here so it
becomes positive sine of x.

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,980
What's f 4 of x?

20
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,140
The fourth derivative of x?

21
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,430
It equals cosine of x again.

22
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,110
As we keep taking derivatives
we'll keep repeating and the

23
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,540
pattern will go on, right?

24
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:21,460
The fifth derivative of x, the
fifth derivative of this

25
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,990
function, the fourth is the
same as a function, so the

26
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,010
fifth is going to be the same
as the first derivative.

27
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,480
cosine of x is minus sine of x.

28
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,230
Hopefully you see the pattern.

29
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,950
We're going to do the Macloren
representation, which is a

30
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,600
specific example of the Taylor
series where we figure out the

31
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,100
values of the derivatives
at x is equal to zero.

32
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,990
So let's do that right now.

33
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,080
So f of zero, let me do
it in to another color

34
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,210
to fend off monotony.

35
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,060
f of zero.

36
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,720
What's cosine of zero?

37
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,410
Cosine of zero is 1.

38
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:58,240
f prime of zero is equal to
sine of-- well not minus sine

39
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,780
of zero, but what sine of zero?

40
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,230
Sine of zero is zero,
so minus zero is still

41
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,850
zero, so this is zero.

42
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,970
f prime prime of zero.

43
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,630
Cosine of zero we
already know is one.

44
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,310
We have a negative sine here,
so it becomes a minus one.

45
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,440
The third derivative at
x is equal to zero.

46
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,306
Sine of zero is zero.

47
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:19,720
So this is zero.

48
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,490
I think you might start to
see a pattern emerging.

49
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,470
The fourth derivative at zero.

50
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,840
Cosine of zero is equal to 1.

51
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,390
And then the fifth derivative,
this is hard to read but you

52
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:36,170
get the point is
just zero again.

53
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,930
So what's the pattern as
we take the derivatives?

54
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,710
1, zero, minus 1,
zero, 1, zero.

55
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,550
So it alternates
between zero and 1.

56
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,950
So 1, zero, minus 1, zero,
positive, zero, negative,

57
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,340
zero, positive.

58
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,840
So every other number is zero
and in between them we

59
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,010
alternate between a positive
1 and a negative 1.

60
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,500
So now let's use that
information to figure

61
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,110
The Maclaurin series representation

62
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,720
out them the Macloren
series representation.

63
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,160
So we proved, hopefully, we
didn't prove it definitely

64
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,370
converges over the entire
domain of the function.

65
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,740
You have to take
my word for it.

66
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,840
We'll experiment a little bit
with a graphing calculator

67
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,260
in a few videos.

68
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,870
We said that this
representation-- and it should

69
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,690
make intuitive sense, because
when you take the infinite

70
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,720
Maclaurin series, when you take
that infinite sum, you're

71
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,510
essentially creating a function
where that function is equal to

72
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,240
your original function at
the point you chose.

73
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,200
In the case of a Maclaurin we're
picking x equals zero, and it

74
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,270
equals every derivative
of this function.

75
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,090
Just intuitively it seems, well
if a function equals something

76
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,490
at a point and every one of its
derivatives is also equal to

77
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,070
the function at that point,
maybe those functions are

78
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,530
equal to each other.

79
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,150
I haven't proven
that to you yet.

80
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,800
We know that the representation
is a sum from n is equal to

81
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:04,330
zero to infinity of the nth
derivative evaluated at zero.

82
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,790
A Macloren series is a specific
case of a Taylor series.

83
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,760
We actually haven't done
anything with Taylor series, I

84
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,380
was hoping to get there later.

85
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,980
But the Macloren series is a
really cool one because it's

86
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,770
going to show us all these
relationships between e and

87
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:18,990
cosine and sine and eventually
i and pi and you will

88
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,120
find it exciting.

89
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:26,390
The Macloren is that times x
to the n over n factorial.

90
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,630
That's what we said it was.

91
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,250
So if this is our f of x, f
of x is cosine of x, what

92
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,360
does this turn into?

93
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:45,256
Well, f of x is equal to, it
equals f of zero times x to

94
00:04:45,256 --> 00:04:48,610
the zero over zero factorial,
that's just one, right?

95
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,510
Plus, now we're at n equals 1.

96
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,010
It's the first
derivative at zero.

97
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,740
f prime of zero, well
that's just equal to zero.

98
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,350
And who cares what that--
that would be x to the

99
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,230
first over 1, right?

100
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,480
Now we're at the
second derivative.

101
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,970
The second derivative
at zero is minus 1.

102
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:14,570
Minus 1 times x squared
over 2 factorial plus the

103
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,450
third derivative at zero.

104
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:20,340
The third derivative at zero
we figured out was zero.

105
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,590
Zero who cares what that is.

106
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:26,890
It would have been x to the
third over 3 factorial.

107
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:29,800
And then what's the
fourth derivative?

108
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:35,430
The fourth derivative at
zero is just equal to 1.

109
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,200
So we have times 1 and then
we're at x to the fourth

110
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,570
over 4 factorial.

111
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,460
Let me see if I can write
this a little bit neater.

112
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,370
The next one, the fifth
derivative at zero times x to

113
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,230
the fifth over 5 factorial.

114
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,230
We'll keep going.

115
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,980
Let me write this, clean this
up and hopefully the pattern

116
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,530
merges if it hasn't
emerged already.

117
00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:00,740
f of x is equal to cosine of x
is equal to-- let met get rid

118
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:06,850
of the zeros-- 1 and then we
have minus x squared

119
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:11,350
over 2 factorial.

120
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,860
This term, this goes away.

121
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,800
This is a zero term.

122
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,680
And the next one is a positive.

123
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,330
Plus x to the fourth
over 4 factorial.

124
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,620
And the fifth term goes away.

125
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,600
But then the cycle continues.

126
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,160
The next one is
going to be minus.

127
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,000
Because we had minus 1 plus 1.

128
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,380
It's going to be minus x to
the sixth over 6 factorial.

129
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,420
You could take the
sixth derivative.

130
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,070
You'll see that the derivative
of minus sine of x is minus

131
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,880
cosine of x, that's where
we get the minus 1 from.

132
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,500
And they we're
going to go plus.

133
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,160
So we're just taking all the
even terms. x to the eighth

134
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:53,460
over 8 factorial minus x to
the 10th over 10 factorial.

135
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:57,360
We could just keep going
on and on and on.

136
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,265
And so we have a situation
where we can rewrite cosine of

137
00:07:02,265 --> 00:07:10,260
x is equal to the sum, if you
believe that this Macloren

138
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:14,200
series actually does converge
to cosine of x over the entire

139
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,940
domain of x, that's kind of
an assumption we're making.

140
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,790
Hopefully one day we will have
the tools set to actually

141
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,130
prove that as well.

142
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,300
From n is equal to zero.

143
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,070
So what's happening?

144
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:29,600
We're taking all of
the even powers.

145
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:38,160
So we could say x to the 2n,
that ensures that no matter

146
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,160
what value of n I put in
here I get an even numbers.

147
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,620
So we'll go to the zeroth
power then the second

148
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,810
power, over 2n factorial.

149
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,360
So that takes care of going
from 1 to x squared over 2,

150
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,580
to x to the fourth over
4 factorial, 6 over 6

151
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,490
factorial, et cetera.

152
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,830
But now we have to make it
switched signs like that.

153
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,420
Well let's just multiply
it negative 1.

154
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,160
Let's see what we can do.

155
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:07,160
Negative 1 to the-- so we want
the first term to be positive,

156
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,390
the second term to be negative.

157
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:15,300
So we could say times
minus 1 to the n plus 1.

158
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,060
Let's see if that works.

159
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:25,760
When m is zero what's
negative 1 to the n plus 1?

160
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,860
zero, it would be minus 1.

161
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:39,870
And then when it's 1-- When
it's zero-- no, no it's just

162
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,890
going to be negative
1 to the n.

163
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:46,520
Because when it's zero,
negative 1 to zero is 1.

164
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,555
When it's 1, negative 1.

165
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,350
So this will work out.

166
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,680
So it's negative 1 to the n

167
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,620
You could try it out.

168
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,210
This is the n is equal to zero.

169
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,890
We need to switch colors.

170
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:04,310
That's n is equal to zero and
here we get x to the zero over

171
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,850
zero factorial, which is 1.

172
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:10,100
We have negative 1 to the zero
is 1, so that becomes 1.

173
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,510
When n is equal to 1, this
becomes x squared over 2

174
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,920
factorial, we have negative 1
to the 1 power, so that's

175
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,270
where you get the negative 1.

176
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:22,850
And then when n is equal to
2, the negative 1 squared

177
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:23,830
becomes positive again.

178
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,220
So the negative 1 is
what provides the

179
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,160
alternating numbers.

180
00:09:28,316 --> 00:09:29,702
So pretty neat.

181
00:09:29,889 --> 00:09:31,534
We just figured out

182
00:09:31,611 --> 00:09:33,741
another way to represent cosine of x

183
00:09:33,911 --> 00:09:38,411
And it might be looking a little bit intresting to you

184
00:09:38,626 --> 00:09:43,490
that this representation kind
of resembles part of the

185
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,420
representation of e to the x.

186
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,690
What's the difference between
this and the e to the x? e to

187
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:50,270
the x had the odd exponent
terms and it didn't

188
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:50,990
switch signs.

189
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,610
But other than that, they're
pretty much the same.

190
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,750
So in the next video we'll
do sine of x and then we'll

191
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,745
try to put it all together.

192
00:09:56,745 --> 00:09:58,600
I'll see you soon.
