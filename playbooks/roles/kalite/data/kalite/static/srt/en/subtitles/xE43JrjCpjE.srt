1
00:00:00,754 --> 00:00:07,125
In the last video company A took out a $1mn loan from lender 1 at a variable interest rate

2
00:00:07,125 --> 00:00:12,521
and company B took out a fixed rate $1mn loan from lender 2.

3
00:00:12,521 --> 00:00:19,618
and then they entered into this swap agreement where company A pays a fixed 7% every period.

4
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:26,146
7% on a notional 1mn. Notional meaning that the 1mn doesn't exchange hands, only the interest does.

5
00:00:26,146 --> 00:00:29,938
A pays the 7% on the notional 1mn every period to B.

6
00:00:29,954 --> 00:00:34,515
B pays LIBOR + 1% on that notional 1mn every period to A.

7
00:00:34,592 --> 00:00:37,825
So pays a variable rate on that notional amount.

8
00:00:38,254 --> 00:00:43,310
What I am going to do in this video is go through the numerical mechanics to show that in effect,

9
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:48,633
Company A now has a fixed rate loan when you think of it from the point of view the interest it is paying

10
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:50,695
and company B now has a variable rate loan.

11
00:00:51,002 --> 00:00:54,692
They have kind of swapped the fixed and variable natures of their loans.

12
00:00:54,952 --> 00:00:58,059
So lets think about what happens with company A in period 1.

13
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:04,925
In period 1: So in the old period 1 it had to pay $70,000 of interest to the lender.

14
00:01:05,695 --> 00:01:21,804
So it had to pay in period 1, comapny A had to pay $70,000 to lender 1 but now thats not all it has to do.

15
00:01:22,096 --> 00:01:24,833
Definitely it still has to do that. This loan is still in effect.

16
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:31,054
But now it also has to pay 7, has to pay 7% fixed to B on that notional 1mn

17
00:01:31,115 --> 00:01:41,833
so it also has to pay $70,000(7% on a mn) to company B,

18
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:46,300
But in exchange for that, it's going to get LIBOR +1% from B.

19
00:01:46,331 --> 00:01:53,033
So its going to get LIBOR (we are assuming it is 5% in period1).

20
00:01:53,033 --> 00:01:58,029
5% + 1% = 6%, 6% on a notional $1mn is $60,000.

21
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:09,571
$60k from B. So net net it pays 70, it pays 70 twice but then it gets back 60.

22
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:17,054
So its paying $80,000. So the net is paying $80,000.

23
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:20,485
Now think about what happens in period 2 when LIBOR changes.

24
00:02:20,485 --> 00:02:26,085
So in period 2, now LIBOR changes to 4%

25
00:02:26,085 --> 00:02:33,552
and so A will have to pay 4% + the 2% on its loan which is 6% or $60,000.

26
00:02:33,552 --> 00:02:37,254
A will have to pay $60,000 to its lender.

27
00:02:37,254 --> 00:02:48,685
It would have to pay B the 70,000 still, it would pay to B 70,000

28
00:02:48,685 --> 00:02:58,823
but in exchange it would get LIBOR + 1% from B. LIBOR is 4%.

29
00:02:58,823 --> 00:03:01,254
4% + 1% is 5%.

30
00:03:01,254 --> 00:03:07,018
It would get $50,000. So it would get 50,000 in that period from B.

31
00:03:07,018 --> 00:03:13,536
So whats the total amount that it pays. It pays 60 +70 = 130,000.

32
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,285
But then it gets back 50,000 from the swap agreement.

33
00:03:16,285 --> 00:03:24,321
So it pays $80,000. Notice that it doesn't change from any period..

34
00:03:24,321 --> 00:03:31,018
I encourage you to try out changing the actual LIBOR rate and you see it doesn't change the amount that A pays.

35
00:03:31,018 --> 00:03:33,618
A is now in effect paying a fixed rate.

36
00:03:33,618 --> 00:03:36,018
Now the opposite is going to happen with B.

37
00:03:36,018 --> 00:03:39,048
In the old one, every period it pays $80,000.

38
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:41,285
But now its going to be a little bit different.

39
00:03:41,285 --> 00:03:47,705
In period 1, it still pays $80,000 so that we can write that in every period

40
00:03:47,721 --> 00:03:55,941
In period 2, it still pays $80,000 and then its going to get 7% every period from company A

41
00:03:55,941 --> 00:04:06,562
So it would get $70,000 but its going to be paying LIBOR + 1%

42
00:04:06,777 --> 00:04:15,695
So in Period 1, its going to pay $60,000.

43
00:04:15,818 --> 00:04:21,090
And then in period 2, its going to pay $50,000.

44
00:04:21,152 --> 00:04:27,571
So net you pay 50, you get 70 so thats a part of, you are still paying 10 and you pay another 60

45
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:31,896
So net is your going to pay 70k in period 1

46
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:37,455
and then in period 2, you're going to pay 60k

47
00:04:37,455 --> 00:04:41,367
So now Comapny A is paying a fixed 8% every period.

48
00:04:41,367 --> 99:59:59,999
and company B is going to pay essentially a variable rate.
