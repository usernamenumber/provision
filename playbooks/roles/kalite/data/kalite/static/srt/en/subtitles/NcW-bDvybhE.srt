00:00:04,965 --> 00:00:06,348
In the last video we saw ways to determine the

2
00:00:06,348 --> 00:00:07,502
acidity of molecules look at the stability of the conjugate base.

3
00:00:07,502 --> 00:00:09,702
The more stable the conjugate base the more acidic the molecule.

4
00:00:09,702 --> 00:00:12,567
In the last video we talked about electronegativity stabilizing

5
00:00:12,567 --> 00:00:16,879
the conjugate base in this video we are also going to look at electronegativity

6
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:24,340
but we are going to focus on resonance structures.

7
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:24,734
and resonance structures will allow the stabilization of conjugate base.

8
00:00:24,734 --> 00:00:29,567
So we start with propane here and we think PKA of this proton is approximately

9
00:00:29,567 --> 00:00:33,548
50.So propane is not very acidic at all.

10
00:00:33,548 --> 00:00:36,233
but if I think about propane donating a proton

11
00:00:36,233 --> 00:00:40,169
then these electrons will left behind in that carbon.So I can go ahead and draw

12
00:00:40,169 --> 00:00:45,634
these conjugate base to propane .So i go ahead and put in my hydrogens

13
00:00:45,634 --> 00:00:49,951
so this carbon on the left hand has 3 hydrogens this carbon has 2

14
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:54,500
the carbon on right has donated one of the proton so there is lone pair of electrons

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:00,285
left behind on that carbon.Which gives that carbon -1 formal charge.so we have a carb anion.

16
00:01:00,285 --> 00:01:05,364
So in this carb anion charge is localized to this carbon atom

17
00:01:05,364 --> 00:01:10,365
and since carbon is not very electronegative it doesn't stabilize the negative charge very well.

18
00:01:10,365 --> 00:01:13,570
so that's t one reason why this is an unstable conjugate base.

19
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,395
Another reason is you cant draw a resonance structures for this conjugate base.

20
00:01:17,395 --> 00:01:21,647
you cant spread out that negative charge throughout the molecule to delocalized those electrons

21
00:01:21,647 --> 00:01:25,233
and stabilize the conjugate base.ans so for both those reasons we have

22
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:28,646
unstable conjugate base and since we have an unstable conjugat ebase

23
00:01:28,646 --> 00:01:34,035
that's the reason why propane is not very acidic and has such a extremely high value for its PKA.

24
00:01:34,035 --> 00:01:40,404
lets compare propane with this next molecule here is propene.so we are looking at

25
00:01:40,404 --> 00:01:52,233
this proton has PKA approximately 43.so this propeneis more acidic than propane.and we can explain by looking at conjugate base.

26
00:01:52,233 --> 00:01:57,312
so if I think about propene donating that proton these two electrons will remain behind on the carbon.

27
00:01:57,312 --> 00:02:03,941
so I can go ahead and draw the conjugate base so the carbon on left still has two hydrogen.

28
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:09,320
top carbon has one and carbon on right now has 2 hydrogens.

29
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:14,767
Lone pair of electrons on this carbon so that's our carb anion.So once again we

30
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:20,743
have a negative charge on an atom that isn't very electronegative and so that's a fact that

31
00:02:20,743 --> 00:02:23,879
will lead you to believe this is not a very stable conjugate base.

32
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:28,339
however there you can draw a resonance structure for this conjugate base.

33
00:02:28,339 --> 00:02:33,835
So we go ahead and put this resonance arrow here and I can think about these

34
00:02:33,835 --> 00:02:37,557
electrons moving in here to form a pi bond between these two carbons

35
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:40,737
which will kick these electrons of onto this carbon so lets go ahead and draw the

36
00:02:40,737 --> 00:02:46,403
resonance structure that will results .So now we have a double bond between those two

37
00:02:46,403 --> 00:02:51,197
carbons and carbon left still has two hydrogens.

38
00:02:51,197 --> 00:02:54,816
Carbon in the center has 1 and the carbon on the right still has 2 like that.

39
00:02:54,816 --> 00:03:01,834
Now you would have lone pair of electron on this carbon which will give it a -1 formal charge.

40
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:05,607
and so this would be the resonance structure that you can draw.

41
00:03:05,607 --> 00:03:14,167
So lets go ahead and follow these electrons so the electrons in the those are the once that moved in here

42
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:17,502
to form a pi bond and then we can look at these pi electrons like these blue

43
00:03:17,502 --> 00:03:20,167
these came of onto this carbon like that.

44
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:29,031
So we have delocalized electrons and remember the actual conjugate base would be

45
00:03:29,031 --> 00:03:31,675
hybrid of these resonance structure.

46
00:03:31,675 --> 00:03:33,502
but your negative charge is spread out.

47
00:03:33,502 --> 00:03:39,062
its not localized to one carbon its spread out and delocalized throughout your molecule

48
00:03:39,062 --> 00:03:43,228
and that will stabilize the negative charge and that will make the conjugate base

49
00:03:43,228 --> 00:03:50,219
more stable.since the conjugate base is more stable thats the reason why propene is more acidic that propane.

50
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:57,025
lets go ahead and compare propene to ethanol.here we have ethanol and we have

51
00:03:57,025 --> 00:04:04,942
seen this in two videos and this is the acidic proton on ethanol tha PKA value is approximatel 16

52
00:04:04,942 --> 00:04:10,095
for that proton and so we think about ethanol donating a proton so these electrons will left behind

53
00:04:10,095 --> 00:04:13,992
on the oxygen so we can go ahead and draw in the conjugate base.

54
00:04:13,992 --> 00:04:19,700
so this carbon still has three hydrogens ,this carbon has 2 hydrogens

55
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,900
and for the oxygen on the right its goona have three lone pair of electrons.

56
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:30,144
which gives it a -1 formal charge.and now we can actually draw a resonance structure

57
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:35,151
for this conjugate base.so that negative charge is localized to the oxygen atom.

58
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:40,824
but we know that oxygen is relatively electronegative atom so that oxygen is better

59
00:04:40,824 --> 00:04:44,965
able to pair that negative charge than the carbon was in the previous example.

60
00:04:44,965 --> 00:04:51,436
so that makes a conjugate base stable and so by comparing these PKA values we can see

61
00:04:51,436 --> 00:04:58,904
that ethanol is more acidic than propene.so even though propene we can draw resonance structures for it

62
00:04:58,904 --> 00:05:04,420
and for ethanol you can't it turns out that the charge that has negative

63
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,021
atom is more important factor than resonance.so the fact that this negative charge

64
00:05:09,021 --> 00:05:15,548
on this oxygen is which is an electronegative atom that turns out to be more important

65
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:21,242
than the idea of resonance.so electronegativity is more important than resonance.

66
00:05:21,242 --> 00:05:40,163
so lets compare ethanol to acetic acid.so here we have acetic acid.the acidic proton on the acetic acid is 1.PKA value is approximately 4.75.

67
00:05:40,163 --> 00:05:52,136
and lets think about the conjugate base .so acedic acid donates that proton right and these electrons left on that oxygen so we can draw the conjugate base to acidic

68
00:05:52,136 --> 00:05:53,107
acid so this carbon would still have 3 hydrogens ,

69
00:05:53,107 --> 00:05:56,552
right this top oxygen has 2 lone pair of electrons and oxygen here in right would have 3 lone pair of

70
00:05:56,552 --> 00:05:59,229
electrons which gives it a -1 formal charge

71
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:03,696
and so this is the acetate anion the conjugate base to acedic acid

72
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:09,228
and so once again we have a negative charge on electronegative atom which stabilize this conjugate base.

73
00:06:09,228 --> 00:06:14,562
but this acidic acid is more acidic than ethanol so there must be something else stabilize

74
00:06:14,562 --> 00:06:18,963
the conjugate base .and that something else is of course resonance structure.

75
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:24,805
so we can go ahead and put in resonance pair here and we could show these electrons moving

76
00:06:24,805 --> 00:06:28,628
in here to form a pi bond .which kick these electrons of onto the oxygen.

77
00:06:28,628 --> 00:06:31,853
so we can go ahead and draw the resonance structures.

78
00:06:31,853 --> 00:06:35,696
so the carbon in left still has 3 hydrogens.

79
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:40,696
carbon in the middle here used to have two bonds of oxygen now it has only one

80
00:06:40,696 --> 00:06:46,295
so this top oxygen picked up another lone pair of electrons like that. so

81
00:06:46,295 --> 00:06:49,849
this double bond between this carbon and this oxygen now like that.

82
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:53,828
so this is your structure the -1 formal charge is now on this

83
00:06:53,828 --> 00:07:01,897
oxygen and once again the actual structure of the conjugate base is a hybrid of

84
00:07:01,897 --> 00:07:05,766
these resonance structures.but this time you have the

85
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:09,094
negative charge delocalized which spread out stabilizes the conjugate base.

86
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:15,629
but delocalized over two oxygens in this case and so that makes the conjugate base

87
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:18,094
even more stable than the ethaxoide.

88
00:07:18,094 --> 00:07:23,288
so if i think about the hybrid for this conjugate base having the negative charge

89
00:07:23,288 --> 00:07:29,429
delocalized and over 2 oxygen. this example we have negative charge on one oxygen

90
00:07:29,429 --> 00:07:38,495
so the fact that we can delocalized that negative charge on to negative atms make the acetate ion more stable

91
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:41,895
than tha ethoxide anion.

92
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:45,812
and since the acetate anion is more stable than the ethoxide anion that makes the acidic acidmore acidic than

93
00:07:45,812 --> 00:07:48,362
ethanol.

94
00:07:48,362 --> 00:07:49,829
so when you are

95
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:52,089
trying to think about acidity of molecule

96
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:55,564
not only you have to think about the electronegativity of atom

97
00:07:55,564 --> 00:07:57,943
you have to think about possible responance structures.

98
00:07:57,943 --> 00:08:02,296
more resonance structures you can draw the more stable the conjugate base.
