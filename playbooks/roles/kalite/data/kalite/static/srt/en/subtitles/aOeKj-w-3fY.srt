00:00:04,886 --> 00:00:11,437
The Cage Paintings Were First Exhibited At The Venice Bienale 2007.

00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:17,807
Robert Storr Explores The Connections

3
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:22,986
In Aysus 2005, to my considerable surprise,

4
00:00:22,986 --> 00:00:25,537
I was asked to be the director of the Venice Bienale.

5
00:00:25,537 --> 00:00:27,553
I was surprised because a native-born American

6
00:00:27,553 --> 00:00:29,186
has never been asked before.

7
00:00:29,186 --> 00:00:32,102
I tried to think about what kinds of exhibitions

8
00:00:32,102 --> 00:00:34,920
should be made around the Bienale;

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,536
what kind of exhibition I should make,

10
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,352
and in the mix of that, thought about,

11
00:00:38,352 --> 00:00:42,037
"well I'm the first American to do this".

12
00:00:42,037 --> 00:00:43,636
"There will be a lot of thoughts about

13
00:00:43,636 --> 00:00:45,536
American-ness of whatever I do".

14
00:00:45,636 --> 00:00:49,302
And if I were to pick an American artist that I was proud of

15
00:00:49,302 --> 00:00:51,319
and that I thought represented positive things,

16
00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:52,869
Who would that artist be?

17
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:54,769
Not a single person to represent everybody because that's impossible,

18
00:00:55,754 --> 00:00:56,956
But somebody who'd get touched on.

19
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:05,702
Although there's no arguing that as a painter Pollock had profound influence, and also beyond painting,

20
00:01:05,845 --> 00:01:12,545
he was the father of installion art and performance in some ways too. Or, that Andy Warhol has profound influence.

21
00:01:12,545 --> 00:01:17,020
The person who seemed to me to had, really, the most (influence) was John Cage.

22
00:01:23,559 --> 00:01:25,905
Cage was a cosmopolitan man.

23
00:01:25,905 --> 00:01:31,328
He worked in multiple mediums and he had attitudes that influnced art in every domain.

24
00:01:31,328 --> 00:01:37,478
Cage was the artist Richter first encountered in the early 1960's while a student at Dresden Art Academy.

25
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:43,405
In the context of a Fluxus Festival that was convened more or less by Joseph Beuys.

26
00:01:43,405 --> 00:01:50,610
Far and away the most compelling of anybody was Cage, who if I recall, performed a piece where he wrote,

27
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:57,646
With the mic attached to the pen so the sound of the pen moving on the surface of the paper was what you heard.

28
00:02:01,661 --> 00:02:10,660
Cage, it seems to me was a reference for Richter on a kind of avant-garde practice that he himself didn't follow,

29
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,511
but that he respected and that he could learn from.

30
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:20,493
Some years later, a friend of Gerhard's, who was also a friend of John's, took John to see an exhibition of Gerhard's work,

31
00:02:20,493 --> 00:02:27,544
and what was on display included on of the very large grey paints that looked like they were finger-painted, almost,

32
00:02:27,544 --> 00:02:30,744
with lots of non-directional lines and squiggles and so on,

33
00:02:30,744 --> 00:02:36,994
And took a wonderful picture of John standing with his sort of beatific smile, in front of one of Richter's paintings.

34
00:02:36,994 --> 00:02:44,327
So, although Richter and Cage didn't ever meet, in a sense Richter saw him on stage but never encountered him.

35
00:02:44,327 --> 00:02:47,678
Cage encountered Richter's work but never met him.

36
00:02:47,678 --> 00:02:52,505
Although they never met, there was this kind of charge, this current, going back and forth.

37
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:03,239
Something else that's been said which is, I did not know until just recently, was that he was also thinking when painting,

38
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:08,860
about the Israeli bombardment of Berut during the most recent wars between Israel and Lebanon.

39
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:15,660
And that puts the whole different cast on what those pictures might be. When I wrote the book, I used analogies,

40
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,161
that were essentially landscape analogies for describing,

41
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:24,701
But that wasn't because I think in any way these were landscape pictures. It's because that natural environment

42
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:32,178
is the only source that quirked me then anyway, that would provide the metaphors to describe particular textures

43
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:37,292
and particular colors and particular ways in which the surfaces of those paintings move.

44
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:46,493
But if you them all together, there is in the background, of a lot of his abstractions, a response to nature,

45
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:53,592
But not the desire to represent it in any romantic or naturalist way. If there is in the back of his thinking,

46
00:03:53,592 --> 00:03:58,144
a response to Cage, and to the idea of composition which

47
00:03:58,144 --> 00:04:02,528
comes about without normal kinds of intentionality, and that

48
00:04:02,528 --> 00:04:06,328
we're specks, accident chances of the things that happened

49
00:04:06,328 --> 00:04:09,211
in the process of doing something, such that in making

50
00:04:09,211 --> 00:04:11,711
these paintings, Richter paints and paints and paints,

51
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:13,666
and then chooses to stop.

52
00:04:15,712 --> 00:04:18,810
And if the background, the harshness of some of paintings

53
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,994
the surfaces that are scored intensively with color,

54
00:04:22,994 --> 00:04:26,610
also suggest violence, at some level. And that violence

55
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,840
correlating to the news of the fighting in Lebanon, if all of

56
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,978
those things sort of come together, then I think you have a

57
00:04:33,978 --> 00:04:39,528
relatively good idea, if you will, of how an artist of Richter's

58
00:04:39,528 --> 00:04:44,044
caliber, is never 'influenced' by anything, but feeds on

59
00:04:44,044 --> 00:04:47,045
everything, uses everything.

60
00:04:47,045 --> 00:04:51,027
A friend of mine once said, "a genius is somebody who,

61
00:04:51,027 --> 00:04:53,144
rather like, a really good engine, burns clean."

62
00:04:53,144 --> 00:04:58,277
There's no residue. And in Richter's case, this is actually

63
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:01,893
true, he uses everything, and there is no residue.

64
00:05:01,893 --> 00:05:07,160
And in this case, 'no residue' means there is ultimately no

65
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:12,794
'single reference'. There is no single thing that ties the

66
00:05:12,794 --> 00:05:15,478
immediacy of the painting back to something that is not as

67
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:17,285
immediate as the painting.

68
00:05:17,285 --> 00:05:23,860
So it may help to think about these points of reference, but this painting is not about them. Never was.

69
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,878
And, where the painting will take you, is not confined to

70
00:05:27,878 --> 00:05:30,578
those references either, because the kinds of thoughts that

71
00:05:30,578 --> 00:05:33,527
occur, the kinds of phenomenological experiences that

72
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:37,160
occur, and the subject matters, the moods, the tensions,

73
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,643
are way beyond any particular subject matter.

74
00:05:40,643 --> 00:05:43,744
If you think about it, Richter's a very methodical painter.

75
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:47,711
And he's developed his method gradually but he's very

76
00:05:47,711 --> 00:05:52,144
consistent in his application of it, a lot like Sol LeWitt.

77
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:55,427
He's consistent in his application precisely to create patterns

78
00:05:55,427 --> 00:05:59,671
that are not repetitive. He starts in the same place,

79
00:05:59,671 --> 00:06:03,678
plus or minus a particular ingredient or variable.

80
00:06:03,678 --> 00:06:07,295
He has made many series of paintings by this time,

81
00:06:07,295 --> 00:06:11,260
he's made many paintings by the process of application,

82
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:15,844
scraping back a layer of paint. He's done lots and lots of

83
00:06:15,844 --> 00:06:19,128
things, but each one has a particular tenure, a particular

84
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:22,994
scale, and so on. Now, the method he's used for the Cage

85
00:06:22,994 --> 00:06:26,494
paintings is the format he's used before. He's done for and

86
00:06:26,494 --> 00:06:28,094
he's done more, actually, in some cases.

87
00:06:28,094 --> 00:06:31,711
But the particular number of these paintings is,

88
00:06:31,711 --> 00:06:34,077
to my knowledge, unique at this format and with this surface

89
00:06:34,077 --> 00:06:35,394
and so on.

90
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,578
And, for example, the block paintings to these were

91
00:06:37,578 --> 00:06:40,477
juxtaposed to the abstract show with was done in Cologne.

92
00:06:40,477 --> 00:06:43,078
And it was very, very interesting to see this contrast,

93
00:06:43,078 --> 00:06:46,510
because these block paintings are, comparatively speaking,

94
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,677
swath and atmospheric, whereas these are gritty, and they

95
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:51,011
crackle.

96
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:53,227
And they do, actually have this sort of visual equivalent

97
00:06:53,227 --> 00:06:57,828
of sound that Cage was always after which was the sound

98
00:06:57,828 --> 00:07:02,613
of a prepared piano. It's a kind of percussive, audio texture,

99
00:07:02,613 --> 00:07:05,795
rather than an audio atmosphere.

100
00:07:05,795 --> 00:07:09,193
The Cage paintings are also intact as a group, which is not

101
00:07:09,193 --> 00:07:12,111
true of many of his other series.

102
00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:16,778
Increasingly hes able to place bodies of work in their entirety

103
00:07:16,778 --> 00:07:20,243
but this has only happened in recent years and many of his

104
00:07:20,243 --> 00:07:23,227
series have to be reconstituted in bits and pieces.

105
00:07:23,227 --> 00:07:26,211
I faithfully also think of Cage paintings even with the Berut

106
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:28,878
Association, it has a kind of lift to it, I mean some of the

107
00:07:28,878 --> 00:07:33,778
greens is strange, the reds and greys can be very harsh.

108
00:07:33,778 --> 00:07:37,827
But there is a kind of, openness to those paintings,

109
00:07:37,827 --> 00:07:41,278
the surface is also paid to mind, the words betray me

110
00:07:41,278 --> 00:07:44,661
in a way, but anyway, when I walk intot that room for the first

111
00:07:44,661 --> 00:07:46,860
time, felt a kind of lift from them.

112
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:52,978
And I think Richter is after a kind of exaltation, in paintings

113
00:07:52,978 --> 00:07:56,428
in general has been looking for that, but he's always denied

114
00:07:56,428 --> 00:08:00,110
himself the easy ways to it. He didn't want to be Rothko.

115
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:03,511
He wanted to be Newman, and Newman is a painter of

116
00:08:03,511 --> 00:08:06,061
transcedence whose paintings are, oddly enough, rather

117
00:08:06,061 --> 00:08:09,545
clunky, a lot of them. And unforgiving. And Richter's painting

118
00:08:09,545 --> 00:08:12,778
are never clunky. But they're quite often unforgiving.

119
00:08:12,778 --> 00:08:17,128
So it's as if he's permitting himself only rarely to sort of take

120
00:08:17,128 --> 00:08:20,398
off with paintings, but when he does, he really flies.

121
00:08:20,398 --> 00:08:22,927
And I think, in this group, that's what actually what happens.

122
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:25,327
Richter's technical innovations in this area are really

123
00:08:25,327 --> 00:08:31,461
remarkable, and they're the extension of a perception made

124
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:34,628
very early on in his career and it's the perception of, actually

125
00:08:34,628 --> 00:08:37,545
almost any painter whose every picked up a palette and

126
00:08:37,545 --> 00:08:42,727
knife makes; that when you scrape a painting to remove

127
00:08:42,727 --> 00:08:45,776
a passage that you don't like, or when you scrape paint off

128
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:49,361
your palette and then wipe it off it makes this smear where

129
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:53,261
all the colors mix. And if the colors are relatively fresh,

130
00:08:53,261 --> 00:08:57,561
it gets a kind of wonderful, optical jump to it because of

131
00:08:57,561 --> 00:09:00,444
these accidental collisions of different tones and textures.

132
00:09:00,444 --> 00:09:03,860
Rosalind E. Krauss the art historian who sees everything

133
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,628
froma very narrow, American perspective, and a very

134
00:09:07,628 --> 00:09:11,828
art-historically deterministic perspective, explained all of this

135
00:09:11,828 --> 00:09:14,577
in terms of Jasper John's "Device Circle", which is a painting

136
00:09:14,577 --> 00:09:18,643
where Johns makes uses of a ruler to go round in a circle to

137
00:09:18,643 --> 00:09:21,962
spread and smear paint. Now Jasper was a great painter but

138
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:25,429
he didn't invent this. And he certainly didn't invent it for Richter.

139
00:09:25,429 --> 00:09:28,511
Krauss' lack of knowledge about Richter and her attempt to

140
00:09:28,511 --> 00:09:31,193
simply line him up with American painting in chronological

141
00:09:31,193 --> 00:09:34,544
mode, is an indication of how much the problem Richter

142
00:09:34,544 --> 00:09:38,443
has been for artists in general in this country. No, I mean the source

143
00:09:38,443 --> 00:09:42,228
that is 1. that any artist will do that, and the other source is

144
00:09:42,228 --> 00:09:46,328
actually a painting called "liebespaar" by Sigmar Polke,

145
00:09:46,328 --> 00:09:48,212
in whichthere's this pop image of a couple, and then there's

146
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:52,161
these smears of paint on the side, and that single use of

147
00:09:52,161 --> 00:09:55,227
smeared paint in this manner and to date, Richter's own use

148
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:56,443
of it.

149
00:09:56,443 --> 00:09:58,544
Richter and Polke have a kind of relationship that Johns

150
00:09:58,544 --> 00:10:01,295
and Rauschenberg had, they traded things back and forth,

151
00:10:01,295 --> 00:10:03,511
they took from each other freely, they were inimately

152
00:10:03,511 --> 00:10:05,795
connected with each other's work for a very long time.

153
00:10:05,795 --> 00:10:10,844
In any case, Richter, when he began to develop his work

154
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:16,560
and to first of all think about how to blur the image that was

155
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,360
an image originally favored fan brushes and house painting

156
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,045
brushes, and he would drag it across the fresh paint, in

157
00:10:23,045 --> 00:10:26,278
order to make the image spread and smear and so on.

158
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:29,211
To use a palette knife is a more abrupt thing, because it actually

159
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:33,311
removes paint, at least in the first application, and so it's

160
00:10:33,311 --> 00:10:35,728
much more like flaying a painting, like taking the skin off

161
00:10:35,728 --> 00:10:37,545
but with a knife.

162
00:10:37,545 --> 00:10:40,910
But as he developed the abstract work it became the

163
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:44,728
dominant mode, it was his way of creating large spaces with

164
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:48,129
enormous amounts of activity, in fact with an enormous

165
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:50,677
amount of paint, because if you look at the paintings like the

166
00:10:50,677 --> 00:10:53,493
group that are in St. Louis, on January to December or

167
00:10:53,493 --> 00:10:58,910
if you look at any number of paint before that, you'll see

168
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:03,545
layer upon layer upon of very wet, very rich oil paint.

169
00:11:03,545 --> 00:11:06,994
And as the paint is dragged each time, some of it sticks and

170
00:11:06,994 --> 00:11:11,793
some of it doesn't, and as it's dragged again, there's skips

171
00:11:11,793 --> 00:11:14,544
where there's no point of contact for the next layer of paint

172
00:11:14,544 --> 00:11:17,262
to go in, so if you look at those paintings, what you're seeing

173
00:11:17,262 --> 00:11:21,711
is 1. The juxtaposition of colors that comes with 1 schmear,

174
00:11:21,711 --> 00:11:25,644
and when you look at again the 2nd time, or percieve, is that

175
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:30,209
every place where you actually see from the top surface

176
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:33,560
down into a crevice, you're also getting the mixes of colors

177
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,177
that are down there, it's almost they're in canyon, and you

178
00:11:36,177 --> 00:11:39,752
can see this stuff firing off, layer by layer by layer, all the way up to

179
00:11:39,768 --> 00:11:43,483
the surface. And there's an extraordinarily efficient way to

180
00:11:43,483 --> 00:11:47,752
create an incredible amount of accidental imagery, or

181
00:11:47,752 --> 00:11:51,819
accidental optical incident. And as with Cage, Cage used to

182
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:54,386
say, you know, the thing about accidents is that you do

183
00:11:54,386 --> 00:11:56,768
choose the ones you want to keep. It's not like there's no

184
00:11:56,768 --> 00:12:01,085
intention whatsoever. The process of arriving at a result is a

185
00:12:01,085 --> 00:12:04,486
process you set in motion almost blindly. The part that's not

186
00:12:04,486 --> 00:12:06,886
blind is the decision; once you've made something,

187
00:12:06,886 --> 00:12:10,186
to keep it or not. And in Richter's case, that's what it's all

188
00:12:10,186 --> 00:12:14,718
about, the numbers of layers of paint have to do less with

189
00:12:14,718 --> 00:12:18,053
the desire to load it up and make some busy, physical thing,

190
00:12:18,053 --> 00:12:21,936
than dissatisfaction with everything that was there previously

191
00:12:21,936 --> 00:12:25,603
so he keeps putting it on until something happens that he

192
00:12:25,603 --> 00:12:27,763
can then hold on to it.

193
00:12:29,886 --> 00:12:32,951
The one other, I think, crucial part of this has to do with his

194
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:38,926
relation to painting of the 1940's, 50's and early 60's that we

195
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:42,036
call abstract expressionism or (french). The general

196
00:12:42,036 --> 00:12:47,155
tendency at that time was 1. To use brushes, and 2. To

197
00:12:47,155 --> 00:12:50,952
associate the brush mark with some kind of direct transmission

198
00:12:50,952 --> 00:12:55,303
through the artist and of an emotional content or of

199
00:12:55,303 --> 00:12:58,669
a structural intention or what have you. And then to couple

200
00:12:58,669 --> 00:13:00,868
that or link all of that with a kind of signature mark, that thing

201
00:13:00,868 --> 00:13:04,170
that only that hand would do, and so when we look at a

202
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:07,168
de Kooning or a Pollock dripping, you know, the old rules of

203
00:13:07,168 --> 00:13:09,803
connoisseur-ship come in, you know, that is Pollock's mark,

204
00:13:09,803 --> 00:13:13,836
that's de Kooning's mark, or that's Fo Triaz' mark, or that is

205
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:17,099
Schumacher's mark, or whatever the case might be.

206
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:22,654
All of that has to do with the brush, or what the, Siqueiros,

207
00:13:22,654 --> 00:13:26,518
who was a Mexican painter who was against this kind of art also said,

208
00:13:26,518 --> 00:13:27,719
"the stick with hairs on it."

209
00:13:28,288 --> 00:13:32,968
What Richter has done, basically, was to reintroduce the

210
00:13:32,968 --> 00:13:37,585
gesture without gesturalism; use a tool that makes it impossible

211
00:13:37,585 --> 00:13:40,452
to make a signature mark, unless of course, you think of a

212
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:44,668
broad sweep of, you know, moving lava-like paint as a mark.

213
00:13:44,668 --> 00:13:49,002
So he was able to surface the work, to create movement

214
00:13:49,002 --> 00:13:52,268
within the work, without, for the most part, allowing the hand

215
00:13:52,268 --> 00:13:55,836
itself to be the protagonist, much less the artist, whose

216
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:57,084
hand that is.

217
00:13:58,669 --> 00:14:00,870
The only exceptions to this would be those paintings where

218
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:04,036
he then takes the end of the brush and scores things and

219
00:14:04,036 --> 00:14:08,118
makes marks within it, often, I think, just to expose the

220
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:11,636
hidden layers at a certain point of the paint. There you

221
00:14:11,636 --> 00:14:15,085
begin to get the idea of gesturalism as it was practiced

222
00:14:15,085 --> 00:14:19,154
before, but by and large, it's this other thing. It's this process

223
00:14:19,154 --> 00:14:24,202
it's this willingness to let go of certain kinds of control in

224
00:14:24,202 --> 00:14:27,968
order that other things happen.
