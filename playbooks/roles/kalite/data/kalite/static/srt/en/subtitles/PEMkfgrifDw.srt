1
00:00:00,697 --> 00:00:03,805
So let's say we are in the apple market.

2
00:00:03,805 --> 00:00:04,966
What I want to do in this video is

3
00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:10,410
think about both demand and supply for the apples at different prices.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,916
So let's draw ourselves a little graph here.

5
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:14,591
And we already know:

6
00:00:14,591 --> 00:00:17,360
this, right over here, the vertical axis, is the price axis.

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,642
We're going to say it's price per pound.

8
00:00:20,642 --> 00:00:24,275
And the horizontal axis, this is the quantity.

9
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:26,243
The quantity of apples.

10
00:00:26,243 --> 00:00:28,331
And let's put some tick marks here.

11
00:00:28,331 --> 00:00:29,429
Let's say that's one dollar a pound,

12
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:30,942
two dollars a pound,

13
00:00:30,942 --> 00:00:32,304
three dollars a pound,

14
00:00:32,304 --> 00:00:33,528
four dollars a pound,

15
00:00:33,528 --> 00:00:34,781
and five dollars.

16
00:00:34,781 --> 00:00:38,660
And let's say that this is thousands of pounds produced.

17
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:39,933
And we have to set a period,

18
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:42,118
so let's say that this is all for the next week.

19
00:00:42,118 --> 00:00:44,686
And so this is one thousand pounds,

20
00:00:44,686 --> 00:00:45,753
two thousand,

21
00:00:45,753 --> 00:00:46,740
three thousand,

22
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,841
four thousand,

23
00:00:47,841 --> 00:00:49,243
and five thousand.

24
00:00:49,243 --> 00:00:54,421
Now let's think about both the supply and the demand curves for this market,

25
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,726
or potential supply and demand curves.

26
00:00:56,726 --> 00:01:00,795
So first I will do the demand.

27
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:04,610
so if we, if the price of apples were really high

28
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,073
I encourage you to always think about this

29
00:01:06,073 --> 00:01:08,620
when you're about to draw your supply and demand curve

30
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,668
if the price of apples were really high

31
00:01:11,668 --> 00:01:13,259
what would happen to consumers?

32
00:01:13,259 --> 00:01:15,341
well, they wouldn't demand much

33
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:18,128
so the quantity demanded would be low

34
00:01:18,128 --> 99:59:59,999
so if the price were high,

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
maybe the quantity demanded is 500 apples.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Once again. Be very careful. This is a quantity demanded is 500 dollars.

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And nothing the demand is 500 dollars. The demand is entirely relationship. The actual specific quantity we call that
