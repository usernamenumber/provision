1
00:00:01,707 --> 00:00:07,539
we are standing on a wooden walkware suspended over

2
00:00:07,539 --> 00:00:08,039
water. the surface is fairly deep. well

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,973
this is a well afterall. we are looking at

4
00:00:09,973 --> 00:00:12,792
beautiful monument by claus lutr, called the well of moses

5
00:00:12,792 --> 00:00:13,292
we call that titel fairly recently. It was originally known as the great cross

6
00:00:17,187 --> 00:00:17,687
but of course the claus is no longer here.

7
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:22,701
so let us give this a little bit of contacts

8
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:25,109
alot of things are no longer here. this monument stood

9
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,275
in the mirror of chryster surrounded bythe

10
00:00:27,275 --> 00:00:30,570
self of confusion monks that rooms through they

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,193
established by philipthe four the dukeof

12
00:00:34,193 --> 00:00:43,271
burgindy. so we are talking about the late fourteenth century

13
00:00:43,271 --> 00:00:46,572
we are in burgindy in Djon, or rather i should say

14
00:00:46,572 --> 00:00:47,560
just outside of the old walls of the city.

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,595
and this was the place where the duke had

16
00:00:52,595 --> 00:00:55,026
commisioned in oral that the monks could

17
00:00:55,026 --> 00:00:58,527
continuously say prayers over his soul. it also

18
00:00:58,527 --> 00:00:59,995
was intended by philip and became his better place

19
00:00:59,995 --> 00:01:05,260
of his family. it is important to remember that confusions are

20
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:05,760
close asidy. that is they dedicate themselves

21
00:01:09,456 --> 00:01:13,327
into hirely into solitary prayer.that their environment to ensure the salvation of your self into eternity

22
00:01:13,327 --> 00:01:20,174
it is interesting if i had to call the both the duke actually seems to have evolved the confusions

23
00:01:20,174 --> 00:01:25,578
in fact he is pacified that he would be buried in a confuson robe

24
00:01:25,578 --> 00:01:26,078
and of course he wanted to be buried here. so we are looking at

25
00:01:30,152 --> 00:01:30,652
a very well funded monastery, the most brilliant odes of europe are working here

26
00:01:30,652 --> 00:01:33,579
in kiting claus luter and we're looking up at

27
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:42,261
a heaxagonal structure on each side is a prophet

28
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:46,291
standing on each side of a nitch.but interestingly

29
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:50,570
and importantly this is breaking with the material

30
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:57,845
tradition of having these figures comkpletely embedded

31
00:01:57,845 --> 00:02:00,879
within the architecture.each figure of a prophet is separated

32
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,763
by a lovely column and a capitol and standing on these capitols

33
00:02:04,763 --> 00:02:09,562
are angels in positions of grieving and prayers with their wings outstretched

34
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:15,820
and above them we see a base and on that base

35
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,858
would have stood a tall and narrow cross

36
00:02:18,858 --> 00:02:22,256
with christ on it and at the base of that cross

37
00:02:22,256 --> 00:02:29,126
the single leaning figurre of mary maqualin.

38
00:02:29,126 --> 00:02:33,171
all of this was painted you can see blue

39
00:02:33,171 --> 00:02:36,168
there would have been gold and green.so wily

40
00:02:36,168 --> 00:02:37,178
would have come alive and the monks would have

41
00:02:37,178 --> 00:02:40,212
inspired in their prayer when they looked at this monument

42
00:02:40,212 --> 00:02:42,927
slater is able to gear an individual life to each figure

43
00:02:42,927 --> 00:02:47,391
it rerally does give us a sense of movement of the body

44
00:02:47,391 --> 00:02:50,353
but maybe not so much of destruction of the body.but at least is

45
00:02:50,353 --> 00:02:55,654
its engagement with the space around it.

46
00:02:55,654 --> 00:02:58,081
and look up with the figureof king david

47
00:02:58,081 --> 00:03:00,826
phersoah and then imporatant to the duke and david himself

48
00:03:00,826 --> 00:03:06,637
of a king that he is so specific so individualised

49
00:03:06,637 --> 00:03:09,423
is that there is sense of depth and wisdom t his personality

50
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:13,323
there is a recent suggestion that , that figure next to king david

51
00:03:13,323 --> 00:03:18,146
who is a phophet emayor is also apotrait of philip the four

52
00:03:18,146 --> 00:03:23,876
and in fact if we look into the potraits of philip, they look awesome though. thy do.

53
00:03:23,876 --> 00:03:28,906
moses is looking out past us of power as a seer

54
00:03:28,906 --> 00:03:33,874
that lacoraya looks down and almost offers us his prophecy

55
00:03:33,874 --> 00:03:37,961
but it also challenges us. challenges the monks who have lived wit hit

56
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:42,387
sculpture do you see as i see do you understand

57
00:03:42,387 --> 00:03:46,891
the importance of the tragedy of the spiritual miracle

58
00:03:46,891 --> 00:03:50,078
that transpires above. we have these angels, all in different positions

59
00:03:50,078 --> 00:03:54,562
some with their arms folded on their chest and some

60
00:03:54,562 --> 00:03:57,973
with their arms raised, some clutching their drapery

61
00:03:57,973 --> 00:04:00,626
or some touching their face. there is a depth of emotion in the figures of the prophets

62
00:04:00,626 --> 00:04:05,910
and the angels are what i think would have

63
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:11,376
been inspiration to the monks.thsts important to

64
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,541
remember. here we are at the well the center of life

65
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:17,774
of the monastery. the monastery itself was meant to

66
00:04:17,774 --> 00:04:23,076
continuously pray for the soul of the duke. but in some ways

67
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:26,892
this sculptural group wich we now call the world of moses

68
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:32,106
was the engine in the centre of the monastery

69
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:36,138
that was meant to power in sense and inspire the prayer of the monks

70
00:04:36,138 --> 00:04:40,191
it is one of themost spectacular of le medieval sculptures

71
00:04:40,191 --> 99:59:59,999
and truly of what i have seen
