1
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:10,087
Impressionism is so often painting of modern life,

2
00:00:10,087 --> 00:00:12,634
of activities that we engage in now.

3
00:00:12,634 --> 00:00:13,745
Things that we do every day,

4
00:00:13,745 --> 00:00:16,758
we go to cafes, we go to performances

5
00:00:16,758 --> 00:00:19,300
we sit in bars, we have a drink,

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,637
we stroll down the boulevards.

7
00:00:21,637 --> 00:00:25,259
This is the stuff of modern life and the stuff of impressionist painting.

8
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:28,753
And in fact the paiting that we are lookin at is a painting that is about

9
00:00:28,753 --> 00:00:33,341
what we are doing right now, that is looking at paintings.

10
00:00:33,341 --> 00:00:37,179
I almost feel as though I am looking in a mirror when I look up at this painting.

11
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:39,428
And in fact we are in the Museum of fine arts in Boston

12
00:00:39,428 --> 00:00:42,599
looking at Edgar Degas' "Visit to a museum".

13
00:00:42,599 --> 00:00:44,591
We think that the painting shows Mary Cassat, Degas' friend

14
00:00:44,591 --> 00:00:48,663
because Degas actually did a series of prints of Mary Cassatt

15
00:00:48,663 --> 00:00:50,872
in two different galleries and the Louvre,

16
00:00:50,872 --> 00:00:53,975
and he also did another oil painting of this subject.

17
00:00:53,975 --> 00:00:57,135
He also did pastels so it was clearly one that he really liked,

18
00:00:57,135 --> 00:00:59,540
but he did that with his subjects once he found the subject,

19
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,234
like the races or the ballet, or the nude.

20
00:01:02,234 --> 00:01:05,425
He would visit it time and time again and rework it

21
00:01:05,425 --> 00:01:07,365
and he clearly did that with this subject.

22
00:01:07,365 --> 00:01:09,644
In fact art historians think that perhaps the woman,

23
00:01:09,644 --> 00:01:12,926
who is seated is Mary Cassatt's sister - Lydia.

24
00:01:12,926 --> 00:01:16,505
And Degas and Mary Cassatt were friends for 40 years

25
00:01:16,505 --> 00:01:20,674
and Degas actually was the one who suggested that

26
00:01:20,674 --> 00:01:24,003
Mary Cassatt exibit with the impressionists' group which she did.

27
00:01:24,003 --> 00:01:25,873
She was the only American to do so.

28
00:01:25,873 --> 00:01:27,840
They were really like-minded, it's interesting

29
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,260
because Degas is often critisized as being a misogynist, somebody who has a very difficult time with women

30
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,741
But it's more complex issue, it has to do also with class.

31
00:01:36,741 --> 00:01:40,175
Mary Cassatt had come from a very wealthy American family

32
00:01:40,175 --> 00:01:43,924
and so in some ways although she didn't have the pedigree

33
00:01:43,924 --> 00:01:47,361
that Degas' family name had they were unpair.

34
00:01:47,361 --> 00:01:51,256
The story is that Mary Cassatt saw a Degas' in a shop window

35
00:01:51,256 --> 00:01:54,571
and pressed her nose against the window

36
00:01:54,571 --> 00:01:57,874
so that she could see it and take it in and really admired it

37
00:01:57,874 --> 00:02:01,910
and that similarly Degas saw a painting by Mary Cassatt in 1874

38
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,963
and really admired it and saw her as a kindred spirit.

39
00:02:04,963 --> 00:02:08,539
In fact Degas is quoted saying to Mary Cassatt:

40
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:11,731
"Most women paint as though they are trimming hats. Not you"

41
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:14,922
So they had this really close relationship.

42
00:02:14,922 --> 00:02:21,254
And Cassatt is reported to have stepped in when models were not able to do exactly what Degas wanted them to do.

43
00:02:21,254 --> 00:02:25,591
So Degas took Mary Cassatt as his model for this subject at the museum

44
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:28,095
because by doing so he was immediately taking a woman

45
00:02:28,095 --> 00:02:30,995
who was interested in looking at art and

46
00:02:30,995 --> 00:02:34,599
who had a really good eye and a really intelligent eye.

47
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:36,375
Look at the pose that he's placed her in.

48
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:39,261
Her head is cocked back, she is really assessing

49
00:02:39,261 --> 00:02:41,662
and there is a sense of the discerning here.

50
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:45,507
It's interesting, this balance of looking at printed material

51
00:02:45,507 --> 00:02:48,870
and looking at visual material that's on the walls of the gallery.

52
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,876
That's something that we see around us if we just look around the gallery that we are in today.

53
00:02:52,876 --> 00:02:57,741
So this is a painting that's in some ways about the way we read the visual and it's a painting about seeing.

54
00:02:57,741 --> 00:03:00,872
The subject is somebody looking at art as we, the viewers

55
00:03:00,872 --> 00:03:04,739
in the museum are looking at art, and so there's this perfect replication.

56
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:08,562
But more than looking, Mary Cassatt is standing.

57
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:12,711
tilting, gesturing, moving and so is her companion -

58
00:03:12,711 --> 00:03:15,423
holding the book, looking up, tilting her head

59
00:03:15,423 --> 00:03:20,012
and I think that's precisely what Degas was interested in the same way

60
00:03:20,012 --> 00:03:23,263
that he is interested in gesture if we look at other subjects

61
00:03:23,263 --> 00:03:27,241
that he found compelling like milliners or ballet dancers,

62
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:29,399
the way that they stand, the way that they move.

63
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:33,237
And I think there was something really interesting and modern to Degas

64
00:03:33,237 --> 00:03:38,797
about the way people move and look at art, and gesture, and stand in an art museum.

65
00:03:38,797 --> 00:03:42,429
Right, it's an expression of the modern world and it's interesting and I think instructive

66
00:03:42,429 --> 00:03:44,566
to think about what Degas has not focused on.

67
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:48,863
He has not shown us what the specific works of art are that she is looking at.

68
00:03:48,863 --> 00:03:53,182
We can't even see the body or the dress all that clearly.

69
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:57,397
The entire painting is beautifully brushy and gives this sense of the momentary.

70
00:03:57,397 --> 00:04:01,040
That's right. If anything is specific it's the gesture, the poseture.

71
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,467
I think that Degas is very much thinking about the kinds of ...

72
00:04:04,467 --> 00:04:10,762
puting away the rythorical gesture of history painting,

73
00:04:10,762 --> 00:04:13,465
of images of acient Greece and Rome

74
00:04:13,465 --> 00:04:15,594
that we think of when we think about salon paintings

75
00:04:15,594 --> 00:04:18,467
by Couture, or Gerome,or Bouguereau.

76
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:21,194
For Degas' viewers this must have looked ugly.

77
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:26,092
These aren't the graceful gestures of painting condoned by ...

78
00:04:26,092 --> 00:04:28,810
These are really modern and in some ways ugly gestures,

79
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,244
the way you may capture someone sitting on the subway.

80
00:04:31,244 --> 00:04:34,342
All the paint is really quite muddy as well, the colours are muddy

81
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:38,339
and the composition is also at odds with what academic painting would expect.

82
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:40,214
They are looking to the upper right,

83
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:42,589
but the painting's construction, the orthogonals,

84
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:44,541
look for instance at the bench,

85
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,967
the way the plain of the floor meets the plain of the wall,

86
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:50,928
all of that rushes to the upper left and so they are an opposition to each other,

87
00:04:50,928 --> 00:04:54,232
this is real sense of movement and energy in the painting

88
00:04:54,232 --> 00:04:56,930
that's created by this compositional opposition

89
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,093
that is constructed but is so much at odds with

90
00:05:00,093 --> 00:05:02,677
they way that academic painting would be organized.

91
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:06,425
In an academic painting we would likely see what they were looking at,

92
00:05:06,425 --> 00:05:08,347
and we would see their expressions

93
00:05:08,347 --> 00:05:11,590
and there would be some narrative to be constructed out of that,

94
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,086
but that's not what interested Degas.
