1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let's say you go out to get your flu shot.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
one of the first things you're gonna realize

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is that there are two types of flu shot available.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so two types and i'm gonna go through them kind of one by one.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the first one is called TIV

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and TIV stands for trivailent, refers to the fact that of 3 strains

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
inactivated, inactivated means that the strains are all dead

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
influenza, because there are of course three strains of influenza

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and V is simply vaccine

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this is what TIV stands for

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and on the other side we have LAIV

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
LAIV, and this one stands for Live, live attenuated

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this one is a live virus, but it's weakened

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
attenuated refers to weakened, influenza vaccine

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so just like the other one it has the same three strains, we don't put different strains in this one

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And it's live and attenuated.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let me actually just take a moment to step back and talk about this word attenuated

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Specifically, you might also hear the word cold-adpated

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And what they do is literally chemically change the virus around

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they kind of modify it, so that it's still alive

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
technically it's still alive, but it can really now only cause problems in you nose

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because that's the only cold area, right

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the word cold adapted kind of refers to the fact

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that it's only going to be able to cause problems in your nose

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so if you actually go, if the virus goes deeper into your body where it's now warmer,

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it would not have any effects.

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the virus can cause a runny nose, it might cause a little conjestion

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and sometimes it does for people who get this vaccine

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but it won't cause any problems in other places

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so in your throat you'll be okay, and your lungs you'll be okay because it's weakened

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let's start back with TIV

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this one is dead and it's injected

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and in adults it's usually injected in the upper arm

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so if you see a picture of people getting injections

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you know, this is the one they're getting, right?

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they're getting injected usually in their deltswood muscle

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and in contrast, the LAIV we said was alive, but weak

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we also give this one in a different way

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we actually squirt this one, comes in a liquid

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this one gets squirted in the nose

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that makes sense, because the virus naturally would go into the nose

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so this one we give that way as well.

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so now let's think about groups that cannot get these vaccines

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which groups would we say no to

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the only group really on this side would be

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
anyone that's less than six months

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so if they're less than six months old, they should not get the TIV vaccine

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm actually gonna just draw a dividing line between these two

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And on the other side for the laiv, who would we say no to

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this groups has a little bit larger

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so here you would say no to anyone less than two years or

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
i'll put a big or here

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or if they're over 49 years old

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
49 year old is okay, but let's say they're 50

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you would not give the laiv

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that's kind of a cutoff, right?

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
also on this side are pregnant woman,

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so pregnant woman should not be getting this vaccine

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and people with cronic diseases

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let's say you have athsma or you have kidney disease

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
some sort of a cronic disease that you take medications for

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you should not be getting the laiv if that's the case

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
now there's some others actually in this group as well

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
i'm not gonna go to all the people that you would not want to get LAIV

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
there are few other groups, but i wanted to point these four out

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because these are probably among the most common

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and an interesting thing about this is that

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
remember when we talk about high risk groups for influenza

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we talked about some of these.

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We talked about pregnancy as being a high risk group

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
people with cronic disease, no very young kids

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and also the elderly, and of course elderly

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
would be a sub group of this over 49 group

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so and these folks, let's remember these folks

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
are high risk of getting problems or complications from flu.

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So they're the group that you really want to make sure you vaccinate

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and as it turns out, all of them are probably

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
gonna need the TIV, the one over here vaccine

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
now let me make a little it more space

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and lets talk about a few more groups or things to consider

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let me just kind of leave this space here

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
now whenever i'm giving vaccines

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
i always want to kind of keep in mind

84
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that there are few questions i should ask people

85
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and if they answer these question in a certain way

86
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
i'm gonna hold off on giving the vaccine

87
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so who would i want to hold off giving the vaccine to

88
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
well one group,and this might sound kind of obvious

89
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but one group is someone that's had a bad reaction

90
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let's say they've had a bad, a severe reaction in the past to the vaccine

91
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they've had a severe reaction or allergic reaction

92
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
maybe to the vaccine or an allergy

93
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that's the person i may not want to give vaccine to again, right?

94
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
i just want to clarify what was the cause

95
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or what happened exactly, but if it turns out

96
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that they didn't respond well to it

97
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
either the vaccine itself or to eggs actually

98
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because the vaccine is made using eggs

99
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so either of these things if they have an allergic reaction

100
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so if you're reaction to eggs or vaccine in the past

101
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
i'm gonna hold off on giving vaccine

102
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what's another group you might want to

103
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
hold off giving vaccine to?

104
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
well, they're a syndrome out there, you may not

105
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
have heard of it, but i'm gonna write it out here,

106
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we're gonna just kind of briefly discuss it

107
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
called guillion barre, kind of a french pronunciation

108
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and guillion barre syndrom is a problem of the nerves

109
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so it's actually a nerve disease basically a disease

110
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of the nerves that causes muscle weakness

111
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that's how I usually kind of explain it to people

112
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that want to know what is guillion barre

113
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
causes muscle weakness

114
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and there's a relationship in the past between people

115
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
getting gullion barre and the vaccine

116
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that's why we always want to ask people

117
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if they have guillion barre, and if they do

118
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
i would hold off on giving the vaccine in most circumstances

119
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
now a third one, and this is probably

120
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the most common issue that i've seen come up

121
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is when people are moderately ill

122
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so sometimes people come into the office

123
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and say well, i'm here for the flu shot

124
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and it turns out that they're having a lot of fevers and chills

125
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so if they're having any sort moderate illness

126
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or if they're looking moderately ill then i would not give it

127
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
now i say moderately, and i'm trying to

128
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
write this on purpose, this way because if they have

129
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let's say a mild illness, a very mild illness then it's okay.

130
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this is a kind of a judgement call, right?

131
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so you have to actually, as a doctor and nurse giving the vaccine

132
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
really think about what is the illness and is it severe enough

133
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to really want to make you hold off

134
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so mild illness is okay, and that would be something like

135
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
maybe a runny nose or a diarrhea that's very mild

136
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
something that's not too bad.

137
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so now you know the two vaccines you know who you don't give them to,

138
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you also know somethings that we always

139
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
kind of ask to make sure think about before we give the vaccine.

140
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
things to kind of hold off on

141
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let's actually go down and kind of test our knowledge

142
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
i actually kind of wrote out a simple example of flu clinic

143
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let's say there's a flu clinic going on and you're in charge

144
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let's take a look at what you might do

145
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this person, this is you, right? this is you

146
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you're smiling because a lot of people showed up to your flu clinic

147
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so you gotta go through and let's go one by one

148
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and figure out who would get what

149
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the ages of the people are on top

150
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and any kind of illness they have or any kind of

151
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
cronic condition they have is written on the bottom.

152
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let's get through all these folks, one by one

153
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and figure out if they can get TIV or LAIV, right?

154
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
these are the two vaccines, right?

155
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I'll put a yellow check if it's okay

156
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and i'll put a red x if it's not okay

157
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the 3 year old and the 1 year old is brought in by their 62 year old grandmother

158
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and all three of them are okay with getting the tiv, right?

159
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because they are all over 6 months

160
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and they don't have any illness, they don't have guillion barre

161
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and they have no evidence of allergies in the past

162
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
otherwise i would have written it

163
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so that whole family is okay with tiv

164
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what about the next couple?

165
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
i've got a man and a woman and the woman is pregnant

166
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
well, both the man and the woman are over 6 months, right?

167
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the woman is pregnant but that's not an issue with this vaccine

168
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the man has asthma which is cronic disease

169
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but again, that's not a problem with the tiv vaccine

170
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what about the last family?

171
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the 46 year old woman and her 12 year old son

172
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
well, she has a flu, so she's moderately ill

173
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
i would not give her the tiv vaccine, i'll hold off

174
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
her son on the other hand has mild diarrhea

175
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this mild diarrhea he's still okay to get tiv

176
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so that's basically what it would look like if i was only giving out tiv

177
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but of course i'm giving out laiv as well, so some people might want that one

178
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let's go through again and now think about LAIV

179
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
well, for the live vaccine, you have to be over 2 years old

180
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the 3 year's okay, but his one year old sister is not okay

181
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so she's too young to get this one

182
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you also have to be 49 years or younger

183
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you can't be over 50, or 50 or older

184
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so grandma, who brought them in is also not okay to get this vaccine

185
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so in the first family, only the three year old can that vaccine

186
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and in the second family, we've got a man and a woman

187
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the woman is pregnant, so we know that's gonna make her inelligeable for this vaccine

188
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the man has a chronic disease he's got asthma

189
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so he also cannot get this vaccine

190
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the last family we have a woman who's 46 and her son

191
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
now the woman has flu, so just as before,

192
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
for the same reason because she's got an illness

193
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
i'm not gonna give this vaccine either

194
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and her son has a mild diarrhea

195
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and in this case, just as before,

196
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
he can get the tiv, he also can get the laiv

197
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
cause he's not chronically ill with anything, right?

198
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
now as a final point it's a really great idea that this boy is gonna get flu vaccine,

199
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because he's around someone who has flu

200
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so you want to kind of prevent him from getting sick as well

201
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so he can't really avoid being around his mom

202
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so it's a good idea for him to get vaccinated

203
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the vaccine usually takes about two weeks full effect

204
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so he has to wait 2 weeks before he gets full protection

205
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but of course, along the way it's gonna slowly creep up
