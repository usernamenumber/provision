1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,570
So we're asked to add 3/15 plus 7/15, and then simplify

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:06,590
the answer.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,810
So just the process when you add fractions is if they

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,000
already-- well, first of all, if they're not mixed numbers,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,650
and neither of these are, and if they have the same

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:15,280
denominator.

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,190
In this example, the denominators

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,370
are already the same.

9
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,460
The denominator is 15.

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,590
So if you add these two fractions, your sum is going

11
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,860
to have the same denominator, 15, and your numerator is just

12
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,910
going to be the sum of the numerator, so it's going to be

13
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:37,490
3 plus 7, or it's going to be equal to 10/15.

14
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,340
Now if we wanted to simplify this, we'd look for the

15
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,080
greatest common factor in both the 10 and the 15, and as far

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,680
as I can tell, 5 is the largest number that goes into

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,480
both of them.

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:53,640
So divide the 10 by 5 and you divide the 15 by 5, 
and you get--

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,020
10 divided by 5 is 2 and 15 divided by 5 is 3.

20
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,900
You get 2/3.

21
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,099
Now, to understand why this works, let's draw it out.

22
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:08,865
Let's split something up to 15 sections.

23
00:01:08,865 --> 00:01:11,462
So let me split it up into 15 sections.

24
00:01:11,477 --> 00:01:13,670
Let me see how well I can do this.

25
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,300
Well, actually, even a better way, an easier way might be to

26
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,740
draw circles.

27
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,070
So let me do the 15 sections.

28
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,783
So let me draw.

29
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,692
So that is one section right over there

30
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,137
That is one section and then if I copy and paste it,

31
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:39,710
that is a second section, and then a third section, fourth

32
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:44,760
section, and then we have a fifth section.

33
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,960
Let me copy and paste this whole thing.

34
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,920
So that's five sections right there.

35
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,300
Let me copy and then paste that.

36
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,200
So that is 10 sections, and then let me

37
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,080
do it one more time.

38
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,570
So that is 15 sections.

39
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,010
So you can imagine this whole thing is like a candy bar or

40
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,950
something, and we have now split it up into 15 sections.

41
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,870
Now, what is 3/15?

42
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,419
Well, it's going to be 3 of the 15 sections.

43
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:17,570
So 3/15 is going to be one, two, three: 3/15.

44
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,880
Now, to that, were adding 7 of the 1/15

45
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,490
sections, or 7 of the sections.

46
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,260
So we're adding 7 of those to it.

47
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:35,240
So that's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

48
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,940
And you see now, if you take the orange and the blue,

49
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,310
you get one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

50
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,800
ten of the sections, or 10 of the 15 sections.

51
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,230
And then to see why this is the same thing as 2/3, you can

52
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,220
just split this candy bar into third, so each third would

53
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,760
have five sections in it.

54
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,460
So, let's do that.

55
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,300
One, two, three ,four, five, so that is 1/3 right there.

56
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,590
One, two, three, four, five, that is

57
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,360
another third right there.

58
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,810
And notice, when you do it like this, we have filled out

59
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,190
exactly two-- one, two-- of the thirds.

60
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,780
This is the third third, but that's not filled in.

61
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,210
This is the third third, but that's not filled in.
So 10/15 is the same thing as 2/3.
