1
00:00:00,736 --> 00:00:04,518
If we were to rewind the clock back about 70 million years

2
00:00:04,518 --> 00:00:07,790
You would see dinosaurs roaming the earth,

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,147
and this is a very nice picture here of a dinosaur

4
00:00:10,147 --> 00:00:12,277
enjoying a sunset at the beach.

5
00:00:12,277 --> 00:00:17,733
But unfortunately for the dinosaurs, about 65 million years ago

6
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:21,734
we believe that a huge meteorite struck the earth

7
00:00:21,734 --> 00:00:23,934
and essentially wiped out the dinosaurs.

8
00:00:23,934 --> 00:00:26,800
And it probably wiped out a bunch of other species with it,

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,630
because, you can imagine the shock wave itself

10
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,133
would just exterminate tons of species

11
00:00:31,133 --> 00:00:36,409
then you would have the tsunami of unimaginable size, that would just envelope the continents

12
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:38,963
for some period of time, then you would have the soot

13
00:00:38,963 --> 00:00:43,933
that would go into the air and maybe, make it impossible for most of the plant species

14
00:00:43,933 --> 00:00:46,133
to live, because it would be blocking out all of the sunlight

15
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:50,667
And so in an environment like that, we could imagine that an animal like this

16
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:52,867
would be well suited to survive

17
00:00:52,867 --> 00:00:54,000
It's sitting there underground

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,067
maybe it can hibernate in some way so it doesn't need food for long periods of time

19
00:00:58,067 --> 00:01:01,600
maybe it has its own food stash under there some place

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,808
And so we believe that our

21
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:05,067
Ancient, ancient, ancient

22
00:01:05,067 --> 00:01:05,733
Ancient

23
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:09,667
ancient ancestors, after this mass extinction event

24
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:12,000
might have been something like this

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,630
kind of a mole-looking, rodent animal

26
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,813
that was protected from all of this craziness

27
00:01:15,813 --> 00:01:17,333
that was happening on the surface

28
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:19,482
because they like to hang out underground and

29
00:01:19,482 --> 00:01:21,867
you know, have all of their food nearby them

30
00:01:21,867 --> 00:01:23,667
and maybe they could hibernate in some way

31
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:27,267
So you can imagine that once everything settled down

32
00:01:27,267 --> 00:01:29,400
and now we're talking hundreds of years,

33
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,233
thousands of years,

34
00:01:30,233 --> 00:01:31,667
even MILLIONS of years,

35
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:35,225
some of this guys' descendants start to poke their head out of the ground

36
00:01:35,225 --> 00:01:36,933
and are like. You know what? There's food in trees

37
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:38,667
and there's no one else in the trees

38
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:40,600
and trees are a good place to maybe a get away from

39
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,467
some of the other predators

40
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:44,885
that have managed to survive this mass-extinction event.

41
00:01:44,885 --> 00:01:48,400
And some of its ancestors, or some of its descendants I should say

42
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,133
that were good at climbing trees

43
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:51,867
decided, Hey! Let's try this tree thing out

44
00:01:51,867 --> 00:01:55,733
And so you started to have some selection for the descendants

45
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:58,468
of this rodent that could climb trees well

46
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:01,667
they were able to find food where their ancestors couldn't

47
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:04,482
they could find protection in the trees where their ancestors couldn't

48
00:02:04,482 --> 00:02:06,472
So you could imagine, that some subset of this guys'

49
00:02:06,472 --> 00:02:09,313
descendants evolved into something that might have looked

50
00:02:09,313 --> 00:02:11,402
like this guy.

51
00:02:11,402 --> 00:02:12,667
And all of the pictures I'm showing you

52
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:14,933
these are of modern animals, except for of course, the dinosaur

53
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:16,933
I'm sure it's just kind of photoshopped in, in some way

54
00:02:16,933 --> 00:02:19,645
This is a modern Bush Baby, but I show this picture because

55
00:02:19,645 --> 00:02:23,400
it could have been what some of the primitive primates look like.

56
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,467
Because a Bush Baby, it kinda climbs trees; it's able, it kinda looks like

57
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:30,200
it's able to get a hand here, to start climbing the trees

58
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,333
but it also has rodent-like qualities.

59
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,067
But this of course a modern version of it, so

60
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:37,067
This Bush Baby's ancient, ancient, ancient ancestor might have been

61
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:40,148
that primitive primate, or that species of that primitive primate

62
00:02:40,148 --> 00:02:44,867
that was a descendant of rodents, that said "Hey let's see if we can climb these trees and find some food"

63
00:02:44,867 --> 00:02:48,067
And then some of its descendants might have had just

64
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:52,400
the right adaptations, found their own little niche in the right ecosystems,

65
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,667
and they would have evolved into monkeys

66
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:58,667
once again, this is a modern monkey; so you could imagine

67
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:00,733
a kind of primitive monkey.

68
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:03,133
And then, some of those primitive monkey's descendants

69
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:06,000
they turn into these modern monkeys eventually

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,383
but some of them they grow larger in size,

71
00:03:08,383 --> 00:03:10,600
they spend more time outside of trees,

72
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,400
they lose their tail, they don't need it as much for balance

73
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,232
maybe it's actually a bad thing to have, because someone else could grab it

74
00:03:16,232 --> 00:03:18,067
when you're in a fight or something like that

75
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:21,600
and they evolve into apes.

76
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,933
And in particular the Great Apes

77
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:24,893
So, one of the Great Apes

78
00:03:24,893 --> 00:03:27,145
The Great Apes involve Gorillas

79
00:03:27,145 --> 00:03:31,133
and Chimpanzees

80
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:38,569
and the ancestor, or really the Great Apes also include Humanity

81
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:41,402
So let me just review back on this timeline,

82
00:03:41,402 --> 00:03:43,000
just so we don't get confused,

83
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,234
I'll review what we just talked about.

84
00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:48,902
So before this mass-extinction event 65 million years ago,

85
00:03:48,902 --> 00:03:50,551
you had all these types of species here

86
00:03:50,551 --> 00:03:52,467
maybe this right up here, maybe this was

87
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:54,405
actually if I'm talking about species,

88
00:03:54,405 --> 00:03:56,217
maybe this was Tyrannosaurus Rex

89
00:03:56,217 --> 00:03:57,867
because the dinosaurs involved a whole bunch of - -

90
00:03:57,867 --> 00:04:00,234
so this might have been T. Rex,

91
00:04:00,234 --> 00:04:02,400
and I mean there's a bunch of species we could list over here,

92
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,800
but after that mass-extinction event

93
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,966
that was an endpoint for a ton, for a ton of species

94
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:12,238
except for maybe this primitive rodent mole-like thing,

95
00:04:12,238 --> 00:04:18,000
that was, you know, maybe a lot of them died in this event,

96
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,481
but just enough of them survived because they were underground,

97
00:04:20,481 --> 00:04:23,000
or just in the right place, or in a mountain or someplace

98
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,220
who knows where they were?

99
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,000
And some of them were able to evolve into

100
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,867
primitive primates

101
00:04:28,867 --> 00:04:31,279
And some of those primitive primates,

102
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:33,601
and this is once again pictures of primitive primates;

103
00:04:33,601 --> 00:04:38,067
and when I say primitive, these are modern versions of them

104
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:40,533
so primitive doesn't necessarily mean worse,

105
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:45,002
because obviously these guys were able to find, even in today's world, a niche for themselves

106
00:04:45,002 --> 00:04:46,733
they are able to find food and reproduce, and,

107
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:50,064
in ways, that, you know, don't get in the way of ther people

108
00:04:50,064 --> 00:04:51,736
and other people don't get in the way of them

109
00:04:51,736 --> 00:04:53,400
When I talk about primitive primates

110
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,404
I'm just talking about a kind of ancestral primates,

111
00:04:55,404 --> 00:04:57,982
maybe something that's not there, uh, today

112
00:04:57,982 --> 00:05:00,667
Although maybe some of it's descendants look very much like it.

113
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:05,900
But anyway, some of those primates evolve into primitive monkeys,

114
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,733
some of those primitive monkey's descendants become modern monkeys

115
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:11,821
so this is, I'll call it M. Monkeys

116
00:05:11,821 --> 00:05:13,133
for modern monkeys,

117
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:16,070
and some of them evolve into primitive apes

118
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,739
and apes, their distinctive characteristic is that they are like monkeys

119
00:05:19,739 --> 00:05:23,267
but they don't have tails, and they are larger than most monkeys

120
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:27,819
And so these primitive apes, some of their descendants are modern Gorillas

121
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:31,488
at some point they break off, some of these descendants are a

122
00:05:31,488 --> 00:05:38,000
ancestor of both modern Chimpanzees and of human beings

123
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,733
And we think, just looking at the DNA evidence

124
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:44,886
We think that this departure right here, and the fossil evidence

125
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,933
was about 7 million years ago

126
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:51,867
That's our best guess for when we as human beings had

127
00:05:51,867 --> 00:05:54,733
a common ancestor with the chimpanzees.

128
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:56,733
Now you have that common ancestor,

129
00:05:56,733 --> 00:06:00,333
some of that common ancestor's descendants became modern chimpanzees

130
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:03,733
and some of them, maybe they explored the right ecosystem

131
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:05,600
where it was more advantageous to do so,

132
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,895
started to walk on two legs.

133
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:12,267
And the most famous fossil of this

134
00:06:12,267 --> 00:06:15,733
is the Australopithecine Fossil of Lucy

135
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:20,157
that was discovered 3.2 mil --, it was discovered more recently

136
00:06:20,157 --> 00:06:24,987
it's 3.2 million years old.

137
00:06:24,987 --> 00:06:29,933
So the whole Genus, and Genus is kind of one level of categorization above Species.

138
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:35,067
The whole Genus of Australopithecine, these were 4 million to 2 million years ago

139
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:37,067
4 to 2, and we never know

140
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:38,636
you could always find a fossil that is older than this

141
00:06:38,636 --> 00:06:39,867
maybe newer than this

142
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:42,402
I've read one account that said maybe 1 million years ago

143
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,400
but give or take, the Lucy Fossil,

144
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,133
which is the most well-established Australopithecine Fossil

145
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:50,204
is about 3 million years old

146
00:06:50,204 --> 00:06:51,800
And this is a reconstruction I have

147
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,333
over here of Lucy.

148
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:56,933
So this is probably what Lucy looked like.

149
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:59,561
And once again, there were many Lucys

150
00:06:59,561 --> 00:07:02,000
it wasn't just there was one Lucy and we're all descendant from Lucy,

151
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,484
and it's actually not even clear that we are even descendant

152
00:07:04,484 --> 00:07:06,899
directly from Australopithecine, we might be a cousin

153
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:09,067
we might be a cousin species

154
00:07:09,067 --> 00:07:11,267
or a cousin Genus, I should say

155
00:07:11,267 --> 00:07:13,400
Genus is the category right above Species

156
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,267
So if you fast-forward a little bit more

157
00:07:15,267 --> 00:07:19,800
you go to about 2.3 to 1.4 million years ago

158
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,333
2.3 to 1.4 million years ago

159
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:26,404
we see fossils that they are standing upright,

160
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,959
the brain size is bigger, because if you look at the

161
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,486
Australopithecine Fossils, they are standing upright, but their cranial capacity isn't that

162
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,901
different than Chimpanzees.

163
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:39,667
You fast-forward to 2.3 million to 1.4 million years ago

164
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,000
we start to see fossils where

165
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,469
they are standing upright still

166
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:47,333
and the cranial capacity has grown,

167
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:52,735
and you're starting to see primitive stone tools around the bone fossils

168
00:07:52,735 --> 00:07:55,733
and so, we believe that this is, these are

169
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:58,401
one of the first, so this is really just how we categorize it

170
00:07:58,401 --> 00:08:04,533
but these are some of the first fossils that we categorize as belonging to the same Genus as ours

171
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:06,667
and the Genus is Homo

172
00:08:06,667 --> 00:08:09,570
And Homo just means man

173
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:13,563
so it's the group right above Species of Man

174
00:08:13,563 --> 00:08:15,000
and we call them similar to man,

175
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,604
because it looks like they are starting to make primitive stone tools,

176
00:08:17,604 --> 00:08:20,200
they stand upright like us,

177
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:26,733
and they have larger cranial capacities than the Australopithecine Fossils or modern Chimpanzees.

178
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:30,600
And once again, we never know if Homo Habilis, which

179
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,133
literally means, the Homo part means Man,

180
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:37,155
Habilis means Handy, because he liked to make tools or whatever else.

181
00:08:37,155 --> 00:08:41,667
We don't if Homo Habilis is a descendant of Lucy's Species,

182
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:44,887
of Australopithecus, or maybe a cousin species

183
00:08:44,887 --> 00:08:48,333
maybe they are both descendants from a common ancestor

184
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,400
we're not quite sure.

185
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,800
Then you fast-forward a little bit more

186
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,067
we're talking now about 1.8,

187
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:59,467
so now we're talking about 1.8 million to 1.3 million years ago

188
00:08:59,467 --> 00:09:05,200
and we start seeing fossils where the cranial capacity larger than Homo Habilis,

189
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,800
getting closer in size to kind of what we know,

190
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,401
what our notion is of kind of a modern person's cranial capacity,

191
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:15,400
at least relative to body size,

192
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,733
and this is Homo Erectus.

193
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:21,400
And once again, we don't know if Homo Erectus is the descendant of Homo Hibilus,

194
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,400
maybe they have a common ancestor,

195
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,733
who knows?

196
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:26,667
It looks from the fossil evidence that there was,

197
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,467
especially when you look at this range here

198
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,400
that there was some overlap, where you had

199
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:35,400
both Homo Erectus and Homo Hibilus living on the same planet at the same time

200
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,467
Now you fast-forward even more,

201
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:42,600
and we think, about 600,000 to 300,000

202
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,467
once again, all of these are constantly being modified

203
00:09:45,467 --> 00:09:49,733
as we get better at finding new fossils, or interpreting the fossils we have,

204
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:51,400
or we look at DNA evidence or whatever

205
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,667
about 600,000 to 300,000 years ago, you have the Neanderthals appear

206
00:09:56,667 --> 00:10:00,305
And Neanderthals are in the same Genus as Humans,

207
00:10:00,305 --> 00:10:03,649
so it's really Homo Neanderthalensis.

208
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:04,867
I always have trouble saying that,

209
00:10:04,867 --> 00:10:08,000
so this is still part of Homo.

210
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,569
And a common misconception is that the Neanderthals

211
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:13,333
are somehow a more primitive version of humans,

212
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,398
that they are somehow cavemen and we are modern men

213
00:10:15,398 --> 00:10:16,467
That's not the case.

214
00:10:16,467 --> 00:10:21,200
The belief is that Neanderthals are either a cousin species, we have a common ancestor

215
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,467
or, that they're actually a sub-species of human beings

216
00:10:25,467 --> 00:10:29,333
and there is some belief that they might have interbred with Homo Sapiens,

217
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:35,000
and maybe some, or a good number of us have Neanderthal genes.

218
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,012
It's nothing to be ashamed of, it's just something, you know, unfortunately that Neanderthals

219
00:10:40,012 --> 00:10:44,067
just get a bad name, because of our popular culture.

220
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:47,814
If anything, so this is a drawing of Neanderthal brain, they actually had a

221
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,867
fairly large cranial capacity, although scientists say

222
00:10:49,867 --> 00:10:53,600
they kind of make one reason or another why we think they might have been more

223
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,405
primitive than Homo Sapiens, but who knows? We don't know.

224
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:59,733
We're constantly learning things every day.

225
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:02,667
But of course, the whole point of this is to talk about

226
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:04,733
how humans showed up on this planet,

227
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:11,267
and the first really human fossils we find about 200,000 years ago

228
00:11:11,267 --> 00:11:14,633
and this, remember, we're in the Genus Homo;

229
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:18,400
and now we've finally found something that looks just like us

230
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,333
anatomically at least, we can't study its behavior and all the rest,

231
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,267
and now we get to Homo Sapiens,

232
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,733
the Homo part, once again, means Man

233
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:31,333
and the Sapiens, the Sapiens means "Thinking".

234
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:34,867
So we can debate whether it's an appropriate title for our Species,

235
00:11:34,867 --> 00:11:36,133
but it's Thinking Man,

236
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:39,667
so once again the Neanderthals they were either a cousin species

237
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:43,333
for a lot of this time, especially once Homo Sapiens showed up,

238
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:46,733
and maybe Homo Sapiens showed up before this, we just haven't found the fossils yet

239
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:49,230
They were maybe both inhabiting the same planet,

240
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,867
maybe there was some interbreeding,

241
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:54,467
but the Neanderthals disappeared about 30,000 years ago

242
00:11:54,467 --> 00:11:57,148
30,000 years ago these guys disappeared

243
00:11:57,148 --> 00:12:00,678
Maybe some of them kind of got mixed in with the Homo Sapiens

244
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:01,933
started to interbreed with them,

245
00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:04,486
or they might have just been killed off,

246
00:12:04,486 --> 00:12:07,933
because they were fighting over the same ecosystems

247
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:11,267
and I have made a little sample here of Homo Sapiens

248
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:15,400
just in case, well, I'm assuming most of you watching this video are one

249
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,229
but just in case, here's my little sample

250
00:12:18,229 --> 00:12:27,708
We can debate how representative of a sample of our species this really is.
