1
00:00:06,815 --> 00:00:10,241
Well, here we are looking at Pontormos' 'Entombment,'

2
00:00:10,241 --> 00:00:11,612
[or 'Deposition from the Cross' – ]

3
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:14,360
a typical Mannerist painting from about 1520.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,289
And we want to use this as a starting-off point

5
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:18,562
to talk about what follows Mannerism.

6
00:00:18,562 --> 00:00:21,992
Right, a kind of rejection of Mannerism is going to happen.

7
00:00:21,992 --> 00:00:24,396
Absolutely, very rhetorically, a rejection of Mannerism

8
00:00:24,396 --> 00:00:26,002
is going to come around, beginning in

9
00:00:26,002 --> 00:00:30,196
the last quarter of the 16th century, and in the late 1570s,

10
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,828
especially 1580s and onwards.

11
00:00:31,828 --> 00:00:34,441
And I can see why people would reject it.

12
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:36,707
I mean, it's incredibly complicated.

13
00:00:36,707 --> 00:00:37,611
Exactly.

14
00:00:37,611 --> 00:00:39,284
Its difficult to read.

15
00:00:39,284 --> 00:00:39,790
Sure.

16
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,750
Its hard to tell whats going on.

17
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,582
There are a lot of reasons that this

18
00:00:44,582 --> 00:00:48,106
doesn't sort of seem like the traditional definition of art –

19
00:00:48,106 --> 00:00:49,989
especially when you think about the Renaissance

20
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:51,855
and its interest in naturalism.

21
00:00:51,855 --> 00:00:55,240
All of the qualities, its difficulty in reading,

22
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,584
its enigmatic qualities  – the very stylized, elegant nature –

23
00:00:58,584 --> 00:01:01,160
these were all things that made Mannerist art good,

24
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,575
in the Mannerist period.

25
00:01:02,575 --> 00:01:06,540
But after over fifty years of Mannerism's dominance in Italy –

26
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,450
beginning in the 1520s, and reaching towards

27
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,245
the end of the century – a backlash does begin to build 

28
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:13,772
exactly towards the issues that you were talking about.

29
00:01:13,772 --> 00:01:15,021
And there's a growing desire 

30
00:01:15,021 --> 00:01:16,884
for many reasons – a few of which we will talk about –

31
00:01:16,884 --> 00:01:19,214
for a return to the basic principles

32
00:01:19,214 --> 00:01:20,486
of the High Renaissance –

33
00:01:20,486 --> 00:01:24,548
which they look back upon – from 70 years later –

34
00:01:24,548 --> 00:01:27,330
as a period when art was good –

35
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,673
for several different reasons.

36
00:01:28,673 --> 00:01:31,335
Wow, and so one of the reasons that they are going to

37
00:01:31,335 --> 00:01:33,912
reject Mannerism has to do with its legibility

38
00:01:33,912 --> 00:01:36,662
at a time when the Church is being attacked,

39
00:01:36,662 --> 00:01:39,654
and really needs art to communicate

40
00:01:39,654 --> 00:01:41,907
in a very easy and direct way – (Right?)

41
00:01:41,907 --> 00:01:43,057
– because of the Reformation.

42
00:01:43,057 --> 00:01:46,421
Sure. The Protestant Reformation was criticizing art

43
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:48,880
coming out of the Catholic areas for being too distracting,

44
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,994
and for not communicating the story well.

45
00:01:50,994 --> 00:01:53,481
And so, as we know, the Protestants tended to put

46
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:56,007
their emphasis on the written word in the Bible,

47
00:01:56,007 --> 00:01:57,784
rather than on art, because they would point to

48
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:58,484
something like this and say,

49
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:00,317
"This is not a good religious teaching tool."

50
00:02:00,317 --> 00:02:01,586
Right.

51
00:02:01,586 --> 00:02:02,886
And the whole way the Church defended art

52
00:02:02,886 --> 00:02:04,511
was by saying it was there to teach.

53
00:02:04,511 --> 00:02:05,333
Right.

54
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,229
So then how could you point to this

55
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:09,349
and say that it is teaching anybody anything?

56
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:10,156
Exactly.

57
00:02:10,156 --> 00:02:12,038
And so a new style –

58
00:02:12,038 --> 00:02:14,518
as the Counter Reformation is building –

59
00:02:14,518 --> 00:02:16,018
even beginning in the 1540s,

60
00:02:16,018 --> 00:02:17,487
but especially towards the end of the century –

61
00:02:17,487 --> 00:02:19,174
they feel that a new style is needed.

62
00:02:19,174 --> 00:02:20,335
That makes sense.

63
00:02:20,335 --> 00:02:23,383
Our story about this reaction actually starts in Bologna.

64
00:02:23,383 --> 00:02:25,544
And it starts there for a couple of reasons.

65
00:02:25,544 --> 00:02:28,420
One reason is that Cardinal Paleotti –

66
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,254
who was one of the leaders of the Counter Reformation –

67
00:02:31,254 --> 00:02:33,267
was a bishop from Bologna.

68
00:02:33,267 --> 00:02:36,931
And at the various meetings of the Council of Trent –

69
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:39,116
which was this religious convention to formulate

70
00:02:39,116 --> 00:02:42,407
the Catholic response to the Protestant Reformation,

71
00:02:42,407 --> 00:02:44,640
Cardinal Paleotti was in charge, essentially,

72
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,234
of figuring out what to do about art –

73
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,005
how to make good  – in quotes – 

74
00:02:49,005 --> 00:02:50,747
art that would be immune

75
00:02:50,747 --> 00:02:52,605
to the criticism of the Protestants.

76
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:53,366
Right.

77
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:55,041
And the Council of Trent also meets

78
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,433
in Bologna several times .

79
00:02:56,433 --> 00:02:57,517
Oh, I didnt know that.

80
00:02:57,517 --> 00:02:58,586
I thought they only met in Trent.

81
00:02:58,586 --> 00:03:01,340
No. As frequently happened during this era –

82
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,116
sometimes when the plague

83
00:03:02,116 --> 00:03:03,569
or other diseases would break out –

84
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:05,545
they would move the conference to other places.

85
00:03:05,545 --> 00:03:07,873
And so, because you have this Bishop from Bologna,

86
00:03:07,873 --> 00:03:10,449
and because, also, the Council is taking place –

87
00:03:10,449 --> 00:03:13,706
sometimes in Bologna – it's almost first in Bologna 

88
00:03:13,706 --> 00:03:16,641
that you see artists responding to this need

89
00:03:16,641 --> 00:03:20,680
for an art that is basically more straightforward,

90
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,024
clear, legible – a good religious teaching tool –

91
00:03:24,024 --> 00:03:25,139
Didactic.

92
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:25,639
Exactly.

93
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,826
And it gets rid of all of the ambiguities,

94
00:03:27,826 --> 00:03:29,563
and the overwrought elegance

95
00:03:29,563 --> 00:03:31,525
that they see being the problem, by now,

96
00:03:31,525 --> 00:03:33,586
with some of the most characteristic works

97
00:03:33,586 --> 00:03:35,329
of Mannerism that had come before.

98
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:38,439
Yeah and I noticed that here in this image of the crucifixion –

99
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:40,000
This is by --

100
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,055
This is by Annibale Carracci.

101
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,155
This is a crucifixion from pretty early in his career –

102
00:03:44,155 --> 00:03:45,578
around the 1580s.

103
00:03:45,578 --> 00:03:47,001
And this was made in Bologna.

104
00:03:47,001 --> 00:03:50,865
In fact, you can see a little miniature Bologna

105
00:03:50,865 --> 00:03:53,429
down at the bottom, as well as in the distance.

106
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:56,771
And here we see an artist, who, as a young man,

107
00:03:56,771 --> 00:04:00,229
is trying to formulate a new style of painting,

108
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:02,347
in part – although not exclusively –

109
00:04:02,347 --> 00:04:04,357
because of this new religious atmosphere

110
00:04:04,357 --> 00:04:06,705
of the counter Reformation thats pushing artists

111
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:09,488
to make art that is legible, straightforward,

112
00:04:09,488 --> 00:04:12,888
easy to understand, and properly communicates the stories

113
00:04:12,888 --> 00:04:14,872
from the Bible or other religious texts.

114
00:04:14,872 --> 00:04:18,022
What I notice most about it is this kind of

115
00:04:18,022 --> 00:04:23,544
emotional quality to it, where the gestures are very –

116
00:04:23,544 --> 00:04:25,185
It's very clear from everyone's gestures

117
00:04:25,185 --> 00:04:28,685
and facial expressions what they're feeling.

118
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,598
Right.

119
00:04:29,598 --> 00:04:32,642
The grasping of the chest, or the throwing out of the arms.

120
00:04:32,642 --> 00:04:33,764
And the facial expressions.

121
00:04:33,764 --> 00:04:37,103
A kind of overwrought acting going on.

122
00:04:37,103 --> 00:04:38,911
Yes, that's definitely true.

123
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:43,258
And the style that Annibale Carracci

124
00:04:43,258 --> 00:04:44,660
and his brother and cousin –

125
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,062
who are also artists working with him –

126
00:04:46,062 --> 00:04:47,466
and others that soon will follow them,

127
00:04:47,466 --> 99:59:59,999
this is going to give birth to the Baroque style.

128
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And what you've just described are very much

129
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
characteristics of the Baroque style.

130
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Bold gestures.

131
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Bold facial expressions to make the meaning

132
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in the narrative as clear as possible 

133
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in absolute contrast to all of the ambiguities,

134
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the emotionless fanciful renderings

135
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that we saw in these kind of scenes in Mannerism.

136
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Right.

137
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And also a kind of emotion to make things have

138
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a kind of impact on the viewer too.

139
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Which is something we didn't see so much

140
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in the High Renaissance, when there was

141
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a kind of distance in that ideal beauty.

142
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Here, there's a kind of down to earth.

143
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is what the story is telling us.

144
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is how the figures are feeling.

145
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Its definitely more dramatic and energized

146
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
than a High Renaissance composition might have been.

147
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What I always say, is in some ways the Baroque style

148
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is a return to the principles of a High Renaissance,

149
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but with the volume turned way, way up.

150
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Way up.

151
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
To 11. [LAUGHS]

152
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Exactly.

153
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Past 10.

154
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Right. And so, the gestures and the facial expressions

155
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
are one way that this becomes very dramatic.

156
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Baroque paintings like already we can see in this one,

157
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
tend to have dramatic lighting very frequently.

158
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Right --

159
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then something else that also increases the intensity

160
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the legibility, and the clarity of the image

161
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is that all the figures are quite large

162
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and pressed right up against the front of the picture plane that

163
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is very close to the viewer 

164
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to really almost enter the viewer's space,

165
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and really heighten that sense that you are there too 

166
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you can experience this,

167
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this will heighten your religious devotion.

168
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Also, typical of Baroque art and its rejection of Mannerism

169
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is the intense or great simplification of the composition.

170
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There are no complicated patterns.

171
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There are no contorted positions.

172
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Theres no enigmatic representation of space or foreshortening.

173
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Everything is boiled down to its essentials.

174
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There's nothing extraneous in these early Baroque paintings.

175
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So its the narrative

176
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Exactly

177
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The narrative is the core.

178
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There's nothing extra, there's nothing confusing.

179
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The other thing also, that compared to Mannerist paintings

180
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Carracci and their later Baroque followers

181
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
are very intent in creating very naturalistic images.

182
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Gone is the very attenuated, elegance stylization of Mannerism

183
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There's a return to basics also in the rendering

184
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of the figure and its anatomical accuracy

185
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the representation of fabric, and depth,

186
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and space and gravity, and three-dimensionality.

187
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Everything that was illogical in a Mannerist work of art,

188
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and praised for it at that time, now becomes

189
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
logical and clear and straightforward.

190
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So theres kind of an implicit criticism.

191
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Sure --

192
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in Mannerism, a kind of saying, "Mannerism wasnt good art."

193
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well the 'Carracci' (followers) literally did say that.

194
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They were not only artists, but they were art critics in a way.

195
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And they were responding to the praise of Mannerism

196
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
from the earlier decades.

197
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And saying, "No, this is not good art,

198
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because it doesn't replicate nature,

199
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because it's not based on study from life."

200
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so they go around looking at artists

201
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
who they thought of as good 

202
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
including the typical ones we think of

203
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
from the High Renaissance 

204
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Like Raphael and Michelangelo and so on.

205
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But also traveling to areas that didn't tend

206
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to be emphasized in the literature as much 

207
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
traveling around their native region of Emilia.

208
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But also looking at people like Titian and ?? in Venice.

209
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And you can see all of these influences in their paintings.

210
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And an early one like this,

211
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where also in a later more mature work like this Lamentation 

212
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which is around 1605.

213
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Still, this is Annibale Carracci.

214
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we can see the basic hallmarks

215
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of this new Baroque style that's emerged.

216
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Intense, very dramatic rendering of the narrative.

217
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But at the same time very simple, very straightforward.

218
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There's no mistaking the emotions.

219
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There's no mistaking the narrative in what's going on here.

220
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Christ looks dead

221
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but again also very strikingly naturalistic, very descriptive.

222
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And you know, its so easy to read.

223
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
My eye goes first to this figure of Christ at the bottom 

224
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
whos been removed from the cross.

225
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then it goes up to Mary Magdalene 

226
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
whos got that kind of dramatic emotion,

227
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you know, throwing her arms up, and kneeling,

228
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and looking down at Him and then up to, I guess,

229
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the other Mary 

230
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The other Mary.

231
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Reaching out to those arms that reach out

232
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
toward the third woman.

233
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So then, our eye then moves across.

234
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then it moves down towards Christs mother.

235
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then back down towards Christ.

236
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Theres a kind of way that the artist really is leading our eye

237
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
through the composition in a very sort of methodical way.

238
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And also playing down the areas of the composition

239
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that dont necessarily contribute to the narrative.

240
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And so again, notice that the figures

241
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
are very close to the front of the picture plane,

242
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and everything behind them is in dark  in shadow.

243
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Theres no architecture, theres no 

244
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Exactly.

245
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Nothing to distract you.

246
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Theres no elaborate landscape.

247
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Right.

248
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And also in terms of the composition,

249
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we should say that here we can see

250
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
one of the most important features of all Baroque art,

251
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in addition to the naturalism and the drama 

252
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the very strong diagonal that cuts across the picture plane

253
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
also adding  I just notice that  two parallel diagonal lines 

254
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
also adding to the energized drama at the scene.
