1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,367
So let's subtract 286 from 913.

2
00:00:05,367 --> 00:00:07,967
But first I'm going to do it slightly different way.

3
00:00:07,967 --> 00:00:10,233
I've taken each of these numbers and I've expanded them out.

4
00:00:10,233 --> 00:00:17,567
This 9 in the hundreds place represents 900, this 1 in the tens place represents 10, this 3 in the ones place represents 3.

5
00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:22,833
Likewise 286 is the same thing as 200 plus 80 plus 6.

6
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:28,633
So let's try to subtract going place by place. So if we start in the ones place we have a problem immediately.

7
00:00:28,633 --> 00:00:33,624
3 is less than 6. How do we subtract a larger number from a smaller number?

8
00:00:33,624 --> 00:00:42,216
We also have a problem in the tens place. 80 is larger than 10. What do we do?

9
00:00:42,216 --> 00:00:43,888
How do we subtract a larger number from a smaller number?

10
00:00:43,888 --> 00:00:47,767
And you might guess the answer here is Regouping, sometimes called Borrowing.

11
00:00:47,767 --> 00:00:50,767
We're going to take a value from one place and give it to another.

12
00:00:50,767 --> 00:00:58,700
So let's say, this scenario right over here where we have this 3 and we want to take some value from one of the other places.

13
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:05,500
Well, I could take 10 from the tens place so then this is going to become 0.

14
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:12,767
And if I give that 10 to the ones place, so 10 plus 3 is 13.

15
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:19,971
Notice: I haven't changed the value. 900 plus 0 plus 13 is still 913.

16
00:01:19,971 --> 00:01:27,123
Now this solved the problem for the ones place - I can now subtract 6 from 13 - but it made the problem in the tens place even worse.

17
00:01:27,123 --> 00:01:30,633
I have to subtract 80 from 0! What do I do?

18
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:33,767
Well luckily I can go to the hundreds place.

19
00:01:33,767 --> 00:01:41,967
I could take a hundred from 9 hundred (so then I'm left with 8 hundred) and I could give it to the tens place.

20
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:50,033
So if I give it to the tens place then this is going to be 100, right over here.

21
00:01:50,033 --> 00:01:56,300
Notice: This still adds up to 913. 800 plus 100 plus 13 is 913.

22
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:02,367
Why is this valuable? Well, now in every column I'm subtracting a smaller number from a larger.

23
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:06,033
You might say: "Isn't that a positive sigh here?" But we have this negative out here.

24
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:11,967
So we're subtracting 6 from 13, we're subtracting 80 from 100, subtracting 200 from 800.

25
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:13,900
So let's do it.

26
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:25,637
13 minus 6 is 7. 100 minus 80 is 20. 800 minus 200 is 600.

27
00:02:25,637 --> 00:02:31,100
So we're left with 600 plus 20 plus 7 which is 627.

28
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,167
Now let's do the exact same thing here but we're not going to expand the numbers.

29
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:40,638
So 6 is greater than 3. What do we do? Well, we can regroup from the tens place.

30
00:02:40,638 --> 00:02:47,300
We can take 10 from here (so we're left with 0 tens) and give that one ten to the ones place.

31
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:54,802
So you give 10 to the 3, you get... it becomes 13.

32
00:02:54,802 --> 00:02:58,610
But now we have a problem in the tens place. How do we subtract 8 from 0?

33
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:06,767
Well, we could take a hundred from the hundreds place (so 900 becomes 800) and give that hundred to the tens place.

34
00:03:06,767 --> 00:03:11,900
So you give hundred to the tens place, a hundred plus 0 tens is a hundred.

35
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:19,972
A hundred is the same thing as 10 tens.

36
00:03:19,972 --> 00:03:28,500
And so now we are ready to subtract. 13 minus 6 is 7, 10 minus 8 is 2.

37
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:38,300
Remember, this is really 10 tens minus 8 tens to get 2 tens. A hundred minus 80 to get 20.

38
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,300
And then finally we have 800 minus 200 to get 600.
627.
