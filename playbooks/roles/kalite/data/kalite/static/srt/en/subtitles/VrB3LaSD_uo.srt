1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
   

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,990
Let's keep messing with our
determinants to see if we can

3
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:04,910
get more useful results.

4
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,140
And they might not be obviously
useful right now,

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,350
but maybe we'll use them later
when we are exploring other

6
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,060
parts of linear algebra.

7
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,090
So let's say I have
some matrix, let's

8
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,420
call it matrix X.

9
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,710
Matrix X is equal to-- I'll just
start with a 3 by 3 case

10
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,100
because I think the 2 by 2
case is a bit trivial.

11
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,210
Actually, why don't I just
start with a 2 by 2 case.

12
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:32,020
Let's say matrix X is a, b,
and then it has x1, x2.

13
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,030
I could have called these c and
d, but you'll see why I

14
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,240
called them x1 and
x2 in a second.

15
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,970
And I'll say I have
another matrix.

16
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:42,370
Let's say matrix Y is identical
to matrix X except

17
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:43,610
for this row.

18
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:50,820
So matrix Y is a, b y1 and y2.

19
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,950
And let's say we have
a third matrix Z.

20
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,690
   

21
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:00,070
That's identical to the first
two matrices on the first row.

22
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,290
So a, b.

23
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,790
but on the second row it's
actually the sum of the two

24
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,150
rows of x and y.

25
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,070
So it's going to be, this
entry's going to be x1 plus

26
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:18,910
y1, and this entry right
here is x2 plus y2.

27
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,150
Just like that.

28
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,050
I want to be very clear,
Z is not X plus Y.

29
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,800
All of the terms of Z are
not the sum of all the

30
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,690
terms of X and Y.

31
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,770
I'm only focusing on
one particular row.

32
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,990
And this is just a general theme
that you'll see over and

33
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,920
over again, and we saw it in
the last video and I guess

34
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,790
you'll see it here, is that
determinants or finding the

35
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,530
determinants of matrices
aren't linear on matrix

36
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,720
operations, but they are linear
on operations that you

37
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,330
do just to one row.

38
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:49,680
So in this case, everything else
is equal except for this

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,000
row, and Z has the same first
row as these guys, but its

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,080
second row is the sum of the
second row of these guys.

41
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,090
So let's explore how
the determinants

42
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,130
of these guys relate.

43
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:05,270
So the determinant-- let
me do it in X's color.

44
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,639
The determinant of X-- I'll
write it like that-- is equal

45
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,200
to a ax2 minus bx1.

46
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,070
You've seen that
multiple times.

47
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:22,670
The determinant of Y is equal
to ay2 minus by1.

48
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:31,130
And the determinant of Z is
equal to a times x2 plus y2

49
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:38,150
minus b times x1 plus y1, which
is equal to ax2 plus

50
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:45,150
ay2-- just distributed the
a-- minus bx1 minus by1.

51
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,710
And if we just rearrange things,
this is equal to a--

52
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,510
let me write it this
way-- this is equal

53
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:54,890
to ax2 minus bx1.

54
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,740
That's that term and that term,
we switched colors.

55
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,560
So that's those two guys.

56
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:07,320
And then plus ay2 minus by1.

57
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,190
Now what is this right here?

58
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,900
That is the determinant of X.

59
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,680
   

60
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,290
And this right here is
the determinant of Y.

61
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,190
So there you have it.

62
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:22,190
If we have matrices that are
completely identical except

63
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:25,160
for one row-- and in this case
it's a 2 by 2 matrix, so it

64
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,115
looks like half of the matrix--
and Z's, that row

65
00:03:29,115 --> 00:03:32,080
that we're referring to that's
different, Z's is the sum of

66
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,530
the other two guys' rows, then
Z's determinant is the sum of

67
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,590
the other two determinants.

68
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,990
So this is a very
special case.

69
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,840
I want to keep reiterating it.

70
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,530
It only works in the case where
this row and only this

71
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,740
row is the sum of this row and
this row, and the matrices are

72
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,850
identical everywhere else.

73
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:54,490
Let me show you the 3 by 3 case,
and I think it'll be a

74
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,290
little bit more general.

75
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,420
And then we'll go to n by n.

76
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,500
The n by n is actually, on some
level, the easiest to do,

77
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,430
but it's kind of abstract so I
like to save that for the end.

78
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:08,300
So let's redefine all those
guys into the 3 by 3 case.

79
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:17,029
So let's say that X is equal
to a, b, c-- let's just do,

80
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:19,019
let's make the third row the
row we're going to use to

81
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,810
determine our determinant. a,
b, c, d, e, f-- actually let

82
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,230
me do the middle row, because I
don't want to make you think

83
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,670
it always has to be
the last row.

84
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:33,260
So let's say it's x1, x2, x3,
and you have d, e, f.

85
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,910
And what's the determinant
of X going to be?

86
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:39,200
The determinant of X is going
to be equal to-- let's say

87
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,380
we're going along this
row right here,

88
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,530
that's the row in question.

89
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,690
It's going to be equal to--
well you remember your

90
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,870
checkerboard pattern-- so it's
going to be-- remember, plus,

91
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,080
minus, plus, minus, plus--
you remember all

92
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,250
the rest how it goes.

93
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:57,910
So it's going to start with
a minus x1 times the sub

94
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,810
matrix-- you get rid of that
column, that row-- b, c, e, f.

95
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,470
   

96
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:09,520
Then you have plus x2 times the
sub matrix-- get rid of

97
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,140
that column, that row--
a, c, d, f.

98
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,580
   

99
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:20,200
And then finally minus x3--
you get rid of its row and

100
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,690
column-- you have a, b, d, e.

101
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:26,170
   

102
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:31,190
Now let me define another matrix
Y that is identical to

103
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,260
matrix X, except for that row.

104
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,340
So it's a, b, c.

105
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,210
Then down here d, e, f.

106
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,250
That middle row is different.

107
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,410
It's y1, y2, and y3.

108
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,490
What's the determinant
of Y going to be?

109
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,920
Determinant of Y?

110
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,390
Well it's going to be identical
to the determinant

111
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,510
of X because all the
sub-matrices are going to be

112
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,870
the same when you cross
out this row

113
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,120
and each of the columns.

114
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,660
But the coefficients are
going to be different.

115
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,390
Instead of an x1,
you have a y1.

116
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:04,460
So it's going to be equal to
minus y1 times the determinant

117
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:13,320
b, c, e, f plus y 2 times the
determinant of a, c, d f minus

118
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:18,210
y3 times the determinant
of a, b, d, e.

119
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,990
I think you see where
this is going.

120
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,330
Now I'm going to create
another matrix.

121
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:28,680
I'm going to create another
matrix Z just like that that

122
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,290
is equal to-- it's identical to
these two guys on the first

123
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:38,590
and third rows, a,
b, c, d, e, f.

124
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,840
Just like that.

125
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,060
But this row just happens
to be the sum of this

126
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,233
row and this row.

127
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:46,420
And when we figured out this
determinant we went along that

128
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,390
row-- you can see that
right there.

129
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:52,240
So this row right here is going
to be x1 plus y1, that's

130
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,750
its first term.

131
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:58,310
x2 plus y2, and then you
have x3 plus y3.

132
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,110
Now what's the determinant
of Z going to be?

133
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,010
Well, we can go down this
row right there.

134
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:10,020
So it's going to be minus x1
plus y1 times its sub-matrix--

135
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,730
get rid of that row, that
column-- you get b, c, e, f.

136
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:16,420
   

137
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,470
I think you definitely see
where this is going.

138
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:23,950
Plus this coefficient, plus x2
plus y2 times its sub-matrix--

139
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:26,310
get rid of that row, that
column-- a, c, d, f.

140
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:30,610
   

141
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:37,220
And then you have minus this
guy right here, x3 plus y3

142
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,820
times its sub matrix-- get
rid of that column and

143
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,130
row-- a, b, d, e.

144
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:45,370
   

145
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,580
Now what do you have
right here?

146
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,043
This is the determinant of Z.

147
00:07:48,043 --> 00:07:50,700
   

148
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,790
This right here is the
determinant of Z.

149
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,970
This thing right here.

150
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,430
I think you can see immediately
that if you were

151
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,650
to add this to this you would
get this right here, right?

152
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,900
Because you have this
coefficient and this

153
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,670
coefficient on that.

154
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:07,240
If you added them up you would
get minus x1 plus y1.

155
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,080
This guy and this guy
add up to this guy.

156
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,500
And then if I were to do
this guy and this guy,

157
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,020
add up to that guy.

158
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,830
Let me do another one.

159
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,720
And then finally that
term plus that term

160
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,040
add up to that term.

161
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,790
So you immediately see that the
determinant, or hopefully

162
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:29,580
you immediately see, that the
determinant of X plus the

163
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:36,095
determinant of Y is equal
to the determinant of Z.

164
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:41,210
   

165
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,350
So we did it for the 2 by
2 case, we just did it

166
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,470
for the 3 by 3 case.

167
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,670
Might as well do it for
the n by n case so we

168
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,860
know that it works.

169
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,380
But the argument is identical
to this 3 by 3 case.

170
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,760
So that's good to keep in your
mind because 3 by 3 is easy to

171
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,470
visualize, n by n is sometimes
a little bit abstract.

172
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,240
So let me re-define
my matrices again.

173
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,020
I'm just going to do the
same thing over again.

174
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,660
So I'm going to have
a matrix X.

175
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,370
But it's an n by n matrix.

176
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:12,140
   

177
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,330
So let me write it this way.

178
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:20,130
Let's say it is a 1, 1, a 1,
2, all the way to a 1, n.

179
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:24,650
And there's some row here, let's
say that there's some

180
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:29,010
row here on row i-- let's call
this row i right here-- and

181
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:35,220
here it has the terms x1, x2,
all the way to xn, but

182
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,490
everything else is just
the regular a's.

183
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,830
So then you have a-- let
me make this as a21,

184
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,310
all the way to a2n.

185
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:46,710
And then if you went all the way
down here you would have

186
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:51,150
an1, and you'd go all
the way to ann.

187
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,380
So essentially you could imagine
our standard matrix

188
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,360
where everything is defined in
a, but I replaced row i with

189
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,400
certain numbers that are maybe
a little different.

190
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,160
And I think you'll see
where I'm going.

191
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,150
Now let me define
my other matrix.

192
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,810
Let me define matrix Y.

193
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:10,530
Let me define matrix Y to be
essentially the same thing.

194
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,520
This is a11-- it's
the same a11.

195
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,640
This is a12, all
the way to a1n.

196
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,330
This is a21, we could go
all the way to a a2n.

197
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:24,480
And then on row i, the same row,
this is n by n, this is

198
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,950
the same n by n-- if this was
10 by 10, this is 10 by 10.

199
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,680
If this is row seven, then
this is row seven.

200
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,210
It has different terms. It's
identical to matrix X

201
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,445
except for row i.

202
00:10:34,445 --> 00:10:39,890
In row i it is y1, y2,
all the way to yn.

203
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:43,170
And if you keep going down, of
course, you have an1, all the

204
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:46,350
way to ann.

205
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,460
Fair enough.

206
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,860
Now let's say we have
a third matrix.

207
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,140
Let's have a third matrix.

208
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,840
Let me draw it right here.

209
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,190
So you have Z, Z is equal to--
I think you could imagine

210
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,440
where this is going.

211
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,460
Z is identical to these two
guys except for row i.

212
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,160
So let me write that out.

213
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,430
So Z looks like this.

214
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:14,260
You have a11, a12, all
the way to a1n.

215
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,670
And then you go down and then
row i happens to be the sum of

216
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,770
the row i of matrix
X and matrix Y.

217
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:31,510
So it is x1 plus y1, x2 plus y2,
all the way to xn plus yn.

218
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,820
And then it you keep going
down, everything else is

219
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:39,010
identical, an1 all
the way to ann.

220
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:43,450
So all of these matrices are
identical except for row X has

221
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:47,100
a different row i than
matrix Y does.

222
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,810
And row Z is identical
everywhere except its row i is

223
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,995
the sum of this row
i and that row i.

224
00:11:52,995 --> 00:11:55,420
So it's a very particular case,
but we can figure out

225
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,870
their determinants.

226
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,640
So what are the determinants?

227
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:03,360
The determinant of X, the
determinant of matrix X-- and

228
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,860
hopefully you're maybe a bit
comfortable with writing sigma

229
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,110
notation, we did this
in the last matrix.

230
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:15,460
We can go down this row right
there, and for each of these

231
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:19,410
guys we can say so the
determinant is going to be

232
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,135
equal to the sum.

233
00:12:21,135 --> 00:12:24,420
   

234
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:28,930
Let's say we start from j is
equal to 1-- j's going to be

235
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,100
the column, so we're going to
take the sum of each of these

236
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,600
terms from j is equal
to 1 to n.

237
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,620
And then remember our
checkerboard pattern, so we

238
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,130
don't know if this is a
positive or negative.

239
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:45,650
We can figure it out by taking
negative 1 to the i plus j--

240
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:49,350
remember, this is the ith row
that we're talking about--

241
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:59,550
times xj-- xj is the
coefficient, xsubj, times the

242
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,790
sub matrix for xsubj.

243
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,950
So if you get rid of this
guy's row and this guy's

244
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,570
column, what is it
going to be?

245
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:11,020
We could say that that's the
same thing as the sub matrix,

246
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,000
if we called this guy-- let me
write it this way-- if we got

247
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,180
rid of this guy's row and this
guy's column, if we had just

248
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,370
our traditional matrix where
this wasn't replaced.

249
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:25,570
If we just had an ai1 here, ai2,
its sub matrix would be

250
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,580
the same thing, because we're
crossing out this

251
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,330
row and this column.

252
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,360
So it would be all of these
guys and all of

253
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,360
these guys down here.

254
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,180
So it would be the sub matrix--
this is a n minus 1

255
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:42,530
by n minus 1 matrix-- it would
be the sub matrix for aij.

256
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,060
That's for the first term--
sorry, the determinant.

257
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,890
Don't want to lose the
determinant there-- times the

258
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:52,660
determinant of the
sub matrix aij.

259
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,170
And so that's for the first
term, and then you're going to

260
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,520
add it to the second term, and
then you're just going to keep

261
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,030
doing that.

262
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,650
That's what this sigma
notation is.

263
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,890
That's the determinant of X.

264
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:03,930
Now what's the determinant
of Y?

265
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:09,940
The determinant of Y is equal
to the sum-- we could do the

266
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,610
same thing-- j is equal to
1 to n of negative 1

267
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,770
to the i plus j.

268
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:19,710
We're going to go along this row
right here, the ith row.

269
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:22,990
So we're going to have ysubj--
right, we're going to start

270
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,840
with ysub1, then plus ysub2,
times the determinant of its

271
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,640
sub matrix, which is
the same as the

272
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,600
determinant of this sub matrix.

273
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,820
So you get rid of that row and
that column for each of these

274
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,480
guys, that everything else on
the matrix is the same.

275
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,870
So aij.

276
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,840
The matrix of aij.

277
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,040
Now what is the determinant
of Z.

278
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,930
I'm pretty sure you know exactly
where this is going.

279
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,455
The determinant-- this should
be a capital Y right there--

280
00:14:47,455 --> 00:14:52,440
the determinant of Z is equal to
the sum, from j is equal to

281
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,950
1 to n, of negative
1 to the i plus j.

282
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:59,300
We're going along this row.

283
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:06,160
But now the coefficients are xj,
that's what we're indexing

284
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,820
along, xj plus yj.

285
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,890
And then times its sub matrix,
which is the same

286
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,582
as these sub matrices.

287
00:15:13,582 --> 00:15:20,500
So aij, which you might
immediately see is the sum of

288
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,250
these two things.

289
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:25,220
If I, for every j, I just summed
these two things up,

290
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,650
you're having two coefficients--
you could have

291
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:33,590
this coefficient and that
coefficient on your aij term,

292
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,090
and then when you add them up
you can factor this guy out

293
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:39,560
and you will get this
right here.

294
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,730
So you get the determinant of X
plus the determinant of Y is

295
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:46,470
equal to the determinant of Z.

296
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,310
So hopefully that shows
you the general case.

297
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,600
But I want to make it very
clear, this is just for a very

298
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,140
particular scenario where three
matrices are identical,

299
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,790
except for on one row.

300
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:00,450
And one of the matrices on that
special row just happens

301
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:04,600
to be the sum of the other two
matrices for that special row,

302
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,320
and everything else
is identical.

303
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,320
That's the only time where the
determinant of-- not the only

304
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,930
time, but that's the only time
we can make the general

305
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:13,145
statement where the determinant
of Z is equal to

306
00:16:13,145 --> 00:16:15,810
the determinant of X plus
the determinant of Y.

307
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:19,340
It's not the case-- let me write
what is not the case--

308
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:30,390
so not the case that if Z is
equal to X plus Y, it is not

309
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:35,340
the case that the determinant
of Z is necessarily equal to

310
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:43,450
the determinant of X plus
the determinant of Y.

311
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,120
You cannot assume this.

312
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,550
Determinant operations are not
linear on matrix addition.

313
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,740
They're linear only on
particular rows getting at it.

314
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,750
Anyway, hopefully you found
that vaguely useful.
