1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,835
We're once again at the Museum of Modern art in the room of devoted to pop art

2
00:00:06,835 --> 00:00:14,632
and we're standing in front of -- sort of walking around -- the Oldenburg's Floor Cake from 1962.

3
00:00:14,632 --> 00:00:18,944
And both of us are smiling because it's just a hilarious work of art.

4
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:24,262
What's funny to me is that when we get up close it really doesn't look like cake at all.

5
00:00:24,262 --> 00:00:28,330
It looks like, actually, the giant cherry on top looks like a piece of poop.

6
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:34,199
Yeah. In fact, the closer you get to it the less appetizing it becomes. It's this piece of

7
00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:38,583
canvas, it's sort of disgusting and filthy and it's wonderfully not edible.

8
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:41,421
We should just describe it first. It's gigantic.

9
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:42,702
Eight feet long?

10
00:00:42,702 --> 00:00:46,043
A young woman who was just in the gallery a moment ago was walking in the gallery

11
00:00:46,043 --> 00:00:47,843
said that 'I just want to lay down and sleep on it'

12
00:00:47,843 --> 00:00:51,318
because it actually kinda looks like a gigantic bed.

13
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:56,602
It's preposterous to have food this large but it's not just that it's large because in no way is it

14
00:00:56,602 --> 00:01:01,734
an accurate representation of a piece of cake. In fact, it's sort of wonderfully floppy and

15
00:01:01,734 --> 00:01:08,118
the thing that I find incredibly endearing about it is listing to the right. It's this gigantic soft

16
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:09,487
series of pillows.

17
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:16,054
But you know, cake is a floppy thing because the messy, gooey, sensual experience and the squishiness

18
00:01:16,054 --> 00:01:20,559
of this reminds me of digging into the frosting and having it smush down--

19
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:25,629
Right, right, but it's not sensual. It is from a distance and from association it is, definitely, but

20
00:01:25,629 --> 00:01:32,436
as you get close to it it looks dry and it's fabric and it's sort of badly painted fabric

21
00:01:32,436 --> 00:01:37,990
and it's got all these competing associations that're completely at odds with each other.

22
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:44,448
To me it has associations with oversweetness, saccharine and American culture burying itself

23
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:48,057
and sweetness and massproduced food.

24
00:01:48,057 --> 00:01:51,380
It's looking at what we as a culture fetishize, right?

25
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,635
I mean, this is 1962, it's incredibly early. If you think about where pop is at this moment it's just

26
00:01:55,635 --> 00:02:01,508
being born in the US. Warhol is just creating his first soupcans, Lichtenstein is just at the

27
00:02:01,508 --> 00:02:03,500
early stages of his cartoon--

28
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,600
So the pleasures of American consumer culture--

29
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,512
Absolutely.

30
00:02:06,512 --> 00:02:08,601
But it's sort of undermined, really undermined.

31
00:02:08,601 --> 00:02:13,538
Yeah, I think there's a tremendous sense of humor as well. But you're right, the kind of critical aspect

32
00:02:13,538 --> 00:02:17,321
here but not only critical towards American culture but about what our canon should be.

33
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:22,663
There was that great quote. Lichtenstein said that 'by the early 60s, after I've studied expresionism,

34
00:02:22,663 --> 00:02:27,331
you could take a rag that had been soaked in paint and hang it up on the wall and that would be considered

35
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:33,491
art.' So we've definied something that was still difficult. It also raises questions about what representation

36
00:02:33,491 --> 00:02:36,083
is supposed to be and what representation is.

37
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:40,169
If you think about representation as something that traditionally, maybe something out of the

38
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:45,853
nineteenth century, is meant to refer to in some very direct ways, this is sort of against

39
00:02:45,853 --> 00:02:52,832
I mean, it identifies what it is but in so many ways it's at odds with what it's meant to represent.

40
00:02:52,832 --> 00:02:59,279
It is still maintianing essential identity as a slice of cake but when you look at it in any way, other

41
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,415
than that broad identiy, it refuses to be that.

42
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:08,482
But it also remindes me of is the heroic tradition of scultpture. It's not a hard bronze or marble

43
00:03:08,482 --> 00:03:10,532
thing, it's smushy, say.

44
00:03:10,532 --> 00:03:13,785
But not only that, it's not this idealized human body, it's not this body of a god--

45
00:03:13,785 --> 00:03:20,578
Yeah, it's not a heroic, it's the exact opposite, it's the everyday, it's the mundane, it's the lowest.

46
00:03:20,578 --> 00:03:24,028
So it's the lowest brought up to this absurd height.
