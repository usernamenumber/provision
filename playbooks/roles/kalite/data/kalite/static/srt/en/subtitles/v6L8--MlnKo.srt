As a birthday gift, Zoey gave her niece an electronic piggy bank that displays the total amount of money

2
00:00:06,177 --> 00:00:10,031
in the bank as well as the tottal number of coins

3
00:00:10,031 --> 00:00:17,267
After depositing some number of nickels and quarters only so we have only nickels and quarters, the display read.

4
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:20,852
Money $2 Number of coins 16

5
00:00:20,852 --> 99:59:59,999
How many nickels and quarters did Zoey put in the bank

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So lets define some variables here lets let n= the number of nickels and lets let q be

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
= to the number of quarters the number of quarters

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the number of quarters so how many many total coins do well it's gonna be the number of nickels + the number of quarters
