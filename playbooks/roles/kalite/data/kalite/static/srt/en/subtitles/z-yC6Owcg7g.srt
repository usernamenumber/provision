1
00:00:02,595 --> 00:00:05,204
We're in St. Peter's Basilica.

2
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:07,257
Standing right beside baldacchino.

3
00:00:07,303 --> 00:00:14,086
In the crossing. Directly under Michelangelo's dome which is so high. It's breathtaking.

4
00:00:14,086 --> 00:00:17,559
And we're looking past the baldacchino which is actually not easy to do.

5
00:00:17,575 --> 00:00:22,094
Taking an extraordinary... I was about to call it sculpture but it's more than a sculpture.

6
00:00:22,094 --> 00:00:26,029
It's architecture. It's sculpture. It's stained glass.

7
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:27,913
It's the cathedral's patron.

8
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:32,511
The chair is bronze and encases a older wooden chair.

9
00:00:32,511 --> 00:00:36,186
Which is believed by tradition to have belonged to Saint Peter.

10
00:00:36,186 --> 00:00:44,105
It appears to float effortlessly in the air and a kind of canopy held by four church fathers.

11
00:00:44,105 --> 00:00:48,054
And it's not that they are lifting so much is they're restraing the chair.

12
00:00:48,054 --> 00:00:55,308
Right. We seem to be honest being assumed to have it all around pouring from either side of the chair.

13
00:00:55,323 --> 00:01:05,452
Pushing up from below are golden cloudes that raise up the throne and surrond it almost to push it forward in a way to.

14
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,609
It's true. And almost to see down on to our world.

15
00:01:09,671 --> 00:01:13,417
Right. It's kind of pouring into our world. Such a boroque thing.

16
00:01:13,601 --> 00:01:17,822
The spirituals are also clearly represented by this golden raise.

17
00:01:17,884 --> 00:01:21,640
That move much more quiqly out into our space, out into cathedral.

18
00:01:21,655 --> 00:01:23,012
Through the clouds.

19
00:01:23,012 --> 00:01:27,521
Through the clouds and over and pass the plaster. They're actually architecture of the church.

20
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:32,538
And that frame themselves a cloud of angels.

21
00:01:32,538 --> 00:01:42,199
The dance and spin and the intern frame the stained glass, this beautifull stained glass representation of the whole spirit.

22
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:50,351
The dove which is itself the centre-piece and it has the focal point of the entire cathedral.

23
00:01:50,351 --> 00:02:00,194
And the Dove is represented within concentric oval shape. And you get this feeling of raising and moving towards the center of the world.

24
00:02:00,194 --> 00:02:04,973
Well, that's right, it's a kind of almost visual multiplikation and a kind of intensifikation.

25
00:02:04,973 --> 00:02:07,061
Untill we reach the Holly Spirit itself.

26
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:11,994
What always amazes me about Bernini and everything that we've seen in Rome,

27
00:02:11,994 --> 00:02:16,380
is the sway that he is willing to think about architecture in a new way.

28
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,750
And sort of something that is heavy and incloses base.

29
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,647
If you think about the Pantheon 
or just generally what architecture is suppose to do.

30
00:02:23,647 --> 00:02:27,965
He makes architecture into this purest thing almost.

31
00:02:27,965 --> 00:02:30,134
It becomes a playful stage.

32
00:02:30,134 --> 00:02:36,398
It becomes something that can be in some ways overwhelmed by the kind of theatricality.

33
00:02:36,398 --> 00:02:40,108
That he brings to his almost set pieces.

34
00:02:40,108 --> 00:02:47,443
Its like painted centrally using stucco painted with gold on top of marble.

35
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,799
It is an extraordinary mix.

36
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:52,787
You've got the brilliant light of the stained glass window

37
00:02:52,787 --> 00:02:56,004
which actually is illuminated by the sky beyond.

38
00:02:56,004 --> 00:03:00,957
You have the gilded stucco you have the bronze which is in part gilded as well.

39
00:03:00,957 --> 00:03:06,285
You have the marble which can be brilliantly white but also coloured.

40
00:03:06,285 --> 00:03:11,249
And it becomes this kaleidoscope of form and colour and light.

41
00:03:11,249 --> 00:03:14,009
And its dizzying and beautiful.

42
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:17,172
But when I say dizzying I dont want to suggest that it is unfocused.

43
00:03:17,172 --> 00:03:20,385
But its tremendously unified.

44
00:03:20,385 --> 00:03:24,385
And perfect in the scale of it.
