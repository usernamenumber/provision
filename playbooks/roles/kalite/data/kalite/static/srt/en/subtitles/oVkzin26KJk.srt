1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,250
   

2
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:02,270
Welcome back.

3
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:05,390
I will be eating turkey in a
little over an hour, and I

4
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:06,380
want to work up an appetite.

5
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,280
So I will move forward and
continue with the SAT

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,690
problems. Today is Thanksgiving,
by the way.

7
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:16,580
That's why I'm a little extra
excited about the turkey.

8
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,210
Problem number 1.

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,010
Oh, by the way, we're on
page 47, section 9, of

10
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,260
the-- what's it called?

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,210
The official SAT study guide.

12
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:26,770
Problem number 1.

13
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,850
There is the same number of boys
and girls on a school bus

14
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,360
when it departs from school.

15
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,230
So at the beginning,
boys equals girls.

16
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,210
I don't know if this is
going to be useful

17
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,990
for me to write that.

18
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,390
At the first stop, 4 boys
get off the bus

19
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,390
and nobody gets on.

20
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:50,570
So stop one, minus 4 boys.

21
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:54,710
   

22
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:59,030
After the first stop, there
are twice as many girls as

23
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,580
boys on the bus.

24
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:09,450
So now, girls is equal
to 2 times the boys.

25
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,090
How many girls are
there on the bus?

26
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,090
So you could almost do
this by inspection.

27
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:19,920
But what you could say is, well,
here the boys is equal

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,710
to the girls.

29
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,080
Then we subtract 4
from the boys.

30
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,360
So this b is actually
a different b.

31
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,910
This is 2 times the new
one, b minus 4.

32
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,160
Why does that make sense?

33
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,800
   

34
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,320
We start off with b boys.

35
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,400
At the first stop, 4 get off.

36
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,730
So now there are
b minus 4 boys.

37
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:43,440
And at the end, it says that
there are twice as many girls

38
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,470
as there are boys now, and b
minus 4 are the number of boys

39
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,630
there are now.

40
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,275
So now girls is equal to
2 times b minus 4.

41
00:01:50,275 --> 00:01:53,970
But we also know that girls is
equal to this initial b.

42
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,610
So you say b is equal
to 2b minus 8.

43
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,770
I just distributed the 2.

44
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:04,070
And then if we subtract b from
both sides and add 8 to both

45
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,870
sides, you get 8
is equal to b.

46
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,520
And you could have probably
thought about that.

47
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,710
I mean, you didn't have to do
all this fancy algebra.

48
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:15,720
You could have just said, well,
when 4 boys leave, I'm

49
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,610
left with half as many
boys, right?

50
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,290
Because before, I had just
as many girls as boys.

51
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,230
Then 4 leave, and I
have half as many.

52
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,680
Because now the number
of girls is doubled.

53
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,830
So if I have some amount of
something and when 4 leave,

54
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,190
I'm left with half, then we
know we started with 8.

55
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,010
So you could have just done
it without the algebra.

56
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,560
But this is one way you
could make sure you

57
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,590
had the right answer.

58
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,900
But it probably would've taken
you too long, so the best way

59
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,190
might have been just to
do it in your head.

60
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,470
Problem number 2.

61
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,800
And I will do it in magenta.

62
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,260
Which of the following is the
graph of a linear function

63
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,000
with a negative slope and
a positive y-intercept?

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,610
So I'm not even going to
look at their choices.

65
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,160
It'll take me forever
to draw them.

66
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,190
I'm just going to draw my own
graph that describes what

67
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,542
they're saying.

68
00:03:02,542 --> 00:03:03,540
soon.

69
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,560
That's the x and y-axes.

70
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,730
And so they say, graph
of a linear function.

71
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,620
So linear function means it's
going to be a line.

72
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,670
Negative slope.

73
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,880
So negative slope means that it
goes from the top left to

74
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,830
the bottom right.

75
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,970
Because we move to the right.

76
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,040
Negative slope means that the
graph's going to move down.

77
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,750
So it's going to be a negative
inclination.

78
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,570
And a positive y-intercept, so
that means it intersects the

79
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:30,060
y-axis in the positive y area.

80
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,330
So a suitable line would look
something like this.

81
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,770
It would intersect here
and move down.

82
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,020
So it would look like this.

83
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,860
   

84
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,160
And if we look at the choices of
which ones do that, well, D

85
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,230
is the only one that looks
like what I just drew.

86
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,920
So the choice is D.

87
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,940
   

88
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,655
Problem number 3.

89
00:03:50,655 --> 00:03:58,510
   

90
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,690
Refer to the following price
list. So I guess for

91
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,570
problems 3 and 4.

92
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:05,690
So let me draw the price list.
So number of donuts.

93
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,730
   

94
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:09,600
I can never spell donuts.

95
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,500
I always want to write
out dough.

96
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,660
And then it says, total price.

97
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:19,120
   

98
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,570
It says if I get 1 donut, it's
going to cost me $0.40.

99
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:28,990
If I get 6 donuts, a box of 6,
it's going to cost me $1.89.

100
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:35,020
And if I get 12 donuts, it's
going to cost me $3.59.

101
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,330
And the question is-- question
number 3-- of the following,

102
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:43,630
which is the closest
approximation of the cost per

103
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,620
donut when one purchases
a box of 6?

104
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,610
Well, a box of 6 costs $1.89.

105
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:53,410
So it's literally $1.89
divided by 6. $1.89/6.

106
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,510
And you can eyeball that.

107
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:59,760
It's a little over $0.30.

108
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,480
If it was $1.80, it
would be $0.30.

109
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,800
And then you have to have
9 divided by 6.

110
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,050
So it's like 31 and 1/3 cents.

111
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,410
It's approximately $0.31.

112
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,630
And if you look at it, they give
you very rough numbers.

113
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,280
So it's choice B.

114
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,840
And what they wanted you to
do is do this quickly.

115
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,210
They don't want you to actually
divide the numbers.

116
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,330
They want to say, well, $1.89
divided by 6 is roughly $0.30.

117
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,580
You do that problem really,
really fast.

118
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,620
Now, problem number 4, we use
the same price list. What

119
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,870
would be the least amount of
money needed to purchase

120
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:30,340
exactly 21 donuts?

121
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,840
Well, if we want to purchase 21
donuts, we want to get it

122
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,280
in kind of as big chunks
as possible.

123
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,640
So let's see.

124
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:44,340
If we got 12-- exactly
21 donuts.

125
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,200
It could've been tricky.

126
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,960
Maybe 24 donuts would've been
cheaper or something.

127
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,910
But we want exactly 21.

128
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,130
So we want to get one dozen of
this, because this is going to

129
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,450
be a little under $0.30
per donut, right?

130
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,710
Because $3.60 would be $0.30.

131
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,180
And then we want to
get 1 of these.

132
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,000
   

133
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,410
And then we want to
get-- let's see.

134
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,186
6-- that would get us to 18.

135
00:06:04,186 --> 00:06:04,840
you

136
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,260
And then we want to
get 3 of these.

137
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,930
Times 3.

138
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:10,620
So let's see.

139
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:22,220
It would be 3 times $0.40, which
is $1.20, plus $1.89,

140
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,060
plus $3.59.

141
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,440
So 9 plus 9 is 18.

142
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,780
1 plus 2 plus 8 is 11, 16.

143
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,500
And then $6.68.

144
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,500
And that is choice B.

145
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,620
This is for problem number
4, not problem number 3.

146
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,870
Let's move on.

147
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,360
   

148
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,190
And we'll switch colors.

149
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,700
Number 5.

150
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,805
I think I'm going to have
to do some drawing now.

151
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:56,190
The figure above.

152
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,970
Which of the following
is closest to h of 5?

153
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,800
Yeah, I'll have to
draw that one.

154
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,320
So let me draw the
coordinate axes.

155
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,880
That's my x-axis.

156
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,130
This is my y-axis.

157
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:10,560
   

158
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:10,830
Let's see.

159
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:18,380
The graph does something
like this.

160
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,560
Let me draw the markers.

161
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:30,040
So this is 2, 4, 6, and so on.

162
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:35,760
And this is 2, 4,
6, and so on.

163
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:40,600
This is minus 2,
minus 4, so on.

164
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,640
And the graph looks something
like this.

165
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,620
So it's minus 6.

166
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,190
Let me do a different color.

167
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:52,275
So if we start at minus 6,
and then it crosses.

168
00:07:52,275 --> 00:07:57,350
It goes someplace like
there, roughly.

169
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:01,190
Then it dips down to here.

170
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,960
Dips down something like that.

171
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:12,140
And then it does something--
I'm trying to be exact,

172
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,045
because this is actually all
dependent on the graph.

173
00:08:14,045 --> 00:08:16,750
   

174
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,850
It's going to be something
like that.

175
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:23,080
And they want to know, after
I've drawn this graph, they

176
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,610
want to know, what is the
closest to h of 5?

177
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,890
Well, this is h of x.

178
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:31,750
This is 5.

179
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:37,929
So h of 5 is just going to
be this point right here.

180
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:46,020
And if we go to the left, it
looks like right in between 2

181
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,880
and 4, right?

182
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,070
And what's right in
between 2 and 4?

183
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,040
Well, 3.

184
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,580
And it looks even more like that
when you look at it on

185
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,020
the graph they drew.

186
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,310
My graph, you could argue
it's close to 2.

187
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,375
But when you look at the one in
the book, you can see that

188
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:01,020
it's close to 3.

189
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,280
And I have a minute
left, so I will do

190
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,830
that in the next video.

191
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,080
See

192
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,300
