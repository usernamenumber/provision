1
00:00:01,045 --> 00:00:04,481
When you buy a US treasury security, you are essentially giving a loan

2
00:00:04,481 --> 00:00:05,933
to the US Federal Government

3
00:00:05,933 --> 00:00:09,079
This is an example here

4
00:00:09,079 --> 00:00:11,494
I have a US treasure security here

5
00:00:11,494 --> 00:00:17,717
it says that the owner of this piece of paper here will be paid $1000 in one year

6
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:20,550
so, if you buy this from the Treasury, maybe from somewhere else

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,869
let's just say that the government is issuing them right now

8
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:31,231
let's say you buy it for, you buy it for $950 and the government will

9
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:36,061
will give you this security right over here

10
00:00:36,061 --> 00:00:42,562
now fast forward 1 year you're holding this security

11
00:00:42,562 --> 00:00:44,141
and what'll happen?

12
00:00:44,141 --> 00:00:45,488
so you know that stuff is written there

13
00:00:45,488 --> 00:00:46,649
what'll happen a year later?

14
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:49,482
Well it's written on the security and I simplified it just for the example

15
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:53,986
it says the holder of this security will get $1000

16
00:00:53,986 --> 00:01:03,739
so at this point, the US government has to give you $1000

17
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:07,454
so you look at just the money flow, it's pretty clear that you're just lending the money

18
00:01:07,504 --> 00:01:09,126
you give them $950 now, and then a year later, they'll give you $1000

19
00:01:09,126 --> 00:01:17,160
and if you want to put this in terms that you normally associate with borrowing money

20
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,482
in terms of how much interest that you'll get

21
00:01:19,482 --> 00:01:23,733
well, you lent $950 and you got back $1000

22
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:25,400
So, let's think about it this way

23
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,533
Let's get the calculator out

24
00:01:27,533 --> 00:01:45,733
So, 1000 divided by 950 is equal to 1.053, or 105.3% of your money back

25
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:53,933
This is 105.3% of money lent

26
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:57,733
of money given to the government

27
00:01:57,733 --> 00:01:59,000
or another to think about it is

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,800
you got a 5.3% interest or you lent your money out at an annual interest of 5.3%

29
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,733
you got your money back, plus you got 5.3% after one year

30
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:18,067
So, you could imagine, of all sudden many people want to buy this government security.

31
00:02:18,067 --> 00:02:28,267
Now the price goes up, instead of 950 dollars, imagine it is now 980 dollars. What is the implicit yield that

32
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:31,333
the person get on it

33
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,867
we'll get the calculator back on here

34
00:02:32,867 --> 00:02:41,000
so, you paid in 980, instead of 950. Then a year later

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,067
when you get the 1000 dollars back, there'll be 102% of your money

36
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:48,533
So, in that situation there will be 102% of your money

37
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:55,867
so, at the 950 dollar price, you're essentially lending the government money at 5.3%

38
00:02:55,867 --> 00:03:00,933
And 980 dollars, you are lending the government money at 2%.

39
00:03:00,933 --> 00:03:02,667
And I'm doing this just to show you a point

40
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:08,400
When the price of the treasury security goes up, as happened in this case

41
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,867
the yield, or the interest, that you are getting on your loan goes down

42
00:03:11,867 --> 00:03:16,600
in either situation, you're going to get your 1000 dollars back.

43
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,800
if you're lending 950 and get 1000 dollars back, you'll get 5.3 %

44
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:28,533
So this is what people are talking about when they say

45
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:34,267
treasury prices go up, if treasury prices go up

46
00:03:34,267 --> 00:03:36,333
then the yields go down

47
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:40,667
So, there's more demand for the treasury, the interest on the treasury will go down

48
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:45,800
In the next video we'll talk about how this might change for treasuries of different maturity dates
