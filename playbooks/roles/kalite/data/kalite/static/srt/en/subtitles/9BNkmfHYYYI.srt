1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,070
We know the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:09,310
at 400 kilometers above the surface of the Earth where the space station might hang out

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,400
What I want to do in this video is think about

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,820
how fast does the space station need to be moving

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:24,340
in order to stay in orbit, in order to maintain its circular motion around the earth

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,750
So we know from our studies of circular motion so far

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,670
what's keeping it going in circular motion assuming that it has a constant speed

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,570
is some type of centripetal acceleration

9
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,590
And that centripetal acceleration is the acceleration due to gravity

10
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,480
And we figured out what it was at 400 km

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:51,380
So we know that the magnitude of that centripetal acceleration has to be equal to this

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:58,450
speed or the magnitude of the velocity squared divided by r

13
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:01,980
where r is the radius of the circular path

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,520
the radius of the orbit, which would be the radius of Earth plus the altitude

15
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,080
So that we figured out in the last video, is 6771 km

16
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:18,140
Let's just solve this for v. Then we can put in the numbers in our calculator

17
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,230
So you multiply both sides by r and flip the two sides

18
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,610
You get v squared is equal to the magnitude of our acceleration times the radius

19
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:32,660
The magnitude of our velocity or speed is equal to the square root of our acceleration

20
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:37,130
times--or the magnitude for acceleration times the radius

21
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,380
So let's get our calculator out and you can verify that the units work out

22
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,260
This is meters per second squared times meters which is meter squared per second squared

23
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,460
take the sqrt of that, you get meters per second

24
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,370
which is the appropriate units

25
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,240
So let's get our calculator out and actually calculate this

26
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,160
There you go

27
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:02,460
And then we want to calculate the principal square root of

28
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:14,060
the magnitude of acceleration due to gravity at this altitude is 8.69 m/s squared

29
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:21,790
times the radius of our circular path which is the radius of Earth which is 6371 km

30
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:26,820
plus the 400 km of altitude that we have in this scenario

31
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:36,040
So that gives us--we did this in the last video--6.771 times 10^6 m

32
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,320
It's important that everything here is in meters

33
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,750
Our acceleration is in meters per second squared

34
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,610
This right over here is in meters

35
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,700
So the units don't do anything strange

36
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:51,130
And then we get our drumroll for how fast, in meters per second

37
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,570
We get 7670

38
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:03,630
7671, but I'll just stick to three significant digits, 7670 meters per second

39
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,900
Let me write that down

40
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:13,650
The necessary velocity to stay in orbit is 7670 meters per second

41
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,860
Let's just conceptualize that for a second

42
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:24,450
Every second it's going over 7000 m, or every second it's going over 7 km

43
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:30,310
If we assume that's the direction it's traveling, it's going at a super super fast speed

44
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,650
If we want to translate that into kilometers per hour

45
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:39,480
you just take 7670 meters per second

46
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:46,560
and say, there are 3600 seconds per hour

47
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,020
If you multiply that, that's how many meters it will travel in an hour

48
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,820
If you want that in kilometers, you just divide it by 1000

49
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:59,860
You have one kilometer for every 1000 m. Meters will cancel out

50
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,200
Seconds will cancel out. And you're left with kilometers per hour. So let's do that

51
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:14,770
So we multiply our previous answer by 3600 and then divide by 1000

52
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,650
or you just multiply it by 3.6

53
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:26,320
and then we get roughly 27,600 km/h

54
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,280
So this is really an unfathomable speed

55
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:33,370
And you might be wondering, how does such a big thing maintain that type of speed

56
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:41,710
Even a jet plane which is nowhere near this fast has to have huge engines to maintain its speed

57
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,390
how does this thing maintain it?

58
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:51,510
And the difference between this and a jet plane is that a jet, or a car, whatever--

59
00:04:51,510 --> 00:05:00,230
let's focus on a jet plane. A jet plane has to travel through the air

60
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:06,390
It actually uses the air as its propulsion, sucks in the air and spits out the air really fast

61
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,860
But it has all of his air resistance

62
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:15,540
So if the engines were to shut down, all the air would bump into the plane

63
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:19,050
and provide essentially friction to slow down the plane

64
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:23,620
What the space station or the space shuttle or something in space has going for itself

65
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,030
is that it's traveling in an almost complete vacuum

66
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,880
Not 100% complete vacuum, but almost complete vacuum. So it has

67
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:37,530
pretty much no air resistance--negligible air resistance you have to deal with

68
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,960
So we know from Newton's Laws

69
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,340
an object in motion tends to stay in motion. So once this thing gets going

70
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:49,110
it doesn't have air to slow it down, it'll keep staying that speed

71
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:56,930
In fact if you did not have gravity which is causing the centripetal acceleration

72
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:01,440
it would just go in a straight path forever and ever

73
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,260
And that brings up an interesting point because if you are in order like this

74
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,360
traveling at this very very very fast speed

75
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,670
you have to make sure that you don't vary from this speed too much

76
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:16,910
If you slow down, you will slowly spiral into the Earth

77
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:24,810
If you speed up a lot beyond that speed, you will slowly spiral away from the Earth

78
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,700
because then the centripetal acceleration due to gravity

79
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,310
won't be enough to keep you in a perfect circular path

80
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,860
So you really have to stay pretty close to that speed right there
