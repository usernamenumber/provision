99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, if you're watching this video, I'm pretty sure that at some point in your life, or in the lives of

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
someone you know, they've had the flu. almost everybody is pretty familiar with how

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
awful it feels to get sick with the flu. Now, when people talk about the flu, they kind of talk about it in two different ways.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We're gonna get into both of those ways right now. Now, sometimes, they'll talk about the illness,

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or the symptoms they had when they had the flu.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, other times, they'll talk about the virus, you know, the actual virus that causes the flu.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, I'm going to actually break it down the same way.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We're gonna talk first about the illness, and then we're going to get into the virus.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we're gonna draw a nice little line down the middle so that we don't, uh, get lost in this conversation.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, I can't help it, but any time that I hear that someone has the flu, I immediately get into this mode where I have

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a bunch of questions for them, and I really just wanna kinda convince myself that when they say they have the flu,

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they really have the flu, and they don't have something else. So the questions that pop up in my head:

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The first one is usually, is it abrupt, or is did it kind of start abruptly.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm just going to kind of write that. "Was it abrupt?"

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And you know, I might say, "do you remember, uh, feeling well one evening and then waking up sick?" Or something like that.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
"Do you remember exactly, kinda, when it started?" And most people with the flu can tell you within a day or two

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
exactly when their illness started. Now, another clue that something is the flu is that it usually lasts for about 3-7 days.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, if someone is saying, "well, I got sick with the flu and then four months later, you know, I started getting better."

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's a very weird story, usually it would be a lot quicker than that.
