1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,470
   

2
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,330
Let's do a few more examples
of solving equations.

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,000
And I think you're going to
see that these equations

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,640
require a few more steps
than the ones we

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,490
did in the last video.

6
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,420
But the fun thing about these is
that there's more than one

7
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,060
way to do it.

8
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,260
But as long as you do legitimate
steps, as long as

9
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,760
anything you do to the left-hand
side, you also do to

10
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,760
the right-hand side, you should
move in the correct

11
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,100
direction, or you shouldn't
get the wrong answer.

12
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,990
So let's do a couple of these.

13
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:28,870
So the first one says-- I'll
rewrite it-- 1.3 times x minus

14
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:35,280
0.7 times x is equal to 12.

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,080
Well, here the first thing that
my instinct is to do, is

16
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,900
to merge these two terms.
Because I have 1.3 of

17
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,020
something minus 0.7 of
that same something.

18
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,180
This is the same variable.

19
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:50,340
If I have 1.3 apples minus 0.7
apples, well, why don't I

20
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,840
subtract 0.7 from 1.3?

21
00:00:52,840 --> 00:01:01,530
And I will get 1.3 minus 0.7
x's, or apples, or whatever

22
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,610
you want to call them.

23
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,720
So is equal to 12.

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,800
You could imagine that I did
the reverse distributive

25
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,430
property out here.

26
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,080
I factored out an x.

27
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,610
But the way my head thinks about
it is, I have 1.3 of

28
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,180
something minus 0.7 of
something, that's going to be

29
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,240
equal to 1.3 minus 0.7 of those
somethings, that x.

30
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:30,570
And of course 1.3 minus 0.7 is
0.6 times x of my somethings

31
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,750
is equal to 12.

32
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,970
And now, this looks just like
one of the problems we did in

33
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:35,690
the last video.

34
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,450
We have a coefficient times x is
equal to some other number.

35
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,140
Well, let's divide both sides
of this equation by that

36
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,870
coefficient.

37
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,310
Divide both sides by 0.6.

38
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:50,570
   

39
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,970
So the left-hand side will
just become an x.

40
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,700
X is equal to-- and what
is 12 divided by 0.6?

41
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,160
0.6 goes into 12-- let's add
some decimal points here--

42
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,870
that's the same thing
as 6 going into 120.

43
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,320
6 goes into 12.

44
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,630
2 times 2, times 6 is 12.

45
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,280
Subtract, you get a 0.

46
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,570
6 goes into 0 0 times.

47
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,840
So it's going to go 20 times.

48
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,090
12 divided by 0.6 is 20.

49
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,070
And we can verify.

50
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,080
Let's verify this.

51
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,760
1.3, let's substitute it back.

52
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:33,090
1.3 times 20, minus
0.7, times 20.

53
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,110
Let's verify that that
is equal to 12.

54
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,760
So I'll take the calculator out,
just so you don't have to

55
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,590
trust my math.

56
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:46,940
So we have 1.3 times
20 is equal to 26.

57
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,960
So this piece right
here is 26.

58
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,640
And then 0.7 times 20.

59
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,920
I don't need a calculator
for that.

60
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,990
That is 14.

61
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,440
26 minus 14 is 12.

62
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,400
So it checks out.

63
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,590
We got the right answer
for this equation.

64
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,590
x is equal to 20.

65
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,210
Let's do this one right here.

66
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,640
5x minus 3x plus 2
is equal to 1.

67
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,860
This looks very complicated.

68
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,420
And whenever something looks
daunting, just do steps that

69
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,280
look like they're simplifying
the equation.

70
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,610
And over time, as long as you
do legitimate steps, you

71
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,520
should be able to make
some progress.

72
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,530
So the first thing I want to
do, is I want to distribute

73
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,780
this negative 1 over here.

74
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:35,150
So this is the same thing
as 5x minus 3x, minus 2.

75
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:35,390
Right?

76
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,530
I just did the distributive
property on the 3x and the 2.

77
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,960
This is a negative 1
times 3x plus 2.

78
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,270
So it's negative 1 times 3x,
plus negative 1 times 2.

79
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,460
Or negative 3x minus 2.

80
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,440
And that is going to
be equal to 1.

81
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,500
Now, I have 5 of something
minus 3

82
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,720
of that same something.

83
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,490
So that's going to be equal
to 2 of that something.

84
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,080
5x minus 3x is 2x.

85
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,370
5 minus 3 is 2.

86
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:06,570
And then I have the minus
2 is equal to 1.

87
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:10,470
And now, I like to get into the
form where I have 2x, or I

88
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,370
have something times x is
equal to something.

89
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,070
So I want to get rid of
this negative 2 on

90
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,390
the left-hand side.

91
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,880
The best way I know how
to do that is to

92
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,470
add 2 to both sides.

93
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,209
So add a 2 on the
left-hand side.

94
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:21,930
If I do it to the left-hand
side, I've got to do it to the

95
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,440
right-hand side.

96
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,870
Plus 2 on the right-hand side.

97
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,780
These two guys will cancel out,
and you're going to get

98
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:35,910
2x is equal to 1 plus
2, is equal to 3.

99
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:40,550
And now you can divide both
sides by 2, and you get x is

100
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:44,680
equal to 3/2.

101
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,910
And I'll leave it for you to
verify that this is indeed the

102
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:48,900
correct answer.

103
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,040
Let me draw a little line here
so that our work doesn't get

104
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,490
messy, although that might have
made it even messier.

105
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,600
So here we have to
solve for s.

106
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,850
And look, we have a fraction
and 2 s terms.

107
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,030
How do we do that?

108
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,120
Well, just do it the same way.

109
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:08,010
We have 1 times s minus-- you
can view this as 3/8 times s

110
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,500
is equal to 5/6.

111
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,970
You could view this as 1 times
s, minus 3/8 times

112
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,800
s is equal to 5/6.

113
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,920
You could factor out
an s, if you like.

114
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,750
Maybe I'll do it this way.

115
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,680
I'll factor it onto the
left-hand side.

116
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,440
This is the same thing
as s times 1, minus

117
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,520
3/8 is equal to 5/6.

118
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,730
And 1 minus 3/8, what is that?

119
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:34,930
That 1, I can rewrite as 8/8.

120
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,030
That's 1.

121
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:43,980
So this is the same thing as 8/8
minus 3/8 is 5/8, times s.

122
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,680
You could switch the order
of multiplication.

123
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,510
5/8 times s is equal to 5/6.

124
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,020
And you might be able to
go straight from that.

125
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,100
If I have 1 of something minus
3/8 of that something, I have

126
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,980
8/8 of that something minus
3/8 of that something, I'm

127
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,340
going to have 5/8 of
that something.

128
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,450
And now, to solve for s, I can
multiply both sides by the

129
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,120
inverse of this coefficient.

130
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,900
So I multiply 8 over
5 times 5/8s.

131
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,790
If I do it to the left-hand
side, I have to do it to the

132
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,650
right-hand side.

133
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,370
8 over 5.

134
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,100
I multiplied by 8 over 5 so
that those cancel out and

135
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,380
those cancel out.

136
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:23,660
And you are left with s is equal
to-- right, this is just

137
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,750
a 1-- is equal to-- well,
the 5's we can divide.

138
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,910
Divide the numerator and
the denominator by 5.

139
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:34,140
Divide the numerator by 2 and
the denominator by 2.

140
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,890
You're left with-- sorry, divide
the denominator by 2,

141
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,890
you get 6 divided by 2 is 3.

142
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,740
You're left with 4/3.

143
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,860
s is equal to 4/3.

144
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,010
Let's do one more of these.

145
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:53,640
So here I have 5 times q minus
7 over 12 is equal to 2/3.

146
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,570
So let me write this.

147
00:06:54,570 --> 00:07:00,290
And I could rewrite this as just
5 over 12 times q minus 7

148
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,890
is equal to 2/3.

149
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,390
And what I want to do with this
video, is to show you

150
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,330
that I can do it two
different ways.

151
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,210
But as long as I do legitimate
operations, I should get the

152
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,240
same answer.

153
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,670
So the first way I'm going
to do it, is I'm going to

154
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,500
multiply both sides of
this equation by

155
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,040
the inverse of 5/12.

156
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:23,460
So I'm going to multiply both
sides by 12 over 5.

157
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,200
Because I wanted to get
rid of this 5/12 on

158
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,820
the left-hand side.

159
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,510
It makes everything look
a little bit messy.

160
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,470
And I multiply it by 12 over 5,
because these are going to

161
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:30,960
cancel out.

162
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,960
The 5 and the 5 cancel out, the
12 and the 12 cancel out.

163
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,190
So the left-hand side of my
equation becomes q minus 7 is

164
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:41,860
equal to the right-hand
side, 2/3 times 5/12.

165
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,450
If you divide the 12
by 3, you get a 4.

166
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,190
You divide the 3 by
3, you get a 1.

167
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:52,080
So 2 times 4 is 8 over 5.

168
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,960
And now we can add 7 to both
sides of this equation.

169
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,490
So let's add-- I want to do that
in a different color--

170
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:04,340
add 7 to both sides
of this equation.

171
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,880
These two 7's cancel out.

172
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,080
That was the whole point
of adding the 7.

173
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,650
And you are left with q is
equal to 8/5 plus 7.

174
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:22,270
Or we could write 8/5 plus
7 can be written as 35/5.

175
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:26,075
And so this is going to be
equal to 8-- well, the

176
00:08:26,075 --> 00:08:27,720
denominator is 5.

177
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:33,490
8 plus 35 is 43.

178
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:37,990
So my answer, going this way,
is q is equal to 43/5.

179
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,250
And I said I would
do it two ways.

180
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,520
Let's do it another way.

181
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,240
So let me write the
same problem down.

182
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:48,310
So I have 5/12-- actually, let
me just do it a completely

183
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,240
different way.

184
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,890
Let me write it the
way they wrote it.

185
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:58,590
5 times q minus 7, over
12 is equal to 2/3.

186
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,410
Let me just get rid of the 12
first. Let me multiply both

187
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,890
sides of this equation by 12.

188
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,830
I just don't like that 12
sitting there, so I'm going to

189
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:08,530
multiply both sides by 12.

190
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,430
So these are going to cancel
out, and you're going to be

191
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:17,440
left with 5 times q minus 7
is equal to 2/3 times 12.

192
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,020
That's the same thing
as 24 over 3.

193
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,620
So this is, let me write this.

194
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:27,570
2 over 3 times 12 over 1 is
equal to-- if you divide that

195
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,610
by 3, you get a 4, divide
that by 3, you get a

196
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,590
1-- is equal to 8.

197
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,700
So you get 5 times q minus
7 is equal to 8.

198
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,140
And then instead of dividing
both sides by 5, which would

199
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:41,090
get us pretty close to what we
were doing over here, let me

200
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,510
distribute this 5, I just want
to show you, you can do it

201
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,210
multiple legitimate ways.

202
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,830
So 5 times q is 5q.

203
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:53,130
5 times negative 7 is minus, or
negative 35, is equal to 8.

204
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:56,030
5q minus 35 is equal to 8.

205
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,630
Now, if I want to get rid of
that minus 35, or that

206
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,230
negative 35, the best
way to do it is to

207
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:06,750
add 35 to both sides.

208
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,650
I did that so that these cancel
out, and I'm left with

209
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:15,120
5q is equal to 8 plus
35, which is 43.

210
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,110
Now I can multiply both sides of
this equation by 1/5, which

211
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,720
is the same thing as dividing
both sides by 5.

212
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,970
And these cancel out.

213
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:27,340
You get q is equal
to 43 over 5.

214
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,410
So there's a bunch of ways you
can do these problems. But as

215
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,410
long as you do legitimate
steps, you will

216
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:34,150
get the right answer.

217
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:38,140
And I'll leave it to you to
verify that this truly is the

218
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,240
right answer for q.

219
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,310
This is the q that will
satisfy this equation.

220
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,240
Let's do one word
problem here.

221
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,710
Jade is stranded downtown with
only $10 to get home.

222
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:57,880
Taxis cost $0.75 per mile, but
there's an additional $2.35

223
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,380
hire charge.

224
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,080
Write a formula and use it to
calculate how many miles she

225
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,290
can travel with her money.

226
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:05,790
All right.

227
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:10,250
So the total cost of a cab ride
is going to be equal to

228
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:18,960
just the initial hire charge,
which is $2.35, plus the $0.75

229
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:25,010
per mile, times the
number of miles.

230
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:28,780
We're letting m is equal to
the miles she travels.

231
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,030
Miles traveled.

232
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:33,410
   

233
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,710
So this is the equation.

234
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,700
We know that she only
has $10 to get home.

235
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,890
So her cost has to be $10.

236
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:43,210
So we have to say, the
cost has to be $10.

237
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:52,370
So 10 is equal to
2.35 plus 0.75m.

238
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,320
So how do we solve for
m, or the number of

239
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,815
miles Jade can travel?

240
00:11:56,815 --> 00:12:00,150
Well, we can get rid of the 2.35
on this right-hand side

241
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,830
by subtracting that
amount from both

242
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,860
sides of this equation.

243
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,900
So let's do that.

244
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:13,020
So let's subtract minus
2.35 from both sides.

245
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,470
These will cancel out.

246
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,620
That was the point.

247
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:25,880
The left-hand side-- what
is 10 minus 2.35?

248
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,390
Now, these will cancel out.

249
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,040
Now what is 10 minus 2.35?

250
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,070
10 minus 2 is 8.

251
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:37,580
10 minus 2.3 is 7.7.

252
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:41,620
So it's going to be 7.65.

253
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,270
If you want to believe
me, let's do it.

254
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:48,150
10 minus 2.35.

255
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,220
7.65.

256
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:56,220
And that is going to
be equal to 0.75m.

257
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,480
Let me write that in
that same color.

258
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,050
It's nice to see where different
things came from.

259
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,360
0.75m.

260
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,930
I have, like, five shades
of this purple here.

261
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:10,770
so this is that, that is that,
and then these two guys

262
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:11,970
canceled out.

263
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:16,682
Now to solve for m, I can just
divide both sides by 0.75.

264
00:13:16,682 --> 00:13:20,340
So if I divide that side by
0.75, I have to do it to the

265
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,350
left-hand side as well.

266
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,430
0.75.

267
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,990
That cancels out, so on the
right-hand side, I'm left

268
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,380
with just an m.

269
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,540
And on the left-hand side-- I'll
have to get my calculator

270
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:37,350
out for this one-- I have 7.65
divided by 0.75, which is

271
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:42,320
equal to 10.2.

272
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,930
m is 10.2, so Jade can
travel 10.2 miles.

273
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,200
