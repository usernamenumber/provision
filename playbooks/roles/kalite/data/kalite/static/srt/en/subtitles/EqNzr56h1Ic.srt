1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:05,780
So this problem here we're told that the triangle ACE is isosceles

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,790
so that's this big triangle right here

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,720
Its isosceles which means it has two equal sides and we also know

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,460
from isosceles triangles that the base angles must be equal

5
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,930
So this two base angles are going to be equal

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,600
and this side right over here

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,230
is going to be equal in length to this side over here

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,210
We can say AC is going to be equal to CE so we get all of that

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,240
from this first statement right over there

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,450
Then they gave us some more clues or some more information

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,200
They say CG is equal to 24 so this is CG

12
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,070
right over here it has length 24

13
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,830
They tell us BH is equal to DF BH is equal to DF so those two things

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,060
are going to be congruent they're gonna be the same length

15
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,000
Then they tell us that GF is equal to 12

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,980
so this is GF right over here

17
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:57,430
so GF is equal to 12 that distance right over there

18
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,450
And then they finally tell us that FE is equal to 6 so this is FE

19
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:12,750
And then finally they ask us what is the area of CBHFD so CBHFD

20
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,990
so they're asking us for the area they're asking us for the area

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,710
of this part right over here

22
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:24,000
Let me that part and that part right over there that is CBHFD

23
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,740
So let's think about how we can do this

24
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,780
We can figure out the area of the larger triangle and then from

25
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:32,060
that we could subtract the areas of this little pieces at the end

26
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,920
Then we'll be able to figure out this middle area this area

27
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,730
that I've shaded then we don't have

28
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,290
the information yet to solve that

29
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,110
We don't know the height or the altitude of this triangle is

30
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,420
We don't know it's base if we knew its base

31
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,580
We would say hey! one half base times height we'd get the area

32
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,570
of this triangle and then we have to figure out subtract this areas

33
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,340
And we don't have full information there either

34
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,450
We don't know this height once we know that height

35
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,670
then we could figure out this height but we also don't quite yet know

36
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,610
what this length right over here is

37
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,700
So let's just take it piece by piece

38
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,690
So the first thing we might want to do and you might guess

39
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,590
cause we've been talking a lot about similarities

40
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,300
making some type of argument about similarity here

41
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,240
because there's a bunch of similar triangles

42
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:18,170
For example, triangle CGE shares this angle with triangle DFE

43
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,610
They both share this orange angle right here

44
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,260
and they both have this right angle right over here

45
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,190
So, they have two angles in common they're going to be similar

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,950
by angle-angle you can actually show there's should be a third angle

47
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,310
in common because this two are parallel lines

48
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:47,540
So, we can write the triangle CGE is similar to triangle DFE

49
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,930
And we know that by angle-angle

50
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,750
We have one course set of corresponding angles congruent

51
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,580
and then this angle is in both triangle so it is a set

52
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,780
of corresponding congruent angles right over there

53
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,950
And so then once that we know that they're similar,

54
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,970
we can set up the ratio between sides

55
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,250
'Cause we have some information about some of the sides

56
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,710
so we know that the ratio we know that the ratio between DF

57
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,930
and this side right over here which is a corresponding side

58
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:17,820
The ratio between DF and CG so the ratio between DF and CG

59
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:22,940
which is 24 is going to be the same thing as the ratio between FE,

60
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:31,540
FE which is 6 and GE which is not 12 it's 12 plus 6 it is 18

61
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,230
And then let's see 6 over 18 this is just 1 over 3,

62
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:43,020
you get 3 DF is equal to 24

63
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,690
I just cross multiplied or you could multiply both sides by 24

64
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,290
Multiply both sides by 3 you would get this

65
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,470
Actually you could just multiply both sides 24

66
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,150
and then you get 24 times one-third but we'll just do it this way

67
00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:00,320
divide both sides by 3 you get DF, DF is equal to 8

68
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:04,900
So, we found out that DF is equal to 8 that length right over there

69
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,480
And that's useful for us

70
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:13,070
Because we know that this length right over here is also equal to 8

71
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,970
And now what could we do?

72
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,290
Well we can make another seems

73
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,240
like we can make another similarity argument

74
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,910
'cause we have this angle right over here

75
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,080
It is congruent to that angle right over there

76
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,460
And we also have this angle which is going to be 90 degrees

77
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,970
We have a 90-degree angle there and actually said that by itself

78
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,650
is actually enough to say that we have two similar triangles

79
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,920
We don't even have to show that they have a congruent side here

80
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,120
and actually were gonna show this are two congruent triangles

81
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,290
that we're dealing with right over here

82
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,950
So we have two angles and actually we could just go straight to that

83
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,850
'cause when we talk about congruency

84
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,870
if you have an angle that's congruent to another angle,

85
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,420
another angle that's congruent to another angle

86
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,180
and then a side that's congruent to another side you're dealing

87
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,000
with 2 congruent triangles

88
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:02,070
So, we can write triangle right over here I'll write it in pink

89
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,630
Triangle AHB is congruent is congruent to triangle

90
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,260
You wanna get the corresponding vertices right

91
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:18,880
We can read the triangle EFD to triangle EFD and we know that

92
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:25,340
because we angle-angle-side postulate for congruency

93
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,840
And if that two triangles are congruent that makes things convenient

94
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:32,060
that means if this side is 8, that side is 8 we already knew that

95
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,840
That's how we established our congruency but that means

96
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,440
if this side is 6 has length 6

97
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,760
and the corresponding set on this triangle

98
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,530
is also going to have length 6

99
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:45,700
So we can write this length right over here is also going to be 6

100
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:49,120
Now I can imagine, you can imagine where all of this is gonna go

101
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,520
but we want to prove to ourselves

102
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,060
we want know for sure what the areas

103
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,380
We don't want to say "Hey maybe this is the same thing as that"

104
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,120
Let's just actually prove it to ourselves

105
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,830
So how do we figure out we've almost figure out the entire base

106
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,260
of this triangle but we still haven't figure out the length of HG

107
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,630
Well now we can use a similarity argument again

108
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,500
because we can see that

109
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:11,570
triangle ABH is actually similar to triangle ACG

110
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,620
They both have this angle here and then they both have a right angle

111
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:19,100
that one ABH has right angle there ACG

112
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,300
has a right angle right over there

113
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,430
So you have two angles two corresponding

114
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,610
angles are equal to each other

115
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,890
You're now dealing with similar triangles

116
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:33,470
So we know that triangle ABH ill just write it this as AHB

117
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,320
since I already wrote it this way

118
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:41,730
AHB is similar to triangle AGC

119
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,010
You want to make sure you got the vertices in the right order

120
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,930
A is orange angle G is the right angle and C is the unlabeled angle

121
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:56,050
This is similar triangle AGC

122
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,080
Now what that does for is that we could use the ratios to figure out

123
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,500
what HG is equal to so what can we say over here

124
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,280
Well we can say that 8 over 24

125
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:08,260
BH over its corresponding side of the larger triangle

126
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:16,330
So we say 8 over 24 is equal to 6 is equal to 6 over not HG

127
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:22,180
but over AG 6 over AG and I think you can see where this is going

128
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:27,190
You have one-third is equal to 6 over AG

129
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:34,620
or we can cross multiply here and we can get AG is equal to 18

130
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:40,000
So this entire length right over is 18 if AG is 18 and AH is,

131
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,050
then HG is 12

132
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,950
And this is what you might have guessed if you were just trying

133
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,450
to guess the answer right over here

134
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:50,420
But now we have proven to ourselves that this base is has length of

135
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,500
Well we have 18 here

136
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:55,560
and we have another 18 here so has a length of 36

137
00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:01,330
so the entire base here is 36, so that is 36

138
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,650
And so now we can find out the area of this larger

139
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,250
of this entire isosceles triangle

140
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:13,970
So, the area of ACE is going to be equal to one-half times the base

141
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:18,310
which is 36 times 24

142
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:25,570
And so this going to be the same thing as one-half times 36 is 18

143
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:33,250
18 times 24 I'll just do that over here at the top so 18 times 24

144
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:40,250
8 times 4 is 32, one times 4 is 4, plus 3 is 7,

145
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,280
let me put a zero here

146
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:43,290
because we're not dealing math with 2 but 20

147
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:50,310
If 2 times 8 is 16, 2 times one is 2 plus 1 so it's 316

148
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,680
and then you have 2, 7 plus 6 is 13, one plus 3 is 4

149
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:02,120
So the area is ACE is equal to 432 but were not done yet

150
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,340
This area that we that we care about

151
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:09,330
is the area of the entire triangle minus this area

152
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,140
and minus this area right over here

153
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,930
So what is the area what is the area of this each

154
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,710
of this little wedges right over here

155
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,930
So it's going to be one-half times 8 times 6, so one-half times 8,

156
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,400
is 4 times 6

157
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,840
So this is going to be 24 right over there and this is going

158
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,740
to be another 24 right over there

159
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:35,140
So this is going to be equal to 432 minus 24 minus 24, or minus 48

160
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,850
Which is equal to and we could try this to do this on our head

161
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,040
If we subtract 32 we're gonna get to 400

162
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,470
and then were gonna have to subtract another 16

163
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,290
So if you subtract 10 from 400 its 390 so that you get to 300 you get

164
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,960
to 384 whatever they units for this were

165
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,690
If these were in meters and this would be meters squared

166
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,090
If this centimeters this will be in centimeters squared

167
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,170
And did I do that right?

168
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,290
Let me go the other way if I add 8 if I add 40 to this

169
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,700
24 plus another 8 gets me to 432

170
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,400
Yup and were done
