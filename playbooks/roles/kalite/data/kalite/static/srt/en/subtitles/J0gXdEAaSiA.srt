1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,570
   

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,470
Let's try to come up with the
reaction of when we have this

3
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:10,120
molecule right here reacting
with sodium methoxide in a

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,595
methanol solution, or with
methanol as the solvent.

5
00:00:13,595 --> 00:00:17,170
   

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,030
Just so we get a little practice
with naming, let's

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,710
see, this is one, two,
three, four carbons.

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,600
So it has but- as a prefix and
no double bond or triple

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,890
bonds, so it's butane.

10
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,470
And we have a chloro
group here.

11
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:30,990
So if we start numbering
at the side

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,630
closest to it, one, two.

13
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:33,880
So it's 2-chlorobutane.

14
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:39,000
   

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,220
Let's think about what
might happen here.

16
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:47,420
The first thing-- let
me just redraw the

17
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,430
molecule right there.

18
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:52,760
The first thing you need to
realize is this sodium

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,960
methoxide is a salt.

20
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,870
When it's not dissolved,
it's made up of a

21
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,650
positive sodium cation.

22
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:01,660
Let me draw them right here.

23
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:08,580
It's a positive sodium
cation and a

24
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,860
negative methoxide anion.

25
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,060
Let me draw the methoxide
part right here.

26
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,000
   

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,380
It normally would have just
two pairs, but now we have

28
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,360
three pairs here.

29
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,276
The oxygen has an
extra electron.

30
00:01:26,276 --> 00:01:29,380
   

31
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,715
Actually, let me draw
another electron

32
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,450
as the extra electron.

33
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,050
This'll be useful for
our mechanism.

34
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,330
It could be any of them.

35
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,930
The oxygen has an
extra electron.

36
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,320
It has a negative charge.

37
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,720
In solid form, when they're not
dissolved, they had formed

38
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,080
an ionic bond and they form
a crystal-like structure.

39
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,470
It's a salt, but when you
dissolve it in something, in a

40
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:52,130
solution, in this case, we have
methanol as the solution,

41
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,170
they will disassociate
from each other.

42
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,940
And what you have right here is
this methoxide right here.

43
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:02,040
This is a very, very,
very strong base.

44
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:09,729
This right here is
a strong base.

45
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,970
And if you use the Lewis
definition of a base, that

46
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:17,650
means it really, really, really
wants to give away this

47
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,880
electron to something else.

48
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,570
If you use the Bronsted-Lowry
definition, this means that it

49
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:26,900
really, really, really wants
to take a proton off of

50
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,030
something else.

51
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,160
In this situation, that is
exactly what it will do.

52
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:37,440
I'll actually give you the most
likely reaction to occur

53
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,020
here, and we'll talk about other
reactions, and why this

54
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,660
is the most likely reaction
in future videos.

55
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,310
So it wants to nab a proton.

56
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,500
It is a strong base.

57
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,040
It wants to give away
this electron.

58
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:57,590
Let's say that it gives away
this electron to this hydrogen

59
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,880
right over here.

60
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,340
Now, this hydrogen already
had an electron.

61
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:06,780
If it's getting an electron from
the methoxide anion, the

62
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,410
methoxide base, then it can give
away its electron to the

63
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,360
rest of the molecule.

64
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,970
It can give away this electron
to the rest of the molecule.

65
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:19,010
Now, carbon won't need
the electron.

66
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:21,350
Carbon doesn't want to have
a negative charge.

67
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:26,920
Maybe simultaneously that
electron goes to that carbon

68
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,810
right over there.

69
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,900
But once again, this carbon
doesn't want it.

70
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,920
It already has four bonds, but
what we see is we have this

71
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,990
chloro here.

72
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:38,160
This is a highly electronegative
group.

73
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,540
The chlorine is very
electronegative, so the whole

74
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,500
time, the chlorine was already
tugging on this

75
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,200
electron right here.

76
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,310
Now, all of a sudden, it's all
happening simultaneously, when

77
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,680
an electron becomes available
to this carbon, this carbon

78
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,240
doesn't need this electron
anymore.

79
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,630
The chlorine already wanted it,
so now the chlorine can

80
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,700
take the electron.

81
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,550
And just like that, in exactly
one step, let's think about

82
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,080
what happened.

83
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:09,630
If all of these simultaneous
reactions occurred, what are

84
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,280
we left with?

85
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:18,170
Let me redraw my two
chlorobutanes.

86
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,839
I'm going to have to
change it now.

87
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,180
So now, the chlorine
has disappeared.

88
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,000
So we clear it.

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,780
That's disappeared.

90
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,700
The chlorine has now left.

91
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,000
This chlorine is now up here.

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,700
It has left.

93
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,360
It had this electron right over
there, which is right

94
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,450
over there.

95
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,070
The other electron it was paired
with that was forming a

96
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,025
bond with is now also
on the chlorine.

97
00:04:43,025 --> 00:04:46,080
   

98
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,710
It becomes a chloride anion.

99
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,780
Let me draw the rest of
the valence electrons.

100
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,210
One, two, three, four, five,
six, and it has the seventh

101
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,040
one right here.

102
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,670
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, so it now

103
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,370
has a negative charge.

104
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:09,810
This electron up here-- let me
clear this part out as well.

105
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:15,700
   

106
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,590
Now, this electron right here,
this magenta electron, this is

107
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,560
now given to this carbon.

108
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,030
Let me draw it here.

109
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,000
That magenta electron is now
given to that carbon.

110
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,170
And if we look at the other
end, the one that it was

111
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,780
paired with, that it was bonded
with, it still is

112
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,190
bonded with it, so that green
electron is now still on that

113
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,250
carbon and now they
are bonded.

114
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,705
Now, they're forming
a double bond.

115
00:05:36,705 --> 00:05:39,550
   

116
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,190
This all of the sudden has
become an alkene and now the

117
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,960
methoxide took the hydrogen.

118
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,560
   

119
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,810
Let me redraw the methoxide.

120
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,240
   

121
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:59,670
OCH3, the oxygen had one,
two, three, four, five.

122
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:02,190
It had six.

123
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:06,370
Actually, it had seven valence
electrons, one with the carbon

124
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,470
and then all of these
six unpaired ones.

125
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,170
Neutral oxygen has six.

126
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,880
But now it gave one of them
away to a hydrogen.

127
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:21,900
It gave that green electron
there to the hydrogen-- I'll

128
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,240
make this hydrogen the same
color-- to this hydrogen right

129
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,890
over here, so now
this hydrogen is

130
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,350
now bonded with it.

131
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,750
   

132
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,930
So what are we left with?

133
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:38,710
We have a chloride anion,
so this is chloride.

134
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:41,340
   

135
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,200
We now have methanol.

136
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,770
This was a strong base.

137
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,840
Now it has become its
conjugate acid.

138
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:57,900
So now we have methanol, which
is the same as the solvent, so

139
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,660
it's now mixed in.

140
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,720
And now we're left off
with one, two,

141
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,330
three, four, still four.

142
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:12,550
We still have four carbons,
but now it's an alkene.

143
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,400
We have a double bond, so we
could call this but-2-ene, or

144
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,310
sometimes called 2-butene.

145
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,570
Let's think about what
happened here.

146
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,370
It all happened simultaneously.

147
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,920
Both reactants were present.

148
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,750
There was actually only one
step so this is the

149
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,300
rate-determining step.

150
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,610
If we would try to name
it, it would probably

151
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,170
have a 2 in it someplace.

152
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,360
And something got eliminated.

153
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,660
The chloride, or I guess you
could call it the chloro

154
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,120
group, got eliminated.

155
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,610
It left.

156
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,780
It was a leaving group
in this situation.

157
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:51,350
So this was eliminated, and this
type of reaction where

158
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,680
something is eliminated and
both of the reactants are

159
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,110
participating in the
rate-determining step, and we

160
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,640
only had one step here so that
was the rate-determining step,

161
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,400
is called an E2 reaction.

162
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,050
   

163
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,336
And once again, E stands
for elimination.

164
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:12,000
   

165
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,740
And the 2 stands for that both
reactants were involved in the

166
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,790
rate-determining step.

167
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,680
We had one reactant
and two reactants.

168
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,410
They were both involved with
the rate-determining step.

169
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,290
E2, just like Sn2.

170
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,390
It's obviously not the same
reaction, but in Sn2, we had

171
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,290
substitution.

172
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,420
The leaving group left,
nucleophile came.

173
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,360
It was substitution using
a nucleophile so that's

174
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,440
the S and the n.

175
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,309
And then the 2 was we
had both reactants.

176
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,799
It was all happening
simultaneously.

177
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,370
I'll leave you there.

178
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,390
We're going to go into more
detail on the different types

179
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,760
of each reactions, which ones
are favored, and then we'll

180
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,950
talk a little bit about E1.

181
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,820
You could maybe guess what
that's going to be based on

182
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,920
our experience with
Sn2 and Sn1.

183
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,334
