1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,670
So I've got an arbitrary triangle here, we'll call it triangle ABC

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,660
What I wanna do is look at the midpoints of each of the sides of ABC,

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,190
So this is the midpoint of one of the sides of side BC

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,610
Let's call that point D

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,220
Let's call this midpoint E

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,480
And let's call this midpoint right over here F

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,060
And so this is the midpoint,

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,040
we know that the distance from BD

9
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,210
is equal to the distance from D to C

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,240
So this distance is equal to this distance

11
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,670
We know that AE is equal to EC,

12
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,880
So this distance is equal to that distance

13
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,830
And we know that AF is equal to FB,

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,260
so this distance is equal to this distance

15
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,600
Instead of drawing medians going from this midpoints to the vertices,

16
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,110
What I wanna do is I wanna connect

17
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,340
these midpoints and see what happens

18
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,700
So if I connect them I clearly have three points

19
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,490
So if you connect three nonlinear points

20
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,530
like this you will get another triangle,

21
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,210
And this triangle that's formed from the midpoints

22
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,970
of the sides of this larger triangle,

23
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,470
we call this a medial triangle

24
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,960
Medial triangle and that's all nice and cute by itself

25
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,360
But what we're gonna see in this video,

26
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,080
is that the medial triangle actually have some very neat properties

27
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,450
What we're actually going to show is that divides

28
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,500
Any triangle into four smaller triangles

29
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,360
They are congruent to each other

30
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,880
That all four of these triangles are, are identical to each other

31
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:26,910
And they are similar to their larger triangle

32
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,590
And you could think of them

33
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,440
Each has having one fourth of the area of the larger triangle

34
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,250
So let's go about proving it,

35
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,280
So first let's focus on this triangle down here

36
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:40,540
Triangle CDE and it looks it looks similar to the larger triangle

37
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:44,710
The triangle CBA, but let's prove it to ourselves

38
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,900
So one thing we could say is well look

39
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,440
Both of them share this angle right over here,

40
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:53,820
Both the larger triangle, triangle CBA shares has this angle

41
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,790
And the smaller triangle CDE has this angle

42
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,130
So they definitely share that angle

43
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,630
And now let's look at the ratios of the sides,

44
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,750
We know that the ratio of CD

45
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,910
We know that the ratio of CD to CB,

46
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:14,590
the ratio of CD to CB is equal one over two

47
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,290
This is half this entire side is equal to one over two

48
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,990
And that's the same thing as the ratio of CE to CA

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,490
CE is exactly half of CA,

50
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,330
Cause E is the midpoint

51
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,810
It's equal to CE over CA

52
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,310
So we have an angle and corresponding angles that are congruent

53
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,960
And then the ratio of two corresponding sides

54
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,240
of either the side of that angle

55
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,370
Or the same CD or CB as one half

56
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,110
CE or CA as one half

57
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,020
And the angle in between is congruent

58
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:50,690
so by SAS so by SAS similarity,

59
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,420
SAS similarity, similarity

60
00:02:54,430 --> 00:03:03,340
We know we know that triangle CDE, CDE

61
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:12,280
is similar to triangle to triangle CBA, CBA

62
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,050
And just from that you can get some interesting results,

63
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,920
Because we know that the ratio of these

64
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,540
sides of the shorter triangle or the smaller triangle

65
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,340
To the longer triangle is also going to be one half

66
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,320
Cause the other two sides have a ratio of one half

67
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,590
What we are gonna do with similar triangles,

68
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,910
so this is gonna be one half of that

69
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,750
And we know one half of AB

70
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,100
is just going be is just going to be the length of the FA

71
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,860
So we know that this length right over here

72
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,440
Is going to be the same as FA or FB

73
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,220
We can get that straight from similar triangles

74
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,660
Because these are similar,

75
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:49,350
we know that DE, DE over BA over BA

76
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,890
has got to be equal to these ratios,

77
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,160
the other corresponding sides which is equal to one half,

78
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,350
and so that's how we get that right over there

79
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,760
Now let's think about let's think about that this triangle up here

80
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,670
Let's thinks about this triangle up here

81
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,160
Triangle we can call it BDF, triangle BDF

82
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,950
So first when we compare triangle BDF to the larger triangle,

83
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,060
they both share this angle right over here angle ABC,

84
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,690
they both have that angle in common

85
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,760
And we're gonna have exact same argument

86
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:22,150
We can just you can just look at this diagram

87
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,990
You know that the ratio of BA

88
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,560
The ratio let me do it this way

89
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:32,390
The ratio of BF to BA, the ratio BF to BA

90
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:40,700
Is equal to one half, which is also the ratio of BD to BC BD to BC

91
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,710
The ratio of this to that is the same ratio

92
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,140
of this to that which is one half

93
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,820
Cause BD is half of this whole length

94
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,450
BF is half of this whole length

95
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,330
And so you have corresponding sides have the same ratio

96
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,550
On the two triangles and they share and angle in between

97
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,070
So once again by SAS similarity,

98
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,160
by SAS similarity SAS similarity

99
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:09,110
We know that triangle, we know that triangle right this way

100
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:20,400
DBF, triangle DBF is similar to triangle CBA,

101
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:25,000
Is similar to triangle CBA

102
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,860
And once again we use this exact same kind of argument,

103
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,930
that we do with this triangle

104
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,200
Well if it's similar with the ratio to all the corresponding sides

105
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,590
Have to be the same and that ratio is one half

106
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,090
So the ratio of this side to this side

107
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:41,770
So the ratio of FD the ratio of FD to AC has to be one half

108
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,880
or FD has to be one half of AC

109
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:47,200
Which when one half of AC is just the length of AE

110
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,690
So that is just going to be that length right over there

111
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,790
I think you see where this is going

112
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,510
And also, because it's similar

113
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,670
to all of the corresponding angles have to be the same

114
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,300
And we know that this is that, that the larger triangle

115
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,930
has a yellow angle right over there

116
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,840
So we have that yellow angle right over here

117
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:07,610
And this triangle right over was also similar to the larger triangle

118
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,160
So it will have that same angle measure up here,

119
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,740
We are to show that in this in this first part

120
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,300
So now let's go to this third triangle,

121
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,360
I think you see the pattern

122
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,450
I'm sure you might be able to just, pause this video,

123
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,600
And just prove it for yourself

124
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:25,730
But we see that the ratio of AF over AB

125
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,270
Is going the same as the ratio AE over AC

126
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,360
AE over AC which is equal to one half

127
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,650
So we have two corresponding sides with the ratio

128
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,010
is one half from the smaller to the larger triangle

129
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,270
And that they share a common angle

130
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,450
they share this angle in between the two sides

131
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,210
So by SAS similarity so this is getting repetitive now

132
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:56,950
We know that triangle we know that triangle EFA triangle EFA

133
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:03,100
is similar to triangle CBA to triangle CBA

134
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,930
And so the ratio of the corresponding sides it will be one half

135
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:10,310
So the ratio of FB to BC needs to be one half

136
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,180
or FE needs to be half of that

137
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,000
Which is the length of BD

138
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:17,110
So this is going to be that length right over there

139
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,430
And you can also say that since we show all that this triangle

140
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,170
This triangle and this triangle we haven't talked about this middle one yet

141
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,170
They're all similar to the larger triangle,

142
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,110
so they're all going to be similar to each other,

143
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,780
so they're e all going to have the same corresponding angles

144
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,760
So if the larger triangle had this yellow angle,

145
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,550
Then all of the triangle will have this yellow angle right over there

146
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,730
And the larger triangle will have this blue angle right over here

147
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,390
Then the corresponding vertex all of the triangles

148
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,100
were going has that blue angle

149
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,270
All of the ones that we've shown are similar

150
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,620
We haven't thought about this middle triangle just yet

151
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,050
And of course, if this is similar to the whole,

152
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:57,140
it'll also have this angle at this vertex over here

153
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:59,010
because this corresponds to that vertex

154
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,040
based on the similarity

155
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,650
So that's interesting,

156
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,360
Now let's look at the let's look at

157
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,890
Let's compare the triangles to each other

158
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,570
We've now shown that all of these triangles

159
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,720
Have the exact same three sides,

160
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,730
Has this blue side or I should have this one marked side

161
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,570
This two marked sides of this three marked side

162
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,060
One marked two marked three marked,

163
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:23,810
And that even applies to this middle triangle right over here

164
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,200
So by side, side, side,

165
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:33,020
So by side, side, side congruency, congruency

166
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:36,190
We now know and we wanna be careful

167
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,060
when we get our corresponding sides right

168
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:42,450
We now know that triangle, triangle CDE

169
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:50,280
is congruent to triangle D to DBF, DBF

170
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,590
When we look at the corresponding sides,

171
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,320
I'm looking at the colors

172
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,010
I want from the yellow to magenta to blue,

173
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,160
The yellow to magenta to blue

174
00:08:55,170 --> 00:09:03,080
which is going to be congruent to triangle to triangle EFA, EFA

175
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,640
Which is going to be congruent to this triangle and here,

176
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,050
We wanna make sure that we're getting

177
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,830
we're getting the right corresponding sides here

178
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,890
So make sure when we do that,

179
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,630
We just have to think about the angles

180
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,440
So we know, we know this is interesting,

181
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,140
That the ,the because the, the interior angles

182
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,840
of a triangle add up to 180 degrees

183
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,250
We know that this magenta angle plus this blue angle

184
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,530
plus this yellow angle equal a hundred-eighty

185
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,400
Here we have the blue angle and the magenta angle,

186
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,700
And clearly they all add up to 180

187
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,500
You must have the blue angle the blue angle

188
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,730
The blue angle must be right over here

189
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,880
Same argument blue angle as I,

190
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,380
Yellow angle and blue angle

191
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,820
we must have the magenta angle right over here

192
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,050
They add up to 180,

193
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,570
So this must be the magenta angle

194
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,300
And then finally magenta and blue,

195
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,350
This must be the yellow angle right over there

196
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,370
And so when we wrote the congruency here,

197
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,900
we started at CDE

198
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,590
Yellow magenta blue,

199
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,310
So here we're gonna go yellow magenta blue

200
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:05,610
So this is going to be congruent to triangle FED to triangle FED

201
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,790
And so that's pretty cool we just show that all three that this triangle

202
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,690
This triangle this triangle and that triangle are congruent

203
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,950
And also we can look at the corresponding

204
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,930
and that they all have ratios relative to the larger triangle,

205
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,740
They're all similar to the larger triangle the triangle ABC

206
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,460
And that the ratio of between the sides is one to two,

207
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:26,040
And also because we've look at corresponding angles

208
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:28,780
We see for example, we see for example

209
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:32,060
that this angle is the same as that angle

210
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,930
So if you viewed DC if you viewed BC as transversal

211
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:40,550
All of the side becomes pretty clear that FD is going to be parallel to AC

212
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,960
Because the corresponding angles are congruent

213
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:46,830
So this is going to be parallel to that right over there

214
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,070
And you can use that as the same exact argument

215
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,370
to say well then this side

216
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,340
because once again, corresponding angles,

217
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:56,190
corresponding angles here and here

218
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,560
You can say that this is going to be parallel to that right over there

219
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,970
And then finally,

220
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,480
With the same argument over here you have

221
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,510
You have I wanna make sure I get the right corresponding angles

222
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,180
You have this this line and this line

223
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,300
and this angle corresponds to that angle

224
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,270
They are the same

225
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:21,710
So this DE must be parallel to BA to BA

226
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,710
So that's another neat property of this medial triangle

227
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,410
I thought that all of these things just jumped out

228
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,790
When you try to do something fairly simple with the triangle
