1
00:00:07,683 --> 00:00:10,668
Okay Brian and Monica, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art

2
00:00:10,668 --> 00:00:13,133
on a very crowded afternoon

3
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:16,316
standing before one of the heroic vases as you enter into the

4
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:20,483
Greek gallery, this is described as a geometric crater from the 8th century BCE.

5
00:00:20,483 --> 00:00:22,967
Why is it called geometric?

6
00:00:22,967 --> 00:00:25,949
The geometric style is evident on these vases.

7
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:30,283
You can see it in the pattern on the lip up top. You see that meander pattern

8
00:00:30,283 --> 00:00:33,649
and then each individual section is framed, so in a

9
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:36,469
series of rings, almost like Olympic rings

10
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,042
around the outside of the vase,

11
00:00:38,042 --> 00:00:39,100
we see different shapes and patterns, so

12
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,117
lots of geometric pattern.

13
00:00:41,117 --> 00:00:46,716
And even the...there are some huge forms here in animal forms, but they themselves seem to be kind of

14
00:00:46,716 --> 00:00:50,399
reduced to geometric shapes and patterns

15
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,084
Interesting, though we do have figure activity on the vase, so

16
00:00:53,084 --> 00:00:56,850
as I'm told, early geometric vases only had geometric decoration.

17
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:57,467
Right.

18
00:00:57,467 --> 00:00:59,501
So moving now into the next century

19
00:00:59,501 --> 00:01:01,084
we start to see a lot more human activity.

20
00:01:01,084 --> 00:01:02,734
What was this vase used for?

21
00:01:02,734 --> 00:01:05,016
It's a very large vase, so

22
00:01:05,016 --> 00:01:08,133
you can't imagine storing wine or putting olives

23
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:10,185
in this one, right? I mean, how large is it?

24
00:01:10,185 --> 00:01:14,334
It's standing above our heads, but it looks like a...few feet, and we

25
00:01:14,334 --> 00:01:17,284
know about these vases that they weren't actually kept in the home, right?

26
00:01:17,284 --> 00:01:18,532
No, these in fact were

27
00:01:18,532 --> 00:01:23,516
gravemarkers. In fact, the vases have perforations in the bottom

28
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:26,517
and, they would mark graves and libations would be

29
00:01:26,517 --> 00:01:27,700
poured into them, and it would slowly

30
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,900
seep into the ground underneath as a kind of offering

31
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,067
to the dead.

32
00:01:31,067 --> 00:01:32,950
There have been tough shape. Lot's of breaks on them, right?

33
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:36,468
Yes. This is made of terra cotta, baked earth, so

34
00:01:36,468 --> 00:01:38,468
it would break into large chunks, so it wouldn't shatter,

35
00:01:38,468 --> 00:01:39,183
like glass.

36
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:39,767
That's right.

37
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,682
So, many of these are reassembled? Yes.

38
00:01:41,682 --> 00:01:45,250
Okay, so we do have, geometric decoration,

39
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,667
we see it on the foot, and as it moves up, we start to see

40
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:52,450
some figure activity, and this is a new trend in geometric art, right?

41
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:56,018
That's right. And the activity that we see portrayed here

42
00:01:56,018 --> 00:01:59,268
goes right along with the vase's function. It's a funerary

43
00:01:59,268 --> 00:02:03,834
scene that we see here. We can see, there is the deceased

44
00:02:03,834 --> 00:02:06,300
lying on a funeral bier, as it's called. We see mourners

45
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,867
on either side. They've got their, they're tearing at their hair

46
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:12,185
in a traditional Greek gesture of mourning as they're

47
00:02:12,185 --> 00:02:15,265
assembled on either side of that central funerary scene.

48
00:02:15,265 --> 00:02:17,584
What's interesting, you noted the dead lying

49
00:02:17,584 --> 00:02:21,585
horizontally on the funeral bier, not distinguished in any way

50
00:02:21,585 --> 00:02:23,717
from the other figures, they're all exactly the same.

51
00:02:23,717 --> 00:02:24,667
That's right, yeah.

52
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:27,886
So the gesture that they make distinguishes them as

53
00:02:27,886 --> 00:02:30,435
living, whereas the deceased are simply lying there.

54
00:02:30,435 --> 00:02:31,616
Correct.

55
00:02:31,616 --> 00:02:34,768
In an Egyptian context, we would see the dead person

56
00:02:34,768 --> 00:02:38,217
to be celebrated with a lot of imagery, a lot of symbolism.

57
00:02:38,217 --> 00:02:39,918
Here, we don't get much more than the body.

58
00:02:39,918 --> 00:02:42,669
That's correct, and perhaps his family assembled on either side.

59
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:46,052
He's being fanned by these palm fronds as you can see by

60
00:02:46,052 --> 00:02:48,516
figures, to either side.

61
00:02:48,516 --> 00:02:52,017
So, interesting, even in this early period, the Greeks seemed

62
00:02:52,017 --> 00:02:53,184
to be much more about life than death.

63
00:02:53,184 --> 00:02:54,117
It seems that way.

64
00:02:54,117 --> 00:02:57,436
The focus is on the mourners, who are expressing grief,

65
00:02:57,436 --> 00:03:00,035
rather than on what the deceased did for a living or what

66
00:03:00,035 --> 00:03:02,485
status they held, maybe, in an Egyptian context.

67
00:03:02,485 --> 00:03:03,185
Right.

68
00:03:03,185 --> 00:03:05,869
Now, you mentioned before that the body forms are very

69
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:09,550
simplified. But we have no trouble reading the vase. Is that right?

70
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,301
Absolutely, in terms of that procession we see in that lower register

71
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:16,718
we can see...we have no trouble identifying that there are three

72
00:03:16,718 --> 00:03:19,518
horses pulling that chariot even though they share one body.

73
00:03:19,518 --> 00:03:24,200
But we can see that the artist is attempting a kind of, illusion

74
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,950
of depth, by overlapping those figures.

75
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,419
So very different than we would expect in a Grecco-Roman

76
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:31,969
sense, where we would have perspective.

77
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:34,551
Right, in later times, where that would be defined

78
00:03:34,551 --> 00:03:36,302
much more illusionistically.

79
00:03:36,302 --> 00:03:39,134
So very flat. We tend to walk right past these in the

80
00:03:39,134 --> 00:03:42,333
museum, because they feel like they're marking an

81
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:45,598
entrance-way, like Heraldic lions or something.

82
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:47,979
Certainly, this would've had a much more special appeal

83
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:50,740
in Ancient Greece, right. This is not an ordinary object.

84
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,636
Yeah, these have a very specialized function. You can't just

85
00:03:53,636 --> 00:03:57,119
throw a pot like this any day. This is reserved for

86
00:03:57,119 --> 00:04:00,234
wealthy Greeks who can afford this kind of thing

87
00:04:00,234 --> 00:04:02,968
to mark their graves of their beloved deceased.

88
00:04:02,968 --> 00:04:06,268
So, so, rooms and rooms in museums have vases that

89
00:04:06,268 --> 00:04:09,136
probably would have more of a utilitarian function.

90
00:04:09,136 --> 00:04:10,551
For wine and oil and such

91
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:12,751
This one sounds like it's very different.

92
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:17,051
Absolutely.
