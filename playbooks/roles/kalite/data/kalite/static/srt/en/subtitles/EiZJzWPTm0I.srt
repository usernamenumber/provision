1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,570
We're on problem 248, truly the home stretch.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:09,610
Right triangle pqr is to be constructed on the xy plane.

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:14,130
Let me draw an xy plane, that seems like it should be useful.

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:22,060
So that's x, and y -- I'm sorry, that's y and that's x.

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:22,530
Let me label them since I said them wrong.

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:27,000
y and x, that should be second nature to you at this point.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,180
If you start the xy plane so the right angle is at p,

8
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,230
and pr is parallel to the x axis--

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,210
so it's going to look something like that, where

10
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,780
that's p and that's r,parallel to

11
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,810
and p is the right angle, right,

12
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,310
so it's going to look something like that.

13
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,840
So q has to be right below p.

14
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,360
The x- and y-coordinates of p, q, and r

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,390
are to be integers that satisfy the inequality

16
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,280
minus 4 is less than or equal to x

17
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,660
which is less than or equal to 5.

18
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:04,170
And it tells us that 6 is less than or equal to y,

19
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,160
which is less than or equal to 16.

20
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,000
How many different triangles with these properties

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,070
could be constructed?

22
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,180
So let's first draw this range.

23
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:22,500
So x could be between minus 4 and 5.

24
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,720
And x and y are always going to be integers

25
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,000
so that's our boundary. And it could be minus 4 or 5, right?

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:41,170
And then y is between 6 --let's just say this is 6 - and 16.

27
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,520
ok ,So let's think about this.

28
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,290
Let's think about where we can place the point.

29
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,610
So first of all, how many different legitimate places

30
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:54,270
can we put the point p?

31
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,440
Let's just kind of figure out how many different ways

32
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,180
we can construct this thing.

33
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,200
So if we have to pick its x-coordinate,

34
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,960
how many different x-coordinates are valid?

35
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,390
So you have minus 4, minus 3, minus 2, minus 1,

36
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:11,650
0, 1,2, 3, 4, and 5.Right?

37
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,080
They should be -- 5 minus 5, so it should be 9.

38
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,090
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 -- oh actually, no,

39
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,820
it's 10 different points,

40
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,580
because we could include minus 4, right?

41
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:27,410
So it could be -- x could be minus 4, minus 2, 3 -- right,

42
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:35,860
this is minus 3, minus 2, minus 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

43
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:41,000
Right? So this x value can take on any of these 10 spots.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,370
So p can take on 10 different values.

45
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,200
Well, its x-value could take on 10 different values, right?

46
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,390
So p's x can take on 10 different values.

47
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,980
And how many values can its y take over?

48
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,900
Well, this top boundary is 16, this bottom boundary is 6.

49
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,190
And we can be either one, right?

50
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:08,490
So 16 minus 6 would be 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

51
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,350
But we can include 6 as well, right?

52
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,840
If you just said 16 minus 6, that would give you 10 spots,

53
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,550
but since we're including 6, the y could take on 11 spots.

54
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:22,370
You could count them, maybe it'll be beneficial for you

55
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,680
to see all the different y's it could be.

56
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,280
It could be anything between 6 and 16, including 6 and 16.

57
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,690
So there's 11 possibilities for the y.

58
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:36,360
So that means that there are 110 different possible p's.

59
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,620
Let me just draw one of them.

60
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,780
Let's say that's our p.

61
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,630
So our p is there.

62
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:48,500
For any given p, how many different possible r's are there?

63
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,810
Well r is in the same line as p.

64
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:55,050
So whatever p's y value is, r has to be the same.

65
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:59,150
But r could be any of the other leftover x spaces, right?

66
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,720
So if p took up one of them, r could be here,

67
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,320
it could be here, it could be here.

68
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,430
r could be in any of these spots, right?

69
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,290
So how many left over x spots are there?

70
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,030
Well there were 10 x spots, 10 x-coordinates.

71
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,270
p took up one of them.

72
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:24,310
So now r could only be in one of nine x-coordinates.

73
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:29,000
Fair enough. And r is limited to its y.

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,420
Once we pick a y coordinate for p, that's got to be

75
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,490
the same coordinate as r, right?

76
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,370
has to be on the same y-coordinate as p.

77
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,150
Because they told us that this line is parallel to the x-axis

78
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:41,550
Fair enough.

79
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:46,100
So how many possibilities -- once we've picked a p and an r,

80
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,260
how many different possibilities do we have for q?

81
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,450
Well q is going to have the same x value,

82
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,070
because they told us that this is a right angle,

83
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,860
and so this has to be q.

84
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:01,960
So q has to be in the same vertical line as p.

85
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,450
It has to have the same x-value.

86
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,710
And so on how many different y-values can it have?

87
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,680
Well there were a total of -- we said there were originally

88
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,030
11 potential y-values, right?

89
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,310
That's what we said when we picked our p.

90
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,120
p could be anywhere between 6 and 16.

91
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,830
q could be any of those numbers, but it can't be

92
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,150
at the same point as p, right?

93
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,820
This side has to have some length.

94
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:27,490
So if there were 11 original slots, 11 original y slots,

95
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,190
p takes one of them up.

96
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:35,070
So then q could be any of one of 10 y slots.

97
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:39,900
So if we want to know the total number of potential triangles

98
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:46,360
like this, there are 11 potential places to put p.

99
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,940
Once we've put p, there are nine potential places

100
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,370
to put r, and once we've put p,

101
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,670
there's also 10 potential places to put .

102
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:02,490
So this is what, 110 times 90.

103
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:08,540
That's the same thing as 11 times 9 with two 0's, right?

104
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,620
Which is choice c.

105
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,420
And we're onto our last -- I'm glad this a new video,

106
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,460
that took me six minutes.

107
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,080
Problem 249.

108
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,070
Hopefully it won't take you that long on the GMAT.

109
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,640
It takes less time if you don't have to explain it.

110
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,350
If n is a positive integer less than 200 -- so n is

111
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,490
less than 200, it's positive and it's an intiger --

112
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:38,780
and 14 over n -- 14n over 60 is an integer.

113
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,230
So that means that 14n divided by 60 --

114
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,100
or 14 is divisible by 60

115
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,430
then n has how many different prime factors?

116
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:50,280
Let's simplify this first. Divide the top and the bottom by 2

117
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:56,310
You get -- this is also saying that 7n over 30 is an integer.

118
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:03,220
Well multiplying by 7 doesn't make it any easier

119
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,920
to be divisible by 30, right?

120
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,760
Because 7 and 30 share no common factors.

121
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,580
14 and 60 did, 2, but we got rid of it.

122
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:15,000
So we have 7 and 30, so n has to be divisible by 30.

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,380
Right? n has to be divisible by 30 for this to be an integer.

124
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,530
Well, I don't know, let's just pick the smallest one.

125
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,830
I mean, there's a lot of different candidates.

126
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,970
n could be 30, or 60, or 90, or a bunch of different numbers.

127
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,230
But let's just pick n is equal to 30.

128
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,390
They just say that n is less than 200,

129
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,890
so let's just say that n is equal to 30.

130
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,220
If n is equal to 30, then they say,

131
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,100
how many different positive prime factors?

132
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,000
Well let's just do a prime factorization of 30.

133
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,400
2 times 15, which is 3 times 5.

134
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,980
So it has 3 positive prime factors.

135
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,440
So that's choice b. I don't know, I'm just curious.

136
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,060
So let's see if

137
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,110
that would've worked if we picked n equals 60

138
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,140
If you'd have done the prime factorization of 60,

139
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:02,490
you'd have gotten 2 times 30, which is 2 times 15,

140
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,410
which is 3 times 5.

141
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,560
And yeah, you still have only three factors.

142
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,020
You're using one of them twice.

143
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,830
So this is the same thing as 2 squared times 3 times 5.

144
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,270
So you still have actually

145
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,610
three different positive prime factors.

146
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,730
So it would work for any of the multiples of 30.

147
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,340
Anyway, choice c. And we're all done.

148
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,380
I don't know what I'm going to do next,

149
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,640
maybe I'll do some LSAT videos, or maybe I'll get back to

150
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,670
actually teaching something.

151
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,550
Anyway, see you in a future play list.
