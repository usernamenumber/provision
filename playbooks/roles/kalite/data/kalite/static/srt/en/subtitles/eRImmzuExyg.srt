1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,580
   

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:02,880
So what happened in the
previous video?

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,450
We had a nice, simple
neighborhood in 1995.

4
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,390
Everyone prudently bought houses
with 20% down, they

5
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,100
bought it for a $100,000.

6
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,480
And frankly, there were probably
more people who

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,780
wanted to buy houses then but
they couldn't get financing.

8
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,850
And that was in place for a
reason; because you had to

9
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,130
prove yourself worthy to
get the financing.

10
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,510
But anyway, 10 years go by,
financing gets really cheap

11
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,670
because you have this dynamic of
rising home prices; people

12
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,570
downplay risk; people are
willing to give loans to more

13
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:31,150
and more people.

14
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,479
And they kind of do that,
just to keep up

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,180
with the other banks.

16
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,760
And you have in 2005, at kind
of the peak of the bubble,

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,680
someone buys house number one
for $1,000,000, with no money

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,180
down, subprime loan.

19
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,660
And then, a year later, they
foreclose and the house is

20
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,270
auctioned off and it
only gets $300,000.

21
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,510
But between the time that the
house was bought for a million

22
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,590
dollars and auctioned off for
$300,000, let's say that

23
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,250
that's in-- I don't know, let me
do that in year, let me say

24
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,430
this is 2008, now.

25
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:08,620
So 2008, this house get's
foreclosed, and

26
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:12,580
auctioned for $300,000.

27
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,565
And in the meantime, all of
these people-- let's say all

28
00:01:14,565 --> 00:01:17,850
of them-- took $500,000 home
equity loans, right?

29
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,570
So they all have $500,000 of
debt from the home equity

30
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,790
loans, plus whatever they have
left from the original $80,000

31
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,300
loan, so, maybe, $580,000;
if they were only paying

32
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,540
interest. It may be a little
bit less than that.

33
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,940
Let's just say, it's
roughly $500,000.

34
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,900
And at first, maybe in 2008,
they all say, you know what,

35
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,100
this is temporary, that was just
a fire sale price, and

36
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,410
these auctions don't really
reflect a market reality.

37
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,290
So we're just going to sit tight
and wait for our housing

38
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:49,900
prices to go up because this
wasn't a real transaction.

39
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:58,800
But let's say 2009 comes along,
and this individual,

40
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:05,040
house number two's owner either
has to move, has a

41
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,850
different job in a different
city; or maybe they just get

42
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,740
laid off and they can't pay
their mortgage anymore and

43
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,260
they need to sell their house.

44
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,940
Well they try to sell their
house a little bit and it's no

45
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:21,190
coincidence that they
sell for $600,000.

46
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,810
And no one [? call ?]

47
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:22,080
[? line ?]

48
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,060
for awhile, and [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

49
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,410
starting up, because you have
a lot of people trying, at

50
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,720
least, just be made whole on
their loan when they sell

51
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,450
their house.

52
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,750
But no one's buying
their house.

53
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,580
So at some point,
they give up.

54
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,630
They go to the bank and they
say, hey bank, can I do a

55
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,280
short sale where if I sell
it for less, then I

56
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,120
don't owe you any debt.

57
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,900
But the banks are still pretty
confident then, and

58
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,490
they're like, no.

59
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:48,630
A short sale is when you sell
something for less than what

60
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,270
you owe on it.

61
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:55,860
So a short sale would be like
this guy has house number two,

62
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,040
has let's say a $500,000
mortgage.

63
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,630
And if he were to sell his house
for $480,000 and the

64
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:05,470
bank were to agree that $480,000
is all he has to pay

65
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,770
back, then that would
be a short sale.

66
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,000
Right?

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,750
But the bank says, no, you
either sell your house or

68
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,090
we're going to foreclo-- You
either pay us for the debt, or

69
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,020
we're going to foreclose
on you.

70
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,500
So the guy says, sure,
you know what, I

71
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,260
have nothing to lose.

72
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,700
I've just lost my job.

73
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,010
Here are the keys to the
house, foreclose on it.

74
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,220
And so the bank says, OK I
foreclosed on it and the bank

75
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,040
realizes in a few months that
was a bad decision.

76
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,430
Because now, when they auction
the house, they don't get even

77
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,560
$580,000; they don't get
$480,000 for it; they get

78
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,860
$250,000 for it.

79
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,680
And all of this sounds like
a very extreme example.

80
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,550
Things not that different than
what I'm describing happened

81
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,380
in places like Modesto and
Stockton, California, and

82
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,870
parts of Miami and Nevada
and Arizona.

83
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,740
But anyway, so it auctions
off for $250,000.

84
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,310
Now everyone in the neighborhood
gets scared

85
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,160
because this guy, house number
two, made an honest effort to

86
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,820
sell; couldn't sell; tried to do
a short sale; couldn't do a

87
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,510
short sale; and when the bank
auctioned, they actually

88
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,080
auctioned it off for
less than house

89
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,850
number one, it was $250,000.

90
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,100
So now, all these people
say, what am I doing?

91
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:10,510
I'm working three jobs to pay a
$500,000 mortgage on a house

92
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,750
that's probably worth
$250,000.

93
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,630
And if someone really were to be
rational about it, $250,000

94
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,250
isn't some crazy
lowball price.

95
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,660
They paid $100,000 for it.

96
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,390
Maybe, if you adjust that for
GDP growth or inflation, that

97
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:30,020
$100,000 in 2009 dollars might
be $150,000 or $200,000.

98
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,080
So $250,000 actually,
isn't a crazy price.

99
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,670
But anyway, all of these people
said, why do I keep

100
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,470
working so hard, being
an indentured

101
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,370
servant to this mortgage?

102
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,240
I'm just going to give the keys
back to the bank, that's

103
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,160
called: jingle mail.

104
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,790
So you give the keys
back to bank.

105
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,260
Let's say this guy gives the
keys back to this bank.

106
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,240
This bank that thought that they
had made a prudent loan,

107
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,360
this is house number
three, I think.

108
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,790
So they give the keys back
to the bank instead of

109
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,030
paying off the loan.

110
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,820
And this bank says, oh boy,
now I have this house.

111
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,180
They auction it off;
they get $250,000.

112
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,620
So what happened to the bank?

113
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,550
The bank had a $500,000 loan
out, it got $250,000 back.

114
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,960
And also, this person has also
lost all of the equity in

115
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,520
their house that they
originally had.

116
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,520
House number three
lost their house.

117
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,640
So how much wealth is gone
from each person's

118
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,610
perspective?

119
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:26,480
Well the bank had given $500,000
of real capital, real

120
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,950
money that could have been used
to build a factory; to

121
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:36,260
plant some crops; to work on
research and development that

122
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,050
might have developed new
materials or new technologies.

123
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,520
That was real $500,000
of capital.

124
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,050
And now, they got a house and
they auctioned off that house

125
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,725
and they got $250,000.

126
00:05:46,725 --> 00:05:47,850
Right?

127
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:56,640
So they lost $250,000.

128
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,900
And this individual, number
one, what did they lose?

129
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,240
Well, they lost, by entering
into this transaction,

130
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,220
essentially, they lost
whatever equity they

131
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,030
originally had in their house.

132
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,950
And what equity would they
have had in their house?

133
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,630
Well, they had, let's just
say, they had $20,000 of

134
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,520
equity before they did this
transaction, right?

135
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,600
So they lost that $20,000
of equity.

136
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,280
And frankly, they could've
sold that

137
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,320
$100,000 house for $250,000.

138
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,410
We know, even in this quote,
unquote, tough real estate

139
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,680
market, they could have
sold it for $250,000.

140
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,500
So they really had, let's see,
they had an $80,000 loan, a

141
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:38,860
$250,000 asset, so they really
had $250,000 minus $80,000,

142
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,390
that's $170,000.

143
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:44,280
So they really had $170,000 of
lost equity, if I'm doing my

144
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:44,810
math right.

145
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:45,600
But I think you get the point.

146
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,000
So they did build some equity
through housing appreciation,

147
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,365
just the house didn't go from
$100,000 to a $1,000,000, it

148
00:06:51,365 --> 00:06:53,530
went from $100,000
to $250,000.

149
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:59,420
So their equity was actually
$20,000 plus the $150,000 that

150
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,530
they got from just the
increasing asset value-- if

151
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,530
they didn't enter into
this transaction.

152
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:09,000
So they would've had a another
$170,000 of equity that they

153
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,640
lost. So the homeowner
lost $170,000.

154
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,410
So combined, these two parties,
by entering into this

155
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,400
transaction, how much
did they lose?

156
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,320
Let's see, 300,000, they
lost $420,000.

157
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,220
$420,000 was just wiped out.

158
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,710
It just disappeared
from the economy.

159
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,710
And where did it go?

160
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,770
It existed at some point, it
must've gone someplace.

161
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:34,750
Well, it was consumed.

162
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,490
It went into these granite
countertops and these hardwood

163
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,440
floors and the vacation; the
vacation is pure consumption.

164
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,790
You could argue, maybe, some of
it's investment if it helps

165
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,980
you become more productive, but
for the most part, that's

166
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,360
pure consumption.

167
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,780
Things like wood floors and the
two more bathrooms and the

168
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:53,120
granite countertops, there is
some value there, but that

169
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,290
value is definitely not
equivalent to the amount of

170
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,290
money that was spent on them.

171
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:00,720
They were depreciating assets;
they're luxury goods; they're

172
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,310
probably according to
the taste of the

173
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,750
person who did it.

174
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,700
But anyway, the whole point of
this video is, is when you

175
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,620
have these asset bubbles, like
in real estate, and you have

176
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,320
this downplaying of risk, and
this psychology that an asset

177
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,700
class can only go up.

178
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:20,090
And then people start to have an
inflated notion of what the

179
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:22,940
assets are worth, and start to
borrow against those and

180
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,550
leverage up against those
inflated notions, you have to

181
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,290
have a misallocation of wealth
and, essentially, a lot of

182
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:33,429
resources end up getting
destroyed.

183
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,610
Resources that could have built
factories, could have

184
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,490
built schools, could have built
roads, whatever, ended

185
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,799
up building granite countertops
and sending people

186
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:45,770
on vacation and making them feel
good to go start shopping

187
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,500
at Williams-Sonoma or Neiman
Marcus or whatever.

188
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,810
And all of that is, essentially,
just consumption

189
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,430
that just destroys wealth.

190
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,570
So it just disappears.

191
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,790
And I want to make this point
because we have a government

192
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:03,620
now that somehow thinks that
it can legislate away real

193
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,240
wealth destruction.

194
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,600
It thinks that, you know what,
if we just somehow buy this

195
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,890
loan from this bank, this
$500,000 loan, and if we were

196
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:18,110
to hold on to it long enough,
maybe the underlying asset--

197
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,020
the house got foreclosed on, so
we don't even have the loan

198
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,410
anymore, we have the house.

199
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,110
So maybe the government says,
oh what if we just buy this

200
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,170
house and hold it long enough,
maybe it'll get back to a

201
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,280
million dollars.

202
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,580
It may get back to a million, if
our population increases so

203
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,780
much that, one day, that might
become a productive asset

204
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,390
again, or becomes a
high demand asset.

205
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,530
Or, it might not ever go up; it
might be a house that was

206
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,680
built in the middle of nowhere
that's not really useful to

207
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,570
anyone; and, if anything, it's
going to become a place where

208
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,710
squatters start to come and the
whole place turns into an

209
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,530
empty neighborhood.

210
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,480
Who knows?

211
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,560
But the bottom line is the
government somehow thinks that

212
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:00,280
once things get bad, it can
step in and try to not let

213
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,480
people realize that they
have destroyed wealth.

214
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,340
I call that legislating
against reality.

215
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,030
And reality is something it's
very hard to do anything

216
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,550
against, whether you want to
legislate against it, or speak

217
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,430
against it, or perceive a
universe that's not in

218
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,460
accordance with it.

219
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,420
But anyway, this is the
crux of the issue.

220
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,460
But with that said, I don't want
to seem like one of these

221
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,740
defeatist people who says that
there's no solution to the

222
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,310
credit crunch.

223
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:26,020
In particular, this banking
crisis we're

224
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,990
dealing with right now.

225
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:30,340
In the next video, I'll give you
a proposed solution that

226
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,110
was actually suggested
to me by a friend

227
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:32,600
from business school.

228
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,990
And I actually think it makes
a lot of sense, if you think

229
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,620
that the credit freeze
that's going on is

230
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,540
the crux of the issue.
