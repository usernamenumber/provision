1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,030
We're on problem 161.

3
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:07,190
The positive integer n
is divisible by 25.

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:15,040
If the square root of n is
greater than 25, which of the

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,150
following could be the value
of n divided by 25?

6
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,650
So what could be a valid value
for n divided by 25?

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,130
So let's see if we can
manipulate this a little bit.

8
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:28,990
If we square both sides, we get
n, right-- the square of

9
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:34,270
the square root of n is n--
is greater than 625.

10
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:40,090
And then if we divide both sides
by 25, we get n/25 is

11
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,440
greater than 25.

12
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:47,970
So a valid value for n/25 has
to be greater than 25.

13
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,100
If we look at all the choices,
there's only one value that's

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:56,690
greater than 25, and
that's E, 26.

15
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,280
Problem 162.

16
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,600
It looks they want to make
sure we know how

17
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,300
to deal with fractions.

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:11,510
1 over 1 plus 1 over
2 plus 1/3.

19
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,770
Let's just drive through
this math.

20
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:19,080
That equals 1 over 1 plus 1
over-- let's see, 2 is the

21
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:26,630
same thing as 6/3 right--
6/3 plus 1/3 is 7/3.

22
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:30,806
So this is equal to 1 over 1
plus-- 1 over 7/3 is the same

23
00:01:30,806 --> 00:01:37,810
thing as 3/7-- so that's equal
to 1 over 7/7 plus

24
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:41,170
3/7, so it's 10/7.

25
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:46,000
Which is equal to 7/10,
which is choice B.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,500
   

27
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,030
Let's switch colors.

28
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,670
163.

29
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:58,880
A fruit salad mixture consists
of apples, peaches, and grapes

30
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,880
in the ratio-- so the so the
apples to peaches to grapes--

31
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,729
is equal to 6 to 5 to 2,
respectively by weight.

32
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:13,740
If 39 pounds of the mixture is
prepared, the mixture includes

33
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,760
how many more pounds of
apples than grapes?

34
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,850
So they want to figure out the
apples minus the grapes.

35
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,410
OK, so they tell us that the
apples plus the peaches plus

36
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,560
the grapes is equal
to 39 pounds.

37
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,360
When you're dealing with a
ratio, it's useful to say well

38
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,495
each of these is going to be
equal to, I guess you'd call

39
00:02:33,495 --> 00:02:36,950
it their ratio number times
some number, right?

40
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,850
Let me explain what
I'm saying.

41
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,420
Let's just say that apples
are equal to 6 times

42
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,250
some number x, right?

43
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,930
Well if apples are equal to 6
times some number x, then

44
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,370
peaches are going to
be equal to 5 times

45
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,140
that number x, right?

46
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,380
Because the ratio of the apples
to the peaches is a 6

47
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,430
to 5, right?

48
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,070
So if you did 6x over 5x,
you'd get 6 to 5.

49
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:03,940
And by the same logic, then the
grapes would be 2 times

50
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,110
that same number x.

51
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,780
And all the ratios
would work out.

52
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,570
So we can substitute all of
these back into that equation.

53
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:17,780
And you get 6x plus 5x plus
2x is equal to 39.

54
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,850
6 plus 5 is 11, plus 2--

55
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,230
Well

56
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,860
actually I have a phone call
that I was expecting.

57
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,110
So let me continue this
in the next video.

58
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,180
