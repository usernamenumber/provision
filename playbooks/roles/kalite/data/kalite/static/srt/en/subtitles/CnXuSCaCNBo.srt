1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,382
We're here at Stanford Medical School with 4th-year medical student Morgan Keyes and Dr. Charles Prober.

2
00:00:08,382 --> 00:00:11,355
MK: Okay, Dr. Prober, what are we going to talk about today?

3
00:00:11,355 --> 00:00:16,556
Dr: So Morgan, I thought we'd talk about Bacterial Meningitis in children.

4
00:00:16,556 --> 00:00:18,599
MK: Okay.

5
00:00:18,599 --> 00:00:22,965
Dr: And what I'd look to do in reflecting on bacterial meningitis (BC) is...

6
00:00:22,965 --> 00:00:29,559
...go back to the lessons we learned in the prudent prescribing of antibiotics.

7
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:32,763
Dr: a former video, a prior video.

8
00:00:32,763 --> 00:00:38,940
Dr: One of the things that was mentioned as a general principle in that particular video

9
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:46,138
was trying to understand where the site of infection is in a child,

10
00:00:46,138 --> 00:00:51,061
in order to pick the right antibiotic and the right management.

11
00:00:51,061 --> 00:00:55,658
Dr: So in this case, since I'm referring to BC, the question might be:

12
00:00:55,658 --> 00:00:59,838
What would make you think that a child has BC?

13
00:00:59,838 --> 00:01:04,993
That is, what are the signs and symptoms of BC?

14
00:01:04,993 --> 00:01:10,333
Student: So this is thinking about the site, knowing that there is an infection in the

15
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:14,652
cerebrospinal fluid (CBF), or fluid around the brain and spinal cord, you have to look at that

16
00:01:14,652 --> 00:01:17,346
in a variety of ways as a doctor?

17
00:01:17,346 --> 00:01:22,315
Dr: Exactly. One of the things that will make a physician suspicious that there might be

18
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:26,541
an infection in the CBF or in the central nervous system (CNS),

19
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:30,906
is that a child might not be behaving normally,

20
00:01:30,906 --> 00:01:34,018
that is, they might have an altered state of consciousness.

21
00:01:34,018 --> 00:01:40,519
E.g., they might be very, very sleepy; or, they might be very irritable

22
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:49,900
Student: So the signs are irritability and/or sleepiness (lethargic),

23
00:01:49,900 --> 00:02:05,365
maybe even in a coma, which would be more advanced in the infection.

24
00:02:05,365 --> 00:02:12,563
Dr: And then the child would almost invariably have that fever associated with this illness.

25
00:02:12,563 --> 00:02:18,507
And, on the examination, when the physician examines the child,

26
00:02:18,507 --> 00:02:22,362
they might detect what are called "meningeal signs".

27
00:02:22,362 --> 00:02:31,696
And those meningeal signs include a stiff neck, especially if the child is over 1 or 2 years of age,

28
00:02:31,696 --> 00:02:35,040
Student: And how can you tell if someone has a stiff neck?

29
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,476
Dr: What a physician will often due is hold the child behind the head and try

30
00:02:38,476 --> 00:02:45,117
try to flex the head on the neck, and stiff would be literally that:

31
00:02:45,117 --> 00:02:50,365
the child's neck would not bend when the head is elevated from the bed.

32
00:02:50,365 --> 00:02:54,869
Student: Wow, so it's literally where it stays linear, you can't curve it well.

33
00:02:54,869 --> 00:03:00,814
Dr; Exactly. The other meningeal signs that may be present in addition to the stiff neck are

34
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:03,972
the child may have some seizures, abnormal movements.

35
00:03:03,972 --> 00:03:11,077
The child might also assume an abnormal posture, a stiffening of the body.

36
00:03:11,077 --> 00:03:14,560
So, not just the neck being stiff, but the rest of the body being stiff as well.

37
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:21,944
And on examination of the neurologic system, the nervous system,

38
00:03:21,944 --> 00:03:28,306
the child might have "focal signs," that is, asymmetry between the two sides of the body.

39
00:03:28,306 --> 00:03:32,532
Student: Oh, and what kinds of things would you see that are assymetrical?

40
00:03:32,532 --> 00:03:36,247
Dr: It could be that one side of the body is weaker than the other,

41
00:03:36,247 --> 00:03:41,681
It could be that one of the body has different reflexes than the other side.

42
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:48,600
These are all signs and symptoms which may be associated with BM,

43
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:54,034
which would make the physician suspicious of the diagnosis of meningitis.

44
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:58,353
Student: Okay, so we talked about some of the things you look for as a doctor. Now,

45
00:03:58,353 --> 00:04:01,697
going back a minute, you said something about BM, does that assume that there

46
00:04:01,697 --> 00:04:04,762
are other types of meningitis that we are not addressing in this lecture?

47
00:04:04,762 --> 00:04:09,313
Dr: That is a very important point. So, I am focusing on BM,

48
00:04:09,313 --> 00:04:16,000
there are other types of organisms, non-bacteria, that can cause meningitis,

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,344
and the most prominent of those other organisms are viruses.

50
00:04:19,344 --> 00:04:25,845
So you can have a viral meningitis, sometimes referred to as aseptic meningitis.

51
00:04:25,845 --> 00:04:32,718
And that in fact is more common that bacterial meningitis, so it is very important to consider.

52
00:04:32,718 --> 00:04:38,895
There are also some parasites that can cause meningitis, and some fungi.

53
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:52,084
The fungi and parasites are uncommon, but they may occur in abnormal immune systems

54
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:57,842
Viral meningitis on the other hand is quite common.

55
00:04:57,842 --> 00:05:02,115
But for today I am focusing on bacterial meningitis.

56
00:05:02,115 --> 00:05:07,502
So you suspect the infection may be present based on those signs and symptoms.

57
00:05:07,502 --> 00:05:14,561
To prove, to determine whether meningitis is present,

58
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:18,276
a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination [must take place],

59
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:27,007
and CSF is acquired by doing a lumbar puncture,

60
00:05:27,007 --> 00:05:40,846
putting a needle in the back to obtain fluid.

61
00:05:40,846 --> 00:05:45,722
Student: Is that also what a spinal tap is?

62
00:05:45,722 --> 00:05:48,137
Dr: That is also called a spinal tap

63
00:05:48,137 --> 00:05:55,521
When that is obtained, using a needle into the lumbar area,

64
00:05:55,521 --> 00:06:02,626
a fluid is then sent to the lab, where the fluid will be examined in different ways

65
00:06:02,626 --> 00:06:08,385
One is to look under the microscope and determine if there is an abnormal number

66
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:11,078
of white blood cells present.

67
00:06:11,078 --> 00:06:13,493
Student: So abnormal meaning high or low?

68
00:06:13,493 --> 00:06:16,140
Dr: Meaning just high, actually.

69
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,112
The normal number of white blood cells in the CSF is 0.

70
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:23,803
So, high is something greater than 0. And with BM, it tends to be quite high.

71
00:06:23,803 --> 00:06:27,889
generally 1,000-2,000/mL.

72
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:46,233
Glucose is also measured, and with BM the glucose tends to be low

73
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:48,648
less than 40.

74
00:06:48,648 --> 00:06:51,341
Student: Why would it be low?

75
00:06:51,341 --> 00:06:55,150
Dr: It's low because with meningitis you have an abnormal penetrability,

76
00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:01,930
or lack of penetrability of the meninges, which are the covers of the brain,

77
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:07,921
reducing the amount of glucose that is transported into the spinal fluid.

78
00:07:07,921 --> 00:07:12,239
Dr: And then most importantly, the fluid is examined with something called the Gram stain,

79
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:22,642
a special kind of stain. A Gram stain can determine if bacteria are present.

80
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:27,704
Student: So you're actually staining the bacteria.

81
00:07:27,704 --> 00:07:33,091
Dr: Exactly. And if sufficient bacteria are present the Gram stain will reveal those.

82
00:07:33,091 --> 00:07:42,518
And so, with BM, the 2nd prudent principle is to know the pathogen.

83
00:07:42,518 --> 00:07:46,187
So, if a spinal fluid is obtained, there is lots of white cells, your glucose is low,

84
00:07:46,187 --> 00:07:52,178
even with a negative Gram stain, one can guess the usual pathogens,

85
00:07:52,178 --> 00:07:55,150
because the list is short in normal children.

86
00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:02,859
And those bacteria, the short list, includes "Haemophilus influenzae" tybe B,

87
00:08:02,859 --> 00:08:13,679
2nd, the Pneumococcus.

88
00:08:13,679 --> 00:08:18,881
Student: That's funny, it sounds like it causes pneumonia.

89
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:21,342
Dr: It does cause pneumonia, indeed.

90
00:08:21,342 --> 00:08:28,819
3rd: Meningicoccus.

91
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:35,088
Dr: Those are the prominent bacteria in normal children with BM.

92
00:08:35,088 --> 00:08:44,190
The reason we're not seeing as much BM in 2011 as we were seeing 10 or 20 years ago,

93
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:49,345
is we now have vaccination against each of those three pathogens.

94
00:08:49,345 --> 00:08:51,667
Student: We do?

95
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:57,844
Dr: We do. We vaccinate against "H. Influ. B" starting at two months of age

96
00:08:57,844 --> 00:09:04,067
and by the time the child is about 1.5yrs, they're completely protected against that bacteria

97
00:09:04,067 --> 00:09:08,757
The Pneumo we also vaccinate against and it's very successful at reducing

98
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:14,237
the frequency of pneumococcal meningitis--also given at 2 months of age.

99
00:09:14,237 --> 00:09:24,547
And Meningicoccus, the vaccination is relatively new and used in children who are older

100
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:26,683
They're now 2yrs of age.

101
00:09:26,683 --> 00:09:34,485
So, we still can and do see cases of meningicoccal meningitis as it occurs

102
00:09:34,485 --> 00:09:37,921
in children under the age of 2.

103
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:43,216
Those are the usual pathogens. In other parts of the world that don't use vaccines,

104
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:47,674
those are the pathogens that will be prominent in causing BM.

105
00:09:47,674 --> 00:09:52,689
And knowing those pathogens, we go to the 3rd Principle of antibiotic prescribing,

106
00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:59,516
which is knowing antibiotic would potentially kill those bacteria.

107
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:04,671
Student: Okay, so what should I call that category?

108
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:10,197
Dr: Pathogen sensitivity, knowing which antibody would work against the likely bug.

109
00:10:10,197 --> 00:10:17,953
Student: That, you were mentioning in your last lecture,

110
00:10:17,953 --> 00:10:23,711
that varies by the location in the body, and the location in the world, where you're using it.

111
00:10:23,711 --> 00:10:30,213
Dr: It varies by the location of the world, but not by part of the body.

112
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:36,761
And, fortunately, for the treatment of BM, to cover all three of the bacteria,

113
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:42,241
two antibiotics cover all three of them, and I'll just mention the names as I end this.

114
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:52,922
One antibiotic is Cefotaxin, and a reasonable facsimile is Ceftriaxone.

115
00:10:52,922 --> 00:11:06,993
And because some of the Pneumo are resistant to Beta-lactam drugs,

116
00:11:06,993 --> 00:11:14,516
Vancomycin is also used for suspected BM.

117
00:11:14,516 --> 00:11:23,851
Student: Okay, so we use Vancomycin if we think you have a bug that is resistant to other drugs?

118
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:26,080
Dr: Exactly.

119
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:31,467
Student: And there is a type of lab test you could do to find that out?

120
00:11:31,467 --> 00:11:35,693
Dr: Exactly. So those are the Principles of antibiotic prescribing, in terms of

121
00:11:35,693 --> 00:11:39,362
diagnosis of BM. 1) Knowing site of infection

122
00:11:39,362 --> 00:11:43,356
2) What the pathogens are, and 3) knowing what antibiotic would work.

123
00:11:43,356 --> 00:11:52,365
Student: My last question, just because we learned about a tight barrier between

124
00:11:52,365 --> 00:12:01,049
the blood and the CSF, are these antibiotics listed here able to cross the barrier?

125
00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:06,343
Dr: An extraordinarily important question, which is another principle:

126
00:12:06,343 --> 00:12:11,823
You have to make sure that they can be delivered to the suspected site of infection.

127
00:12:11,823 --> 99:59:59,999
For those antibiotics, the answer is, "Yes."
