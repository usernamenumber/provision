1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:00,766
In the last video

2
00:00:00,766 --> 00:00:02,438
we introduced ourselves

3
00:00:02,438 --> 00:00:03,692
to the law of supply

4
00:00:03,692 --> 00:00:05,968
and it was a fairly common sense idea

5
00:00:05,968 --> 00:00:07,379
that if we hold all else equal,

6
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:10,147
that if the price of something goes up,

7
00:00:10,147 --> 00:00:11,308
there's more incentive

8
00:00:11,308 --> 00:00:13,119
for more producers to produce it,

9
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:14,933
or a given producer to produce more of it.

10
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:15,433
And we saw that.

11
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:17,461
As the price goes up,

12
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:19,621
we moved along the supply curve,

13
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:22,133
and the quantity produced went up.

14
00:00:22,133 --> 00:00:23,164
Now what I want to talk about

15
00:00:23,164 --> 00:00:24,189
in this video

16
00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:25,797
is all the things we held equal

17
00:00:25,797 --> 00:00:26,800
in the last video.

18
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,770
And the first of these,

19
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:29,700
I'll call this

20
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,615
the "price of inputs."

21
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:34,075
Or, another way to think about it

22
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:35,782
is the "cost of production."

23
00:00:35,782 --> 00:00:37,965
So if the price of inputs,

24
00:00:37,965 --> 00:00:39,729
maybe the price of labor,

25
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:40,677
the people who would have to

26
00:00:40,677 --> 00:00:41,563
pick the grapes,

27
00:00:41,563 --> 00:00:42,323
or our fuel

28
00:00:42,323 --> 00:00:43,606
that we need to transport

29
00:00:43,606 --> 00:00:45,012
the grapes, or the land,

30
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:46,605
if any of that increased,

31
00:00:46,605 --> 00:00:48,460
then at a given price point,

32
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,435
we would make less money.

33
00:00:49,435 --> 00:00:50,457
There's less incentive

34
00:00:50,457 --> 00:00:51,386
for us to do it,

35
00:00:51,386 --> 00:00:52,731
especially if this is true .

36
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:54,729
only for grapes

37
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:55,533
Maybe we'll say,

38
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:57,098
"Okay, if it's now more expensive

39
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,214
to get grape seeds,

40
00:00:58,214 --> 00:01:00,116
maybe I'll start planting something else,

41
00:01:00,116 --> 00:01:01,200
because I'm not getting

42
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,467
as much profit per pound of grape."

43
00:01:03,467 --> 00:01:05,550
So if the price of my inputs,

44
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:10,333
or if the size of my costs go up,

45
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,587
at any given price point,

46
00:01:11,587 --> 00:01:13,475
I'd want to produce less.

47
00:01:13,475 --> 00:01:16,835
So if the price of inputs go up,

48
00:01:16,835 --> 00:01:21,757
my supply would go down.

49
00:01:21,757 --> 00:01:23,754
So, this becomes...

50
00:01:23,754 --> 00:01:25,240
at this price point,

51
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,216
I'd make less money,

52
00:01:26,216 --> 00:01:27,562
so I would produce less,

53
00:01:27,562 --> 00:01:29,745
or maybe I would produce other things.

54
00:01:29,745 --> 00:01:33,507
So I would shift the whole supply curve

55
00:01:33,507 --> 00:01:37,222
would shift to the left.

56
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,219
And also, even the minimum price

57
00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:40,798
I would need to supply any of it

58
00:01:40,798 --> 00:01:41,587
would also go up

59
00:01:41,587 --> 00:01:42,748
when you shift the curve to the left,

60
00:01:42,748 --> 00:01:44,234
because now, all of a sudden,

61
00:01:44,234 --> 00:01:45,785
it costs me more to produce

62
00:01:45,785 --> 00:01:47,485
even that first unit.

63
00:01:47,485 --> 00:01:50,829
And, likewise, if my price of my inputs went down,

64
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:52,176
now, all of a sudden,

65
00:01:52,176 --> 00:01:53,244
at any given price point,

66
00:01:53,244 --> 00:01:53,942
producing grapes

67
00:01:53,942 --> 00:01:55,397
would become more profitable

68
00:01:55,397 --> 00:01:56,587
and I would have more incentive

69
00:01:56,587 --> 00:01:58,166
to maybe produce grapes

70
00:01:58,166 --> 00:01:59,095
relative to other things

71
00:01:59,095 --> 00:02:00,070
and use more land

72
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,160
for grapes than other things

73
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,710
and then you would have

74
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,922
the whole curve shift to the right.

75
00:02:05,922 --> 00:02:10,785
Now let's think about related goods.

76
00:02:10,785 --> 00:02:12,518
So what happens

77
00:02:12,518 --> 00:02:14,476
with the price of related goods?

78
00:02:14,507 --> 00:02:17,046
And when we think about this,

79
00:02:17,046 --> 00:02:18,309
we don't want to think of it

80
00:02:18,324 --> 00:02:19,840
from a demand point of view,

81
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,922
because we're talking about supply.

82
00:02:20,922 --> 00:02:21,651
You want to think about it

83
00:02:21,651 --> 00:02:22,797
from the producer's point of view

84
00:02:22,797 --> 00:02:25,549
So when we think about related goods here,

85
00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:26,600
we want to think about

86
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,794
substitutes for production.

87
00:02:27,794 --> 00:02:29,235
So, maybe I'm a farmer,

88
00:02:29,235 --> 00:02:31,232
and I know very little bit about farming,

89
00:02:31,232 --> 00:02:32,006
so I don't even know

90
00:02:32,006 --> 00:02:32,795
if this is possible,

91
00:02:32,795 --> 00:02:33,879
but maybe on my land,

92
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:34,900
I'm saying,

93
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,572
"Well, some of my land is going to be for grapes,

94
00:02:36,572 --> 00:02:39,498
and some of it is going to be for blueberries."

95
00:02:39,498 --> 00:02:40,891
And so what would happen

96
00:02:40,891 --> 00:02:43,910
if the price of a related good

97
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,000
-- in particular, blueberries --

98
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,814
what would happen

99
00:02:45,814 --> 00:02:48,925
if the price of blueberries went up?

100
00:02:48,925 --> 00:02:52,176
Well, if the price of blueberries went up,

101
00:02:52,176 --> 00:02:53,244
then I would say,

102
00:02:53,244 --> 00:02:53,894
"Wow, you know,

103
00:02:53,894 --> 00:02:55,289
maybe I can do better with blueberries,"

104
00:02:55,289 --> 00:02:56,299
and I would allocate

105
00:02:56,299 --> 00:02:57,645
more of my land

106
00:02:57,645 --> 00:02:59,235
to blueberries than to grapes.

107
00:02:59,235 --> 00:03:00,582
And so, once again,

108
00:03:00,582 --> 00:03:02,161
if the price of related goods...

109
00:03:02,161 --> 00:03:04,749
well, it depends which related goods...

110
00:03:04,749 --> 00:03:08,244
but if the price of productive substitutes,

111
00:03:08,244 --> 00:03:16,541
so the price of other things I could produce...

112
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,841
if the price of other things

113
00:03:17,841 --> 00:03:19,143
I can produce

114
00:03:19,143 --> 00:03:22,731
goes up,

115
00:03:22,777 --> 00:03:24,979
then my supply of grapes, once again,

116
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:26,588
my supply of grapes would go down.

117
00:03:26,588 --> 00:03:28,263
And the important thing is

118
00:03:28,263 --> 00:03:29,551
is in any of these circumstances,

119
00:03:29,597 --> 00:03:31,235
literally just think it through.

120
00:03:31,235 --> 00:03:31,816
Do not just look at

121
00:03:31,816 --> 00:03:32,746
what I'm writing here

122
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:35,599
and try to memorize it in some way, shape, or form.

123
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,519
This is really just a way

124
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,595
to think about things.

125
00:03:38,595 --> 00:03:40,187
"Hey, obviously, if I can make

126
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:41,870
more money off of blueberries,

127
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,970
now, all of a sudden,

128
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,084
I'm going to allocate more of my land

129
00:03:44,084 --> 00:03:45,754
to blueberries than to grapes."

130
00:03:45,754 --> 00:03:48,133
Supply of grapes will go down.

131
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:48,833
Now let's think about

132
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:53,825
what happens with the number of suppliers.

133
00:03:53,825 --> 00:03:56,050
"Number of Suppliers."

134
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,888
And this one is...

135
00:03:57,888 --> 00:03:59,200
this is pretty common sense:

136
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,763
the more people that are supplying,

137
00:04:00,763 --> 00:04:03,467
the higher the supply would be.

138
00:04:03,467 --> 00:04:06,248
So if the number of suppliers goes up...

139
00:04:06,248 --> 00:04:08,668
and now, this is a curve,

140
00:04:08,668 --> 00:04:09,924
maybe, for the aggregate supply.

141
00:04:09,924 --> 00:04:11,733
So if the number of suppliers goes up,

142
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:14,235
then the aggregate supply would go up

143
00:04:14,235 --> 00:04:15,907
at any given price point.

144
00:04:15,907 --> 00:04:17,904
If the number of suplliers were to go down,

145
00:04:17,904 --> 00:04:20,180
then the aggregate supply would go down

146
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,147
at any given price point.

147
00:04:22,147 --> 00:04:23,800
So this one, hopefully, is somewhat obvious.

148
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,208
Then we can think about things like technology.

149
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,235
And, so, this is, just...

150
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:30,257
maybe there's some innovation,

151
00:04:30,257 --> 00:04:32,579
some new type of seed that,

152
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:34,299
with the same amount of work,

153
00:04:34,299 --> 00:04:35,739
the same amount of land,

154
00:04:35,739 --> 00:04:37,502
can produce that many more grapes.

155
00:04:37,502 --> 00:04:42,071
So if we have technological improvements,

156
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:43,818
(I'm assuming we're not going to go

157
00:04:43,818 --> 00:04:44,839
in some type of dark ages)

158
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:47,670
if we have technological improvements,

159
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:53,802
that will also make the supply go up.

160
00:04:53,802 --> 00:04:55,845
You can also think about it as:

161
00:04:55,845 --> 00:04:56,979
it might make it cheaper to produce,

162
00:04:56,979 --> 00:04:58,818
so it's kind of the same thing here.

163
00:04:58,818 --> 00:04:59,839
The price of inputs might go down,

164
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,254
so that would make your supply go up.

165
00:05:02,254 --> 00:05:02,990
Or, you could just say,

166
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,766
"Hey, look. There's just going to be more grapes

167
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:06,969
popping off of these new types of vines that we got

168
00:05:06,969 --> 00:05:10,008
so we're just going to produce more grapes."

169
00:05:10,008 --> 00:05:11,133
And then the last one I'll cover,

170
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:12,225
and it's a little bit strange

171
00:05:12,225 --> 00:05:13,314
in the grape analogy,

172
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:16,366
is the "expected future prices."

173
00:05:16,418 --> 00:05:22,777
So the expected future prices

174
00:05:22,777 --> 00:05:23,954
-- price expectations.

175
00:05:23,954 --> 00:05:26,200
And let's go away from the grapes,

176
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,133
because grapes are perishable goods,

177
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:29,200
they go bad.

178
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,038
It's not like you can save goods

179
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:33,250
to use them later.

180
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,598
But let's say you are an oil producer.

181
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:36,098
And oil is something that

182
00:05:36,098 --> 00:05:39,081
you can store and you can use it later.

183
00:05:39,081 --> 00:05:44,422
If you expected oil prices to be neutral today,

184
00:05:44,422 --> 00:05:46,093
and then, tomorrow,

185
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:48,090
all of a sudden, you are sure that

186
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,109
oil prices are going to go up in the future,

187
00:05:51,109 --> 00:05:52,781
you're sure that a year from now,

188
00:05:52,781 --> 00:05:54,685
oil prices are just going to go through the roof,

189
00:05:54,685 --> 00:05:55,600
what's your incentive?

190
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,100
Well, you should hoard all of your oil.

191
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,055
Do not sell it today,

192
00:05:59,055 --> 00:06:01,094
and wait to sell it in the future,

193
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,200
if you're sure

194
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,133
that's what's going to happen.

195
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:04,400
So if you expect...

196
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,518
if there's a change ..

197
00:06:06,518 --> 00:06:08,431
in expected future prices.

198
00:06:08,431 --> 00:06:11,088
so, if you go from neutral

199
00:06:11,088 --> 00:06:15,125
to expecting prices go up in the future,

200
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,864
then you're going to hoard your goods.

201
00:06:17,864 --> 00:06:18,871
You can't hoard grapes,

202
00:06:18,871 --> 00:06:20,306
because the grapes will just go bad.

203
00:06:20,306 --> 00:06:20,960
You might be able to,

204
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,460
I don't know,

205
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,576
turn them into wine or something.

206
00:06:22,576 --> 00:06:25,876
But if we're talking about something like oil,

207
00:06:25,876 --> 00:06:26,376
you would say,

208
00:06:26,376 --> 00:06:28,300
"Hey, why should I pump all of the fixed amount of oil

209
00:06:28,315 --> 00:06:30,027
in the ground today

210
00:06:30,027 --> 00:06:31,400
to sell it at today's lower prices.

211
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,190
I'm going to lower the supply today

212
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,038
so I can sell it in the future."

213
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:39,546
So if the expected future prices

214
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:43,342
go from "neutral" to...

215
00:06:43,342 --> 00:06:45,351
you expect future prices to go up dramatically,

216
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:46,883
then current supply,

217
00:06:46,883 --> 00:06:48,044
-- and that's..

218
00:06:48,044 --> 00:06:49,316
. I'm just going to emphasize

219
00:06:49,316 --> 00:06:50,733
by writing the word "current" --

220
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:53,436
current supply will go down

221
00:06:53,436 --> 00:06:53,936
so you can hoard it

222
00:06:53,936 --> 00:06:56,357
to sell it in the future.
