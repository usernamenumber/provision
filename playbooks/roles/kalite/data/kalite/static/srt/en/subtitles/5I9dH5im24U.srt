1
00:00:00,071 --> 00:00:03,098
In the last video we talked about how humans over time

2
00:00:03,098 --> 00:00:08,237
have been getting better and better, getting more Calories out of a given unit of land.

3
00:00:08,237 --> 00:00:11,238
And one thing I want to emphasize, in the last video

4
00:00:11,238 --> 00:00:13,649
these numbers that I came up with, I picked these numbers

5
00:00:13,649 --> 00:00:17,157
to make the map fairly simple and to give you a general idea,

6
00:00:17,157 --> 00:00:22,234
I don't want you to think that what a square kilometre

7
00:00:22,234 --> 00:00:25,744
can support today is exactly 1,000 people.

8
00:00:25,744 --> 00:00:28,420
It depends hugely on what the land is like,

9
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,902
how much of the land you're actually using for agriculture,

10
00:00:30,902 --> 00:00:34,048
what crops you're planting etc. etc. ..

11
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,742
how the people are living, how many Calories they need ...

12
00:00:36,742 --> 00:00:40,407
the whole point of the last video was just to give you a framework

13
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:45,301
that, wow, there is this upper bound based on how much productivity you actually get from the land.

14
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:47,402
Now, what we want to think about in this video

15
00:00:47,402 --> 00:00:50,736
that was kind of the last video with this axes right here

16
00:00:50,736 --> 00:00:52,483
gettin more and more out of the land,

17
00:00:52,483 --> 00:00:54,413
but what I want to think about in this video,

18
00:00:54,413 --> 00:00:56,442
is how did humans through different technologies,

19
00:00:56,442 --> 00:01:01,821
how do we get by doing less and less of the labout for getting those Calories out of the land.

20
00:01:01,821 --> 00:01:05,162
Obviously, you just don't have land and things spontaneously grow

21
00:01:05,162 --> 00:01:06,750
like I guess would happen in the wild,

22
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,766
but if you're doing agriculture, you need to put some energy into the land,

23
00:01:09,766 --> 00:01:11,689
you've got to work the land.

24
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:14,149
And so what we have over here in this chart,

25
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:18,489
and this chart is derived from inforamtion from this book right over here,

26
00:01:18,489 --> 00:01:24,032
this is Energy And Society, and what we want to think about here

27
00:01:24,032 --> 00:01:28,406
is the different ways that humans have gone about to till soil.

28
00:01:28,406 --> 00:01:30,988
So not if you're going to think about the total process

29
00:01:30,988 --> 00:01:33,526
or the total energy required to grow a certain crop,

30
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:38,713
what we're just going to focus is one step of the agricultureal process

31
00:01:38,713 --> 00:01:40,398
and that is tilling the soil.

32
00:01:40,398 --> 00:01:43,993
And, in case you're like me, and you have never worked on a farm,

33
00:01:43,993 --> 00:01:48,240
that's one thing that I would like to change one day, actually go through that process,

34
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,237
but tilling the soil is kind of turnig it up

35
00:01:51,237 --> 00:01:54,402
so you get the nutrients from the bottom layers to the surface,

36
00:01:54,402 --> 00:01:58,407
you dig, you bury all of the remains from the last harvest,

37
00:01:58,407 --> 00:02:03,241
you bury all of the weeds so that they die

38
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:05,366
and you also kind of get air in the soil

39
00:02:05,366 --> 00:02:10,486
what is does is it essentially prepares the soil for the next agricultural cycle.

40
00:02:10,486 --> 00:02:14,634
So it's a process that humans have been doing since antiquity.

41
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,815
And what I want to do in this video is to think about the different ways to do it

42
00:02:17,815 --> 00:02:20,401
and how much energy is required to do it.

43
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:22,371
And we're going to think about the enrgy in two ways,

44
00:02:22,371 --> 00:02:24,013
how much of that energy comes from humans,

45
00:02:24,013 --> 00:02:27,570
and how much of that energy comes from things other than humans.

46
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,111
So just as an example. When we talk about human power,

47
00:02:31,111 --> 00:02:35,069
we're talking about someone literally hand-ploughing the field.

48
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:38,503
So this woman right over here is literally, she has a sort of cart

49
00:02:38,503 --> 00:02:40,231
that's digging up the soil behind her.

50
00:02:40,231 --> 00:02:45,520
When we talk about the oxen power, we're talking about the oxen doing most of the work.

51
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,702
They're the ones dragging this plough which is digging up all of the soil

52
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:51,907
and this gentleman has to kind of be there to supervise.

53
00:02:51,907 --> 00:02:57,984
But this still is fairly an intense labour that this gentleman is doing right over here.

54
00:02:57,984 --> 00:03:01,971
And when we talk about the tractors, we're talking about a scenario like this,

55
00:03:01,971 --> 00:03:05,400
where the tractor is doing most of the work of actually digging up,

56
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,808
dragging this plough behind it and digging up all of the soil.

57
00:03:08,808 --> 00:03:13,169
And from this book right over here, that's where we've got these numbers from,

58
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:14,859
I'll tell you which numbers I've got from them

59
00:03:14,859 --> 00:03:17,426
and which numbers I kind of reason through

60
00:03:17,426 --> 00:03:20,566
because I wasn't fully comfortable with the numbers they had.

61
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:23,735
But these are their numbers. That if your human power

62
00:03:23,735 --> 00:03:28,706
to till 1 hectar of soil will take 400 hours.

63
00:03:28,706 --> 00:03:34,079
Oxen power, this should be a pair, not pari, a pair of oxen, 65 hours.

64
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:36,317
6-HP tractor 25 hours.

65
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:39,157
50-HP tractor 4 hours.

66
00:03:39,157 --> 00:03:42,406
And in case you are wondering what is a hectare of soil,

67
00:03:42,406 --> 00:03:46,496
it is literally a plot of land, a hectare of soil,

68
00:03:46,496 --> 00:03:51,250
a hectare of land I should say,

69
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:56,902
is a plot of land that is 100 m by 100 m

70
00:03:56,902 --> 00:04:02,654
and it's roughly equal to 2.5 acres, not exactly 2.5 acres,

71
00:04:02,654 --> 00:04:08,816
it's like 2.47... something, but roughly 2.5 acres.

72
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:13,738
When you think about how many hours to essentially dig up all of the soil

73
00:04:13,738 --> 00:04:16,909
for a plot of land 100 by 100 metres.

74
00:04:16,909 --> 00:04:20,580
So what we have over here, so clearly human takes a lot longer,

75
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,236
oxen make it a little bit faster,

76
00:04:22,236 --> 00:04:28,071
6-HP tractor even faster, 50-HP tractor, very powerful tractor, even faster than that.

77
00:04:28,071 --> 00:04:33,321
Now, this column right over here is the amount of energy

78
00:04:33,321 --> 00:04:38,404
required to actually produce and maintain the machinery used.

79
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:43,033
So this is a very unintuitive thing. For example, whenever you think about

80
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:46,734
the amount of energy to plough this land over here,

81
00:04:46,734 --> 00:04:50,829
you tend to think: ok, this individual is going to expend a lot of her energy,

82
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:54,703
you don't think about the amount of energy required to actually maintain the tool,

83
00:04:54,703 --> 00:04:59,773
to build the tool that she is using, in this case a hand plough,

84
00:04:59,773 --> 00:05:02,193
and then to maintain that as she does it.

85
00:05:02,193 --> 00:05:06,747
And so this estimate, I've got these two from these fellows right over here,

86
00:05:06,747 --> 00:05:09,323
they're actually more and there might be a gal?,

87
00:05:09,323 --> 00:05:15,306
but it's about 6,000 kilocalories, and this is kilocalories for lower case c.

88
00:05:15,306 --> 00:05:17,166
And one thing I wanna emphasize here,

89
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:25,076
1 kcal is equal to 1 Calorie with a capital C

90
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:31,227
which is the same thing as 1,000 calories with a lower case c.

91
00:05:31,227 --> 00:05:33,058
We talked about this in the last video,

92
00:05:33,058 --> 00:05:35,989
but when people talk about food calories

93
00:05:35,989 --> 00:05:39,006
they are really talking about the Calorie with the capital C

94
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,558
or you can say they talk about kilocalories.

95
00:05:41,558 --> 00:05:45,134
So your candy bar, 200 Calories, they are talking about this right over here,

96
00:05:45,134 --> 00:05:49,813
in Chemistry class you talk abou the amount of energy to rise a gramme of water 1Â°C,

97
00:05:49,813 --> 00:05:52,333
you're talking about these calories here.

98
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,991
So all of these numbers in this chart right over here,

99
00:05:54,991 --> 00:05:59,562
you can either use them with this unit, kcal, kilocalories,

100
00:05:59,562 --> 00:06:04,142
or Calories with the capital C, they're essentialy the same units that we used in the last video,

101
00:06:04,142 --> 00:06:09,012
and these are the same numbers that you are used to from a kind of a dietary calorie point of view.

102
00:06:09,012 --> 00:06:17,083
So for example, 6,000 Calories, that's about how much a typical male would expand in 3 days,

103
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:22,289
so this is to maintain it over the course of these 400 hours in the case of the hand plough,

104
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:29,720
and the total amount of Calories that were needed to make the plough,

105
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,988
devided by the total number of hours.

106
00:06:31,988 --> 00:06:34,835
So whatever fraction of the plough's live is being used here,

107
00:06:34,835 --> 00:06:38,400
you used that fraction right over here to put this 6,000 Calories.

108
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,730
But needless to say, for at least the plough, for the kind of the ...

109
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:47,387
either the human or the oxen scenario, this isn't a significant amount of the total Calories.

110
00:06:47,387 --> 00:06:50,998
So obviously, if you are doing either with human power or oxen power,

111
00:06:50,998 --> 00:06:54,074
you are not usin any gasoline, you are not using any petroleum,

112
00:06:54,074 --> 00:06:56,229
in all of these scenarios we're going to assume,

113
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:59,031
that someone has 10 working hours in the day.

114
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:05,160
And that right over here this is kind of a measure of how hard that person's work is.

115
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,317
I kind of estimated these numbers here,

116
00:07:07,317 --> 00:07:11,419
they are slightly different than what the original numbers were in this book right over here.

117
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:16,631
But they are saying: look, if you are actually walking along using this hand plough,

118
00:07:16,631 --> 00:07:20,150
that is actually very vigorous activity.

119
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:26,569
It is going to require about 400 Calories per hour to do this type of activity,

120
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:30,902
you do it over 10 hours, it's going to require 4,000 Calories

121
00:07:30,902 --> 00:07:35,672
just to do it over 10 hours, and then we are assuming that the rest of the day

122
00:07:35,672 --> 00:07:39,328
you are going to walk around, maybe you cook dinner, eath breakfast, sleep some of it,

123
00:07:39,328 --> 00:07:44,653
we are assuming the other 14 hours of the day are going to be about 100 Calories per hour,

124
00:07:44,653 --> 00:07:48,716
and so this is the total if someone were to using this techique

125
00:07:48,716 --> 00:07:53,403
work for a total of 10 hours, this is how many Calories they would consume in the day.

126
00:07:53,403 --> 00:07:55,652
You can see this is the most labour-intensive,

127
00:07:55,652 --> 00:07:58,914
so it looks like that they would consume the most Calories per day,

128
00:07:58,914 --> 00:08:02,481
these two are the least labour-intensive, you are sitting on the tractor,

129
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:05,656
although that still requires more Calories than sleeping or watching TV,

130
00:08:05,656 --> 00:08:08,493
and so that is the number of Calories they would consume.

131
00:08:08,493 --> 00:08:12,812
Now this right over here, this is the interesting number, or one of the really interesting numbers,

132
00:08:12,812 --> 00:08:19,395
based on all of these assumptions, this is the total human input in Calories to do this task,

133
00:08:19,395 --> 00:08:22,281
to till this 1 hectare of soil.

134
00:08:22,281 --> 00:08:26,095
So over here, you are using 5,400 Calories a day,

135
00:08:26,095 --> 00:08:30,466
it you are working 10 hours per day and it requires 400 working hours,

136
00:08:30,466 --> 00:08:33,831
you are going to be working 40 days, right, 400 divided by 10,

137
00:08:33,831 --> 00:08:39,319
40 days times 5,400 Calories per day, it is going to take a human,

138
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:45,826
just the human part, not even thinking about the 6,000 Calories necessary to maintain and make that plough,

139
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:54,461
the human is going to expend 216,000 Calories to till, to plough that 1 hectare of land.

140
00:08:54,461 --> 00:08:57,826
And if you add the other 6,000 into for the actual plough,

141
00:08:57,826 --> 00:08:59,822
and you can debate what this number should be,

142
00:08:59,822 --> 00:09:01,842
because it is not a significant number compared to this,

143
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:05,133
you get about 222,000 total Calories.

144
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:09,165
When you go to the oxen situation requiring fewer hours

145
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:14,119
and each hour requires fewer ... a little less Calories,

146
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:19,829
this is still labour-intensive, but not as labour-intensive as what this women right over here is doing.

147
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:23,335
So at daily base is she using a little bit fewer Calories,

148
00:09:23,335 --> 00:09:28,078
but since you are only doing 6.5 days of this, 65 hours divided by 10,

149
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:33,044
you have significantly reduced the number of Calories, the total number of Calories

150
00:09:33,044 --> 00:09:36,492
that the human need to put into this task.

151
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,970
Now, there still is other energy being done.

152
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,169
Now all of a sudden the oxen have got involved.

153
00:09:42,169 --> 00:09:47,007
And if you assume that each ox consumes about 20,000 Calories a day,

154
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:52,255
and you have 2 of them, so 40,000 Calories per day for just to feed the oxen,

155
00:09:52,255 --> 00:09:57,034
and you are going to do that for 6.5 days, 65 divided by 10,

156
00:09:57,034 --> 00:10:02,061
the oxen are going to consume 260,000 Calories to do this task.

157
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:06,045
So the total energy input here now has gone up.

158
00:10:06,045 --> 00:10:09,776
So this is an interesting phenomenon that is going on right over here.

159
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:14,978
What the human is putting in as we get better and better technology goes down substantially,

160
00:10:14,978 --> 00:10:19,236
216,000 and 33,000, and we will se that with the tractor that goes down even more,

161
00:10:19,236 --> 00:10:23,368
but the total energy, if you include the amount of energy that the oxen have to put in,

162
00:10:23,368 --> 00:10:28,166
or if you include the amount of energy to do the gasoline that has to be used for the tractor,

163
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:32,857
the total amount of energy is going up to plough that field,

164
00:10:32,857 --> 00:10:35,965
but the human energy goes down dramatically.

165
00:10:35,965 --> 00:10:38,959
Now, the last thing I want to highlight here, and this is where my numbers

166
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:45,032
that depart a little bit or fairly significantly from this original study right over here, this original estimate,

167
00:10:45,032 --> 00:10:48,989
is the machinery input on the tractors.

168
00:10:48,989 --> 00:10:53,497
So if you look this up, you can google search it, they have much larger numbers here,

169
00:10:53,497 --> 00:10:59,517
but I did a little research and it looks like for most petroleum, combustion based engines or vehicles

170
00:10:59,517 --> 00:11:03,565
roughly 20% of the total energy that is used in the field,

171
00:11:03,565 --> 00:11:09,374
20% of that energy is used for the actuall production and maintenance of that veihicle over its life.

172
00:11:09,374 --> 00:11:14,235
So what we did over here is we said: ok, for a 6-HP tractor, I used their number,

173
00:11:14,235 --> 00:11:17,713
we are going to have to use 25 hours to do it,

174
00:11:17,713 --> 00:11:19,839
it is going to use this much petroleum,

175
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,860
assuming that is uses 23.5 litres of gas or petroleum over 24 hours,

176
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,489
and I just put 20% for that number for saying

177
00:11:27,489 --> 00:11:35,178
how much energy had to be used to maintain that vehicle over that amount of time,

178
00:11:35,178 --> 00:11:40,237
and if you think about what fraction of this vehicle's life that 25 hours represents,

179
00:11:40,237 --> 00:11:44,425
that fraction times the total amount of energy required to produce that.

180
00:11:44,425 --> 00:11:47,708
So remember, these things are made out of metal, they had to be made in furnaces,

181
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,975
so just pruducing a vehicle requires a lot of energy,

182
00:11:50,975 --> 00:11:56,592
and so this right over here is 20%, and I just used the rule of thumb,

183
00:11:56,592 --> 00:12:02,701
for most petroleum or combustion based vehicles, the 20% of the total energy expenditure

184
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:13,111
over the course of that vehicle's life is roughly equal to the amount of energy used to produce that vehicle.

185
00:12:13,111 --> 00:12:19,500
But either way, you go all of the way over here, the human has to spend less Calories sitting on the vehicle,

186
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,089
so they spend less Calories per day,

187
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:25,000
and then the total human input right over here for the 6-HP tractor,

188
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,834
it is going to take them 2.5 days, 25 hours, 10 hours a day,

189
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:33,757
is going to be 8,500 Calories. But of course, you have the petroleum used,

190
00:12:33,757 --> 00:12:38,105
and then some estimate of the amount of energy used to produce that tractor,

191
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:41,624
and you are just taking the fraction over that 25 hours,

192
00:12:41,624 --> 00:12:44,115
you are not taking the entire life of that 6-HP tractor.

193
00:12:44,115 --> 00:12:50,063
To produce this 6-HP tractor this number would be much larger if you talk about the total number of energy,

194
00:12:50,063 --> 00:12:53,666
we are just taking this small fraction of its life that we are using right over here,

195
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,690
same thing for the 50-HP tractor.

196
00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:00,673
But anyway, if you look at it, this is the really interesting thing,

197
00:13:00,673 --> 00:13:04,681
humans, by going from human power all the way to a 50-HP tractor,

198
00:13:04,681 --> 00:13:08,128
you are getting almost a factor of 200 improvement

199
00:13:08,128 --> 00:13:12,413
in terms of how little energy has to be put in by the human to till that land.

200
00:13:12,413 --> 00:13:17,235
But you actually get a total increase if you factor in things like the petroleum,

201
00:13:17,235 --> 00:13:22,081
and then definitely the amount of energy to actually produce that machine.

202
00:13:22,081 --> 00:13:24,267
So anyway, hopefully you found that interesting.

203
00:13:24,267 --> 00:13:31,291
I find this kind of ... it's something that you don't think a lot about. How much energy input has to be put in.

204
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:35,260
And often times we only think about the human energy input,

205
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,260
but we are not thinking about the energy input from other things like oxen.
