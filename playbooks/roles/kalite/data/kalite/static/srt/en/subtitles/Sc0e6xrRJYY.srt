00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,560
Welcome to the presentation on multiplying expressions.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,250
Let's get started.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:11,520
So if I were to ask you what x plus two times, let me use a

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:20,600
different color, times x plus three equals, at first you'd be like,

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,430
huh, that's a little strange.

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,170
But it turns out that you actually already know

7
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:24,930
how to do this problem.

8
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,050
And it's just the distributive property.

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,030
Because, if I just had -- let me write a different problem

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,590
here -- if I just wrote a let me just make it clear, this is

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:41,390
a separate problem -- if I just wrote a times x plus three, you

12
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:58,050
know that that's just a x plus, you could say a three, or

13
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,500
another way to say that would be three a, right?

14
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,000
But as you see, all we did is distribute it, this a times three.

15
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:07,280
All we did is distribute the a times the x and the three.

16
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,760
Well, we're going to do the same thing here, but instead

17
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,620
of a we have x plus two.

18
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,040
So let's do that.

19
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:18,820
So this would be -- let me switch to green -- we get x

20
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,980
plus two, and since I'm using green, I'm just going

21
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,470
to stay with green.

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,390
x plus two, let me switch to orange.

23
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,970
x plus two times x plus x plus two times three.

24
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,300
Does that make sense?

25
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,710
If that looks a little confusing, just pretend

26
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,530
like that x plus two is the a in this example.

27
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,070
And all we did is, we distributed it across

28
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,100
that x plus three.

29
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,970
And now it becomes a pretty straightforward problem.

30
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,130
What is -- we do distribution again with each part

31
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,420
of this problem.

32
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,730
So, let me stay in orange.

33
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,940
What is x times x?

34
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,810
Well that's x squared.

35
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,840
And then x times two -- well, that's twox.

36
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,850
So we did this left-hand side already.

37
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,670
Now we do this right-hand side.

38
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,720
What's three times x?

39
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,640
Well that's threex.

40
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,930
What's three times two?

41
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,670
Well, that's six.

42
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,680
And now we're almost done.

43
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,660
We could say, oh, we have a twox here and a threex here, we can

44
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,690
simplify and add those together.

45
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,060
And we know that that equals x squared.

46
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,990
twox plus threex is equal to fivex.

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,930
x squared plus fivex plus six.

48
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,880
So all we did, there's really nothing new to learn here.

49
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,450
We just distributed the x plus two times each term of x plus three.

50
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,620
And we got the second step.

51
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,460
And then we distributed this x times x plus two, and this three

52
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,650
times x plus two, and simplify.

53
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,800
Let's do a couple of problems.

54
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,960
And hopefully it'll hit the point home.

55
00:02:51,960 --> 00:03:07,170
Let's say I had fivex plus nine times fourx minus two.

56
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:16,580
Once again, that equals fivex plus nine.

57
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,120
I'm just distributing it.

58
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,630
I want to stay in my color that I'm using, so that's why I'm

59
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,660
just writing it out like this.

60
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:27,650
That equals fivex plus nine times fourx.

61
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:32,330
And then plus, fivex plus nine times minus two.

62
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,550
That minus two is here and this fourx is here.

63
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,820
And now we just multiply it out.

64
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:45,160
fivex times fourx is twentyx squared.

65
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,710
Hope that makes sense to you; let me write it

66
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,740
down in this corner.

67
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:55,040
fivex times fourx is the same thing as five times four times x times x.

68
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,030
That equals twentyx squared.

69
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,830
Hopefully that makes sense to you.

70
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,280
So, going back to the problem.

71
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,820
fivex times fourx is twentyx squared plus nine times fourx is thirty-sixx.

72
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,030
Plus minus two times fivex.

73
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:16,990
So that's minus tenx.

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,860
And then nine times negative two, well, that's minus eighteen.

75
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,470
And we're almost done.

76
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,690
So we get twentyx squared.

77
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,300
And we have thirty-sixx.

78
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,990
Minus tenx.

79
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:34,040
So that's plus twenty-sixx minus eighteen.

80
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,510
There.

81
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,420
We're done.

82
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,320
Let's do another problem.

83
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:49,700
Let's do twox plus y.

84
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,630
Whoops, some parentheses.

85
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,030
I'll stay in one color, since I think you understand

86
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,160
what we're doing.

87
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:03,200
Times threex plus twoy.

88
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,780
Well, once again, this is the same thing as -- and we could

89
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,100
just do it in a little different way, a little

90
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:08,830
different order.

91
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,340
But we could distribute it like this.

92
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:15,950
We could say that this is threex times twox plus y.

93
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:21,560
Plus twoy times twox plus y.

94
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,040
See what I did?

95
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,270
I just switched the order this time.

96
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,400
Just to mix things up.

97
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,050
This threex is there.

98
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,130
This twoy is here.

99
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:31,310
And we just distributed it along two -- and we just, we

100
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:35,240
distributed it twox plus y along each of these numbers.

101
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,530
And now we just multiply it out.

102
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,620
threex times twox is sixx squared.

103
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:46,960
threex times y -- that's threexy.

104
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,920
threexy is just another way of saying three times x times y.

105
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:56,850
Plus, now, two times y times twoy times twox, well, that's four y x.

106
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,310
four y x.

107
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,430
two times two times y times x.

108
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,000
Plus twoy times y.

109
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:11,360
Well, that's just twoy squared.

110
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,580
Now, can we simplify anything here?

111
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,970
Think about it a little bit.

112
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,950
Well, it turns out that x y and y are actually the same thing.

113
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,560
They're just switching the order.

114
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,290
So you could just rewrite this as sixx squared plus

115
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,110
seven x y plus twoy squared.

116
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,550
And we could have just as easily have written it as

117
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:39,470
sixx squared plus seveny x plus twoy squared.

118
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,410
I hope I'm not confusing you.

119
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,910
Let's do one more, real fast.

120
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:53,100
Let's do twox plus two squared.

121
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,860
Well, you might be temptd to just square each of these

122
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,180
terms, but you've got to be careful because you

123
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,330
have this x here.

124
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,830
So it actually turns out that this is equal to twox

125
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:06,220
plus two times twox plus two.

126
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,730
Any number squared is just that number times itself.

127
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,940
So any expression like twox plus two squared, is just that

128
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,000
expression times itself.

129
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,970
And now we can just do it as -- this is the same thing

130
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:22,300
as twox times twox plus two.

131
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:26,060
Plus two times twox plus two.

132
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,310
We just multiply everything out.

133
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,230
twox times twox, that's fourx squared.

134
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,520
twox times two, that's fourx.

135
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,680
Plus two times twox is fourx again.

136
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,790
And then two times two, well, that's four.

137
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,760
And we're almost there.

138
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,740
We just can add up these two terms.

139
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:51,130
fourx squared plus eightx plus four.

140
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,500
And we're done.

141
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:55,880
I think you're ready now to try some level one multiplying

142
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,210
expression problems.

143
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,920
Hope you have fun.
