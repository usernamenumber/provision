00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,880
I just realized that when I just did problem number 14,

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,170
I got a weird answer because,once again,

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:07,810
I cannot add and multiply.

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,660
But just redoing it just so you get the right answer.

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:18,390
Number 14. Oh,they give you a,3a,dot,dot,dot.

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,580
And they say that each term is 3 times the previous term.

7
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,960
So the next term is going to be 9a and so forth.

8
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:30,560
They say the sum of the first five terms is 605.

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,410
And so what is a? Well,what are the first five terms?

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:42,550
It's a,3a,9a,27a--I'm just multiplying by 3 every time. 81a.

11
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,980
And this is always the part that I will mess up. This is 1a.

12
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:58,400
So 1 plus 3 is 4.4 plus 9 is 13.13 plus 7 is 20,plus 1 is 21.

13
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,580
And then 4 plus 8,121a is equal to--

14
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,570
and they say,it equals 605.

15
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,670
The sum of the first five terms,605.

16
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:15,930
a is equal to 605/121,and that is 5.

17
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,960
Much easier when you can add properly.

18
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,740
That's all I had for this video

19
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,240
because I just had to correct my mistake.

20
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,400
See you in the next problem.
