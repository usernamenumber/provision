1
00:00:04,447 --> 00:00:08,020
We're in the Uffizzi and we're looking at Verrocchio's painting of

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:12,042
the Baptism of Christ. So we see St. John on the right

3
00:00:12,042 --> 00:00:15,992
baptizing Christ. This is simultaneously the moment that

4
00:00:15,992 --> 00:00:19,893
Christ's divine nature is revealed and we see that in the Holy Spirit and the hands of

5
00:00:19,893 --> 00:00:23,941
God above. What is especially fun about this painting is that

6
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:28,138
Leonardo was one of his students and Leonardo painted some parts

7
00:00:28,138 --> 00:00:32,281
of this painting. OK, so that is a wild idea right there. Because we think of Leonardo

8
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:35,996
as the master of the High Renaissance, and the notion of him as a student

9
00:00:35,996 --> 00:00:39,704
and to actually have some of his student work available is really fabulous.

10
00:00:39,704 --> 00:00:43,438
Well, it is pretty wild, just the notion, that other people would paint part of your

11
00:00:43,438 --> 00:00:47,342
paintings - that is true. It is not something we could imagine a modern artist doing. But this was

12
00:00:47,342 --> 00:00:51,370
a standard idea, that a master would have students, would have apprentices, and

13
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,640
they would work in his work shop and often do some of the less critical elements.

14
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,785
So we know that Leonardo was responsible for one of the

15
00:00:58,785 --> 00:01:02,703
angels, Right, so one day Verrocchio said: "Today, Leonardo, could you paint one of the

16
00:01:02,703 --> 00:01:06,977
angels for me?" And so Verrocchio painted one of the angels and Leonardo painted

17
00:01:06,977 --> 00:01:10,906
the other. And I think what is fun about this is to think about

18
00:01:10,906 --> 00:01:14,566
one of the angels as an Early Renaissance angel and the other

19
00:01:14,566 --> 00:01:18,551
angel as a High Renaissance angel. Leonardo's angel as the High

20
00:01:18,551 --> 00:01:22,669
Renaissance angel, because it is really Leonardo who invents the style of the High

21
00:01:22,669 --> 00:01:26,578
Renaissance. To me I think it is pretty obvious. So we have two angels,

22
00:01:26,578 --> 00:01:30,969
they are very close. Think about how one angel, Verrocchio's

23
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:34,634
angel looks rather typical, like a boy. He does

24
00:01:34,634 --> 00:01:38,199
look like a boy. Yeah, like maybe Verrocchio went out and got a boy to model for

25
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:42,273
him. Leonardo's angel looks like it has no earthly model. It's

26
00:01:42,273 --> 00:01:46,440
just ideally beautiful. And it's that ideal

27
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,443
beauty that will become so important in the High Renaissance.

28
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:53,968
If you think about figures like Michaelangelo's David, it's the ideal

29
00:01:53,968 --> 00:01:57,755
beauty of the High Renaissance figures that suggests their divine

30
00:01:57,755 --> 00:02:01,713
nature. So that's so interesting. Because when we think about the Trecento, like we have a

31
00:02:01,713 --> 00:02:05,957
kind of painting that created a representation of the other

32
00:02:05,957 --> 00:02:09,620
worldly, of the divine, that had nothing to do with the earthly. But then

33
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:13,970
in the 15th century we had artists that were studying nature, studying

34
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,650
our reality. In a sense you are saying that

35
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,886
Leonardo is surpassing even that, that he took the lessons of the 15th century and

36
00:02:21,886 --> 00:02:25,664
reworked them in order to be able to create an even more

37
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:29,776
transcendent representation of the divine. Well, in the 1300s

38
00:02:29,776 --> 00:02:33,403
artists would represent spirituality or in the heavenly by using

39
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:37,168
a lot of gold, halos, figures that were very

40
00:02:37,168 --> 00:02:41,734
flat and so they suggested transcendence, a kind of other worldliness.

41
00:02:41,734 --> 00:02:45,860
So what Leonardo is doing is, he is keeping all of those lessons of the early

42
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,334
Renaissance of how to make the human figure look real, right. Using

43
00:02:49,334 --> 00:02:53,503
modeling, giving the figure a sense of weight and gravity, giving

44
00:02:53,503 --> 00:02:56,933
the figure a sense of three-dimensionality. Understanding its

45
00:02:56,933 --> 00:03:01,202
anatomy. Exactly. All of those lessons of the Early Renaissance and

46
00:03:01,202 --> 00:03:05,197
yet is able to imbue the figure with a sense

47
00:03:05,197 --> 00:03:09,339
of transcendence and divinity. So much so

48
00:03:09,339 --> 00:03:12,971
that the halo now almost seems redundant. Exactly. And

49
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:17,088
it is Leonardo who will do away with the halo but it is not just the ideal

50
00:03:17,088 --> 00:03:21,326
beauty of the figure that suggests that kind of transcendence

51
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:24,642
and spirituality. It is also, I think for me, in the movements of the

52
00:03:24,642 --> 00:03:28,064
figure. If you look at Leonardo's angel holding Christ's

53
00:03:28,064 --> 00:03:32,292
clothing, he kneals facing to the right, his

54
00:03:32,292 --> 00:03:36,173
shoulders twist slightly to the left, his head leans

55
00:03:36,173 --> 00:03:40,416
back and up and it is an incredibly complex

56
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:44,146
pose. If you think back to the Early Renaissance, the artists

57
00:03:44,146 --> 00:03:47,855
like Masaccio and Donatello were just really discovering

58
00:03:47,855 --> 00:03:51,797
how to create figures standing in contrapposto, who could

59
00:03:51,797 --> 00:03:55,851
move realistically. But Leonardo is taking a giant

60
00:03:55,851 --> 00:03:59,532
step beyond that. So the figures really move in a very

61
00:03:59,532 --> 00:04:04,089
elegant and graceful way that suggests that divine nature

62
00:04:04,089 --> 00:04:07,562
So Leonardo is really offering us a glimpse into the future, a

63
00:04:07,562 --> 00:04:12,101
promise of what the High Renaissance will hold in store for us.
