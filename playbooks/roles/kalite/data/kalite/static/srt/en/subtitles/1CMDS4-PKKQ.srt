1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,650
Let's now expand our
knowledge of calculus

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,600
to the third dimension.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,170
So first of all, just what
does a function look like

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:09,810
in three dimensions?

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,280
And actually we'll go over
the different types.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,640
Because you can have a line in
three dimensions, or kind of

7
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,600
a curve in three dimensions.

8
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,920
You can have a surface.

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,310
You could have a vector field.

10
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,540
There are different types of
representations we'll see,

11
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:21,890
when we start working
with three dimensions.

12
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,330
But I think the most
intuitive-- and none of these

13
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,920
are directly intuitive-- I
think you have to really be

14
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,370
able to visualize them.

15
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,950
But the most intuitive, to
me at least, is a surface

16
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:31,620
in three dimensions.

17
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,790
And eventually, we can expand
this into n dimensions.

18
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,940
But then it becomes very
hard to visualize.

19
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,160
So we had our traditional
x and y-axis before, but

20
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,380
now let's give another
dimension of height.

21
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,890
Let's say that this is my
x-axis-- and I'll draw

22
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,030
the positive quadrant.

23
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,920
That's my x-axis.

24
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,920
That's the y-axis, and
that's the z-axis.

25
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,410
And the convention is to kind
of follow the right hand rule,

26
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:01,510
where the x-axis-- taking the
cross product of the x-axis

27
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,970
with the y-axis-- is
equal to the z-axis.

28
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,910
What do I mean by that?

29
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,550
This is x-- those colors really
don't go well together.

30
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,070
This is y.

31
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,230
This is z.

32
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,520
What do I mean by
the cross product?

33
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,420
So if this is the
unit vector in the x

34
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,390
direction-- so that's i.

35
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,670
Let's say this is
a length of 1.

36
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,980
This is in the
y-direction, so it's j.

37
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,670
Oops.

38
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,460
j, little cap.

39
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,300
And that cap just means
it's a unit vector.

40
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,660
It's in y-direction, but
it has a magnitude of 1.

41
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,940
And I'll use a
different color for z.

42
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,130
z is up.

43
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,720
And the unit vector
for there is k.

44
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:50,060
And this is just a convention,
that i cross j is equal to k.

45
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,190
And that's just the
convention, you know,

46
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,130
for drawing the x-axis.

47
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,460
Do we make increasing x
pointing out this way?

48
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,470
Or do we make increasing
x point inwards?

49
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,780
And this gives us
the convention.

50
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,540
So i goes in this direction.

51
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,260
I'm trying to make sure I
can do my hand properly.

52
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,600
So let me draw the
cross product.

53
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,430
So if you take the first
vector, put your index finger

54
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:14,920
in the direction of the first
vector, middle finger in the

55
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:22,510
direction of the second vector,
and your other fingers can

56
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,730
do what they need to do.

57
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,920
So this is going in
the direction of i.

58
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,640
That is going in the
direction of k.

59
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,430
Sorry, of j, right?

60
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,590
In the y-direction.

61
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,980
And then you have your palm of
your thumb, and then your thumb

62
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,720
is going to open up
in this direction.

63
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,380
Your thumb is going to
point up, which is

64
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,780
the direction of k.

65
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,450
So that's just a-- good
to know, where did that

66
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,320
convention come from?

67
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,140
This is kind of called a
right-handed coordinate system.

68
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,910
But let's get to the
meat and potatoes.

69
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,220
So how do we define a surface
in three dimensions?

70
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,490
Well, we can define z as
a function of x and y.

71
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,830
So let's do that.

72
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:08,930
And just the notation, z is
equal to a function of x and y.

73
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:12,110
And all that means is that if
I give you an x-value and a

74
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,170
y-value you get a z-value.

75
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:19,660
And so, I don't know,
let's pick one.

76
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,370
z is equal to x plus y.

77
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:30,210
So this z is equal to, I don't
know, x squared plus y.

78
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,050
So how do we plot the
points on the surface?

79
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,820
And I'll show you, actually,
computer generated surfaces

80
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,330
that are far more professional
looking than anything I

81
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,353
could possibly try to draw.

82
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:45,150
   

83
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:56,770
So let's say, what's f of-- f
of, I don't know, 2 comma 1.

84
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:01,350
Well, that would mean x is 2,
so it's 2 squared plus 1.

85
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,690
Well, it equals 5.

86
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,630
And if we had to plot that
point of the surface-- and

87
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,660
maybe I'll actually graph this
one in a little bit-- we

88
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,040
go along the x-axis 2.

89
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,870
So 1, 2.

90
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:15,070
We go along the y-axis 1.

91
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,910
So if you take this point--
this is x is equal

92
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,380
to y is equal to 1.

93
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,510
And then we go and then we
say, well, z is equal to 5.

94
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:26,120
So we can go up here, I don't
know, we'd go up 5 units.

95
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,700
And we would plot that point.

96
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,200
And you would see, if you
kept doing that, you

97
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,530
would plot a surface.

98
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,680
You'd plot a surface.

99
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,360
And let me clean this
up a little bit.

100
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,550
So the natural question that
you might want to ask--

101
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,140
and actually, let me
show you a surface.

102
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,550
I'm afraid that when I
manipulate this graph, it'll

103
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,560
slow down my computer and
I'll start sounding

104
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,230
like I'm melting.

105
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,880
But I'll take that risk.

106
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,820
Just bear with me.

107
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,850
So here is a surface I use,
using this Java applet grapher.

108
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:54,600
And it's actually free.

109
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,260
I'll give you the link for it.

110
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,000
But this surface right here,
this is-- I'll actually show

111
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,680
you the graph of this.

112
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,110
It'll start taking the
partial derivative.

113
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,130
Don't worry about this wall.

114
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,170
We'll get to this in a second.

115
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,770
But this is a
function of x and y.

116
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:10,320
You can see this is the
x-axis, the y-axis.

117
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,960
The height is the z-axis.

118
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,920
This'll probably really slow
down my computer, but you

119
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,480
can actually rotate it.

120
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,090
Look at that.

121
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:23,670
   

122
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,910
I don't want to slow.

123
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,190
I don't want to slow things
too down while I'm trying

124
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,580
to do my screen capture.

125
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,270
Anyway, I think you'd
understand, where you pick an

126
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:35,680
x-point, you pick a y-point,
and then z-- this surface right

127
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,800
here, without this line
intersecting it-- this

128
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,700
surface right here, is
a function of x and y.

129
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,640
   

130
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,070
So the question is,
well, how do we apply

131
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,830
calculus to surfaces?

132
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,640
Because-- actually, let me
bring that thing out again.

133
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,800
Because if you look at this
surface, if you were to pick

134
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,780
any arbitrary point on this
surface, and say, what is

135
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,470
the slope of that surface?

136
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,000
Well, it kind of has no
meaning, because you have to

137
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,970
kind of pick a direction.

138
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,370
If you said, what is the
slope of the tangent line?

139
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,230
Any point on this graph
actually has an infinite

140
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,570
number of tangent lines.

141
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,600
I mean, think of it this way.

142
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,240
Take a bowl or something that
maybe-- you know, like this.

143
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,370
And then take a, I don't
know, a toothpick.

144
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,420
And make that toothpick tangent
to the bowl, and you can see

145
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,880
that on any point on the
bowl, you can just rotate

146
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,200
that toothpick around.

147
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,510
So you kind of have to pick the
orientation of that toothpick.

148
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,030
So what we're going to learn is
when you take a derivative in

149
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,390
three dimensions, you have to
specify the direction that

150
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,360
you're taking the
derivative in.

151
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,890
And this is why I actually
drew this wall here.

152
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:42,450
This wall is the equation
y is equal to 0.3.

153
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,545
So you can kind of view it.

154
00:06:43,545 --> 00:06:47,950
Along this wall, y is
a constant, right?

155
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,700
So if we assume that y is
constant, then maybe we could

156
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,160
take just the derivative
with respect to x.

157
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,510
So we would essentially
take the slope of this

158
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,270
curve right here.

159
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,730
And let's figure
out how to do it.

160
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:02,110
So first of all, what is the
equation of this surface?

161
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,980
And I just picked one that
they had on Wikipedia.

162
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,850
But the equation of that
surface is-- and I'm going to

163
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:10,896
remove this now, so I don't
sound like I'm melting.

164
00:07:10,896 --> 00:07:13,890
The equation of that surface--
and let me just clear out

165
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:17,695
everything, just because we'll
probably need the extra space.

166
00:07:17,695 --> 00:07:20,380
   

167
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,580
Go back to the pen tool.

168
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:31,910
The equation is z is equal to x
squared plus xy plus y squared.

169
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,980
So we said if we want to take a
derivative, it's hard to-- you

170
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,930
know, you can't just say
there is one derivative.

171
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:37,980
We have to pick a direction.

172
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,200
We have to hold everything
else constant and take the

173
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,300
derivative with respect
to just one variable.

174
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,400
And that is called the
partial derivative.

175
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,920
I know it sounds fancy,
but you'll see.

176
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,050
It's actually no harder than
taking a regular derivative.

177
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,560
You just have to make sure you
remember which variable is a

178
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,450
variable, and which
one is a constant.

179
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,260
So let's say we wanted
to hold y constant.

180
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,430
And we just say, for any
constant y, how much does z

181
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,610
change with respect to x?

182
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,660
Then we take the partial
derivative-- this

183
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,195
is the notation.

184
00:08:04,195 --> 00:08:07,100
   

185
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,410
You can view it as a d
with the top curled.

186
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:17,080
The partial derivative
of z with respect to x.

187
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,130
It equals-- all we do is we
take this expression-- we take

188
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,270
the derivative of x-- and we
just assume that y

189
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,660
is some constant.

190
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,470
So what's the derivative
of 2x with respect to x?

191
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,460
Well, it's just 2x.

192
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,640
What's the derivative of
xy with respect to x?

193
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,945
Well, y is just a number.

194
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:33,710
It's just a constant.

195
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,890
Remember, we're not taking an
implicit derivative here.

196
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,430
y is just a constant.

197
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,300
So if you have some constant
times x, the derivative of

198
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,050
that is just the constant.

199
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,240
Plus y.

200
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,490
And then what's the derivative
of y squared with respect to x?

201
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,410
Well, we're assuming y
squared is a constant.

202
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,580
It's just a number, right?
y is just a number.

203
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,955
So the derivative of just
the number with respect

204
00:08:52,955 --> 00:08:54,230
to x is just 0.

205
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,470
So the derivative of that is 0.

206
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:03,130
So the partial derivative of z
with respect to x is 2x plus y.

207
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,770
Now, what does that mean?

208
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:07,540
Well, that means if I were--
and actually, let me give you

209
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,460
a little notation, before I
show you what that means.

210
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,610
Another way to write this exact
same thing is if we wrote that

211
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:20,380
f of xy is equal to the same
thing-- x squared plus xy plus

212
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:25,090
y squared-- the partial of f
with respect to x we could

213
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,640
have written as this.

214
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,210
The partial derivative of f
with respect to x-- and still

215
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,140
a function of x and y, right?

216
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,950
It still depends on what
constant y you're using--

217
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:40,270
is equal to 2x plus y.

218
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:43,060
Anyway, I thought it's nice
to see that notation.

219
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,100
Now, what does this mean?

220
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,370
Well, what is the slope of z
with respect to x at, say,

221
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:54,080
when x is 1 and-- actually,
let's pick smaller numbers.

222
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,530
When x is equal to, I don't
know, when x is equal to 0.2

223
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:04,420
and y is equal to,
I don't know, 0.3.

224
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,280
Well, we could use this.

225
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,730
The partial derivative of f,
with respect to x, at the

226
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:16,330
point 0.2, 0.3 is equal to 2
times x-- that's 0.4--

227
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,800
plus y-- plus 0.3.

228
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,730
So the slope of this function
with respect to x at the 0.2,

229
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,492
comma 0.3, is equal to 0.7.

230
00:10:28,492 --> 00:10:30,480
Let's see if we can
visualize that.

231
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,040
   

232
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:39,190
So that wall represents the
line y is equal to 0.3.

233
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:42,700
And we want the slope at equal
at-- x is equal to 0.2.

234
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,320
So this is x is
0.2, right here.

235
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,140
So the rate at which the
height, or the rate at

236
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,750
which z is changing with
respect to x, is 0.7.

237
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:56,430
So every time x increases
1, z will increase by 0.7.

238
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,850
So the slope is a little
bit less than 1.

239
00:10:58,850 --> 00:10:59,890
I think you see that, right?

240
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,600
The tangent right here is
increasing with increasing

241
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,330
values of x, but a little
bit less than 45 degrees.

242
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,120
Anyway, I'm all out of time.

243
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,340
See you in the next video.
