1
00:00:00,933 --> 00:00:04,249
The goal of this video is to explore some of the concepts or

2
00:00:04,249 --> 00:00:06,664
formulas you might see in the traditional Physics class but

3
00:00:06,664 --> 00:00:09,265
even more importantly to see that they are really just common sense ideas.

4
00:00:10,457 --> 00:00:13,619
So let's just start with a simple example.

5
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:16,042
Let's say that, and for the sake of this video just so I don't

6
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:19,533
have to keep saying this is the magnitude of the velocity,

7
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:21,533
this is the direction of the velocity, et cetera.

8
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:25,519
Let's just assume that if I have positive number that it means

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,600
for example if I have a positive velocity it means that I am

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,835
going to the right and let's say if I have a negative number

11
00:00:31,835 --> 00:00:34,133
which we won't see in this video, let's assume that I'm going

12
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:37,245
to the left and that way I can just write a number down -we're

13
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:39,733
only operating in one dimension- you know that it is

14
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:41,564
specifying what the magnitude and the direction.

15
00:00:41,564 --> 00:00:44,164
If I said that the velocity was 5 metres per second that

16
00:00:44,164 --> 00:00:46,301
means 5 metres per second to the right.

17
00:00:46,301 --> 00:00:48,390
If I said it is negative 5 metres per second that means

18
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,316
it's 5 metres per second to the left.

19
00:00:51,316 --> 00:00:53,580
Now let's just say, just for simplicity, let's just say that if we

20
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,681
start with an initial velocity, we start with an initial velocity of

21
00:00:57,681 --> 00:00:59,577
5 meters per second

22
00:00:59,577 --> 00:01:02,086
Once again I am specifying with a magnitude and the direction

23
00:01:02,086 --> 00:01:03,494
because of this convention here.

24
00:01:03,494 --> 00:01:05,697
We know it is to the right

25
00:01:05,697 --> 00:01:08,092
and let's say that we have a constant acceleration

26
00:01:08,092 --> 00:01:11,262
we have a constant acceleration at play

27
00:01:11,354 --> 00:01:16,801
of 2 meters per second per second, or 2 m/s^2

28
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:20,109
and once again since this is positive, it is, to the right

29
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:23,235
and let's say that we do this for a duration

30
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:33,197
so my change in time is...let's say we do this for a duration of 4 s

31
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,873
so <i>s</i> for this video is seconds

32
00:01:37,212 --> 00:01:39,356
So what I want to do is think about how far

33
00:01:39,525 --> 00:01:41,614
how far do we travel?

34
00:01:41,858 --> 00:01:43,335
Well there's two things here.

35
00:01:43,465 --> 00:01:46,311
How far or how fast are we going, after 4 seconds

36
00:01:46,311 --> 00:01:51,360
and how far have we traveled over the course of those 4 seconds

37
00:01:51,506 --> 00:01:55,476
So let's draw ourselves a little bit of a diagram here

38
00:01:55,476 --> 00:01:57,756
so this is my velocity axis

39
00:01:58,264 --> 00:02:01,100
and this over here is my time axis

40
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:02,580
(let me draw a straighter line than that)

41
00:02:03,303 --> 00:02:05,394
so that is my time axis

42
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:12,555
This is velocity, that is my velocity right over there

43
00:02:13,241 --> 00:02:15,432
and I'm starting off at 5 m/s

44
00:02:15,832 --> 00:02:18,470
this is 5 m/s right over here

45
00:02:18,652 --> 00:02:23,154
so V_i is equal to 5 m/s

46
00:02:23,378 --> 00:02:26,742
and then every second that goes by, I'm going 2 m/s faster

47
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:29,373
because it's 2 meters per second per second!

48
00:02:30,118 --> 00:02:32,349
so every second that goes by

49
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:36,402
so after 1 second...I'm going to go 2 m/s faster...so I'll be at 7

50
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:38,060
Or another way to think about it

51
00:02:38,277 --> 00:02:42,787
is the slope of this velocity line is my constant acceleration

52
00:02:43,218 --> 00:02:44,064
I have a constant slope here

53
00:02:44,293 --> 00:02:47,499
So it might look something like that

54
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:50,709
So what has happened after 4 seconds?

55
00:02:51,162 --> 00:02:54,608
so 1...2...3...4...so this is my delta t

56
00:02:55,252 --> 00:03:01,506
So my final velocity is going to be right over there

57
00:03:02,152 --> 00:03:05,464
(I'll write it down here because it's getting in the way of this word <i>velocity</i>)

58
00:03:05,995 --> 00:03:09,293
And so this is V_f, this is my final velocity

59
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:10,646
and what would it be?

60
00:03:10,846 --> 00:03:14,548
Well I'm starting at 5 m/s, so I'm going to do it both ways...

61
00:03:14,687 --> 00:03:17,658
using the variables and using the concrete numbers

62
00:03:17,658 --> 00:03:21,718
So I'm starting at some initial velocity

63
00:03:22,022 --> 00:03:24,504
the subscript <i>i</i> says <i>i</i> for <i>initial</i>

64
00:03:24,902 --> 00:03:29,264
And then each second that goes by, I'm getting this much faster

65
00:03:29,674 --> 00:03:32,190
So if I want to see how much faster have I gone

66
00:03:32,215 --> 00:03:39,326
I multiply the number of seconds that go by times my acceleration

67
00:03:42,436 --> 00:03:44,077
And once again, this right here

68
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:47,843
I just wrote the subscript <i>c</i> saying it's a constant acceleration

69
00:03:48,008 --> 00:03:50,625
And so that will tell me how fast I've gone

70
00:03:50,882 --> 00:03:55,124
If I start at this point, and I multiply the duration times my slope

71
00:03:55,324 --> 00:03:59,863
I will get this high, I will get to my final velocity

72
00:04:01,463 --> 00:04:03,089
and just to make it clear with the numbers

73
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,728
These numbers really could be anything

74
00:04:06,124 --> 00:04:07,757
I'm just picking these to make it concrete in your mind

75
00:04:07,864 --> 00:04:13,228
You have 5 m/s plus 4 seconds

76
00:04:13,228 --> 00:04:14,999
(I'm going to do that in yellow)

77
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:16,945
plus 4 seconds

78
00:04:17,775 --> 00:04:24,525
times our acceleration of 2 m/s^2

79
00:04:24,525 --> 00:04:26,828
And what is this going to be equal to?

80
00:04:26,828 --> 00:04:29,868
You have the seconds cancelling out with one of the seconds down here

81
00:04:29,868 --> 00:04:32,363
You have 4 times, (so let me write it)

82
00:04:32,363 --> 00:04:38,356
So you have 5 meters per second, plus, 4 times 2 is 8

83
00:04:39,186 --> 00:04:44,332
8, this seconds is gone so we're just left with m/s.

84
00:04:44,332 --> 00:04:51,402
or this is the same thing as 13 m/s which is going to be our final velocity.

85
00:04:51,402 --> 00:04:54,062
And i wanna take a pause here (and you can pause here and think about it yourself)

86
00:04:54,676 --> 00:04:56,545
This hopefully should be intuitive

87
00:04:56,545 --> 00:04:59,534
We were starting at going 5 m/s

88
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:03,654
Every second that goes by, we're going to go 2 m/s faster.

89
00:05:03,654 --> 00:05:06,443
So after 1 second, we'll be at 7 m/s

90
00:05:06,443 --> 00:05:09,615
after 2 seconds we will be at 9 m/s.

91
00:05:09,615 --> 00:05:13,904
After, after 3 seconds we will be at 11 m/s.

92
00:05:13,904 --> 00:05:17,266
And then after 4 seconds we will be at 13 m/s.

93
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:22,124
So you multiply how much time passed times acceleration, this is how much faster we are going to be going.

94
00:05:22,232 --> 00:05:28,064
We are already going 5 m/s, 5 plus how much faster, 13 m/s

95
00:05:28,141 --> 00:05:34,200
So this right up here is 13 m/s.

96
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,235
So, I'll take a little pause here,hopefully that is intuitive.

97
00:05:38,235 --> 00:05:43,264
And the whole point of that is to show that this formula that you'll often see in many physics books

98
00:05:43,264 --> 00:05:45,661
It's not just something that randomly popped out of air.

99
00:05:45,661 --> 00:05:47,872
It just makes complete common sense.

100
00:05:47,872 --> 00:05:54,072
Now the next thing I want to talk about is what is the total distance we would have traveled?

101
00:05:54,072 --> 00:05:59,575
Now we know from the last video that distance is just the area under this curve right over here.

102
00:05:59,575 --> 00:06:03,491
So it's just the area under this curve.

103
00:06:03,491 --> 00:06:05,719
Oh yea, you see this is kind of a strange shape right here,

104
00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:07,369
how do I calculate its area?

105
00:06:07,369 --> 00:06:11,509
Now we can just use a little simple geometry to break it down into 2 different areas.

106
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:13,684
That are very easy to calculate the areas.

107
00:06:13,684 --> 00:06:20,258
Or 2 simple shapes, you can break it down into this blue part, this rectangle right over here.

108
00:06:20,258 --> 00:06:22,425
Easy to figure out the area of a rectangle.

109
00:06:22,456 --> 00:06:26,360
And we can break it down into this purple part, this triangle right here.

110
00:06:26,391 --> 00:06:28,752
Easy to figure out the area of a triangle.

111
00:06:28,752 --> 00:06:31,021
And that will be the total distance we traveled.

112
00:06:31,021 --> 00:06:33,367
And even this will hopefully make some intuition.

113
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:38,376
Because this blue area is how far would we have traveled if we were not accelerating,

114
00:06:38,376 --> 00:06:41,697
If we just went 5 m/s, four 4 seconds.

115
00:06:41,697 --> 00:06:46,967
So if you go 5 m/s times (so this is 1 second, 2 second, 3 second, 4 second)

116
00:06:46,967 --> 00:06:50,740
So you're going from 0 sec.. time 0 from time 4

117
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:58,989
Your change in time is 4 seconds, so if you go 5 m/s for 4 seconds, you're going to go 20 meters.

118
00:06:58,989 --> 00:07:04,122
This right here is 20 meters. That is the area of this right here.

119
00:07:04,122 --> 00:07:12,166
5 times 4. This .. this.. this.. mag(enta).. I guess purple or magenta area tells you how further than this are you going

120
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:16,572
because you are accelerating because you kept going faster and faster and faster.

121
00:07:16,572 --> 00:07:18,635
It's pretty easy to calculate this area.

122
00:07:18,635 --> 00:07:24,231
The base here is still 5 cause that's 5 seconds have gone by.

123
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:25,469
And what is the height here?

124
00:07:25,469 --> 00:07:33,853
The height here is my final velocity minus my initial velocity.

125
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:38,069
Or it's the change in velocity due to the acceleration.

126
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:43,091
And the change in velocity due to the acceleration 13 minus 5 is 8.

127
00:07:43,091 --> 00:07:48,418
Or it's this 8 right over here. It is 8 m/s

128
00:07:48,418 --> 00:07:50,877
So this height right over here is 8 m/s.

129
00:07:50,877 --> 00:07:54,447
The base right over here is 5... eh sorry, it's 4 seconds.

130
00:07:54,447 --> 00:07:59,036
That's the time that passed. So what's the area of this triangle?

131
00:07:59,036 --> 00:08:06,978
The area of a triangle is 1/2 times the base which is 4 seconds, times the height.

132
00:08:06,978 --> 00:08:10,507
which is 8 m/s, times 8 m/s.

133
00:08:10,507 --> 00:08:20,832
seconds cancel out, 1/2 times 4 is 2, times 8 is equal to 16 meters.

134
00:08:20,832 --> 00:08:26,799
So the total distance we traveled is 20 plus 16, is 36 meters.

135
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:29,601
That is the total, or I could say total displacement.

136
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:33,046
And, once again, it is to the right since it is positive.

137
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,542
This is our displacement.

138
00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:41,052
Now, what I want to do is this exact same calculations, but keep it in variable form and that will give another formula

139
00:08:41,052 --> 00:08:46,902
that many people often memorize, but I want you to understand that it is a completely intuitive formula and it just comes out of the

140
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:51,341
kind of the logical flow of reasoning that we went through this video.

141
00:08:51,341 --> 00:08:56,102
What is the area? Once again if we use it in the, (if we just think about the variables)

142
00:08:56,102 --> 00:09:01,818
well, the area of this rectangle right here is our initial velocity,

143
00:09:01,818 --> 00:09:06,744
times our change in time

144
00:09:06,744 --> 00:09:11,152
so that's the blue, this is the blue rectangle right over here.

145
00:09:11,152 --> 00:09:13,451
And then, plus, what do have to do?

146
00:09:13,451 --> 00:09:17,569
We have the change in time, once again, we have the change in time.

147
00:09:17,569 --> 00:09:24,228
Times this height, which is our final velocity

148
00:09:24,228 --> 00:09:29,692
minus our initial velocity (these are all vectors)

149
00:09:29,692 --> 00:09:32,093
(well, they're just positive telling us we're going to the right)

150
00:09:32,093 --> 00:09:35,836
and if we just multiply the base times the height, that would give us the area of this entire rectangle.

151
00:09:35,836 --> 00:09:39,649
We have to take it by half because the triangle is only half of that rectangle.

152
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:47,832
So times 1/2, so this is the area, this is the purple area.

153
00:09:47,832 --> 00:09:53,496
(That's not purple) this is the purple area right over here.

154
00:09:53,496 --> 00:09:57,420
This is the area of this, this is the area of that

155
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,461
And let's simplify this a little bit. Let's factor out a delta t

156
00:10:00,569 --> 00:10:05,852
So if you factor out a delta t, you get delta t times a bunch of stuff.

157
00:10:05,852 --> 00:10:11,599
v sub i, so your initial velocity

158
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:16,762
We factor this out, plus this stuff. Plus this thing right over here

159
00:10:16,762 --> 00:10:24,093
And we can distribute the 1/2. We factored, we factored the 1/2 (sorry) we factored the delta t's out.

160
00:10:24,093 --> 00:10:26,642
And let's multiply the 1/2 times each of these things.

161
00:10:26,658 --> 00:10:32,530
So it's going to be plus 1/2 times Vf, our final velocity

162
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:37,828
(That's not the right color, let me actually do it in the right color so that you actually understand what I'm doing.)

163
00:10:37,828 --> 00:10:45,603
So this is the 1/2, so plus 1/2 times our final velocity

164
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:57,584
minus 1/2 times our initial velocity (I want to do that in blue. Sorry I'm having trouble changing colors today.)

165
00:10:57,584 --> 00:11:03,578
Minus 1/2 times our initial velocity.

166
00:11:03,578 --> 00:11:05,447
And now what does this simplify into?

167
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:09,624
We have something plus 1/2 times something else, minus 1/2 times that original something

168
00:11:09,624 --> 00:11:14,517
So what is Vi minus 1/2 times Vi

169
00:11:14,517 --> 00:11:18,871
So anything minus half of it, you're just going to have a positive half left.

170
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:24,695
So these two terms this term and this term will simplify to

171
00:11:24,711 --> 00:11:35,371
1/2 Vi, 1/2 the initial velocity plus 1/2 times the final velocity.

172
00:11:35,371 --> 00:11:45,306
And all of that is being multiplied by our change in time, or the time that has gone by.

173
00:11:45,306 --> 00:11:50,712
And this tells us the distance that we traveled.

174
00:11:50,712 --> 00:11:56,526
Or another way to think about it, let's factor out this 1/2.

175
00:11:56,526 --> 00:12:02,949
You get distance is equal to change in time, times factoring out the 1/2.

176
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:07,439
Vi plus Vf (No that's not the right color)

177
00:12:15,947 --> 00:12:24,084
So this is interesting, the distance we traveled is equal to 1/2 of the initial velocity plus the final velocity.

178
00:12:24,438 --> 00:12:29,307
So this is really, if you just took this quantity right over here is just the arithmetic.

179
00:12:30,722 --> 00:12:35,810
(I always have trouble saying that word) is the arithmetic mean of these two numbers.

180
00:12:36,163 --> 00:12:40,033
So I'm going to define this as something new. I'm going to call this the average velocity.

181
00:12:40,048 --> 00:12:42,357
But we have to be very careful with this.

182
00:12:42,357 --> 00:12:47,058
This right here is the average velocity.

183
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:53,967
But the only reason why I can just take the starting velocity and the ending velocity and adding them together and then divide by two

184
00:12:53,967 --> 00:12:57,113
it's actually taking the average of these two things which would be some place over here.

185
00:12:57,113 --> 00:13:02,248
And I take that as the average velocity is because my acceleration is constant

186
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:07,793
Which is usually an assumption in every introductory physics class, but it's not always the assumption.

187
00:13:07,793 --> 00:13:16,380
But if you do have a constant acceleration like this, you can assume that the average velocity is going to be the average of

188
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:22,165
the initial velocity and the final velocity. If this was a curve, if the acceleration was changing,

189
00:13:22,165 --> 00:13:27,894
you could not do that. But what's useful about this, is if you want to figure out the distance that was traveled,

190
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:33,509
you just need to know the initial velocity and the final velocity, average the two,

191
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:37,080
and then multiply that times the time that goes by.

192
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:41,335
So in this situation, our final velocity is 13 m/s,

193
00:13:41,335 --> 00:13:47,412
Our initial velocity was 5 m/s. So you have 13 plus 5 is equal to 18.

194
00:13:47,412 --> 00:13:53,180
You divide that by two. Your average velocity is 9 m/s

195
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:59,985
if you take the average of 13 and 5. And then 9 m/s times 4 seconds gives you 36 meters.

196
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,128
So hopefully that doesn't confuse you. I just wanna show you where some of these things that you'll see in your physics class

197
00:14:04,128 --> 00:14:08,128
Some of these formulas, why you shouldn't memorize them, and they can all be deduced.
