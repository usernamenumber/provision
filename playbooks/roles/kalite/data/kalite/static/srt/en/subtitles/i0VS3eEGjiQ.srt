1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,640
I've drawn an arbitrary triangle right over here

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,950
And I've also drawn is three medians

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,290
Median EB median FC and median AD

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,770
And we know where the three median intersect

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,210
at point G right over here we call that the centroid

6
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,710
What I wanna do in this video is prove to you

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,850
That centroid is exactly two thirds along the way of each median

8
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,580
Or another way to think about it we can pick any one of

9
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,630
these medians then let's say let's pick EB

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,500
What I wanna do is I wanna prove that EG,

11
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,610
EG is equal to two times GB two times GB

12
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,270
So whatever distance this is it's twice this distance there

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,010
Or other way to think about it is EG is two thirds along

14
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,480
the way of EB and that logic that I'm using to prove this

15
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,330
You can use for any of the medians to show

16
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,050
That the centroid is exactly two thirds along the way of any median

17
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:00,190
Or divides it to a segment that's twice as long as the other segment

18
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:06,540
And to do that let's focus I wanna focus on triangle A B E

19
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,590
Triangle A B E right over here

20
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,190
And I'm gonna draw this median as essentially the way

21
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,090
So let me draw that way I'm gonna try to color code it similarly

22
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:21,190
So we draw it I'm gonna draw it a little bit flatter than that

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,880
So it's like that and then we have the two yellow sides

24
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,270
So it looks something like this

25
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,400
It looks something like that

26
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:35,400
And then we have the centroid right over here at G

27
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:40,470
That is our centroid and then we have this magenta line going to A

28
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,400
Let me draw a little bit neater than that

29
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,300
We have that line going to A

30
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,250
And then we have this blue line going to F right over here

31
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:52,160
We have this blue line going to F

32
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:57,280
And let me label all the points go back to the orange color

33
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:03,170
So this is going to be E, this is going to be B, this is going to be A

34
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,410
This is going to be F right over here

35
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,550
And just to make sure we have all the same markings

36
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,800
That little marking there is that marking

37
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,090
These two markings are on this side right over there

38
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,030
And the whole way that I'm gonna prove

39
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,730
That EG is twice as long as GB is

40
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,230
Just to refer the results that we did I think a couple of videos ago

41
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,650
That the medians divide in this triangle to just

42
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:30,340
Into six smaller triangles that all have equal area

43
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,440
So another way to think about it

44
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,390
Is each of these three smaller triangles have equal layer

45
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,520
These are three of the total of six smaller triangle

46
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,710
So these three all have equal area

47
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,760
So let's think about of this triangle right over here

48
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:46,760
Let's think about of this triangle, triangle AGB

49
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,260
This is triangle AGB right over there those are same triangles

50
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,440
And let's compare that to triangle

51
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:56,270
Let's compare it to triangle EAG right over here

52
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,040
Let's compare it to this triangle which is

53
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,390
This triangle right over here on the original drawing

54
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,130
Now they both have the exact same height if you view EG

55
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,540
As their as their base or not I guess their shared base

56
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,730
They don't have the exact same base

57
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,960
This smaller triangle has the base E oh sorry

58
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,960
The smaller orange triangle has GB as its base

59
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,560
The larger blue triangle has EG as its base

60
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,650
But the definitely have the same height or altitude

61
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,240
When you draw it this way

62
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,570
So their height in both cases is this right over here

63
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,570
Now the other thing that we do know

64
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,020
The other thing that we do know

65
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,090
Is that this blue triangle EAG

66
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,360
Has twice the area of the orange triangle how do we know that?

67
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,670
Because it's got two of these triangles in it

68
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,590
So one way to think about it is this orange triangle has area X

69
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,460
You want me to call it A well I already used A

70
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,040
So I'm gonna call it area X

71
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,440
Then each of these blue triangles have area X

72
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,320
Or you could say this entire blue region

73
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:05,710
This entire blue region has area two X area two X

74
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,410
So if you look at this two blue triangles

75
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:13,910
We know that one half times base time height is equal to area

76
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,800
So we get one half the base is EG one half

77
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,190
I'll do that in green color

78
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:27,880
One half EG times height times this yellow height

79
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,580
Is going to be equal to two X

80
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,040
Is going to be equal to two X

81
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:36,530
I'm just way I'm just applying the formula for the area of a triangle

82
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,700
One half base times height is equals to area this is our area

83
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,520
Now let's do the same thing for this orange triangle

84
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:47,260
One half let me scroll a little bit to the right

85
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:54,750
We have one half GB GB times the yellow height

86
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,330
Times height is going to be equal to X

87
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,880
Is going to be equal to X

88
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,380
Well we can substitute if this is equal to X we can

89
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:08,310
We can place this entire expression right over here for X

90
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,140
So let's do that we get one half

91
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,560
And you might already see where this is going

92
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,770
But I won't I won't skip any steps here

93
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:24,130
We get one half time EG times H times H

94
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:29,730
Is equals to two is equals to two time X

95
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,270
But instead of X I'm gonna write this here

96
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:37,190
As you can look so two times two times one half times GB

97
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,860
Times this length times the base of the smaller triangle

98
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,730
Times H times H

99
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,200
And now we can just simplify this

100
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,250
We have two times one half is just going to be

101
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,690
It's just going to be one you can divide both sides by H

102
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,440
And we are left with one half EG is equals to GB

103
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:00,800
Or we could write EG over two is equal

104
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,790
Let me do this in same color since I've gone this far

105
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,450
With the same colors

106
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:13,650
So we can write we can write on half EG, EG is equal to GB

107
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,660
Is equal to GB and we're done

108
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,610
This is essentially saying that GB is half of EG

109
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:25,710
GB is half of EG so for example if EG is two

110
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,840
This is going to be one if EG is four this is going to be two

111
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,570
So we've actually proven our result

112
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,730
We'll actually let's go back to

113
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,970
This is the result we wanted to prove to get to there

114
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,750
We just multiply both sides of this equation by two

115
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,120
You multiply thisthe left hand side by two you get EG

116
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:43,250
You multiply the right hand side by two you get GB

117
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,020
So we've proven the EG is twice GB

118
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,830
And you can apply the same logic to any of the medians

119
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,160
To show that the centroid

120
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:54,920
Is exactly two thirds along the way of the median.
