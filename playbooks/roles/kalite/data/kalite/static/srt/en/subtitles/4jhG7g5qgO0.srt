1
00:00:00,124 --> 00:00:06,850
Simply 4a squared b and this whole quantity is being raised to the third power

2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:10,565
Now here we'll just use the property if we have the product of things,

3
00:00:10,565 --> 00:00:15,163
let's say I have a times b and I'm raising that to some power n

4
00:00:15,163 --> 00:00:20,735
this is just going to be equal to a to the n times b to the n.

5
00:00:20,735 --> 00:00:27,098
And to realize why that happens, let's just try it out with a simple example.

6
00:00:27,098 --> 00:00:32,903
If I have a times b to the third power, what is that going to be equal to?

7
00:00:32,903 --> 00:00:37,222
That is going to be equal to a times be (that's to the first power)

8
00:00:37,222 --> 00:00:40,287
and then times a times b (and that's to the second power)

9
00:00:40,287 --> 00:00:43,491
times a times b (that's to the third power).

10
00:00:43,491 --> 00:00:47,903
We're literally taking this expression and multiplying it three times.

11
00:00:47,903 --> 00:00:51,897
Now, we can just swap these around, because of the communicative

12
00:00:51,897 --> 00:00:55,426
and associative properties of multiplication.

13
00:00:55,426 --> 00:00:58,723
So if we just swap these around and change the order in which we're multiplying,

14
00:00:58,723 --> 00:01:04,435
we can write this as a times a times a times b times b times b.

15
00:01:04,435 --> 00:01:06,572
We have three a's here and three b's.

16
00:01:06,572 --> 00:01:09,358
So this right here is going to be equal to a to the third,

17
00:01:09,358 --> 00:01:12,841
and this right over here is going to be equal to be to the third.

18
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:15,627
So we have a to the third and b to the third, and so it worked.

19
00:01:15,627 --> 00:01:19,110
Hopefully this gives you a sense of why this property holds.

20
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,293
Now let's apply it to the actual problem!

21
00:01:21,293 --> 00:01:25,148
So we have 4 a squared b to the third power.

22
00:01:25,148 --> 00:01:29,513
That means that each of the components in the product are going to b raised

23
00:01:29,513 --> 00:01:34,714
to the third power so that means that we have 4 to the third power times

24
00:01:34,714 --> 00:01:40,705
a squared to the third power times b to the third power

25
00:01:40,705 --> 00:01:42,980
let me color code, this third power

26
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,928
here in mangenta, that's this third power over here

27
00:01:46,928 --> 00:01:49,761
I'm just raising it, sort of taking the product first and then

28
00:01:49,761 --> 00:01:51,200
raising that to the third power

29
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,869
I can take each of the terms in the product eah of the numbers

30
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:57,470
in the product and raised those to third power first

31
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,721
and then take the product. So that's what we are doing

32
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,392
Let's try to simplify this

33
00:02:02,392 --> 00:02:05,504
What is four, what is four to the third power

34
00:02:05,504 --> 00:02:08,290
Four to the first is four, four to the second is 16

35
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:11,355
and we want to multiply 16 times 4,

36
00:02:11,355 --> 00:02:15,303
So 4 to the third power is just 4 times 4 times 4 is 64.

37
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:19,714
and then we have a squared and we are raising that

38
00:02:19,714 --> 00:02:22,826
to the third power. We know from the product property of

39
00:02:22,826 --> 00:02:26,820
the exponents that's going to be a to the 2 times 3 power

40
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,906
or a to the sixth power, so this is a to the sixth power

41
00:02:30,906 --> 00:02:35,179
we got six from 2 times three and then finaly

42
00:02:35,179 --> 00:02:39,591
we juste have b to the third power, let me do that in a different colour

43
00:02:39,591 --> 00:02:43,027
we just have b to the third power and I'll juste write it over here

44
00:02:43,027 --> 00:02:47,300
So we simplify this expression to 64 a to the sixth

45
00:02:47,300 --> 99:59:59,999
b to the third power.
