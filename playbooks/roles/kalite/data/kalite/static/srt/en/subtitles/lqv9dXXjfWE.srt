1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,220
We're on problem 148.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,440
What is the tens digit of positive integer x.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,960
We want to know the tens digit.

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,470
Statement one tells us x divided by 100

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,170
has a remainder of 30.

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,990
Well, then we know the tens digit is 3, right?

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,990
Because, let's say 30 divided by 100 has remainder of 30

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,910
and its tens digit is 3.

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,220
130 divided by 100 has a remainder of 30

10
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,680
and its remainder is 3.

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,490
And I can make an argument that any number,

12
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,660
when you divide it by 100 that has a remainder of 30,

13
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,840
its tens digit is going to be 3.

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,810
In fact, that number is going to be 3, 0.

15
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,500
And its going to have a bunch of other digits here,

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:48,870
there, there.

17
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,140
And if you just divide this by 100,

18
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,000
you're going to be left over with 30.

19
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,100
So statement one is sufficient to figure out

20
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,990
what the tens digit of the number is.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,390
Statement two.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,770
So we could write x divided by 110

23
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,770
has a remainder equal to 30.

24
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,500
Well, this is a little different case.

25
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,750
So, definitely, when 30 is divided by 110 the remainder is 30,

26
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,270
because it goes into it 0 times.

27
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,240
So the remainder is 30.

28
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,550
And then the tens digit is 3.

29
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,270
So let's see, I'm going to try to find other numbers

30
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,860
when they're divided by 110 its remainder is 30

31
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,450
but its tens digit is something else.

32
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,410
So let's see. 140.

33
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:35,750
If I divide that by 110, I'm left with a remainder of 30.

34
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,110
But its tens digit is what?

35
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,210
Its tens digit is 4, right?

36
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,550
I shouldn't draw an arrow here.

37
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:48,370
If I did-- let's see, I go up one more-- 250.

38
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:52,560
250, you divide it by 110, its remainder is 30.

39
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,980
But its tens digit is 5.

40
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,890
So this statement gives me no information.

41
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,560
Saying that the remainder is 30 still gives me no information

42
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,280
The tens digit can be any of these numbers,

43
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,020
or a bunch more if I just kept going.

44
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,990
So statement one is sufficient to answer this question.

45
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,850
Question 149.

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,690
If x, y, and z are positive integers, is x minus y odd?

47
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,000
In order for this to happen,

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,190
one of these have to be odd and one have to be even.

49
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,520
And you can just think about that.

50
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,470
If you take the difference,or really the sum,

51
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,100
of two numbers, the only way that that difference

52
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,460
or sum is going to be odd is if one is odd and one is even.

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,310
So let's think about that.

54
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,580
Let's look at the statements.

55
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,310
Just going to see if they give us any information.

56
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,540
They say that x is equal to z squared.

57
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,820
Well, that gives me no information about y.

58
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,890
And it gives me, actually,

59
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,950
very little information about x just yet.

60
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,110
I mean, it tells me that x is a perfect square,

61
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,040
but a perfect square could be odd or even, right?

62
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,980
It could be 16, it could be 9.

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,060
16's an even perfect square,9 is an odd one.

64
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,470
So this doesn't give me much information by itself.

65
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,470
Let's see what statement two tells us.

66
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:13,880
Statement two says that y is equal to z minus 1 squared.

67
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,780
So this statement, by itself,is kind of like statement one.

68
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,530
It just tells me that y is a perfect square of some integer,

69
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,560
right?

70
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,800
Because z is an integer, so z minus 1 is an integer.

71
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,990
So it just tells you y is a perfect square.

72
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,600
And a perfect square could be even or odd.

73
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,940
But if we take both of these together,

74
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,860
then something interesting happens.

75
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,220
For example, if we assume that z is odd,

76
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,370
then its square will also be odd, right?

77
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,220
3 squared is 9, 7 squared is 49.

78
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,860
So if z is odd, then x is odd.

79
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,130
And then z minus 1 would be even and then y would be even.

80
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,310
So one would be odd, one would be even.

81
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,080
And you could do the other way.

82
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,460
You could say if z is even, x is even.

83
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,090
And if z is even, then z minus one is odd.

84
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,420
And y is odd.

85
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,700
And I can prove it to you mathematically.

86
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,720
Let's write this and substitute for z.

87
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:06,170
So x minus y becomes z squared minus z minus 1 squared.

88
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:13,500
And so this becomes z squared minus z squared minus 2z plus 1

89
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,950
And that equals z squared minus z squared

90
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,930
plus 2z, right?

91
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,170
Distribute the negative sign.

92
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,150
Plus 2z minus 1.

93
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:31,790
The z squares cancel out and we're left with 2z minus 1.

94
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,010
If we use both statements,x minus y

95
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,750
simplifies to 2z minus 1.

96
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,380
They told us that z is a positive integer.

97
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,860
So this-- this part of the statement right here--

98
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,720
has to be even.

99
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,840
It's a multiple of 2.

100
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,120
So this is even.

101
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,930
And if you subtract 1 from an even number,

102
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,550
this whole expression has to be odd.

103
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,300
So both statements together are sufficient to say that

104
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,750
x minus y is odd.

105
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,210
Next problem. This one looks hairy. 150.

106
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,520
Henry purchased three items during a sale.

107
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,070
He received a 20% discount off the regular price

108
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,660
of the most expensive item

109
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,860
and a 10% discount off the regular price of the other two.

110
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,140
Was the total amount of the three discounts greater than

111
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,140
15% of the sum of the regular price? OK.

112
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,610
So what was the total amount of the three discounts?

113
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:33,250
It was 20% times-- let's just call it item one--

114
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:40,670
20% times item one plus 10% times item too,

115
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:44,430
plus 10% times item three.

116
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,150
And I'm assuming this is the most expensive.

117
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,780
Let's just say this is the second most, I guess.

118
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,200
This is third most expensive.

119
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,620
Maybe they're the same price, I don't know.

120
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,890
This is the total discount. This isn't what he paid.

121
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,450
This is the discount on item one.

122
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,330
The discount on item two.

123
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,250
I'm not saying what they actually paid for item two.

124
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,740
So what the question is,

125
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,500
was a total amount of the three discounts,

126
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:10,190
that's this number,greater than 15% of the sum

127
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,380
of the regular prices.

128
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,620
So they're saying, was that greater than 15% of I1,

129
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:19,280
plus I2, plus I3.

130
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,020
And I think we can simplify this.

131
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,380
Because if we distribute this right-hand side,

132
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:34,320
you get 0.15 times I1 plus 0.15 times I2 plus 0.15 times I3.

133
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:40,700
And let's see, if we subtract out 0.15 I1 from both sides,

134
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:49,030
you get point-- let's see, 0.2 minus 0.15 is 0.05 I1.

135
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,760
And I want to keep everything positive,

136
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,430
so let me subtract these from the right-hand side.

137
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,580
So I'm going to subtract 0.1 I2 from--

138
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,520
I'm going to subtract these from both sides of the equation.

139
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:06,210
So that's going to be greater than 0.15 I2 minus 0.1 I2.

140
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:10,850
So that's 0.05 I2.

141
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,910
Plus, and now to do the same thing for I3.

142
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,650
0.15, 0.1.

143
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:21,990
So I'm going to subtract 0.1 from 0.15. So 0.05 I3.

144
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,710
All I did, going from this to this,

145
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,610
is I just distributed the 0.15

146
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,780
and I subtracted and added to simplify it a little bit.

147
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,210
And, actually, this is interesting, too,

148
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,130
because I just have these 0.05's everywhere.

149
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,280
That's a positive number.

150
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,690
And I was able to do that because I just added

151
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,080
and subtracted from both sides.

152
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,450
But if I multiply or divide by a positive number,

153
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,950
then I don't have to change the inequality,and you could say,

154
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,740
let's just divide both sides of this equation by 0.05.

155
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,470
Or the equivalent is to multiply both sides by 20.

156
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:53,390
But then we're left with I1 is greater than I2 plus I3.

157
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,260
And I think this simplification,

158
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,260
without having read the statements, was worth it.

159
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,910
Because we went from something very convoluted

160
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,830
in a very convoluted problem statement

161
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,720
to something very simple.

162
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,940
So, essentially, they're asking us was the price of I1,

163
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,960
was the price of item one,

164
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,400
greater than the price of item 2 plus item 3.

165
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,370
If we can answer this question,

166
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,790
we can answer the harder question.

167
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,660
So statement number one.

168
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,290
The regular price of the most expensive item was $50.

169
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:24,510
I1 was equal to $50.

170
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,780
And the regular price for the next most expensive item was

171
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,950
$20. So I2 was equal to $20.

172
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,580
So now the question boils down to,

173
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,670
was $50 greater than $20 plus the third most expensive item.

174
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,480
Well, I don't know, depends.

175
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,450
Well, actually, this answers our question, right?

176
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,900
Because I was about to say,

177
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,510
well the third most expensive item, maybe it's $30.

178
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:49,650
But by definition, we know that it's not $30. Why?

179
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,130
Because it was the third most expensive item.

180
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,490
The second most expensive item is $20.

181
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,780
So this thing has to be less than $20

182
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,440
if we are to consider it the third most expensive item.

183
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,180
So if this thing is less than $20,

184
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,450
then the right-hand side of the equation is definitely--

185
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,970
it's going to actually be less than $40.

186
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,600
So this is definitely going to be less than $50,

187
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,850
so this is going to be true.

188
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,890
So it turns out that statement one by itself is sufficient.

189
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,050
Because you just have to realize that

190
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,820
I3 has to be less than $20 if I2 is equal to $20.

191
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,840
Statement two.

192
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:26,560
The regular price of the least expensive item was $15.

193
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,880
So let's see. That statement by itself,

194
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,670
we get I1 is greater than I2 plus $15,

195
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,670
where this is the least expensive item.

196
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:40,530
So just looking at this, we know this is going to be $15,

197
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,710
this is going to be more than $15-- yeah, this is hard.

198
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:49,730
You can't say anything about this, because maybe I1 is $17.

199
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,760
Maybe I2 is $16 plus $15.

200
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,650
And in this case, it would not be the case.

201
00:09:55,650 --> 00:10:01,140
Or maybe I1 is $170 and I2 is $16 plus $15,

202
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,400
in which case it would be the case.

203
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,260
So statement two, by itself,isn't sufficient.

204
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,150
So the answer to this is a.

205
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,690
Statement one alone is sufficient to answer this question.

206
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,610
