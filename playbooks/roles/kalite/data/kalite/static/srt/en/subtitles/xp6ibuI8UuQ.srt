1
00:00:01,184 --> 00:00:04,807
All the problems we've been dealing with so far have essentially

2
00:00:04,807 --> 00:00:11,494
been happening in one dimension. You could go forward or backwards.

3
00:00:11,494 --> 00:00:14,027
or right or left, or you could go up or down.

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:19,900
What I want to talk about in this video is what happens when we have two dimensions

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:25,333
or three or four, or really an arbitrary number of dimensions

6
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,333
although if we're dealing with mechanics

7
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:30,906
we normally don't have to go more than three dimensions.

8
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:33,878
But we're going to deal with more than one dimension, or two dimensions,

9
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:36,711
we're also going to be dealing with two-dimensional vectors.

10
00:00:36,711 --> 00:00:38,522
I just want to make sure that through this video

11
00:00:38,522 --> 00:00:41,540
that we understand at least the basics of two-dimensional vectors.

12
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:45,859
Remember, a vector is something that has both magnitude and direction.

13
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:47,970
The first thing I want to do is give you a visual understanding

14
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:52,000
of how vectors in two dimensions would add.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,660
So let's say that I have a vector here that is Vector A,

16
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:02,844
and once again, its magnitude is specified by the length of this arrow

17
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:09,095
Its direction by the direction of the arrow, so it's going in that direction.

18
00:01:09,126 --> 00:01:15,117
I have another vector, called Vector B

19
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:16,045
It looks like this,

20
00:01:16,045 --> 00:01:19,528
What I want to do in this video is to think about what happens when I add

21
00:01:19,528 --> 00:01:23,940
Vector A to Vector B. So there's a couple of things to think about when you visually depict vectors

22
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,912
The important thing is for example, Vector A, that you get the length right,

23
00:01:26,912 --> 00:01:31,510
and also get the direction right. Where you draw it doesn't matter,

24
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:35,597
So this could be Vector A, and this could also be Vector A.

25
00:01:35,597 --> 00:01:40,380
Notice, it has the same length, and also the same direction.

26
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,727
I could draw it up here, or there; it does not matter.

27
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:48,182
I could draw Vector B over here

28
00:01:48,182 --> 00:01:50,200
It's still Vector B; it still has the same magnitude,

29
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,711
and the same direction.

30
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:56,866
We're not saying its tail has to start at the same place that Vector A's tail starts.

31
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:59,200
I could draw Vector B over here

32
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,600
So I can always have the same vector, but I can shift it around.

33
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,569
As long as it has the same magnitude, the same length, and the same direction.

34
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:12,656
And the whole reason I'm doing that is because the way to visually add vectors,

35
00:02:12,656 --> 00:02:14,281
If I wanted to add Vector A,

36
00:02:14,281 --> 00:02:20,922
plus Vector B,

37
00:02:20,922 --> 00:02:23,662
and I'll show you how to do it more analytically,

38
00:02:23,662 --> 00:02:25,380
in a future video

39
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:32,300
I can literally draw Vector A,

40
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:39,312
And then I can draw Vector B, but I put the tail of Vector B to the head of Vector A.

41
00:02:39,312 --> 00:02:44,142
I shift it so it's tail is right at the head of Vector A.

42
00:02:44,142 --> 00:02:48,461
so it will look something like this.

43
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:52,200
And then if you go from the tail of A,

44
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,774
all the way to the head of B,

45
00:02:56,774 --> 00:03:00,303
and you call that Vector C,

46
00:03:00,303 --> 00:03:06,061
That is the sum of A and B.

47
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,966
And it should make sense.

48
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:11,000
If you think about it, let's say these were displacement vectors,

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,514
so A shows you're being displaced this much in this direction

50
00:03:14,514 --> 00:03:18,600
B shows you're being displaced this much in this direction, the length of B in this direction

51
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,244
And if I were to say you have a displacement of A

52
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,380
And then you have a displacement of B,

53
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,067
what is your total displacement?

54
00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:30,733
So you would have to be shifted this far in this direction,

55
00:03:30,733 --> 00:03:33,693
and then shifted this far in this direction

56
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:37,780
so the net amount that you've been shifting is this far in this direction

57
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,845
This would the be the sum of those.

58
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:47,532
Now we can use that same idea to break down a vector in two dimensions,

59
00:03:47,532 --> 00:03:53,430
and I'll give you a sense of what that means in a second,

60
00:03:53,430 --> 00:04:04,251
If I have Vector A, let's call this Vector X

61
00:04:04,251 --> 00:04:09,498
I could say that Vector X is going to be the sum of

62
00:04:09,498 --> 00:04:12,935
This vector right here in green,

63
00:04:12,935 --> 00:04:15,467
and this vector in red

64
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:19,667
Notice, if X starts at the tail of the green vector,

65
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:22,920
and goes all the way to the head of the magenta vector,

66
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,985
and if the magenta vector starts at the head of the green vector,

67
00:04:25,985 --> 00:04:32,161
and then finishes at where Vector X finishes,

68
00:04:32,161 --> 00:04:38,988
Hopefully from this explanation right here, you can see

69
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:42,331
green vector plus magenta vector gives us this X vector

70
00:04:42,331 --> 00:04:48,647
I put the head of the green vector to the tail of this magenta vector

71
00:04:48,647 --> 00:04:52,641
but the whole reason why I did this is that

72
00:04:52,641 --> 00:04:55,567
if I can express X as the sum of these two vectors

73
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:58,028
it then breaks down X into it's vertical component

74
00:04:58,028 --> 99:59:59,999
and it's horizontal component
