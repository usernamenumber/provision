1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,936
In the last video we first thought about the externalities.

2
00:00:03,936 --> 00:00:07,361
The negative externalities of having plastic bags around.

3
00:00:07,361 --> 00:00:08,557
It causes litter,

4
00:00:08,557 --> 00:00:11,231
it might damage animals and the environment in some way.

5
00:00:11,231 --> 00:00:14,050
And we assumed in that video

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:19,007
that we were able to calculate the actual external cost of a plastc bag.

7
00:00:19,007 --> 00:00:22,626
These two cents a bag is the impact on litter and the environment.

8
00:00:22,626 --> 00:00:25,563
And then we were able to figure out that if we factored this in,

9
00:00:25,563 --> 00:00:28,723
instead of just having the regular marginal cost curve of the suppliers,

10
00:00:28,723 --> 00:00:32,041
if we added that marginal cost curve to the external cost,

11
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:36,105
we would get a supplier plus external cost marginal cost curve.

12
00:00:36,105 --> 00:00:41,916
And then we get what is actually the optimal price and quantity of plastic bags,

13
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,858
so that we actually do not eat into our surplus

14
00:00:44,858 --> 00:00:46,873
by creating all of this negative surplus

15
00:00:46,873 --> 00:00:49,121
where the total costs of the bags

16
00:00:49,121 --> 00:00:51,639
are higher than the total benefit.

17
00:00:51,639 --> 00:00:55,377
But one thing that we did not touch on in that video is how does this actually happen.

18
00:00:55,577 --> 00:00:58,850
If we just let things be

19
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,523
and we just had the suppliers' marginal cost curve

20
00:01:01,523 --> 00:01:04,185
and we have the consumers' demand curve,

21
00:01:04,185 --> 00:01:06,513
and in this case the consumers were the supermarkets,

22
00:01:06,513 --> 00:01:09,863
then the equilibrium price would be right over here

23
00:01:09,863 --> 00:01:13,721
because this, although, theoretically saying that there is this cost over here,

24
00:01:13,721 --> 00:01:18,374
the cost won't be factored in into the markets.

25
00:01:18,374 --> 00:01:22,518
So if you are the benevolent emperor in this society,

26
00:01:22,518 --> 00:01:23,818
what do you do?

27
00:01:23,818 --> 00:01:28,056
What do you do to get the quantity closer to this point right over here

28
00:01:28,056 --> 00:01:32,842
than what the equilibrium quantity will be when you don't factor in the external cost?

29
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,443
And there is a bunch of options here.

30
00:01:34,443 --> 00:01:37,661
You could just ban plastic bags,

31
00:01:41,108 --> 00:01:44,625
You could put a quota on plastic bags.

32
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:51,726
saying that more than a certain amount of bags cannot be produced.

33
00:01:51,726 --> 00:01:54,508
Or you could tax plastic bags.

34
00:01:57,199 --> 00:02:01,514
Now, let's think about which of these will result in the most surplus,

35
00:02:01,514 --> 00:02:04,788
the most benefit to society in aggregate.

36
00:02:04,788 --> 00:02:06,994
And one core assumption we are going to make

37
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:12,935
is that this is an accurate assessment of the external cost per bag.

38
00:02:12,935 --> 00:02:16,502
So if you were to just ban plastic bags as this benevolent emperor,

39
00:02:16,502 --> 00:02:20,408
maybe seemingly or hopefully benevolent emperor of this society right here.

40
00:02:20,408 --> 00:02:22,511
If you just banned plastic bags, what would happen?

41
00:02:22,511 --> 00:02:25,646
Well, then this market just won't exist

42
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:29,381
and all of this surplus that could have existed, won't exist anymore.

43
00:02:29,381 --> 00:02:31,833
So you would actually be destroying surplus.

44
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:35,736
Now, you could say: "No, plastic bags are horrible. They should just be outright banned."

45
00:02:35,736 --> 00:02:40,257
"There is no amount of benefit for which plastic bags are worth using."

46
00:02:40,257 --> 00:02:43,179
But in that case you are actually arguing this point right over here.

47
00:02:43,179 --> 00:02:48,841
You would be arguing that it's not two cents a bag, it's ten cents a bag of negative externality.

48
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:52,442
And because of that, then you would have this curve shift up even more.

49
00:02:52,442 --> 00:02:54,850
And then, there is no positive quanity there.

50
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,492
And then, maybe a ban would be all right.

51
00:02:56,492 --> 00:02:59,843
But if the two cents is the externality, the negative externality

52
00:02:59,843 --> 00:03:01,833
and if you were to ban plastic bags

53
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:07,405
then you would actually be removing this surplus from society.

54
00:03:07,405 --> 00:03:10,454
So that doesn't seem like a good option.

55
00:03:10,578 --> 00:03:12,376
Now, what about the quota?

56
00:03:13,097 --> 00:03:15,444
You kind of look at the study right over here and say:

57
00:03:15,444 --> 00:03:20,504
"Look, the optimal amount of plastic bags is 1.9 mln bags per week,

58
00:03:20,504 --> 00:03:24,865
so I will just say that's the most that the market can produce."

59
00:03:24,865 --> 00:03:28,040
But when you say that, that's assuming that you really do understand

60
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,103
what does demand curve look like...

61
00:03:30,103 --> 00:03:32,333
I just drew a straight line here, just to add simplicity.

62
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:36,238
...assuming you really do understand what this marginal cost curve looks like.

63
00:03:36,238 --> 00:03:40,640
And throughout this play we've been assuming that we kind of do understand those things,

64
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,739
but in the real world it's actually very hard

65
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:46,590
to know exactly what the marginal cost curve looks like.

66
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,722
And it's also hard to know exactly what the marginal benefit curve,

67
00:03:49,722 --> 00:03:51,252
rather than the demand curve looks like.

68
00:03:51,252 --> 00:03:53,253
Especially, because they are always changing.

69
00:03:53,253 --> 00:03:55,109
There is always more competitors, less competitors,

70
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,500
more substitute products, more R&D.

71
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,739
Things are getting more efficient, less efficient.

72
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:05,500
And so, it's very hard to know what the true equilibrium quantity should be.

73
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,100
So, a quota is difficult.

74
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,357
You don't have quite the right information.

75
00:04:10,634 --> 00:04:12,573
A tax is interesting.

76
00:04:12,573 --> 00:04:16,404
Because the tax says: "Look, regardless of what the marginal cost curve really is,

77
00:04:16,404 --> 00:04:19,447
we are just going to shift it up by two cents."

78
00:04:19,447 --> 00:04:21,936
We saw that when we first talked about taxes.

79
00:04:21,936 --> 00:04:24,108
When we first talked about taxes,

80
00:04:24,108 --> 00:04:26,514
we talked about: "Hey, they are introducing a deadweight loss,

81
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:30,403
because you are not producing as much quantity as you would have otherwise

82
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,840
or as much quantity isn't being consumed."

83
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,776
But here a tax could actually prevent a deadweight loss

84
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,189
because if you have a two-cent tax,

85
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:42,660
essentially adding the cost of the negative externality in the form of a tax,

86
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,079
on top of the suppliers' cost right over here,

87
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,041
you are going to cause the equilibrium quantity

88
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:53,848
to be the quantity where you are not generating all of this negative surplus.

89
00:04:53,848 --> 00:04:55,834
And it's just the positive side effect.

90
00:04:55,834 --> 00:04:58,659
Once again, this is all assuming that this is the right numer.

91
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:00,442
But it would be a positive side effect

92
00:05:00,442 --> 00:05:03,380
that you would also generate some revenue for the government.

93
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,046
And what is good about the tax

94
00:05:05,046 --> 00:05:06,816
in this circumstance right over here,

95
00:05:06,816 --> 00:05:10,000
you are not assuming anything about what the marginal cost curve looks like

96
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,598
or what demand curve looks like.

97
00:05:12,598 --> 00:05:15,042
As long as you are assuming that this is the right number

98
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:17,438
the tax will always shift,

99
00:05:17,438 --> 00:05:19,580
whatever the marginal cost curve is,

100
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,797
it will always shift it to the right point to intersect,

101
00:05:24,336 --> 00:05:26,783
wherever the demand curve is,

102
00:05:26,783 --> 00:05:31,337
at this equilibrium point, that gives us an equilibrium price and an equilibrium quantity.

103
00:05:31,337 --> 00:05:32,690
So if this is the right number

104
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,751
and you put a two-cent tax per bag

105
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:40,378
then this is probably going to be the best option

106
00:05:40,378 --> 00:05:43,861
in terms of optimizing the total surplus.
