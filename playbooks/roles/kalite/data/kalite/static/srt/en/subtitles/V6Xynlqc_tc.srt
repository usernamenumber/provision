1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,640
   

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,430
We're asked to convert these
linear equations into

3
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:08,870
slope-intercept form and then
graph them on a single

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:09,740
coordinate plane.

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,590
We have our coordinate
plane over here.

6
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,720
And just as a bit of a review,
slope-intercept form is a form

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:20,910
y is equal to mx plus b,
where m is the slope

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,510
and b is the intercept.

9
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,050
That's why it's called
slope-intercept form.

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,020
So we just have to algebraically
manipulate these

11
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,440
equations into this form.

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,540
So let's start with line A,
so start with a line A.

13
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:39,230
So line A, it's in standard form
right now, it's 4x plus

14
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,570
2y is equal to negative 8.

15
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,160
The first thing I'd like to do
is get rid of this 4x from the

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,880
left-hand side, and the best way
to do that is to subtract

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,460
4x from both sides
of this equation.

18
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,420
So let me subtract 4x
from both sides.

19
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,880
The left hand side of the
equation, these two 4x's

20
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,440
cancel out, and I'm just left
with 2y is equal to.

21
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:10,480
And on the right-hand side I
have negative 4x minus is 8,

22
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,430
or negative 8 minus 4, however
you want to do it.

23
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,890
Now we're almost at
slope-intercept form.

24
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,330
We just have to get rid of this
2, and the best way to do

25
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,770
that that I can think of is
divide both sides of this

26
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,220
equation by 2.

27
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,250
So let's divide both
sides by 2.

28
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,190
So we divide the left-hand side
by 2 and then divide the

29
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,700
right-hand side by 2.

30
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,750
You have to divide
every term by 2.

31
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:37,980
And then we are left with y is
equal to negative 4 divided by

32
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,540
2 is negative 2x.

33
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:45,070
Negative 8 divided by
2 is negative 4,

34
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,480
negative 2x minus 4.

35
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,900
So this is line A, let me
graph it right now.

36
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,420
So line A, its y-intercept
is negative 4.

37
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,100
So the point 0, negative
4 on this graph.

38
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,790
If x is equal to 0, y is going
to be equal to negative 4, you

39
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,150
can just substitute
that in the graph.

40
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,330
So 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

41
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,979
That's the point
0, negative 4.

42
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,300
That's the y-intercept
for line A.

43
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,770
And then the slope
is negative 2x.

44
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:23,830
So that means that if I change
x by positive 1 that y goes

45
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,150
down by negative 2.

46
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,460
So let's do that.

47
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,250
So if I go over one in the
positive direction, I have to

48
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,870
go down 2, that's what a
negative slope's going to do,

49
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,920
negative 2 slope.

50
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,750
If I go over 2, I'm going
to have to go down 4.

51
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,460
If I go back negative 1, so
if I go in the x direction

52
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,540
negative 1, that means in the y
direction I go positive two,

53
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,620
because two divided by negative
one is still negative

54
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,850
two, so I go over here.

55
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,390
If I go back 2, I'm
going to go up 4.

56
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,300
Let me just do that.

57
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,490
Back 2 and then up 4.

58
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,120
So this line is going
to look like this.

59
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,000
   

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,160
Do my best to draw it,
that's a decent job.

61
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,550
That is line A right there.

62
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,710
All right, let's do line B.

63
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:20,310
So line B, they say 4x is equal
to negative 8, and you

64
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,850
might be saying hey, how do I
get that into slope-intercept

65
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,040
form, I don't see a y.

66
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,190
And the answer is you won't be
able to because you this can't

67
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,900
be put into slope-intercept
form, but we can simplify it.

68
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,240
So let's divide both sides
of this equation by 4.

69
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,060
So you divide both sides
of this equation by 4.

70
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,680
And you get x is equal
to negative 2.

71
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,520
So this just means, I don't care
what your y is, x is just

72
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,190
always going to be equal
to negative 2.

73
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,110
So x is equal to negative 2 is
right there, negative 1,

74
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,850
negative 2, and x is just always
going to be equal to

75
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:59,620
negative 2 in both directions.

76
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,180
And this is the x-axis,
that's the y-axis, I

77
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,660
forgot to label them.

78
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,880
Now let's do this last
character, 2y is equal to

79
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,630
negative eight.

80
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:12,310
So line C, we have 2y is
equal to negative 8.

81
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:18,980
We can divide both sides of this
equation by 2, and we get

82
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,570
y is equal to negative 4.

83
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,020
So you might say hey, Sal, that
doesn't look like this

84
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,130
form, slope-intercept
form, but it is.

85
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,580
It's just that the slope is 0.

86
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,960
We can rewrite this as y is
equal to 0x minus 4, where the

87
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,260
y-intercept is negative
4 and the slope is 0.

88
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:47,070
   

89
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,810
So if you move an arbitrary
amount in the x direction, the

90
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,570
y is not going to change,
it's just going to

91
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:52,760
stay at negative 4.

92
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,760
Let me do a little bit neater.

93
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,450
y is just going to stay
at negative 4.

94
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,710
Or you can just interpret it as
y is equal to negative 4 no

95
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,950
matter what x is.

96
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,490
So then we are done.
