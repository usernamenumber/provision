1
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:03,998
Where we left off in the last video we were beginning to try

2
00:00:03,998 --> 00:00:07,748
to figure out what the 24 roots of

3
00:00:07,748 --> 00:00:11,034
1 were and then we're going to square those 24 roots, take the absolute value of their

4
00:00:11,034 --> 00:00:15,586
imaginary part and then sum them up. So let's once again, let's just think about the

5
00:00:15,586 --> 00:00:20,647
roots that matter. So this over here we figured out this is pi over 12

6
00:00:20,647 --> 00:00:23,652
so let me, this is pi over 12...

7
00:00:23,652 --> 00:00:26,885
it's the angle, I guess I should say, that's either the pi over 12i

8
00:00:26,885 --> 00:00:31,635
let's just focus on the angle here, this over here is 2pi over 12

9
00:00:31,635 --> 00:00:35,193
or pi over 6. This over here is 3pi over 12, or

10
00:00:35,193 --> 00:00:39,395
pi over 4, this over here is 4pi over 12

11
00:00:39,395 --> 00:00:43,947
4 pi over 12, or pi over 3, and this right over

12
00:00:43,947 --> 00:00:48,262
here is 5pi over 12. This is 5pi over 12.

13
00:00:48,262 --> 00:00:51,683
5pi over 12. And then this obviously

14
00:00:51,683 --> 00:00:55,180
is just 6pi over 12 or pi over 2. We could keep going, but before we keep going

15
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,183
and this will really just simplify the math a little bit. Remember we're going to have to

16
00:00:59,183 --> 00:01:02,746
square these roots. So let's just think about if we have some complex number, a + bi

17
00:01:02,746 --> 00:01:07,211
If we have some complex number a + bi

18
00:01:07,211 --> 00:01:16,767
Let's think about what happens when we square it. This is going to be equal to a^2 + 2abi - b^2

19
00:01:16,767 --> 00:01:22,666
Or we could rewrite it as a^2 - b^2, which will be the real part, and then plus 2abi

20
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:26,696
2ab is the imaginary part.

21
00:01:26,696 --> 00:01:30,852
And the reason why I even took the trouble of writing it this way is to realize that the complex

22
00:01:30,852 --> 00:01:37,099
what we're going to do is square all these complex numbers, and then take the absolute value of the imaginary part.

23
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:41,501
So really all that matters is the absolute value of 2ab

24
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:49,432
Or really, 2 times the absolute value, 2 times the absolute value of ab

25
00:01:49,432 --> 00:01:53,871
Now, these guys all have analogs where either a or b would be negative

26
00:01:53,871 --> 00:02:00,363
So if this guy is, if this guy, this right over here, let's call this a + bi

27
00:02:00,363 --> 00:02:09,921
If you had a - bi, you would be down here. You would be down here, so if this guy is a + bi, a -bi is going to be over here

28
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:15,932
Or you could have -a - bi is going to be over here. -a - bi is going to be over there.

29
00:02:15,932 --> 00:02:21,687
Or you could have -a + bi over here. -a + bi over here.

30
00:02:21,687 --> 00:02:24,015
But the reason why I did this is we showed you just over here

31
00:02:24,015 --> 00:02:28,085
all of these guys, when you square them and you take the absolute value

32
00:02:28,085 --> 00:02:31,684
of the imaginary part of that squared value, it's all going to be the same

33
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:35,913
when you take, it's going to be ab, the absolute value is just going to be ab

34
00:02:35,913 --> 00:02:40,306
the absolute value is just still going to be ab, so they're all going to be the same

35
00:02:40,306 --> 00:02:43,470
So what we can do is, and each of these guys is going to have the same analog

36
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:50,114
so what we can do is just find the values for these guys, 1, 2, 3, 4, for these 5 guys

37
00:02:50,114 --> 00:02:55,747
over here. And then just multiply whatever we get by 4, because they each have

38
00:02:55,747 --> 00:03:00,037
I guess there's 4 of these around the unit circle and that'll save a lot of our

39
00:03:00,037 --> 00:03:03,165
work. Now the other thing we want to think about. We already said

40
00:03:03,165 --> 00:03:07,706
ignore 1, because we added that root, but even if we didn't remember to ignore it it wouldn't matter

41
00:03:07,706 --> 00:03:13,189
because 1 doesn't have any imaginary part, 1^2 is still 1, 1 does not have any imaginary

42
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:21,303
part. We can also ignore an angle of pi over 2, or 90 degrees

43
00:03:21,303 --> 00:03:23,622
because this has no real part

44
00:03:23,622 --> 00:03:28,067
and you see over here, when you square it it's actually going to take you

45
00:03:28,067 --> 00:03:30,840
over here and it won't have an imaginary part. When you square it, it's

46
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,257
2 times the real times the imaginary part. This has no real part, so this is going to

47
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:38,367
be zero. So this guy will also not contribute. So we really just care

48
00:03:38,367 --> 00:03:42,766
about these angles, right over here, and then we'll square them,

49
00:03:42,766 --> 00:03:45,633
find the absolute value of their imaginary part, and then multiply

50
00:03:45,633 --> 00:03:48,372
everything by 4 because that will correspond to these other,

51
00:03:48,372 --> 00:03:53,781
if you took the imaginary and real parts and made them negative

52
00:03:53,781 --> 00:03:56,107
and it would take us all the way around the unit circle.

53
00:03:56,107 --> 00:03:59,408
so let's think about it a little bit, so let me just write these over here, so the

54
00:03:59,408 --> 00:04:02,732
z's that we're going to think about right now are going to be

55
00:04:02,732 --> 00:04:14,826
e to the pi over 12, e to the pi over 6, e to the pi over 4,

56
00:04:14,826 --> 00:04:18,525
oh e to the pi over 12i, I should say, pi over 6i, pi over 4i,

57
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:26,988
e to the pi over 3i, and then we have e to the 5pi over 12i.

58
00:04:26,988 --> 00:04:34,023
Now we're going to square each of them, and it's nice to leave them in this

59
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:37,238
exponential form when you square it, as it's much easier to square these values

60
00:04:37,238 --> 00:04:40,319
if you square this you're just essentially multiply the exponent times 2

61
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:49,376
so this is going to be e to the pi over 6i, this will be e to the pi over 3i

62
00:04:49,376 --> 00:04:50,939
We're just squaring them.

63
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:54,517
Just taking the square of each of these values

64
00:04:54,517 --> 00:04:57,025
Each of these roots

65
00:04:57,025 --> 00:05:04,571
So e to the pi over 3i, and in here you're going to have e to the pi over 2i,

66
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:13,070
then over here you'll have e to the 2pi over 3i

67
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:21,250
and then finally over here you'll have e to the 5pi over 6i.

68
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,925
Now these are the squared values of these roots here

69
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:27,722
Now let's just think about their imaginary parts.

70
00:05:27,722 --> 00:05:33,952
So this guy right over here can be rewritten

71
00:05:33,952 --> 00:05:39,890
as cosine of pi over 6 plus i-sine of pi over 6.

72
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:48,144
so his imaginary part is sine of pi over 6

73
00:05:48,144 --> 00:05:50,206
This guy's imaginary part, if you expand it out with Euler's formula

74
00:05:50,206 --> 00:05:54,454
cosine of pi over 3 plus i-sine pi over 3

75
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:59,070
So this imaginary part is just going to be sine of pi over 3

76
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,777
Here's going to be sine of pi over 2,

77
00:06:01,777 --> 00:06:05,187
here's going to be sine of 2pi over 3,

78
00:06:05,187 --> 00:06:16,409
and here's going to be sine of 5pi over 6

79
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:19,558
Now we just have to evaluate these guys

80
00:06:19,558 --> 00:06:22,636
and take their absolute value, and then take the sum

81
00:06:22,636 --> 00:06:25,877
and then multiply everything times 4, and we're essentially

82
00:06:25,877 --> 00:06:30,909
in the home stretch. So pi over 6 is 180, actually let me draw

83
00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:39,945
another unit circle over here just so we can visual these angles

84
00:06:39,945 --> 00:06:48,293
so now we have sine of pi over 6, which is the same thing as 30 degrees,

85
00:06:48,293 --> 00:06:55,711
so it looks like this. and we know that the sine of 30 degrees is 1/2

86
00:06:55,711 --> 00:07:03,040
square root of 3 over 2, but this right over here is 1/2

87
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:12,424
sine of pi over 3 is the equivalent of 60 degrees, the sine over here is

88
00:07:12,424 --> 00:07:18,371
square root of 3 over 2, you can figure that out from 30-60-90 triangles

89
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:21,357
then you have sine of pi over 2

90
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:26,077
pi over 2 is that right over there. Well the sine of that is just 1.

91
00:07:26,077 --> 00:07:33,880
The imaginary part of this, or I guess this would evaluate just to i

92
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,592
but the imaginary part which is viewed as the coefficient on the i, which is kind of

93
00:07:37,592 --> 00:07:40,279
nonintuitive, you kind of think it's the whole thing, but when people say

94
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:43,982
the imaginary part, so this will just be 1.

95
00:07:43,982 --> 00:07:51,924
and then sine of 2 pi over 3. So pi over 3 is 60 degrees, so you can view that as

96
00:07:51,924 --> 00:08:01,096
120 degrees. So it's 120 degrees, so it's right over here. So it's going to have

97
00:08:01,096 --> 00:08:08,179
the same sine value as pi over 3.

98
00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:12,277
so it's going to be square root of 3 over 2.

99
00:08:12,277 --> 00:08:18,647
and then sine of 5pi over 6. pi over 6 is 30 degrees, so this is sine of

100
00:08:18,647 --> 00:08:23,141
150 degrees, so it's going to be just like that.

101
00:08:23,141 --> 00:08:28,161
And it's going to have the same sine value as pi over 6, it's going to be 1/2.

102
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:30,695
and lucky for us, these are all positive values

103
00:08:30,695 --> 00:08:35,842
so let's just take the sum. We have 1/2 plus

104
00:08:35,842 --> 00:08:42,861
1/2 is 1, plus another 1 over here is going to be 2, plus

105
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:48,374
the square root of 3 over 2 is square root of 3.

106
00:08:48,374 --> 00:08:54,376
Now remember, for this quadrant over here, we have to do it for all of the

107
00:08:54,376 --> 00:08:58,061
quadrants, so we just need to multiply everything times 4.

108
00:08:58,061 --> 00:09:02,694
so the sum of the absolute value of the imaginary parts of the squares of

109
00:09:02,694 --> 00:09:08,510
the roots is 8 plus 4 square root of 3. and going back

110
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:14,249
to the original problem. we got the answer here

111
00:09:14,249 --> 00:09:19,543
This is 8 plus 4 square roots of 3. I wanna make sure I didn't mess it up, right

112
00:09:19,543 --> 00:09:27,346
so if we want to find m + n + p, it is 8 plus 4 plus 3,

113
00:09:27,346 --> 00:09:29,463
which is equal to 15

114
00:09:29,463 --> 00:09:31,340
and we're done.
