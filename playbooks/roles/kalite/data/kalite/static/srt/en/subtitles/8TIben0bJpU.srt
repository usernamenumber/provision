1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:07,000
Im going to start with a fair coin and I'm going to flip it four times

2
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,090
and the first question i ask is what is the exact probability

3
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:24,590
exactly one head or heads which is one of those confusing things

4
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,000
when you're talking about what side of the coin

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,480
and I know I have been not doing this consistently

6
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,750
I'm tempted to say if you're saying one it feels like

7
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,750
you should do the singular which would be head

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,080
but I read it up on the, I read up a little bit of it

9
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,390
on the internet and it seems like when you're talking about coins,

10
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:42,780
you really should say one heads which seems a little difficult for me

11
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:43,670
but I'll try to go with that

12
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,280
So what is the probability of getting exactly 1 heads?

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,220
And I put that in quots to see the point, which is really...

14
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,000
We are just talking about 1 heads there.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,280
But it's called "heads" when you are doing with coins.

16
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,220
Anyway I think you get what I am talking about.

17
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,020
Let's think about how many different possible ways

18
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,330
we can get four flips over a coin.

19
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,180
So we are going to have one flip, then another flip,

20
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,950
then another flip, then another flip.

21
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,440
And this first flip has two possibilities that could be heads or tails

22
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,890
The second flip has two possibilities that could be heads or tails.

23
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,360
The third flip has two possibilities could be heads or tails.

24
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,000
And the fourth flip has two possibilities that could be heads or tails

25
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,670
So you have 2 times 2 times 2 times 2

26
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,350
which is equal to 16 possibilities.

27
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:36,940
16 possible outcomes when you flip a coin 4 times.16 possible outcomes

28
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,950
And any one of the possible outcomes would be 1/16.

29
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,870
So if I want to say the probability

30
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,480
I am gonna not talk about this one head. If I just take,

31
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,310
just you know maybe this thing has three heads right here.

32
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,050
This is exact sequence of the event.

33
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,290
This is the first flip, second flip, third flip, fourth flip,

34
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,680
getting exactly this. This is exactly 1 out of possible of 16 events.

35
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,510
Now with that out of the way, let's think about

36
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,960
how many of those 16 possibilities involved getting exactly one heads?

37
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,020
We can list them. You could get your heads. So this is equal to

38
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,220
the probability of getting the heads in the first flip,

39
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,020
plus the probability of getting the heads in the second flip,

40
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,600
plus the probablity of getting the heads in the third flip,

41
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,140
remember exactly one heads, nothing at least 1, exactly 1 heads.

42
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,020
So the probability in the third flip,

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,040
and then or the possibility you get the heads in the fourth flip,

44
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,680
tails heads and tails.

45
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,800
And we know already what the probability of each of these things are.

46
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,120
There are 16 possible events.

47
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,830
Each of these are one of those of 16 possible events.

48
00:02:53,230 --> 00:03:03,980
So this is going to be 1/16, 1/16, 1/16 and 1/16.

49
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,590
And so we really saying the probablity of getting exacly one heads

50
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,590
is the same thing as the probability of getting heads

51
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,260
in the first flip or heads in the second flip,

52
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,770
or heads in the third flip or heads in the fourth flip.

53
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,280
And we can add the probablities of these different things

54
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,270
because they are mutually exclusive.

55
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,490
Any two of these things can not happen in the same time.

56
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,440
You have to pick one of these scenarios.

57
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:33,670
So we can add the probabilities 1/16 plus 1/16 plus 1/16

58
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,870
plus 1/16 that gets 4 times of all.

59
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:42,450
Assume that I did. So you'll get 4/16 which is equal to 1/4.

60
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,510
Fair enough. Now let's ask a slightly more interesting question.

61
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:53,020
Let's ask ourselves, the probability of getting exactly 2 "heads".

62
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,900
There is a couple of ways we can think about it.

63
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,520
One is just in the traditional way.

64
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,320
Let's just, the way you know, the number of possibilities,

65
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,530
equally likely possibilities

66
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,540
You could only use methodology because it is a fair coin.

67
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,900
So how many of the total possibilities have the two heads

68
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,990
of the total of the equally likely possibilities.

69
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,010
So we know there are 16 equally likely possibilities.

70
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,960
How many of those have two "heads"?

71
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,360
So I actually ahead of times so we save time.

72
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,790
I have drawn all of the 16 equally likely possibilities.

73
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,270
And how many of these involed two heads?

74
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,270
Well let's see this one over here has two heads.

75
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:41,120
This one over here has two heads. This one over here has two heads.

76
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,770
Let's see that's this one over here has two heads.

77
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,900
And this one over here has two heads.

78
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,630
And then this one over here has two heads.

79
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:00,260
And I believe we are done after that. So if we count them 1,2,3,4,5,6

80
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,600
of the possibilities have exactly two heads.

81
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,680
So 6/16 equally likely possibilities have two heads.

82
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,040
So we have (what is this) 3/8 chance of getting exactly 2 heads.

83
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,510
Now that's kind of what we have been doing in the past.

84
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,530
But I do think about a way

85
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,190
so we wouldn't have to write out all the possibilities.

86
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,140
And the reason why that is useful is we are going to do

87
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,950
the four flips now and if we are doing with 10 flips,

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,360
there is no way that we can write out all the possibilities like this

89
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,670
so I really want a different way of thinking about it.

90
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,070
And the different way of thinking about it is

91
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,570
of course we are seeing exactly two heads.

92
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,900
You can imagine what we're having the four flips.

93
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:45,190
Flip 1, flip 2, flip3, flip 4, so these are the flips.

94
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,060
You can see the outcomes of the flips.

95
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,000
And you are going to have exactly 2 heads. You can sayŁŹ

96
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,980
"Well look, I am going to have 1 head in one of these positions

97
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,850
and then 1 head in the other positions."

98
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:59,330
So how many... If I am picking the first, so you know,

99
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,020
you could say I have kind of Heads 1 and I have a Heads 2.

100
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,830
And I don't want you to think that these are

101
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,790
somehow the heads in the first flip or the heads in the second flip.

102
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,530
What I am saying is we need 2 heads.

103
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,170
We need in total of 2 heads in all of our flips.

104
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,730
And I am just giving one of the heads a name

105
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,650
and I am giving the other heads a name.

106
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,890
And we are going to see in a few seconds

107
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,140
that we actually don't want a double count.

108
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,730
We don't want to double count the situation: Heads 1, Heads 2,

109
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,270
tails, tails and Heads 2 Heads 1, tails tails.

110
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,760
For our propers, these are exact same outcomes.

111
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,220
So we don't want to double count that.

112
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,280
We are going to have a count for that.

113
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,190
But if we just think about it generally,

114
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,200
how many different flips can that first heads show up in?

115
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,930
Well this 4 different flips that first heads could show up in.

116
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:58,660
So there are 4 possibilities, 4 flips or 4 places that can show up in.

117
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,260
Well that first head takes up one of these 4 places.

118
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,130
Let's just say the first heads shows up on the third flip.

119
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,460
Then how many different palces can that second head show up in?

120
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,460
Well if that first head is in one of 4 places

121
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,210
and then that second head can only be in three different places,

122
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,650
so that second head can only be (let me put it in nice color here)

123
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,920
can only be in three different places.

124
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:27,790
And so you know could be any one of these right over there,

125
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,260
any one of those three places.

126
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,120
And so when you think about it in terms of the first,

127
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,310
I don't want to say the first head, Head 1,

128
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:38,860
actually let me call Head A and Head B,

129
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,500
that what you want to me to talk about it,

130
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,870
first flip or the second flip.

131
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,040
So this is Head A and this right over there is Head B.

132
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:50,590
So if you had a particular, I mean these heads are identical.

133
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,210
These outcomes are different.

134
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,950
But the way we talk about right now, it looks like 4 places that

135
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,320
we can get this Head A and there 3 places we can get this Head.

136
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,040
So if you multiply all of these different ways,

137
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,800
you could get all of the different scenarios.

138
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,420
This is 4 diferent places and this is in one of the 3 left places.

139
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:20,550
You get 12 different scenarios. But there are only be 12 scenarios

140
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,140
if you have used this as being different than this.

141
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,570
Let me rewrite it with our news. This is Head A. This is Head B.

142
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,210
This is Head B. This is Head A.

143
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,170
There will be only 12 different scenarios

144
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,510
if you use these two things as fundementally different.

145
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,500
But we don't. We actually double counting because

146
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:42,500
we can always swap these two heads and have the exact same outcome.

147
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,300
So you want to do is actually divided by 2.

148
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,000
So you wanted to divided by all of different ways

149
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,700
that you can swamp 2 different things.

150
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,660
If we had 3 heads here you will think about all the different ways

151
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,300
that you could swamp 3 different things

152
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,620
if we have 4 heads here be all of the different ways,

153
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,450
you could swamp 4 different things.

154
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,490
So you have there 12 different scenatios

155
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,610
if you couldn't swap them but you want to be divided

156
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,000
by all of the different ways you could swap 2 things.

157
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:12,340
So 12 divided by 2 is equal to 6, 6 different scenarios,

158
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,540
fundementally different scenarios considering

159
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,670
that you could swamp them.

160
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:23,470
If you assume that Head A and Head B can be interchangeble

161
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,220
that it's completely identical outcome for us

162
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,050
because there are really just heads.

163
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,030
So there are 6 diffrent scenarios

164
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:36,570
and we know that there is a total of 16 equally likely scenarios.

165
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,470
So we could say the probability of getting exactly 2 heads is 6 times,

166
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,330
6 scenarios, and we can do this a couple ways.

167
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:48,580
There are 6 scenarios gives us 2 heads of possible 16

168
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,540
or you could say there are 6 possible scenarios

169
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,800
and the probability of each of the those scenarios is 1/16

170
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,860
but either way you will get the same answer.
