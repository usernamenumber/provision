1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,920
   

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,820
In the last video, we had this
rectangle, and we used a triple

3
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,170
integral to figure
out it's volume.

4
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:08,000
And I know you were probably
thinking, well, I could have

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,100
just used my basic geometry
to multiply the height times

6
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:12,940
the width times the depth.

7
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,720
And that's true because this
was a constant-valued function.

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,320
And then even once we
evaluated, once we integrated

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,630
with respect to z, we ended up
with a double integral, which

10
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,840
is exactly what you would have
done in the last several videos

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,580
when we just learned the
volume under a surface.

12
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,560
But then we added a twist
at the end of the video.

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,000
We said, fine, you could have
figured out the volume within

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,160
this rectangular domain, I
guess, very straightforward

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,000
using things you already knew.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,080
But what if our goal is not
to figure out the volume?

17
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,790
Our goal was to figure out the
mass of this volume, and even

18
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,240
more, the material that we're
taking the volume of-- whether

19
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,060
it's a volume of gas or a
volume of some solid-- that

20
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,050
its density is not constant.

21
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,080
So now the mass becomes
kind of-- I don't know--

22
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,550
interesting to calculate.

23
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,740
And so, what we defined, we
defined a density function.

24
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,770
And rho, this p looking thing
with a curvy bottom-- that

25
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,855
gives us the density
at any given point.

26
00:01:09,855 --> 00:01:11,370
And at the end of the
last video we said,

27
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,830
well, what is mass?

28
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,050
Mass is just density
times volume.

29
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:16,750
You could view it another way.

30
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:21,170
Density is the same thing
as mass divided by volume.

31
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:26,630
So the mass around a very, very
small point, and we called that

32
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,750
d mass, the differential of the
mass, is going equal the

33
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,450
density at that point, or the
rough density at exactly that

34
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,790
point, times the volume
differential around that point,

35
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:40,100
times the volume of this
little small cube.

36
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,140
And then, as we saw it on the
last video, if you're using

37
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,240
rectangular coordinates, this
volume differential could just

38
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,390
be the x distance times the y
distance times the z distance.

39
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:55,690
So, the density was that our
density function is defined

40
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,730
to be x, y, and z, and we
wanted to figure out the

41
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:01,560
mass of this volume.

42
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,140
And let's say that our x, y,
and z coordinates-- their

43
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,990
values, let's say they're in
meters and let's say this

44
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,340
density is in kilograms
per meter cubed.

45
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,270
So our answer is going to be in
kilograms if that was the case.

46
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,480
And those are kind of the
traditional Si units.

47
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:21,210
So let's figure out the mass of
this variably dense volume.

48
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,150
So all we do is we have the
same integral up here.

49
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,720
   

50
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,860
So the differential of mass
is going to be this value,

51
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,996
so let's write that down.

52
00:02:30,996 --> 00:02:34,850
   

53
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:38,920
It is x-- I want to make sure
I don't run out of space.

54
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,390
xyz times-- and I'm
going to integrate with

55
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,890
respect to dz first.

56
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,910
But you could actually
switch the order.

57
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,750
Maybe we'll do that
in the next video.

58
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:55,810
We'll do dz first, then we'll
do dy, then we'll do dx.

59
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:00,120
   

60
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,490
Once again, this is just
the mass at any small

61
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,310
differential of volume.

62
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:07,760
And if we integrate with z
first we said z goes from what?

63
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,770
The boundaries on
z were 0 to 2.

64
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:14,050
   

65
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:18,255
The boundaries on
y were 0 to 4.

66
00:03:18,255 --> 00:03:21,110
   

67
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,890
And the boundaries on
x, x went from 0 to 3.

68
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,750
   

69
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,910
And how do we evaluate this?

70
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,900
Well, what is the
antiderivative-- we're

71
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,370
integrating with
respect to z first.

72
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,660
So what's the antiderivative
of xyz with respect to z?

73
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,080
Well, let's see.

74
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:45,080
This is just a constant so
it'll be xyz squared over 2.

75
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,040
Right?

76
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,810
Yeah, that's right.

77
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:52,690
And then we'll evaluate
that from 2 to 0.

78
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,870
And so you get-- I know I'm
going to run out of space.

79
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,420
So you're going to get
2 squared, which is 4,

80
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,990
divided by 2, which is 2.

81
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:05,460
So it's 2xy minus 0.

82
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,070
So when you evaluate just this
first we'll get 2xy, and

83
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,410
now you have the other
two integrals left.

84
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,260
So I didn't write the
other two integrals down.

85
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:13,820
Maybe I'll write it down.

86
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,680
So then you're left
with two integrals.

87
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,660
You're left with dy and dx.

88
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:28,710
And y goes from 0 to 4
and x goes from 0 to 3.

89
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,480
I'm definitely going
to run out of space.

90
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,200
And now you take the
antiderivative of this

91
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,110
with respect to y.

92
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,640
So what's the antiderivative
of this with respect to y?

93
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,240
Let me erase some stuff just
so I don't get too messy.

94
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,230
   

95
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,040
I was given the very good
suggestion of making it

96
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,340
scroll, but, unfortunately,
I didn't make it scroll

97
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,090
enough this time.

98
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:54,160
So I can delete this
stuff, I think.

99
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,220
Oops, I deleted some of that.

100
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,860
But you know what I deleted.

101
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,290
OK, so let's take
the antiderivative

102
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,290
with respect to y.

103
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,640
I'll start it up here
where I have space.

104
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,545
OK, so the antiderivative of
2xy with respect to y is y

105
00:05:06,545 --> 00:05:08,430
squared over 2, 2's cancel out.

106
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,870
So you get xy squared.

107
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,100
   

108
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,270
And y goes from 0 to 4.

109
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:18,000
And then we still have the
outer integral to do.

110
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,395
x goes from 0 to 3 dx.

111
00:05:22,395 --> 00:05:24,215
And when y is equal
to 4 you get 16x.

112
00:05:24,215 --> 00:05:27,050
   

113
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,050
And then when y is 0
the whole thing is 0.

114
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:34,300
So you have 16x integrated
from 0 to 3 dx.

115
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,210
And that is equal to what?

116
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,215
8x squared.

117
00:05:39,215 --> 00:05:42,700
And you evaluate
it from 0 to 3.

118
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,560
When it's 3, 8 times 9 is 72.

119
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,040
And 0 times 8 is 0.

120
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,810
So the mass of our figure-- the
volume we figured out last

121
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,230
time was 24 meters cubed.

122
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,160
I erased it, but if you
watched the last video

123
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,210
that's what we learned.

124
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:00,570
But it's mass is 72 kilograms.

125
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:06,420
And we did that by integrating
this 3 variable density

126
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,090
function-- this function
of 3 variables.

127
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,230
Or in three-dimensions
you can view it as a

128
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,440
scalar field, right?

129
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,910
At any given point, there
is a value, but not

130
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,420
really a direction.

131
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,020
And that value is a density.

132
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,540
But we integrated the scalar
field in this volume.

133
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,650
So that's kind of the new
skill we learned with

134
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:23,620
the triple integral.

135
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,280
And in the next video I'll
show you how to set up more

136
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,460
complicated triple integrals.

137
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,820
But the real difficulty with
triple integrals is-- and I

138
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,180
think you'll see that your
calculus teacher will often do

139
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,630
this-- when you're doing triple
integrals, unless you have a

140
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:38,290
very easy figure like this, the
evaluation-- if you actually

141
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,500
wanted to analytically evaluate
a triple integral that has more

142
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,910
complicated boundaries or more
complicated for example,

143
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,280
a density function.

144
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,850
The integral gets very
hairy, very fast.

145
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:52,610
And it's often very difficult
or very time consuming to

146
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,760
evaluate it analytically just
using your traditional

147
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,270
calculus skills.

148
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,790
So you'll see that on a lot of
calculus exams when they start

149
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,500
doing the triple integral, they
just want you to set it up.

150
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,520
They take your word for it that
you've done so many integrals

151
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,490
so far that you could
take the antiderivative.

152
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,820
And sometimes, if they really
want to give you something more

153
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,530
difficult they'll just say,
well, switch the order.

154
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,930
You know, this is the integral
when we're dealing with

155
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,700
respect to z, then y, then x.

156
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,510
We want you to rewrite
this integral when

157
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,730
you switch the order.
