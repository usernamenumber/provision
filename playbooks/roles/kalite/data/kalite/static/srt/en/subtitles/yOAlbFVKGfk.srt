1
00:00:01,157 --> 00:00:05,157
We are here in the Portland Art Museum in the Jubilee Center for Modern and Contemporary Art

2
00:00:05,157 --> 00:00:07,674
In front of Marcel Duchamp's landmark Boite-en-valise

3
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,967
The red box, series F

4
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:15,688
When I hear the word "valise" I think of could carry around

5
00:00:15,688 --> 00:00:17,324
Like a suitcase.

6
00:00:17,324 --> 00:00:18,097
Yeah.

7
00:00:18,097 --> 00:00:23,481
Like a suitcase. I think my grandmother used "valise" for a suitcase

8
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,258
Exactly, and we use backpacks. It's a new nomenclature.

9
00:00:26,258 --> 00:00:32,846
Duchamp at the end of world war one had seen in the desturction in Europe.

10
00:00:32,846 --> 00:00:38,259
He was a painter, he saw his brother injured in battle and die

11
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:41,072
He came back to Paris and he said

12
00:00:41,072 --> 00:00:43,892
"My work could be lost for the ages"

13
00:00:43,892 --> 00:00:49,147
and he decided to reproduce everything and make his own history

14
00:00:49,147 --> 00:00:51,731
His own musuem in a suitcase.

15
00:00:51,731 --> 00:00:53,398
He packaged himself

16
00:00:53,398 --> 00:00:58,273
Absolutely. In a new an completely unbranded way.

17
00:00:58,273 --> 00:01:08,328
He reproduced a new descending staircase all of his cubist and vaguely surrealist paintings on reproductions

18
00:01:08,328 --> 00:01:11,295
It's like a retrospective in a box.

19
00:01:11,295 --> 00:01:18,986
Absolutely and you know the interesting thing about this box is that he updates it twice so that the

20
00:01:18,986 --> 00:01:25,121
box here at the Portland Art Museum is a box that he created as an addition

21
00:01:25,121 --> 00:01:28,461
For Schwartz in Italy in 1960

22
00:01:28,461 --> 00:01:29,874
How many are there?

23
00:01:29,874 --> 00:01:31,098
100

24
00:01:31,098 --> 00:01:32,387
There are 100 boxes

25
00:01:32,387 --> 00:01:33,788
In the red version

26
00:01:33,788 --> 00:01:37,270
There are red, green, leather and tan versions

27
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:41,003
The earliest version is actually a Valise

28
00:01:41,003 --> 00:01:49,009
A leather valise, because these are mechanically reproduced objects he had a little cottage industry

29
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:54,774
He prints a bunch of them but they never get assembled and so when Schwartz comes to him in the '60s

30
00:01:54,774 --> 00:01:59,120
and says I want to do the Boite-de-valise as a real addition

31
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,902
Duchamp says okay I happened to have a stack of them right here. I never put them together

32
00:02:04,902 --> 00:02:14,919
And so his wife Teeny sat in Paris apartment gluing the reproductions onto these black cardboard backgrounds

33
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:20,937
and little labels they had made and they created this retrospective in a box

34
00:02:20,937 --> 00:02:28,438
And there is something to me that's sort of about the idea of the artist packaging himself

35
00:02:28,438 --> 00:02:37,111
Selling himself, almost like a traveling salesman going around to galleries and try to get their work

36
00:02:37,111 --> 00:02:41,075
There is something about that artist and the commercial environment.

37
00:02:41,075 --> 00:02:45,684
As a curator I always immidiately pullback when someone introduces themselves as an artist

38
00:02:45,684 --> 00:02:51,703
Because the modern artist carried slides and now they carry an iPhone with their entire work on it

39
00:02:51,703 --> 00:02:59,770
Sort of like Duchamp but in the technology of today as opposed to the reproductive technology of his

40
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,754
age

41
00:03:00,754 --> 00:03:04,388
What I find interesting and beautiful about this is the variety

42
00:03:04,388 --> 00:03:12,165
Because he was both a painter and a sculptor in the sense that the ready made was a sculpture

43
00:03:12,165 --> 00:03:16,611
We have the tiny verison of a urel

44
00:03:16,611 --> 00:03:18,903
The entire thing was a ready made

45
00:03:18,903 --> 00:03:24,469
He gave us his lifes work to that date as a ready made surrogate

46
00:03:24,469 --> 00:03:33,470
For the experience. None of it is an original print in the sense of an artist pulled, plate numbered and

47
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:37,788
signed but in fact these are all mechanically reproduced

48
00:03:37,788 --> 00:03:43,520
From images that may or may not have been an original work of art in the first place

49
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:49,886
What's great to me about it is this kind of embracing of mechanical reproduction

50
00:03:49,886 --> 00:03:53,269
Which is sort of a thread through all of Duchamp's work

51
00:03:53,269 --> 00:04:00,740
and a sort of loss of the aura of the original

52
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,973
Which was always a sort of issue that Duchamp confronted

53
00:04:04,973 --> 00:04:11,938
You'll notive that this object is sitting not in 1929 when he first concieves it but it sits

54
00:04:11,938 --> 00:04:21,449
here in the Jubit centre halfway up in the 1960-70 when America discovers his ideas

55
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:27,269
When Duchamp becomes the grandfather of pop

56
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:35,203
and of Cindy Sherman and Richard Prince and all of the artists who practice appropriation

57
00:04:35,203 --> 00:04:40,403
and Sherry Levine and all of that

58
00:04:40,403 --> 00:04:44,353
Absolutely and Sherry Levine who would not exist without Duchamp

59
00:04:44,353 --> 00:04:50,003
And this little miniturization of them too it's like little souveniers

60
00:04:50,003 --> 00:04:53,102
A little Duchamp souvenir

61
00:04:53,102 --> 00:04:56,519
It's like Warhol, your little vail of the air of Paris

62
00:04:56,519 --> 99:59:59,999
Right here
