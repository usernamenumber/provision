1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,510
   

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,570
Let's do some order of
operations problems, and for

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,435
the sake of time I'll do
every other problem.

4
00:00:05,435 --> 00:00:08,730
So let's start with 1b.

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,900
1b right there.

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:21,290
They have 2 plus 7 times 11
minus 12 divided by 3.

7
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,890
So just remember, the top
priority is always going to be

8
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,320
your parentheses.

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,900
So you have your parentheses--
Let me write it this way.

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,730
Your top priority's going to
be your parentheses, after

11
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:36,410
that you're going to have your
exponents, after that you have

12
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,990
multiplying and dividing, and
after that you have addition

13
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,190
and subtraction.

14
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:44,320
So let's remember that and
tackle these order of

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,930
operations problems.

16
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,940
So priority, there's no
parentheses here, there's no

17
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,840
exponents, so the priority's
going to go to multiplication

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,060
and division.

19
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,990
So you could view this as being
equivalent to-- So we're

20
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,640
going to do our multiplication
before we do any addition or

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,590
subtraction, and we're going
to do our division before

22
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,040
doing any addition
or subtraction.

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,100
Problem 1b is exactly equivalent
to this, the

24
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,680
parentheses are just-- I'm
reinforcing the notion that

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,730
I'm going to do my
multiplication and division

26
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,210
before I do the addition
and the subtraction.

27
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:27,230
So 7 times 11 is 77, and then
12 divided by 3 is 4.

28
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:31,380
And the rest of the problem was
2 plus this thing, which

29
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,420
is 77, minus this thing.

30
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,770
And here, since everything is
in addition or subtraction,

31
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,560
let's just go left to right.

32
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:49,210
2 plus 77 is 79 minus 4,
which is equal to 75.

33
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,380
So 1b is equal to 75.

34
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,160
Let's do 1d.

35
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,140
This is a nice hairy problem
right there.

36
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,400
So 1d.

37
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:05,900
It says 2 times 3
plus 2 minus 1.

38
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:15,110
Closing two parentheses, all of
that over 4 minus 6 plus 2

39
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,890
minus 3 minus 5.

40
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,540
Let's see if we can simplify
this a little bit.

41
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,060
As we said, parentheses
take our priority.

42
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,050
So let's do the parentheses
first. 2 minus 1.

43
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,120
2 minus 1 is just 1.

44
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,000
3 minus 5.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,560
That is minus 2, or negative
2, I should say.

46
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,895
6 plus 2 is 8.

47
00:02:38,895 --> 00:02:41,500
   

48
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,860
Now let's keep looking at the
parentheses to see where we

49
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,730
can simplify things.

50
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,190
We have this parentheses
right here.

51
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:50,420
So 3 plus this 1 is now going
to be equal to 4.

52
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,328
Actually, let me rewrite it.

53
00:02:51,328 --> 00:02:55,250
So we're going to have 2 times
this whole expression, 3 plus

54
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,000
1, so it's 2 times 4.

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,400
That right there is 4.

56
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,820
All of that over 4 minus
8, that's negative 4.

57
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,080
This right here is negative 4.

58
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,150
And then minus this
negative 2.

59
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,860
So minus negative 2.

60
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:19,770
2 times 4 is 8, so this whole
thing simplifies to-- A minus

61
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,980
of a negative, that's just
the plus of the plus, the

62
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,470
negatives cancel out.

63
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,280
So this whole thing simplifies
to 8 divided by negative 4 is

64
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,410
negative 2 plus 2.

65
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,950
   

66
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,620
So it equals 0.

67
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,890
So this big, hairy thing
simplified to 0.

68
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,140
Now let's do 2b.

69
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,130
   

70
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,400
Let me clear some space here.

71
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,820
I'll leave the order of
operations stuff there.

72
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:57,880
Let me clear that and
let me clear this.

73
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,800
All right, 2b.

74
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,700
   

75
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,800
Evaluate the following

76
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,280
expressions involving variables.

77
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,810
Fair enough.

78
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:10,600
So they wrote 2y squared, and
they're saying that x is equal

79
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,270
to 1, which is irrelevant
because there is no x here,

80
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,310
and y is equal to 5.

81
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,690
So if y is equal to 5, this
thing becomes the same thing

82
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:25,840
as 2 times 5 squared.

83
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,890
And notice, I put parentheses
there.

84
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:31,070
I could have written this as,
this is the same thing as 2

85
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,590
times 5 squared.

86
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:36,550
And if you look at the order of
operations, exponents take

87
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,120
priority over multiplication.

88
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,240
That's why in my head I just
automatically put those

89
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:41,950
parentheses.

90
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,170
We're going to do the
exponent first.

91
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:53,130
So this is 25, so you get 2
times 25 is equal to 50.

92
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:58,030
So that is 2b, this is equal
to-- use a darker color --that

93
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,090
is equal to 50.

94
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,340
Let's do 2d.

95
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,470
   

96
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:11,506
They're giving us y squared
minus x, whole thing squared.

97
00:05:11,506 --> 00:05:16,330
x is equal to 2 and
y is equal to 1.

98
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,920
Well, we just substitute.

99
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,580
Where we see a y we put a 1.

100
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:25,370
So this is going to be 1 squared
minus x squared--

101
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,600
Sorry, minus x, not x squared.

102
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,755
So we just put a regular
x there.

103
00:05:28,755 --> 00:05:30,410
That's where we put a 2.

104
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,880
And then all of that squared.

105
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,310
Well 1 squared is just
1, so that is just 1.

106
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:43,420
1 minus 2 is negative 1.

107
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:47,600
And then we're going to want to
square our negative 1, so

108
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,460
that will be equal
to positive 1.

109
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,180
So that is equal to 1.

110
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,810
Negative times a negative
is a positive.

111
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,110
All right, let's do 3b.

112
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:00,760
   

113
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,210
Doing every other problem.

114
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,050
I'll do it in yellow.

115
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,160
Evaluate the following

116
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,850
expressions involving variables.

117
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:07,300
All right.

118
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,010
Same idea.

119
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:15,250
So they're giving us
4x over 9x squared.

120
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:19,130
Oh, actually I said I'd
do 3b, I was doing 3a.

121
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:19,890
So here we go.

122
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:29,060
We have z squared over x
plus y plus x squared

123
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,530
over x minus y.

124
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:36,220
And they're telling us that x
is equal to 1, y is equal to

125
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,310
negative 2, and z
is equal to 4.

126
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,660
So let's just do our
substitutions first.

127
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,130
So z squared, that's the same
thing as-- I'll do it in a

128
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:53,480
different color --4 squared over
x, 1, plus y, negative 2,

129
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,410
plus x squared, that's
1 squared, over x,

130
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:01,770
which is 1, minus y.

131
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,330
y is negative 2.

132
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:10,700
So this is going to be equal to
4 squared is 16 over 1 plus

133
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:15,830
negative 2, that's 1 minus 2--
it's just a negative 1 --plus

134
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:21,310
1 squared, which is 1, over
1 minus negative 2.

135
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,840
That's the same thing
as 1 plus 2.

136
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,180
So it's 1/3.

137
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,410
And so this will be 16 divided
by negative 1.

138
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:37,100
We could write that as that's
equal to negative 16 plus 1/3.

139
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,480
Now if we want to actually add
these as fractions we could

140
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,460
have a common denominator.

141
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:48,640
Negative 16 is the same thing
as minus 48 over 3, or

142
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,210
negative 48 over 3.

143
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:54,480
If you take 48 divided by 3
you'll get 16, and I'm just

144
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,970
keeping the negative sign.

145
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:59,800
And then you add
that plus 1/3.

146
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,890
We have a common denominator
now, 3.

147
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:10,740
Negative 48 plus 1
is negative 47.

148
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:16,760
So our answer is negative
47 over 3.

149
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,010
Problem 3d.

150
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:23,910
   

151
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,970
Same type of situation.

152
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:35,240
x squared minus z squared over
xz minus 2x times z minus x.

153
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:41,510
x is equal to negative
1, z is equal to 3.

154
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,299
Let's do our substitutions.

155
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:45,560
So this is x squared.

156
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,220
That's minus 1 squared.

157
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:53,670
Minus z squared, so
minus 3 squared.

158
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:56,816
All of that over x times z.

159
00:08:56,816 --> 00:09:06,200
x times z is minus 1 times 3,
minus 2 times x, x is negative

160
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:12,280
1, times z minus x,
times 3 minus x.

161
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,940
x is negative 1 minus x.

162
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,370
Wherever we saw an x
we put a minus 1.

163
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,440
So this is going to be equal
to-- Remember, you do your

164
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,280
exponents first. Well,

165
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,690
parentheses first, then exponents.

166
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:29,330
So we have negative 1 squared,
that's just a positive 1.

167
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,090
3 squared, that's just
a positive 9.

168
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:36,420
So our numerator becomes 1 minus
9, that's minus 8 or

169
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,170
negative 8.

170
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,160
And then our denominator.

171
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,040
Negative 1 times 3
is negative 3.

172
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,300
And then let's go to our
parentheses here.

173
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,540
We have 3 minus negative 1,
that's the same thing as 3

174
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,390
plus plus 1.

175
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:56,080
So that right there becomes 4.

176
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,650
So our denominator becomes
negative 3 minus 2 times

177
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:05,010
negative 1 times 4, so
that's negative 8.

178
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,880
Minus negative 8.

179
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,230
Minus of a negative is the
same thing as a plus.

180
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:21,320
So this whole thing becomes
negative 8 over negative 3

181
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,160
plus 8 is 5.

182
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:28,350
So it's negative 8/5,
minus 8 over 5.

183
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,170
All right, let me clear up
some space just so we can

184
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,500
reference this problem
properly.

185
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,930
Let me clear all of this
out of the way.

186
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:38,380
   

187
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,350
These are interesting now.

188
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,770
Problem 4: insert parentheses in
each expression to make it

189
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:42,790
a true equation.

190
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,040
Fascinating.

191
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,910
   

192
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,110
So 4b.

193
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:56,810
You have 12 divided by 4 plus
10 minus 3 times 3 plus 7 is

194
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,100
equal to 11.

195
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,270
So let's see what happens if we
just do traditional order

196
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,500
of operations, and I'll do a
little bit in my head because

197
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,570
this is going to take some
experimentation.

198
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,420
Oh yeah, this is 4b,
12 divided by 4--

199
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,740
Yep, that's the problem.

200
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:14,220
So if did 12 divided by 4 first,
and we would get 3.

201
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,570
So let me just do
this in yellow.

202
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:20,670
So if we did regular order of
operations this would be a 3.

203
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:25,010
This right here would
it be a 9.

204
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:32,940
So you would have 3 plus 10,
which is 13, minus 9, 13 minus

205
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,210
9 is 4 plus 7.

206
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:36,990
Actually, that seems right.

207
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:37,980
Let me make sure I
did that right.

208
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,410
3 plus 10-- Right,
that looks right.

209
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,060
So we really just have to do
regular order of operations.

210
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,760
So it already looks like
a true equation.

211
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:52,030
So if you do 12 divided by 4
plus 10 minus 3 times 3 plus

212
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,730
7, I think it turns out right.

213
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,030
Let me confirm.

214
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,740
Make sure I'm not making
a mistake.

215
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:04,900
12 divided by 4 is 3 plus 10
minus 3 times 3 is 9 plus 7.

216
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:11,650
This is equal to 13 minus 9,
which is equal to-- So all of

217
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:18,910
this is equal to 13 minus 9 is
equal to 4 plus 7 is, indeed,

218
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:19,940
equal to 11.

219
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,140
So that one wasn't too bad.

220
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,400
You actually wouldn't have to
put any parentheses to make

221
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,220
this a true expression.

222
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,330
You would just have to follow
the order of operations.

223
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,450
But throwing those parentheses
there makes it a little bit

224
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,170
easier to read.

225
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,210
Let's try 4d.

226
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,050
   

227
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:43,390
12 minus 8 minus 4 times
5 is equal to minus 8.

228
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,260
So first let's just see what
happens if we did traditional

229
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,260
order of operations.

230
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,170
If we did traditional order of
operations we would do this 4

231
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:53,050
times 5 first, which would
give us 20 over there.

232
00:12:53,050 --> 00:13:00,380
And then we would have
12 minus 8 is 4.

233
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,010
And then we would do 4 minus
20-- No, that's not right.

234
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:06,410
That would give us
negative 16.

235
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,465
So that's not going
to be right.

236
00:13:07,465 --> 00:13:09,100
So we can't just do traditional
order of

237
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,050
operations.

238
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:14,040
Sorry, this is a minus
8 right there.

239
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,390
So let's see how we can
experiment with this.

240
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,780
Let's try out a couple
of situations.

241
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:25,650
What if we did 12 minus 8 minus
4 and then multiplied

242
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:26,650
that times 5.

243
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:27,740
Let's see what this give us.

244
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,230
I'm just experimenting
with parentheses.

245
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:36,170
So if you do 8 minus 4, that
right there would be

246
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,960
8 minus 4 is 4.

247
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:43,240
And then 4 times 5 would be
20, and then 12 minus 20--

248
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,270
yeah, that works.

249
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,090
So let me confirm that.

250
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:49,370
So I'm saying I'm going to put
parentheses right there and

251
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,740
right there and let's
work it out.

252
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:56,370
You would get 8 minus 4 is 4.

253
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:59,190
So this whole thing was
simplified to 12

254
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,990
minus 4 times 5.

255
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,890
And you just do order of
operations, you do

256
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:07,360
multiplication first.
So that is just 20.

257
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,370
And if I wanted to make it very
clear I could actually

258
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:09,890
write it like this.

259
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,480
I could actually put
another round of

260
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,040
parentheses right like that.

261
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,450
But order of operations would
tell us to do it anyway.

262
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:20,870
So it becomes 12 minus 20, which
is, indeed, minus 8 or

263
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,540
negative 8.
