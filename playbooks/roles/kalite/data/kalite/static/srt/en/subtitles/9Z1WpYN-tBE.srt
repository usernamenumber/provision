1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,850
   

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:02,590
We're on problem 53.

3
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:06,000
Which table below correctly
describes the points of the

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,950
exponential function f of
x is equal to 3 to the

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,620
minus x minus 2?

6
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,330
They all input the same x-values
as far as I can tell.

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,270
Yeah, they all input
the same x-values.

8
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,000
So let's just figure out
which choice works.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,280
So if we take f of minus
2, that's the first

10
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,680
one they give us.

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,280
f of minus 2, that is equal
to 3 to the minus x.

12
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,920
Well, x is now minus 2, so
minus minus 2 minus 2.

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,960
So what's minus minus 2?

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,790
Well, that's the same thing as
3 squared minus 2, so that is

15
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:44,995
equal to 9 minus 2
is equal to 7.

16
00:00:44,995 --> 00:00:46,740
Did I get that right?

17
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,150
Do you see any of
these choices?

18
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,250
Well, only one of them
has that. f of minus

19
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,020
2 is equal to 7.

20
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,380
That's not right.

21
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,450
That's not right.

22
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,940
That's not right.

23
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,080
Well, here when x is minus
2, f of x is equal

24
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,030
to 7, choice D.

25
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,170
We could have just evaluated the
other ones and we probably

26
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,440
would have agreed with all
of these numbers as well.

27
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,760
Well, that was a lot of copying
and pasting for a

28
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,890
fairly straightforward
problem.

29
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:14,980
Next problem.

30
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,510
I already had it there
waiting for us.

31
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:23,350
log base 6 of 40.

32
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:27,130
So, in general, and just
inspecting it, I think they

33
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,180
just want you to figure out
how do you figure out a

34
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,320
logarithm of any arbitrary base
of some number if you

35
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,040
only have a log base 10
function, which tends to be

36
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,570
the case in your calculator.

37
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,870
I proved this in a Khan Academy
video, but the general

38
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:46,750
idea is if I have log base a
of b, that this is equal to

39
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:53,460
log base 10 of b divided
by log base 10 of a.

40
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,940
Actually, these both don't
have to be 10.

41
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,730
They just have to be
the same base.

42
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:58,920
10 tends to be convenient.

43
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,330
The other base that tends
to be convenient is e.

44
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,680
But anyway, let's use
that property

45
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,660
to solve this problem.

46
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:11,610
So log base 6 of 40 is equal to
log base 10 of 40 divided

47
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:17,460
by log base 10 of 6,
which is choice D.

48
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:22,170
   

49
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,550
All right, next problem.

50
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:32,260
   

51
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,510
Copy and paste it.

52
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,520
   

53
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,000
Just so you know, I don't like
talking while I'm copying and

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,780
pasting, because I think it
slows my computer down and

55
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,560
then I start sounding
like Optimus Prime.

56
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,620
All right, Jonathan wrote the
equation log base 6 of x minus

57
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,960
4 is equal to 0 on the board.

58
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,390
He needs one clue for
problem solving.

59
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,430
Which fact provides the correct
information that he

60
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,340
needs to solve the equation?

61
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,200
Well, I don't know if he
needs any information.

62
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,180
This statement is essentially
saying that 6 to the 0th power

63
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,230
is equal to x minus 4.

64
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,670
Then you could add 4 to both
sides, and you would get 6 to

65
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,080
the 0th power plus
4 is equal to x.

66
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,560
I guess if he didn't know the
definition already of 6 to the

67
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,990
0th power, he would have to
know that to know that it

68
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:29,650
equals 1, so 1 plus 4 is
equal to x, which is 5.

69
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:34,190
So I guess he has to know that
6 to the 0th power is a piece

70
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,440
of information.

71
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,280
   

72
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,470
Well this one wouldn't
have been useful.

73
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,270
6 to the first power, that's
not even useful even if you

74
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,150
didn't know it.

75
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:47,430
4 minus 4 isn't useful even
if you didn't know if.

76
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,080
But 6 minus 4, even
that's not useful.

77
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,380
Yes, choice A, he had
to know 6 to the 0th

78
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,860
power is equal to 1.

79
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,840
All right.

80
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,890
Let's see, they have
a couple more.

81
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,640
I'm going to copy and paste all
of them at the same time.

82
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,890
I'm getting bold.

83
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:07,080
   

84
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,540
All right, like that.

85
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:16,420
Let me clear all of this: clear
image, image, invert

86
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,410
colors, and I'm back
in business.

87
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,110
There you go.

88
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,780
All right, I never know
whether I should use a

89
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,420
dark-colored or light-colored
marker, because over here, the

90
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,250
light-colored ones look good,
but on the white, the darks.

91
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,170
So who knows?

92
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,460
Magenta tends to be good,
maybe purple.

93
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,860
What is the value of
log base 3 of 27?

94
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,640
So that's just asking 3 to what
power is equal to 27?

95
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,650
3 to the first is 3.

96
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,060
3 squared is 9.

97
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,910
3 to the third power
is equal to 27.

98
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,890
So log base 3 of 27
is equal to 3.

99
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,170
They, I guess, just want you to
know what the definition of

100
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,290
a logarithm is in
that question.

101
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,320
I'm noticing that there isn't
necessarily a progression of

102
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,340
difficulty in the problem.

103
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,620
They kind of flip between an
easy one and a hard one.

104
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,090
Who knows?

105
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,150
They're just a grab
bag of questions.

106
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,980
If log base 2-- no,
not log base 2.

107
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:11,060
They're saying log of 2 is
approximately equal to 0.301.

108
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,710
When people just write a log
without a base, you usually

109
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,840
assume it's base 10.

110
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,350
It's kind of like what you'd
get in your calculator.

111
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,890
If you just press log on your
calculator, it's log base 10.

112
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:24,730
So 10 to the 0.3 power
is equal to 2.

113
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,670
If log base 10 of 2 is
approximately equal to 0.301,

114
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:33,500
and log base 10 of 3 is
approximately equal to 0.477,

115
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:40,390
what is the approximate
value of log of 72?

116
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,610
So let's see, I think we just
have to do some prime

117
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,390
factorization here.

118
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:50,710
So 72, that's equal to the log--
let's think about it.

119
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:55,810
That's the log of-- let
me think about it.

120
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,800
This is 36 times 2.

121
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,330
Well, I don't know if
that even helps us.

122
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:09,380
3 to the third, that's 27.

123
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:14,500
This is 9 times 8.

124
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:21,440
So this is log of 3 to
the third times 2

125
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,800
squared; is that right?

126
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,380
So this is log of 9.

127
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,070
I made a mistake.

128
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,500
Ignore that.

129
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,320
So this is the same thing as
the logarithm of 9 times 8.

130
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,570
Fair enough.

131
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:41,640
So that's the same thing
as the log of 9

132
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,300
plus the log of 8.

133
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,450
   

134
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,500
Fair enough.

135
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:53,770
Well, that's the same thing as
the log of 3 squared plus the

136
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:56,360
log of 2 to the third.

137
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,050
2 to the third is equal to 8.

138
00:06:59,050 --> 00:06:59,700
Let's keep going.

139
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,910
I think you see where
it's going.

140
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:01,540
3 squared is 9.

141
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,210
OK, so log of 3 squared, that's
the same thing as 2

142
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:08,090
times the log of 3.

143
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,080
The log of 2 to the third power,
that's the same thing

144
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,530
as 3 times the log of 2.

145
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:16,830
We know what the log of 3 is and
we know the log of 2 is.

146
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:24,770
The log of 3 is 0.477, so we
have 2 times 0.477 plus 3

147
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:31,450
times the log of 2, plus
3 times 0.301.

148
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:36,670
So 2 times 0.477-- let
me do it here.

149
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:41,590
So 0.477 times 2.

150
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:47,200
2 times 7 is 14 plus 1 is 15.

151
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,530
2 times 4 is 8 plus 1 is 9,
three numbers behind the

152
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,040
decimal point, 0.954.

153
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,210
Then 3 times point 0.301,
that's easier.

154
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,950
That's 0.903.

155
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,060
If you add them together, I
can already tell you, it's

156
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,450
going to be that right there.

157
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,305
It's going to be 1.857.

158
00:08:07,305 --> 00:08:09,720
It's choice D.

159
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:15,670
Problem 58.

160
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,950
If x is a real number, for
what values of x is the

161
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:24,200
equation 3x minus 9 over 3 is
equal to x minus 3 true?

162
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,700
All right.

163
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,120
Well, if x is a real
number, let's just

164
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,780
play around with it.

165
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,830
Maybe it's just a truism.

166
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,890
Well, I know it is a truism.

167
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,390
Look at it.

168
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,309
Let me write it.

169
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:39,250
3x minus 9 over 3 is
equal to x minus 3.

170
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,429
Let's multiply both sides
of this equation by 3.

171
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:49,350
You'll get 3x minus 9 is
equal to 3x minus 9.

172
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,990
So we can stop there.

173
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:54,190
So if I take 3 times a number
and subtract 9 from it and if

174
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,680
I said that's the same thing as
taking 3 times a number and

175
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,030
subtracting 9 from it, well,
then x could be any number.

176
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,780
So it works for all
values of x.

177
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,550
You can keep solving.

178
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,740
Let's just add 9
to both sides.

179
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,760
You get 3x equal to 3x.

180
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,315
Divide both sides by 3, you
get x is equal to x.

181
00:09:11,315 --> 00:09:12,880
Well, that's true for
any real number x.

182
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,420
It's equal to itself.

183
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,090
So that works for
all numbers x.

184
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,850
Let's see what else they
have to throw at us.

185
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:24,960
   

186
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,560
All right, let's do one more.

187
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,692
   

188
00:09:32,692 --> 00:09:37,580
I've copied, and now
I have pasted.

189
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,320
On a recent test, Jeremy wrote
the equation x squared minus

190
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,450
16 divided by x minus 4
is equal to x plus 4.

191
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,165
Which of the following
statements is correct about

192
00:09:46,165 --> 00:09:47,860
the equation he wrote?

193
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,180
So let's play with it a little
bit. x squared minus 16 over x

194
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,050
minus 4 is equal to x plus 4.

195
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,630
   

196
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,960
So immediately when you see
something like this, in order

197
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:04,925
to do this, what he had to say
is that x squared minus 16 is

198
00:10:04,925 --> 00:10:08,800
x plus 4 times x minus 4.

199
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,200
That's over x minus 4.

200
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,880
Then to simplify from this to
that, he essentially canceled

201
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,660
out both of these things.

202
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,960
That's fine.

203
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,960
That's fine, assuming
that this number

204
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,210
down here is non-zero.

205
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,650
   

206
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,280
0 over 0 is undefined.

207
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,500
Anything over a 0
is undefined.

208
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,610
His simplification is true as
long as x does not equal 4.

209
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:36,330
Because if x equaled 4, then you
would have an 8 times a 0

210
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:41,590
divided by a 0, and 8 times
a 0 divided by a 0 is not

211
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:45,530
defined, so this doesn't work
when x is equal to 4.

212
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:49,970
If you think about it, if I were
to graph this equation or

213
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:53,630
his original equation, it
would look just like the

214
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:57,190
equation of x plus 4, except
it would have a hole at 4

215
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,380
because it's not defined
at x is equal to 4.

216
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,880
So they're not exactly
the same.

217
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,145
The graphs would be exactly the
same except at the point x

218
00:11:05,145 --> 00:11:06,390
is equal 4.

219
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:10,340
So the point is b.

220
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,660
All right.

221
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,620
I'm out of time.

222
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,080
See you in the next video.

223
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,500
