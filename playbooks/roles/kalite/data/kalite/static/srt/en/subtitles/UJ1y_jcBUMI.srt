My name is Rishi Desai, and I work for Khan Academy. One of the cool things that I get to do is to

2
00:00:04,439 --> 00:00:08,601
put together videos and questions related to health and medicine topics

3
00:00:08,601 --> 00:00:12,798
and put those on the Khan Academy web site, so that all sorts of

4
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:15,415
users from around the world can access that information.

5
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:19,722
Right now, Khan Academy is actually doing something really quite different from this.

6
00:00:19,722 --> 00:00:23,936
We're collaborating with the AAMC -- the Association of American Medical Colleges

7
00:00:23,936 --> 00:00:27,807
and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to basically flip this around.

8
00:00:27,807 --> 00:00:31,839
We acutally want users to to make the videos, to make questions,

9
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,510
and actually send them to us. The reason we are doing this is that

10
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,340
2015 MCAT exam is coming around,and it's gonna

11
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,406
have some the same materials before; you know, biology, chemistry, and physics

12
00:00:42,406 --> 00:00:46,669
but it's gonna have some new materials; things like psychology and sociology, and we

13
00:00:46,669 --> 00:00:50,378
think that you, that's right, you might be a good person to help teach some

14
00:00:50,378 --> 00:00:53,672
someone that content. So we want you to pick one topic that you really

15
00:00:53,672 --> 00:00:57,606
are comfortable with, and make 3 videos and write 10

16
00:00:57,606 --> 00:01:01,673
questions related to that topic, then take all of it and send it to

17
00:01:01,673 --> 00:01:05,438
us by mid-June. And we want folks that are passionate, people that are

18
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,239
clear and concise, can be engaging and fun. Someone that

19
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:13,540
really really understands this material can teach it well. We are gonna go through all these

20
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,379
missions and we are gonna find some winners. We are gonna offer the winners a free

21
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:20,542
one-week trip to a training camp where you get to whole your skills at making

22
00:01:20,542 --> 00:01:25,007
videos, writing good questions, and then we're gonna offer a chance

23
00:01:25,007 --> 00:01:29,163
to become a Khan Academy teaching fellow, so if it sounds like

24
00:01:29,163 --> 00:01:33,163
something that you might want to try, I say, "Go ahead and get started; you're gonna have a blast."
