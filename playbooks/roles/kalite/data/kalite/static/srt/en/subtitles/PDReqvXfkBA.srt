00:00:00,095 --> 00:00:04,042
In the last video we saw why when we take any non-zero number

2
00:00:04,042 --> 00:00:08,686
divided by zero why mathematicians have left that as being undefined.

3
00:00:08,686 --> 00:00:12,355
But it might have raised a question in your brain. What about

4
00:00:12,355 --> 00:00:16,534
zero divided by zero? Isn't there an argument

5
00:00:16,534 --> 00:00:20,343
why that could be defined? So we're gonna think about zero

6
00:00:20,343 --> 00:00:24,615
divided by zero. Well there's a couple of lines of reasoning here.

7
00:00:24,615 --> 00:00:28,033
One, you could start taking numbers closer and closer to zero

8
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:30,002
and dividing them by themselves.

9
00:00:30,002 --> 00:00:34,600
So for example, you take 0.1 divided by 0.1.

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,200
Well that's gonna be one. Let's get even closer to zero:

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,863
0.001 divided by 0.001. Well, that also equals one.

12
00:00:44,863 --> 00:00:54,197
Let's get super close to zero: 0.000001 divided by 0.000001.

13
00:00:54,197 --> 00:00:58,005
Well once again, that also equals one. And it didn't even matter whether

14
00:00:58,005 --> 00:01:02,700
these were positive or negative. I could make these negative and I'd still get the same result.

15
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,340
Negative this thing divided by negative this thing still gets me to one.

16
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:13,005
So based on this logic you might say, "Hey, well this seems like a pretty reasonable argument for

17
00:01:13,005 --> 00:01:18,532
zero divided by zero to be defined as being equal to one. "

18
00:01:18,532 --> 00:01:24,337
But someone could come along and say, "Well what happens if we divide zero by numbers closer and closer to zero;

19
00:01:24,337 --> 00:01:29,367
not a number by itself, but zero by smaller and smaller numbers, or numbers closer and closer to zero."

20
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:41,194
And so they say, "For example, zero divided by 0.1, well that's just going to be zero. Zero divided by 0.001,

21
00:01:41,194 --> 00:01:50,668
well that's also going to be to zero. 0 divided by 0.000001 is also going to be equal to zero."

22
00:01:50,668 --> 00:01:54,424
And it didn't matter whether we were dividing by a positive or negative number.

23
00:01:54,424 --> 00:01:57,489
Make all of these negatives, you still get the same answer.

24
00:01:57,489 --> 00:02:03,015
So this line of reasoning tells you that it's completely legitimate, to think at least that maybe

25
00:02:03,015 --> 00:02:09,842
zero divided by zero could be equal to zero. And these are equally valid arguments.

26
00:02:09,842 --> 00:02:15,415
And because they're equally valid, and frankly neither of them is consistent with the rest of mathematics,

27
00:02:15,415 --> 99:59:59,999
once again mathematicians have left zero divided by zero as undefined.
