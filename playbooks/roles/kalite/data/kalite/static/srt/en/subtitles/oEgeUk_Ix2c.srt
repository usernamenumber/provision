1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,128
Let's go through some more exponent examples.

2
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:06,487
So to warm up, let's think about 
taking a fraction to some power.

3
00:00:06,487 --> 00:00:14,527
So let's say I have two-thirds (2/3), and 
I want to raise it to the 3rd power here.

4
00:00:14,527 --> 00:00:16,958
And we've already learned there are 
two ways of thinking about this.

5
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:19,885
One way is to say let's take three 2/3's –

6
00:00:19,885 --> 00:00:26,339
So that's one 2/3rd, two 2/3's, and three 2/3's.

7
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:29,719
So that's (COUNTING: One, two) three 2/3's.

8
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:34,231
And then we multiply them.

9
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:37,170
And we will get, let's see –

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,746
The numerator will be 2 × 2 × 2, which is 8.

11
00:00:40,746 --> 00:00:47,098
And the denominator's going to be 
3 × 3 × 3, which is equal to 27.

12
00:00:47,098 --> 00:00:53,891
Now the other way of viewing this is you start 
with a 1 and you multiply it by 2/3 three times.

13
00:00:53,891 --> 00:00:56,963
So you multiply by 2/3 once, twice, three times.

14
00:00:56,963 --> 00:00:59,901
You will get the exact same result here.

15
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:01,837
So let's do one more example like that.

16
00:01:01,837 --> 00:01:05,869
So lets say I had 4/9, and I want to square it.

17
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:08,676
When I raise something to the second power, 
people often say, "You're squaring it."

18
00:01:08,676 --> 00:01:12,846
Also when you're raising something to the 3rd power, 
people sometimes say, "You're cubing it."

19
00:01:12,846 --> 00:01:15,964
But let's raise 4/9 to the 2nd power.
Let's square it.

20
00:01:15,964 --> 00:01:19,626
I encourage you to pause the video 
and work this out yourself.

21
00:01:19,626 --> 00:01:26,989
Well, once again, you could view this as 
taking two 4/9's and multiplying them.

22
00:01:26,989 --> 00:01:32,741
Or you could view this as starting with a 1, 
and multiplying it by 4/9 two times.

23
00:01:32,741 --> 00:01:37,470
Either way, your numerator is 
going to be 4 × 4, which is 16.

24
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:45,498
And your denominator is going 
to be 9 × 9, which is equal to 81.
