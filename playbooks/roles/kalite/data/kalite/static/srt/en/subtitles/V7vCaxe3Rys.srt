1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,710
We're on problem 91.

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:08,750
By what percent did the median household-- so median is

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,760
middle-- by what percent did the median household income in

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,650
country Y decrease from 1970 to 1980?

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:18,610
So they want a percentage.

6
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,070
All right. Statement number one tells us in 1970,

7
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:33,400
the median household income in country Y was 2/3 of

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,010
the median household income in country X.

9
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:42,810
So let's write Y in 1970-- let's just write '70,

10
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,090
because the 19 is redundant.

11
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:52,280
The median income in country Y in 1970 is equal to 2/3 of the

12
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,010
median income of country X in 1970.

13
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,800
That's what statement one tells us. But one again, we know

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,030
nothing still about what happened in 1980 in country Y.

15
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:08,030
So we still can't answer the question. Statement number two.

16
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:23,000
In 1980, the median household income in country Y was 1/2

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
the median household income in country X in 1980.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,950
Now, you might be tempted to say, oh, two linear equations

19
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,360
and two unknowns,maybe I can solve for it, et cetera. But no.

20
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,580
There's actually two linear equations in four unknowns,right?

21
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,550
Y in 1970 is different than Y in 1980.

22
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,410
And X in 1970 is different than X in 1980.

23
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,180
So there's actually four variables. But you say, oh no, no.

24
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,710
But we don't need to figure out all the variables,

25
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,460
we just need to figure out the percent decline. Right?

26
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,560
They just say by what percent did the median household

27
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,230
income in country Y decrease from 1970 to 1980?

28
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:12,960
So essentially if we could figure out this, Y80 over Y70,

29
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,440
we'll know what the percent decline was. Right?

30
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,110
If this number is 0.8, then it would be a 20% decline.

31
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,640
If this number was 0.5, then it would be a 50% decline.

32
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,160
So whatever this number is, that's essentially 1 minus

33
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,390
that is the percent decline.

34
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,000
So maybe we just have to figure out this. But look.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I can prove to you mathematically that we still

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
can't figure it out without this. Because Y80 divided by Y70,

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
that's equal to 2/3X-- oh no, sorry, Y80.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:52,150
So Y80, that's 1/2X in 1980 divided by 2/3X in 1970. Right?

39
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:56,450
And then let's see. If we could take this 3/2 up, we get,

40
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:03,260
let's see-- divide by 1/3. 3 becomes 3/2.

41
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:08,010
So it becomes 3/4X80 over X70.

42
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,500
They never told us what the median household income in

43
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,790
country X was in any year.

44
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,860
So we still can't solve this problem.

45
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:22,020
So there's not enough information given. Next problem, 92.

46
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,980
A certain group of car dealerships agreed to donate x dollars

47
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,980
to a Red Cross chapter for each car sold

48
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,170
during a 30-day period.

49
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,400
What was the total amount that was expected to be donated?

50
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:46,270
So the total amount-- let's see. Donation is going to be

51
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:50,550
equal to x dollars times the number of cars.

52
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,000
And this is what we need to figure out.

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,060
We need to figure out what the donations are equal to,

54
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,790
or the expected donations.

55
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,000
It says a total of 500 cars were expected to be sold.

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,010
So it's essentially telling us that C is equal to 500.

57
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,120
We still can't figure out what D is because we don't know

58
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,550
how many dollars are we getting for each car.

59
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,070
So that is not enough information by itself.

60
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:15,440
Statement two. 60 more cars were sold than expected.

61
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:22,110
So the total amount actually donated was $28,000.Interesting.

62
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:29,940
So essentially it's saying that C plus-so if you had an extra

63
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:34,690
60 cars than expected, right? 500 were expected to be sold.

64
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,010
Actually we could just say 500 were expected to be sold.

65
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,740
60 more cars were sold than expected.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,720
So this is the actual number that were sold. And then

67
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,030
that times the amount donated per car is equal to $28,000.

68
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,580
Well, now we do have enough information to figure out--

69
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,840
well, let's think about it.

70
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,870
We have enough information from this to figure out x, right?

71
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:07,340
Well, we definitely have enough information now to

72
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,450
figure out x if we use statement number one.

73
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,700
I just want to be careful to make sure that we can't solve

74
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,020
this just with statement number two.

75
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:20,210
If I just said 560x is equal to $28,000,

76
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:27,830
then you get x is equal to 28,000 over 560.

77
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:31,090
So then the amount that was expected to be donated would be

78
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:37,470
28,000 over 560-- that's what x is, whatever that number is

79
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,450
times the number of cars that were expected to be sold.

80
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,030
Times 500.

81
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,300
And actually, yeah, you have to have statement one there,

82
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,020
because statement two-- 60 more cars were sold.

83
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,050
Actually, let me think about that. So both combined,

84
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,210
when I use both of the information, it definitely works.

85
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,580
So let me see if I can figure it out just using statement two

86
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,000
alone. I don't think I can, but I have a nagging feeling that

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,710
they may be giving more information than I'm--

88
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:08,130
so let me say that the cars expected is C.

89
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,060
So this is what statement two actually is telling us.

90
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,810
I assumed the 500, which I shouldn't have done.

91
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,630
So statement two is actually telling, when I have 60 more

92
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:25,080
than the cars expected to be sold times x, I raised $28,000.

93
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,010
Right. This alone is not-- you don't know what x or C is.

94
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:34,460
Because at the end of the day you need to know

95
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,560
what x times C is. x times C is our goal.

96
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:44,090
So if you distributed this out,you get xC plus 60x is

97
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:53,020
equal to $28,000.And you get xC is equal to 28,000 minus 60x.

98
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,000
So this is as much information as you can glean just from

99
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,600
statement number two. So that alone is not enough.

100
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,890
If you could figure out what x is, you're done.

101
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,100
You actually don't need to know the expected

102
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,030
number of cars sold. You would just know.

103
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,030
Well actually, that's true with statement one.

104
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,020
So you need both of these statements to solve the problem.

105
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,040
Anyway, as you can see,I haven't done these problems before.

106
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,040
So sometimes I'm not sure.

107
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:23,370
And sometimes I might even get them wrong. Problem 93.

108
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,020
While driving on the expressway,

109
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,000
did Robin ever exceed the 55 mile an hour speed limit?

110
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,010
Well, who knows? Statement one. Robin drove 100 miles.

111
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,760
Well, that doesn't tell me whether she ever went more than--

112
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,880
I'm assuming it's a she.

113
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,790
I guess it's an androgynous sounding name.

114
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:46,060
That still doesn't tell me whether she went over 100 miles.

115
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,060
Two. Robin drove for 2 hours on the expressway.

116
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,940
So time is equal to 2 hours.

117
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,740
So each of these independently give me no information about

118
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,750
how fast she went.

119
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,470
But if I use both of them,I can figure out her average speed.

120
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,930
I can say, well, she went 100 miles in 2 hours.

121
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:11,060
Average speed is equal to 50 miles per hour.

122
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,000
Now, the question is,did Robin ever exceed the speed limit?

123
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,380
Well, I don't know. It's completely possible that

124
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,720
she just went up to 50 miles an hour.

125
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,390
Well, we don't know how fast her car accelerates.

126
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:30,440
She might just gone-- she accelerated really fast, got to 55,

127
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,910
stayed there or went down a little bit and ended up

128
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,740
averaging at 55. She's never exceeded it.

129
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,330
But she could have easily gone 80 miles an hour at some point

130
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,680
and then slowed down and taken a break, and had a picnic.

131
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,070
We don't know. So this by itself is not enough information

132
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,030
to figure out if she ever exceeded the speed limit.

133
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,690
If her average speed was 56 miles per hour,

134
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,410
then we'd know that she had to exceed the speed limit.

135
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:58,310
Because, well, we can assume that at some some point she

136
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,000
was going at least 56 miles per hour.

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,520
And especially if we can assume that she started at a

138
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,340
standstill, because then you'd have to go even faster than

139
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,600
the average to make up for the time that you're going slower.

140
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,420
But anyway, there's not enough information here to figure it

141
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,780
out,just knowing that her average speed was 50.

142
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,130
Next problem.

143
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,160
94. In Jefferson School,

144
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:28,450
300 students study French or Spanish or both. OK.

145
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:32,510
This sounds like a Venn Diagram. French or Spanish or both.

146
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:37,090
So this is French, this is Spanish.

147
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,040
And this right here is both, in the intersection.

148
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,170
If 100 of these students do not study French-- OK,

149
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,960
they study French or Spanish or both.

150
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,540
There's not an option to do neither.

151
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:55,400
If 100 of these students do not study French, how many of

152
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,460
these students study both French and Spanish?

153
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,370
So when they tell us that 100 of these students do not study

154
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,530
French, that tells us that this area-- let me color it in

155
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:10,550
a suitably garish color. Oh, no.That's not what I want to do.

156
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:20,010
That tells us that this area right here is 100.So essentially

157
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:24,050
the people who are studying Spanish but not French is 100.

158
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,820
Right? And they're asking, how many of these students study

159
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,240
both French and Spanish?

160
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,360
So they essentially want to know the intersection of

161
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,590
French and Spanish.That purple area is what the question asks

162
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:38,000
So let's explore the statements.

163
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,190
Statement number one tells us, of the 300 students,

164
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:48,030
60 do not study Spanish. 60 no Spanish.

165
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:52,780
So that's essentially telling us this area.

166
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,780
Not this, just this.

167
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:59,020
So that tells us how many study French only. That's 60.

168
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,050
It still doesn't help us to know the intersection.

169
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:09,380
Statement number two says, a total of 240 of the students

170
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,480
study Spanish.

171
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,010
Well, I think this alone is enough information, right?

172
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,880
Because they're telling us that this purple area plus

173
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,740
this yellow area is equal to 240.

174
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,940
We want to figure out the purple area, right?

175
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:30,460
So the total number of people who study Spanish-- it's the

176
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,320
people who study French and Spanish, which is this purple

177
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,130
area-- plus the people who only study Spanish,

178
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,040
which they gave us in the problem was 100.

179
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,030
And then statement number two says that that is equal to 240.

180
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:45,530
So the people who study French and Spanish has to be the

181
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,920
purple area, which is 240 minus 100, which is 140.

182
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,540
Which we don't have to figure out the number, we just have

183
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,360
to know that two gives us enough information, by itself,

184
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,510
to solve the problem.

185
00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:01,030
And we don't even need statement number one.

186
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:04,000
and I'm out of time. See you in the next video.
