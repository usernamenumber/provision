1
00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:03,600
A local hospital is holding a raffle.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,067
The individual cost of participating in the raffle

3
00:00:07,067 --> 00:00:09,533
is given by the following expression

4
00:00:09,533 --> 00:00:15,133
5t + 3 or 5 * t + 3, where t represents

5
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:18,533
the number of tickets one purchases.

6
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:26,733
evaluate the expression when t = 1, t = 8 & t = 10

7
00:00:26,733 --> 00:00:33,133
Lets first take the situation when t = 1, so the

8
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:47,133
expression becomes 5 * 1 + 3 and we know

9
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:49,800
from order of operations, we do the multiplication

10
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:57,333
before we do the addition. so ( 5 * 1) + 3 =

11
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:00,800
5 + 3 = 8.

12
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:09,400
Now we do it when t = 8, this expression becomes

13
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:29,800
(5 * 8) + 3 = 40 + 3 = 43

14
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:35,400
so we have the last situation when t = 10

15
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:59,067
so we have ( 5 * 10) + 3 = 50 + 3 = 53

16
00:01:59,067 --> 99:59:59,999
and we are done
