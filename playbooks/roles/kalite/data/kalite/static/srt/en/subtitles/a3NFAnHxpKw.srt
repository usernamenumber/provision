1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,899
In the last video, we saw that China had increased its M1 money supply

2
00:00:04,899 --> 00:00:13,328
from November of 2009 to November of 2010 by roughly 700 billion dollars.

3
00:00:13,328 --> 00:00:18,091
What I want to do in this video is compare that to increase in foreign assets.

4
00:00:18,091 --> 00:00:20,560
So we move up here once again.

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,739
All of this data is straight from the website of the people's bank of China.

6
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:28,558
And this is the URL right over here.

7
00:00:28,558 --> 00:00:31,488
And your can get from multiple years that have tons of other statistics.

8
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:34,190
And so this chart tells us their foreign assets and foreign exchange.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,790
Now I'm just gonna to focus on foreign assets because when they print currency and say

10
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,190
with their printed yuan, they go buy dollars.

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,590
With that dollars we could buy, or they could keep it in dollars

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,100
or they could buy treasury bonds or they could just go buy US assets.

13
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,320
So assets are the best measure of what they are holding

14
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:57,190
that is denominated in other currencies.

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,990
So let's look at their growth from November of 2009 to November of 2010.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,983
This is why I pick November because we don't have December of 2010 in this chart.

17
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:11,582
So foreign assets, once again this is in hundred million yuan.

18
00:01:11,582 --> 00:01:13,386
Foreign assets in November 2009,

19
00:01:13,386 --> 00:01:18,460
183,651 and that's in hundred million yuan.

20
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:25,566
And you fast forward to November 2010, it is 212,733.

21
00:01:25,566 --> 00:01:31,828
So let's once again put that in terms that make a little more sense at least for someone who is used to dollars.

22
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:35,695
So I will use a very rough approximation for the US.

23
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:38,080
Yuan exchanges in last years, that's close to 6.58 now.

24
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,190
But it gets to about 700 billion dollars increase in money supply

25
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,630
that we get in last video. So let's check this out.

26
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:52,438
So we end up at 212,733 hundred million yuan in foreign assets

27
00:01:52,438 --> 00:02:01,190
November 2010 minus 183,651 so that is the difference.

28
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,990
And this is in hundred million yuan. So let's multiply by a hundred.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,838
So this will be million yuan. Now we divide this by 1,000. This will give us billion yuan.

30
00:02:13,853 --> 00:02:19,698
It's actually close to 2900 billion yuan. So it's almost 3 trillion yuan.

31
00:02:19,698 --> 00:02:23,038
If we want to convert this into dollar, I should choose the same 6.5.

32
00:02:23,038 --> 00:02:31,548
I can do 6.58. Let me just do 6.58. So divide it by 6.58 to put it into billions of US dollars.

33
00:02:31,548 --> 00:02:40,705
So you see there is a 440 billion increase in foreign assets when demoninated in dollars.

34
00:02:40,705 --> 00:02:52,882
So let's think about that. Let's think about this. M1 from November 2009 to November 2010,

35
00:02:52,882 --> 00:03:02,106
M1 was up by approximately 700 billion dollars,

36
00:03:02,106 --> 00:03:08,852
and foreign assets were up approximately, what was the number I just typed there?

37
00:03:08,852 --> 00:03:13,422
Approximately 440 billion.

38
00:03:13,422 --> 00:03:18,275
So most the expansion of the monetary base, of their M1 base,

39
00:03:18,275 --> 00:03:23,067
was to go out to buy foreign assets over the course of 2010.

40
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:27,057
And the balances really just kind of support the growth of actual Chinese economy

41
00:03:27,057 --> 00:03:32,853
with most of it is to go out there buy foreign assets in other currencies.

42
00:03:32,853 --> 00:03:40,599
And actually help keep the yuan devalued. This is Salman Khan of the Khan Academy for CNBC.
