00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:05,133
A thermometer in a science lab displays the temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit.

2
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:08,733
If the mercury in the thermometer rises to 56 degrees Fahrenheit,

3
00:00:08,733 --> 00:00:13,344
what is the corresponding Celsius termperature?

4
00:00:14,267 --> 00:00:18,800
And then they give us the two formulas - if we know the Celsius temperature, how do we figure out

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,667
the Fahrenheit temperature, or if we know the Fahrenheit temperature how do we figure out the Celsius temperature.

6
00:00:23,667 --> 00:00:27,667
And these are actually derived from each other, and you'll learn more about that when you do algebra,

7
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:32,133
and we also - maybe in another video - will explain how you do derive them,

8
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:34,400
and this is kind of interesting, involves a little bit of algebra.

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,333
But they gave us the formula, so they really just want us to apply it,

10
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:40,333
and, maybe, make sure we understand which one we should apply.

11
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:45,600
Well, they're giving us the Fahrenheit temperature here, so F is equal to 56,

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,467
and they're asking us for the Celsius temperature, so we need to figure out what the Celsius temperature is.

13
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:55,333
Well, in this one over here, if you know the Fahrenheit temperature

14
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:57,333
you can solve for the Celsius termperature.

15
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:58,733
So let's use this, right over here.

16
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:04,933
Our Celsius temperature is going to be (5 / 9) times the Fahrenheit temperature.

17
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:11,267
- the Fahrenheit temperature is 56 degrees Fahrenheit - minus 32.

18
00:01:13,452 --> 00:01:18,041
Well 56 minus 32 is 24, so this is going to be equal to

19
00:01:18,718 --> 00:01:24,975
(5 / 9) times 24, and this is the same thing as

20
00:01:25,267 --> 00:01:29,400
5 times 24, all over 9.

21
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,400
And before multiplying out 5 times 24 we can divide

22
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,267
the numerator and the denominator by 3, so lets do that.

23
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:41,267
If we divide the numerator and denominator by 3 we're not changing the value.

24
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:45,600
24 divided by 3 is 8, 9 divided by 3 is 3.

25
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,067
So it becomes 5 times 8, which is 40, over 3, degrees.

26
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:56,067
And if we want to write this as a number which makes a little bit more sense,

27
00:01:56,067 --> 00:02:01,867
in terms of temperature, lets divide 3 into 40 to get the number of degrees we have.

28
00:02:01,867 --> 00:02:09,467
3 goes into 4 one time, with a remainder of 1, carry the 1 down and bring down the zero.

29
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:14,600
3 goes into 10 three times, with a remainder of 1, carry the 1 again,

30
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,933
then you could bring down another zero - we now have a decimal point over here.

31
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:25,467
3 goes into ten 3 times, so this 3 is going to repeat forever.

32
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:30,333
So you could view this as equal 13.333... -

33
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:34,667
it'll just keep repeating, this line on top means repeating - degrees Celsius.

34
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:38,133
Or, you could say that 3 goes into 40

35
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:42,467
13 times with a remainder of 1.

36
00:02:42,467 --> 00:02:47,800
So you could say that this is also equal to 13, remainder 1.

37
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,467
So 13 and one third degrees Celsius.

38
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:57,267
Either way it works, but that's our Celsius temperature when our Fahrenheit temperature is 56 degrees.
