00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,366
What I want to do in this video is take an expenditure view of GDP

2
00:00:04,716 --> 00:00:13,782
So we can think about how GDP can be counted, measured, and how active the different parts of an economy are.

3
00:00:13,936 --> 00:00:21,972
So GDP- the market value of all final goods and services produced-not just changed hands-produced

4
00:00:22,095 --> 00:00:24,753
within a country in a given period.

5
00:00:24,876 --> 00:00:27,687
And the symbol we use for GDP and I don't know why-but the symbol is "Y"-Y is the GDP

6
00:00:30,502 --> 00:00:36,645
And so let's think about it from an expenditure point of view.

7
00:00:36,768 --> 00:00:38,389
Think about what are all the pieces?

8
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:41,422
If were thinking of expenditure for all the players that might...

9
00:00:41,422 --> 00:00:47,389
have spent money on the final goods and services that were produced in our country

10
00:00:49,321 --> 00:00:52,370
Well you could have your firms

11
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,738
The firm's mother spend money on these goods and services

12
00:00:56,738 --> 00:00:59,589
You also have your households, they obviously could've spent

13
00:00:59,589 --> 00:01:04,054
some money on goods and services produced in this country.

14
00:01:04,054 --> 00:01:08,440
Then you also have, you also have in fact

15
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,321
in all countries you have the government, the government could've spent money

16
00:01:12,321 --> 00:01:15,486
on the goods and services produced in this country, and

17
00:01:15,486 --> 00:01:19,807
if we assume that we are trading with other countries, there are other countries

18
00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:25,887
that might've spend money on the goods and services, other

19
00:01:25,887 --> 00:01:29,187
outside...let's just write foreign

20
00:01:29,187 --> 00:01:32,104
people outside the country money to spend money on goods and services

21
00:01:32,104 --> 00:01:36,854
so foreign purchases, and another way to think about it

22
00:01:36,854 --> 00:01:40,054
would've been this is exports

23
00:01:40,054 --> 00:01:46,320
our country is exporting its people outside of the country and they're purchasing it, now this is almost complete

24
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,970
but if we look at all of the money that firms are spending, all the money that households are spending,

25
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:55,071
all the money that governments are spending. Some of it that they are spending might not

26
00:01:55,071 --> 00:02:00,922
be on goods and services that are produced in this country, they might be spending some of the stuff on

27
00:02:00,922 --> 00:02:05,472
things that are produced outside of this country so we would have to subtract it out if we really

28
00:02:05,472 --> 00:02:13,040
wanted to have goods and services produced within the country, so what we're gonna want to do is subtract out foreign products

29
00:02:19,953 --> 00:02:24,007
or another way of thinking about it, the typical way of thinking about it..we would subtract imports

30
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:29,444
So if you think about it all of the goods and services that meet these classifications, the final goods and services

31
00:02:29,444 --> 00:02:34,609
produced in the country in a given time, that firms spent money on and add that to the good and services that households spent money on

32
00:02:34,609 --> 00:02:42,926
and add that to the goods and services that the Government spent on, and all the goods and services-the exports-and

33
00:02:42,926 --> 00:02:50,043
make sure we're not counting the goods and services that other countries produce so we subtract those out

34
00:02:50,043 --> 00:02:54,927
this would give you a pretty good measure of all the goods and services produced within a country

35
00:02:54,927 --> 00:03:01,060
and this is pretty close to the way that economists actually do measure it, so what they do is say

36
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:12,177
Y is equal to "Investment", and we saw in the previous video investment in the macroeconomics term isn't quite what it is in the everyday term

37
00:03:12,177 --> 00:03:16,577
It really essentially means the spending by firms, so pretty much everything that the firm spends

38
00:03:16,577 --> 00:03:22,634
In theory you're spending that money to make future goods and services or to make goods and services, so

39
00:03:22,634 --> 00:03:29,548
that's all considered investment and a little bit of the household spending is considered investment, just new houses

40
00:03:29,548 --> 00:03:41,350
but the bulk of household spending is considered to be consumption, and then everything that the government spends on

41
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:54,984
whether it's the military, and all the salaries for police people, and whatever they do...the grounds-keeping at the White House

42
00:03:54,984 --> 00:04:00,871
whatever else if you are thinking about the U.S. That goes straight to "G". And over here you have foreign exports minus

43
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:04,233
foreign inputs so you have exports minus imports so you could view this is a net exports

44
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:20,268
if this number is positive then net exports are positive and we're exporting more than we're importing, if this number

45
00:04:20,268 --> 00:04:27,150
is negative, net exports is negative that means we are importing more than we are exporting but in a traditional

46
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:35,801
expenditure-view of GDP this whole part right over here will be referred to as net exports

47
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:41,223
and so you sum up these things which are very closely related to the more intuitive versions we started off with

48
00:04:41,223 --> 00:04:48,899
then you essentially have broken down the expenditure-view of GDP in the traditional sense

49
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:55,041
In the next two videos I'm going to start thinking of a bunch of different examples and we'll think of which bucket it would fall into

50
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:58,000
and how it would affect one of these buckets.
