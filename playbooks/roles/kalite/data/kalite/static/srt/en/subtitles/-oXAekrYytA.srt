2
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:07,066
We've walked into the Academia in Florence,

3
00:00:07,116 --> 00:00:08,705
which is an old art school

4
00:00:08,705 --> 00:00:12,964
and is now #1 tourist destination in Florence, I think,

5
00:00:12,964 --> 00:00:14,671
There's a lot of people here.

6
00:00:14,671 --> 00:00:17,074
And there's a long line of people waiting outside to

7
00:00:17,074 --> 00:00:19,173
get in, and it's hard to blame them

8
00:00:19,173 --> 00:00:21,849
because inside is Michelangelo's David, and it's

9
00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:23,573
unspeakably beautiful.

10
00:00:23,573 --> 00:00:26,720
So this is a sculpture that's often seen as a perfect

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,332
exemplar of high Renaissance art.

12
00:00:29,332 --> 00:00:32,372
And I suppose it's important to get the story
out of the way first.

13
00:00:32,372 --> 00:00:36,689
It's an Old Testament story, and it speaks to a young man whose name is David.

14
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:42,250
He's brave enough to take on this terrible giant, 
this terrible enemy, Goliath,

15
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,509
that all of the older men are too fearful of to confront.

16
00:00:46,509 --> 00:00:52,369
He does so without any armor. He goes to battle against Goliath on behalf of the Israelites

17
00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:55,768
and defeats Goliath with the help of God,

18
00:00:55,768 --> 00:01:00,606
specifically with a sling shot and a single rock,
but clearly with the help of God.

19
00:01:00,606 --> 00:01:06,822
You can see the sling shot in his left hand and the rock in his right, and although the

20
00:01:06,822 --> 00:01:10,340
Bible says that David fought Goliath without armor

21
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,507
it doesn't say completely nude.

22
00:01:12,507 --> 00:01:16,319
If you look at the body, of course it's in a kind 
of classical contrapposto,

23
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,836
the weight is clearly on the right leg, the left leg is free

24
00:01:20,836 --> 00:01:25,009
but the body is engaged in something
even more complex and more specific.

25
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:27,571
Much of the body is still relaxed.

26
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:31,341
His right hand is just beginning to tense and you can

27
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:34,269
see his eyes have darted to his left.

28
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:38,993
His body, it seems to me, is about to swivel and follow the head's movement

29
00:01:38,993 --> 00:01:42,372
and so you have this sense that David has just

30
00:01:42,372 --> 00:01:45,218
caught sight of his enemy and his body is just

31
00:01:45,218 --> 00:01:48,940
beginning to tense. He's just preparing to meet Goliath.

32
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,691
It's impossible not to notice the remarkable

33
00:01:52,691 --> 00:01:55,735
knowledge that Michelangelo brings of the human

34
00:01:55,735 --> 00:01:59,079
body, of how it works and the muscles and the skeletal

35
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:03,026
structure and he created this ideally beautiful figure.

36
00:02:03,026 --> 00:02:06,099
Michelangelo had dissected the human body, understood

37
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:08,765
it's internal structure, and this is a fascinating thought:

38
00:02:08,765 --> 00:02:12,693
it was not long before this age that in the west

39
00:02:12,693 --> 00:02:15,247
we had no idea how the human body functioned.

40
00:02:15,247 --> 00:02:17,526
We take for granted in the 21st century

41
00:02:17,526 --> 00:02:19,716
that we understand the mechanics of the body.

42
00:02:19,716 --> 00:02:22,730
And so that kind of analysis of the structure

43
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,763
of the body is really an extraordinary achievement.

44
00:02:24,763 --> 00:02:26,976
This is a sculpture that is about potential.

45
00:02:26,976 --> 00:02:29,690
It is showing this idealized body, but in a sense

46
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,386
we can begin to see ourselves
in this kind of heroic stance as well.

47
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:37,617
This is nearly three times the size of a human being.

48
00:02:37,617 --> 00:02:40,615
You can see why Michelangelo later got the name

49
00:02:40,615 --> 00:02:42,846
Il Divino, "the divine one".

50
00:02:42,846 --> 00:02:44,691
It's important to remember that Michelangelo

51
00:02:44,691 --> 00:02:47,896
is a relatively unknown sculptor at this point. (He's young.)

52
00:02:47,896 --> 00:02:50,845
He's really young, he had had one major commission

53
00:02:50,845 --> 00:02:53,446
which is the Pieta, and then he comes out with this

54
00:02:53,446 --> 00:02:56,849
tour de force, which will bring him
an enormous amount of attention.

55
00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:00,946
He was commissioned by the city government 
of Florence in 1501.

56
00:03:00,946 --> 00:03:03,661
He was originally going to be placed on one of the

57
00:03:03,661 --> 00:03:08,061
tribunes high atop the roof line of the Duomo in Florence

58
00:03:08,061 --> 00:03:09,784
that is, of the main cathedral of Florence.

59
00:03:09,784 --> 00:03:12,716
So it was meant to be seen from very far below.

60
00:03:12,716 --> 00:03:16,144
When Michelangelo showed 
what he had completed three years later

61
00:03:16,144 --> 00:03:18,875
to his patrons, the city government of Florence,

62
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:22,233
they were astounded at how unbelievably beautiful it

63
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:25,217
was and thought, there's no way we want to put this

64
00:03:25,217 --> 00:03:27,743
high up. We're going to put it in the piazza,

65
00:03:27,743 --> 00:03:30,701
in the square, in front of the Signoria.

66
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:33,115
In front of the government building of Florence.

67
00:03:33,115 --> 00:03:34,801
And that's because not only was the sculpture so

68
00:03:34,801 --> 00:03:36,885
extraordinarily beautiful, but because the story of

69
00:03:36,885 --> 00:03:39,182
David had come to be aligned with the story of

70
00:03:39,182 --> 00:03:41,962
Florence. It was a symbol of the republic of Florence

71
00:03:41,962 --> 00:03:44,693
in opposition to the notion of tyranny.

72
00:03:44,693 --> 00:03:47,719
This was a very particular moment in Florentine history.

73
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:50,368
The Medici had by that time actually assumed

74
00:03:50,368 --> 00:03:52,619
a great amount of power and had really subverted

75
00:03:52,619 --> 00:03:56,396
the republican ideals of the city and so this

76
00:03:56,396 --> 00:03:59,432
was a brief moment of the flourishing again of

77
00:03:59,432 --> 00:04:03,227
these democratic ideals. There were ways in which

78
00:04:03,227 --> 00:04:06,103
the pose referred specifically back to classical

79
00:04:06,103 --> 00:04:10,578
images of Hercules. Hercules was a long standing

80
00:04:10,578 --> 00:04:13,245
symbol of Florence as well. So there's a

81
00:04:13,245 --> 00:04:15,753
whole set of symbols that surround this figure.

82
00:04:15,753 --> 00:04:19,397
By making a colossal male nude, and by that we

83
00:04:19,397 --> 00:04:23,551
mean way over life size, Michelangelo is taking on

84
00:04:23,551 --> 00:04:27,743
a type of sculpture that the ancient Greeks and

85
00:04:27,743 --> 00:04:32,082
Romans had made and in a way surpassing what the

86
00:04:32,082 --> 00:04:33,814
ancient Greeks and Romans had done

87
00:04:33,814 --> 00:04:37,111
showing that Florence itself has surpassed ancient

88
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:39,519
Greece and Rome too. We know that Florence saw itself

89
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:43,886
as sometimes the New Athens or the New Rome.

90
00:04:43,886 --> 00:04:46,516
In fact, an important part of the mythology of

91
00:04:46,516 --> 00:04:49,031
Florence was that it had been founded by the

92
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:51,821
ancient Romans. It was an inherent part of their identity.

93
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:54,447
So this all makes sense. It makes total sense that

94
00:04:54,447 --> 00:04:57,161
the government in Florence, the signoria, would see

95
00:04:57,161 --> 00:05:00,385
this sculpture and bring it to the Piazza Vecchia,

96
00:05:00,385 --> 00:05:02,618
bring it to the seat of government (as this potent

97
00:05:02,618 --> 00:05:06,068
symbol). A special conveyance was built to bring it

98
00:05:06,068 --> 00:05:10,338
to the Signoria. There were 14 greased logs that

99
00:05:10,338 --> 00:05:14,612
rolled it with the power of 40 men over several days

100
00:05:14,612 --> 00:05:17,936
from the studio to the piazza. And thy didn't want

101
00:05:17,936 --> 00:05:20,198
it to go up in the cathedral. They wanted it close.

102
00:05:20,198 --> 00:05:22,517
they celebrated it. The city fell in love with this

103
00:05:22,517 --> 00:05:25,905
sculpture and saw it as the most powerful symbol

104
00:05:25,982 --> 00:05:30,549
they could imagine of their renewed republic.
