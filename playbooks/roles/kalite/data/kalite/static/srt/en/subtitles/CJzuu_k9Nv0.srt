1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,405
Let's see if we can handle

2
00:00:01,405 --> 00:00:05,210
some slightly more difficult amine naming examples.

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:07,533
So if we look at this blue molecule right here

4
00:00:07,533 --> 00:00:09,216
we always want to start off

5
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:11,121
by finding the longest carbon chain.

6
00:00:11,121 --> 00:00:12,871
It looks like it's this chain at the bottom

7
00:00:12,871 --> 00:00:19,870
where we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 carbons.

8
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,530
So it's going to be octan.

9
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,092
We don't want to just call it octane

10
00:00:24,092 --> 00:00:26,214
because we have these functional groups up here

11
00:00:26,214 --> 00:00:28,275
and maybe one of them is going to take higher priority

12
00:00:28,275 --> 00:00:30,000
than just the fact that this is an alkane.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,610
And, in fact, one of them will.

14
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,850
So let's look at them.

15
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,340
So over here we an amino group.

16
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,310
That would make this molecule an amine.

17
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,170
So this is an amino group right here.

18
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,500
Then we have this benzene ring.

19
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,540
And when benzene is a functional group

20
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,867
we call it a phenyl group.

21
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:53,600
And that's derived from I think it's either the Greek

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,154
or the Latin word for light

23
00:00:55,154 --> 00:00:58,924
because benzene was first isolated from, I guess

24
00:00:58,924 --> 00:01:00,772
the air around lanterns or something

25
00:01:00,772 --> 00:01:02,477
so this is called a phenyl group.

26
00:01:02,477 --> 00:01:04,084
And then finally we have this OH

27
00:01:04,084 --> 00:01:06,127
which would make this whole thing an alcohol

28
00:01:06,127 --> 00:01:08,509
or we could call that a hydroxy group

29
00:01:08,509 --> 00:01:12,727
so this right here is a hydroxy group.

30
00:01:12,727 --> 00:01:15,237
Now, this is just something that you need to know.

31
00:01:15,237 --> 00:01:17,560
There's no way to kind of deduce it.

32
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,590
The people who've decided how to name things

33
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,505
just decided that

34
00:01:20,505 --> 00:01:23,086
certain groups take higher priority over others.

35
00:01:23,086 --> 00:01:24,762
And out of these three groups

36
00:01:24,762 --> 00:01:25,886
the hydroxy group

37
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:27,930
the thing that's making this whole thing an alcohol

38
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,202
takes the highest priority

39
00:01:30,202 --> 00:01:32,790
so this is what's going to define the suffix.

40
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,190
So if we start numbering

41
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,405
we want to start numbering this chain

42
00:01:35,405 --> 00:01:37,921
closest to the highest priority group.

43
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:39,310
So we'll start numbering at this end.

44
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:47,250
So it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

45
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,101
So we have a hydroxy group on the three carbon

46
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:57,035
so this is octan-3-ol.

47
00:01:57,035 --> 00:01:58,484
If this was not a high priority

48
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:00,095
we would put a hydroxy in the front

49
00:02:00,095 --> 00:02:01,331
but since this is the highest prioritiy

50
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:03,648
its defining this as an alcohol, octanol.

51
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:06,290
But we put the 3 there to say it's on the three carbon.

52
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,058
And then, of course, this would be 5-phenyl.

53
00:02:09,058 --> 00:02:14,530
This right here is 5-phenyl.

54
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,470
And this right here is 8-amino.

55
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,210
And amino comes before phenyl in alphabetical order

56
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,508
so this whole molecule is going to be

57
00:02:23,508 --> 00:02:24,796
-- let me write it over here --

58
00:02:24,796 --> 00:02:45,118
it's going to be 8-amino-5-phenyl-octan-3-ol.

59
00:02:45,118 --> 00:02:46,061
And we're done.

60
00:02:46,061 --> 00:02:49,137
So this is an aromatic compound

61
00:02:49,137 --> 00:02:50,300
because of the benzene ring.

62
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,730
It's an amine because of the amino group.

63
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:56,890
And it's an alcohol because of the hydroxy group.

64
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,810
Now let's look at this molecule here in green.

65
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,500
And actually, I forgot to draw part of it.

66
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,160
This is supposed to be a benzene ring.

67
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,720
So let me make clear.

68
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,975
That is a benzene ring.

69
00:03:05,975 --> 00:03:07,127
So let's think about

70
00:03:07,127 --> 00:03:08,888
the different functional groups here.

71
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:09,775
And we'll start with the one

72
00:03:09,775 --> 00:03:12,067
that you've probably never seen before.

73
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:18,240
This is a nitro group, and it's highly explosive.

74
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,215
Maybe in a future video

75
00:03:19,215 --> 00:03:22,049
I'll show you some nitroglycerin and some TNT

76
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:24,968
as you know, which are highly explosive

77
00:03:24,968 --> 00:03:26,720
but they have nitro groups on them.

78
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,040
So this right here is a nitro group.

79
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,543
It takes very low precedence

80
00:03:32,543 --> 00:03:33,872
in the whole scheme of things.

81
00:03:33,872 --> 00:03:39,480
So this will never be the cause of naming the suffix.

82
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,970
We just know that this is a nitro group right here.

83
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,970
We, of course, have a bromo group

84
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,820
that we've seen many times.

85
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,980
That is a bromo group.

86
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:53,230
And then we have an amino group right here.

87
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,285
So this is going to be

88
00:03:54,285 --> 00:03:56,110
-- let me do this in a different color.

89
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,968
This is definitely an amine.

90
00:03:58,968 --> 00:04:07,026
This is an amino group right there.

91
00:04:07,026 --> 00:04:08,240
And out of these three groups

92
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,600
the amino group is definitely of the highest priority.

93
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,552
So you might be tempted to name this

94
00:04:13,552 --> 00:04:19,150
1-amino-2,3-bromo-4-nitrobenzene

95
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,888
but when a benzene ring

96
00:04:20,888 --> 00:04:22,439
is attached to an amino group

97
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:25,183
this one also has one of those special names.

98
00:04:25,183 --> 00:04:26,930
And let me just do it on the side right here.

99
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:33,645
So if I just have a benzene ring

100
00:04:33,645 --> 00:04:36,577
attached to an amino group

101
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:38,913
so that's an NH2 right there

102
00:04:38,913 --> 00:04:40,913
we call this molecule right here

103
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,515
and this is just the common name for it

104
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:50,018
and it's something to put in your toolkit, this is aniline.

105
00:04:50,018 --> 00:04:51,710
So that will be the base name.

106
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:57,800
This whole thing right here we call aniline.

107
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,900
Let me write it over here.

108
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,071
So this is aniline.

109
00:05:03,071 --> 00:05:04,848
And then we always want to start numbering

110
00:05:04,848 --> 00:05:06,785
at the group that's really defining the molecules

111
00:05:06,785 --> 00:05:08,260
so we start numbering here.

112
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,617
And you want to go in the order

113
00:05:09,617 --> 00:05:11,419
where you're going to bump into something first.

114
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:15,715
So, 1, 2, 3, 4. So this is going to be

115
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:16,724
-- if we look at them

116
00:05:16,724 --> 00:05:19,642
and bromo comes alphabetically before nitro --

117
00:05:19,642 --> 00:05:40,043
so it's going to be 3-bromo-4-nitroaniline.

118
00:05:40,043 --> 00:05:41,950
And we are done!
