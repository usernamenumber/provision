1
00:00:01,117 --> 00:00:04,104
Lets take a look at the simplest alkene so that would just be

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:13,089
2 carbons that are double bonded to each other and then I put the hydrogens around each carbon

3
00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:19,442
like that.lets comapare that to a 2 carbon alkene.so a 2 carbon alkene will then have

4
00:00:19,442 --> 00:00:26,350
6 hydrogens around it like that so when we did our alkene nomenclature we called a 2 carbon

5
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:34,503
alkane we call this molecule in the right ethane so this over here is ethane.

6
00:00:34,503 --> 00:00:41,942
So you can see ane ending for an alkane.and eth ofcourse means there are 2 carbons

7
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:50,399
so if we look at the 2 carbon alkene over here on the left i know that the root is going to be eth

8
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,770
so i go ahead and write eth the ending is alkene not alkane so instead of an ane ending

9
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:02,146
its going to get an ene ending.so this molecule over here is ethene.

10
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:09,502
the other name for this molecule is ethelene so ethene or ethelene either one is fine.

11
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:13,549
So lets look at the molecular formulas for these molecule.

12
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:29,369
So on the right ethane has C2H6 like that so had the general formula if we have n carbons you have 2n+2 hydrogens like that.C2H2n+2

13
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:38,818
on the left has the molecular formula of C2H4 and therefore its general formula would be

14
00:01:38,818 --> 00:01:47,176
if you have n carbon CnH2n hydrogens like that.So we can see that ethene doesn't

15
00:01:47,176 --> 00:01:55,311
have as many hydrogens as ethane does.Ethane has as many hydrogens as possible as for these carbon atoms

16
00:01:55,311 --> 00:02:02,210
so ethane is said to be saturated with hydrogen so lets go ahead and write that this one over here molecule

17
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:07,440
as "saturated" with hydrogens it can't get any more hydrogens.

18
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:14,428
Ethene over here only has 4 hydrogens.so it could actually add 2 more so that some chemistery we havn't gone into yet.

19
00:02:14,428 --> 00:02:23,039
But right now is not completely saturated with hydrogen so it is said to be "unsaturated".

20
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:28,035
So we have "unsaturated" VS "saturated".since we have 4 hydrogens over here

21
00:02:28,035 --> 00:02:37,829
and 6 hydrogens over here.so in future video we will see how these saturated unsaturated relate to fact that everyone heard before.

22
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:45,849
so look at these molecules more lets look at the hybridization states of the carbon atoms.

23
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:52,021
so lets look at hybridization state of this carbon atom .there are only single

24
00:02:52,021 --> 00:03:00,570
bonds around that carbon.therefore that must be sp3 hybridized carbon like that and exact same situation

25
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:07,238
for this carbon so each sp3 hybridized carbon is going to exhibit tetrahedral

26
00:03:07,238 --> 00:03:17,594
geometry.what about the carbons over here on the left.

27
00:03:17,594 --> 00:03:24,768
well this carbon has a double bond so therefore must be sp2 hybridization

28
00:03:24,768 --> 00:03:29,192
so sp2 hybridized this carbon over here also sp2 hybridized.sp2 hybridized carbon are

29
00:03:29,192 --> 00:03:33,743
trigonal planar in terms of there geometry.

30
00:03:33,743 --> 00:03:38,975
so molecule on the left is flat and the molecule on right is tetrahedral

31
00:03:38,975 --> 00:03:44,174
all single bonds in the molecule on the right so if i look at all these bonds all single bonds

32
00:03:44,174 --> 00:03:51,299
they are all sigma bonds so the bond between my 2 carbon atom is a sigma bond.

33
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:57,300
and sigma bonds allow free rotation so on the right there is free rotation between the

34
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:03,699
2 carbon atoms.and since there is a free rotation between those 2 carbon atoms you can get several different

35
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:08,875
conformation for this ethane molecule.so we saw in earlier video about conformations

36
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,976
for ethane.so single bonds allow free rotations

37
00:04:11,976 --> 00:04:23,110
on the right in this double bond one of these bond is sigma bond.and other bond is pi bond.

38
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:29,920
so the pi bond helps stabilize that bond and it prevents any free rotation.

39
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:37,568
so there is no free rotation over here on left for double bond.

40
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:40,968
so that's a very important difference.double bonds and no free rotation

41
00:04:40,968 --> 00:04:45,896
single bonds in the right do have free rotation.

42
00:04:45,896 --> 00:04:50,911
let's look at some more alkenes.over there in left we can see

43
00:04:50,911 --> 00:04:56,544
that we have all hydrogens bonded to my double bond like that.

44
00:04:56,544 --> 00:05:00,570
Lets take off one of those hydrogens and lets put in R group on there so

45
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:08,818
i still have double bond I still have hydrogens attached to my carbon.

46
00:05:08,818 --> 00:05:12,839
I am gonna take of one of those hydrogens and put in R group.

47
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:19,421
so I have some sort of rest of the molecule over here so it substitute one time

48
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:25,975
so I am gonna call it mono substituted alkene.

49
00:05:25,975 --> 00:05:34,541
Lets take of another hydrogen and lets put on another R group.So I have H and H and R and I will make this R prime

50
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:40,356
so this is a different R group.So this is a di substituted alkene.

51
00:05:40,356 --> 00:05:42,066
So mono substitute alkene di substituted alkene.

52
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:47,413
and you can see where I am going with this Keep this hydrogen keep this R group

53
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:54,505
make this R prime (R') I will make this R double prime (R")So this is a tri substituted alkene

54
00:05:54,505 --> 00:06:03,701
and then I have one more spot where I can substitute this is R ,this is R" double prime

55
00:06:03,701 --> 00:06:09,276
and then finally this is R triple prime (R''') So I have 4 different substituent

56
00:06:09,276 --> 00:06:16,844
so it is tetra substituted.So I have a tetra substituted alkene over here.

57
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:22,438
Now the question is out of these four alkene which one is the most stable.

58
00:06:22,438 --> 00:06:29,105
So it turns out that the tetra substituted alkene is the most stable

59
00:06:29,105 --> 00:06:35,024
so the more substituents more alkule groups you have the more stable that makes your molecule.

60
00:06:35,024 --> 00:06:41,396
so tetra substituted is more stable followed by tri substituted alkene followed by di substituted alkene

61
00:06:41,396 --> 00:06:44,404
followed by mono substituted alkene.

62
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,704
is the least stable out the once that we have talked about. So these alkule groups

63
00:06:47,704 --> 00:06:53,096
allow for delocalization of electronic density throughout the molecule and that

64
00:06:53,096 --> 00:06:58,479
helps to stabilize the molecule.so the actual explanation to this is fairly complicated

65
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:05,300
and it involves quantum mechanics .Its very similar to the effect called hyperconjugation which

66
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:12,209
we will discuss in a later video. The video on carbocat.So this sort of explained in later video

67
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:21,700
SO lets take a look at 2 examples and lets try to identify the degree of substitution and identify the stability

68
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,275
of these molecules.

69
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:28,618
so lets look at these alkenes here so lets take this alkene and then lets take

70
00:07:28,618 --> 00:07:39,494
this alkene and lets compare these 2 in terms of their stability

71
00:07:39,494 --> 00:07:46,039
so first if I look at the molecule on the left I need to think what degree of substitution

72
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:50,287
is this.is it mono substituted,di substituted,tri substituted or tetra substituted.

73
00:07:50,287 --> 00:07:54,490
and the way to do it is to focus on your double bond.

74
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,207
and look at what else is in these molecules.

75
00:07:57,207 --> 00:08:02,370
well I know that there are hydrogen here and hydrogen here on that side so

76
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:09,629
there are 2 alcule groups coming off of my double bond so I think it obvious it becomes

77
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:13,474
di substituted so this is a di substituted alkene once you draw your

78
00:08:13,474 --> 00:08:15,621
hydrogen it is much easier to see.

79
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:21,037
On the right over here if I look at my double bonds well I know that this

80
00:08:21,037 --> 00:08:24,434
must be a hydrogen over here so how many

81
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:26,035
different alcule groups I have.

82
00:08:26,035 --> 00:08:29,634
I have 3 different alcule groups coming off of my double bond.

83
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:34,814
So on the right this one is tri substituted .So I have a di substituted alkene on the left

84
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,907
and Tri sunstituted alkene on the right.

85
00:08:36,907 --> 00:08:41,355
The more substituted the alkene is the more stable it is.

86
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:45,356
So this molecule over here on the right is more stable of the two
