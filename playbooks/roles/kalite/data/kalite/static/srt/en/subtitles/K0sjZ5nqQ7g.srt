We've talked a lot about mirrors, in particular parabolic mirrors that reflect light, but I want to do now is talk about lenses

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or talk about what a lens is and think about how they transmit or refract light. So a simple lens that

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we've all seen that maybe it's made out of glass or maybe something else is each surface, and I'm going

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to focus on convex lenses first, so remember: concave means it opens inward like a cave; convex means

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it opens outward. And in a convex lens, it will be symmetric. So one side of the lens will look like

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that, and you can view this, and often times the simpler lenses are made this way, it's part of the surface

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of a sphere, and its symmetric so it has some center right over here and then you have another surface o

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of a sphere that's exactly the same.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's think about what's going to happen as light goes through this lens as it is transmitted through

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it and maybe gets diffracted by it. So we are assuming this is air out here and this is glass or something

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with a higher index of refraction where light travels slower. Imagine that some light that is going parallel

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to the principle axis of the lens--this is the principle axis of the lens right here just like we talked

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
about the principle axis of our parabolic mirrors- but if you imagine light that is going parallel to

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that, right when it hits this surface over here (remember the perpendicular at this point is going to

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
look like this because the lens is actually curved
