1
00:00:00,291 --> 00:00:04,345
Before we go into possible theories as to why plates actually move,

2
00:00:04,345 --> 00:00:09,406
what I want to do in this video is think a little bit about why we see the geological features

3
00:00:09,406 --> 00:00:14,935
we do see at plate boundaries, and in particular I want to focus on the features

4
00:00:14,935 --> 00:00:19,605
we see at divergent plate boundaries, where the plates are moving away from each other,

5
00:00:19,605 --> 00:00:24,203
where new land is being created like we saw in the mid-oceanic ridges,

6
00:00:24,203 --> 00:00:29,622
where we see new land being created right in the center and moving outwards from them.

7
00:00:29,622 --> 00:00:34,270
So to do that let's think about the different layers,

8
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,469
and actually, I want to make one quick correction on the last video.

9
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:39,876
Over here I had drawn these arrows going in that direction,

10
00:00:39,876 --> 00:00:43,133
and based on how I defined them, they should be going into the page

11
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:45,077
and so they should've had these Xs here.

12
00:00:45,077 --> 00:00:47,290
Now, with that out of the way, let's draw a little diagram

13
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:52,667
of what happens at the early stages of these divergent plate boundaries.

14
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:59,278
So you might have your... here you have just your crust,

15
00:00:59,278 --> 00:01:01,740
and maybe it's continental crust...

16
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,137
This right here is the Earth's crust,

17
00:01:05,137 --> 00:01:09,269
and then you have the solid part of the mantle.

18
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:15,621
And the combination of them is the lithosphere.

19
00:01:15,621 --> 00:01:20,811
And then you have the liquid part, the superhot part of the mantle,

20
00:01:20,811 --> 00:01:22,976
so this down here is magma.

21
00:01:22,976 --> 00:01:25,733
It hasn't solidified, it's hot enough to be in the liquid state.

22
00:01:25,733 --> 00:01:32,357
And all of this combined, this right here we consider the mantle.

23
00:01:32,357 --> 00:01:35,127
Now, there's some debate, and we'll talk about this in the next video,

24
00:01:35,127 --> 00:01:39,407
of how hotspots actually form, it could be these mantle plumes

25
00:01:39,407 --> 00:01:43,409
that start at the border between the mantle and the core,

26
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:46,537
it could be some type of convection currents in the actual mantle,

27
00:01:46,537 --> 00:01:50,268
we'll talk more about that in the next video or maybe a few videos from now.

28
00:01:50,268 --> 00:01:54,878
But let's take it for granted that hotspots form in the mantle,

29
00:01:54,878 --> 00:01:59,623
so let's say we have an area of magma right here, that is particularly hot.

30
00:01:59,623 --> 00:02:03,960
Let me draw it in in another color... pink.

31
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,952
So this is particularly hot magma here.

32
00:02:06,952 --> 00:02:10,202
And we know, or maybe we don't know, you'll learn to know right now,

33
00:02:10,202 --> 00:02:14,623
if you take the same material and you make it hotter, it's going to become less dense

34
00:02:14,623 --> 00:02:18,872
because the particles essentially are going to bump into each other with more kinetic energy

35
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:21,042
and have more space in between them.

36
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:27,408
and so this really hot part of the magma or this really hot part of the mantle, it is going to move upwards,

37
00:02:27,408 --> 00:02:29,333
it is going to move upwards,

38
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:32,334
because it is less dense, it will have buoyancy.

39
00:02:32,334 --> 00:02:35,137
And as it moves upwards, it'll heat up the things around it

40
00:02:35,137 --> 00:02:37,953
and it'll eventually make its way into the lithosphere

41
00:02:37,953 --> 00:02:43,565
and it'll be able to break through the lithosphere because it's so hot it can melt its way through.

42
00:02:43,565 --> 00:02:46,901
So let's fast forward this a little bit,

43
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:49,264
so this is Step 1 up here.

44
00:02:49,264 --> 00:02:54,812
Now Step 2 - this hot magma is rising out through the lithosphere,

45
00:02:54,812 --> 00:02:59,664
and so it's going to create a hotspot, a dome in the lithospere and actually on the crust,

46
00:02:59,664 --> 00:03:02,644
and so it might look like this.

47
00:03:02,644 --> 00:03:06,152
So the crust is now going to have a dome in it.

48
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:10,608
And this is the original lithosphere,

49
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:13,259
and it's now kind of been broken into by this hotspot.

50
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:21,255
So the lithosphere is now broken into, or about to be broken into by this hotspot.

51
00:03:21,255 --> 00:03:25,397
All of this is still the lithosphere, I just write 'litho' for short,

52
00:03:25,397 --> 00:03:28,127
this up here is the crust.

53
00:03:28,127 --> 00:03:32,459
And if you take any rigid material, and the crust and the lithisphere they are rigid,

54
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,419
and you push outward on that, it won't stretch nicely like a nice elastic balloon,

55
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:42,121
it will start to crack, it have to be pulled apart on order to kind of take the pushing from below.

56
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:45,832
So this crust is going to start to crack.

57
00:03:45,832 --> 00:03:49,926
Actually, the best example where you see this is actually in like sourdough bread

58
00:03:49,926 --> 00:03:52,001
that has really hard shell around it.

59
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:55,590
You see sourdough bread, let me see if I can draw a loaf of sourdough bread.

60
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,748
It has these cracks on the surface

61
00:03:58,748 --> 00:04:02,654
and that's because the outer layer, the outer shell of the bread is really rigid

62
00:04:02,654 --> 00:04:05,993
and so if the inside heats up and the surface really has to expand,

63
00:04:05,993 --> 00:04:14,800
these kind of rift form in the bread to allow that kind of rigid shell to actually expand.

64
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,491
The exact same thing would happend to the crust, or acutally the entire lithosphere.

65
00:04:19,491 --> 00:04:23,453
So let me draw this hotspot again.

66
00:04:23,453 --> 00:04:26,789
I'll do it in the pink color.

67
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:29,987
Now the hotspot has got this far.

68
00:04:29,987 --> 00:04:33,994
This is the hot magma right over here.

69
00:04:33,994 --> 00:04:42,321
And if we fast-forward a little bit more, the crust starts to be fully pulled apart.

70
00:04:42,321 --> 00:04:44,460
So you fast-forward a little bit more,

71
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,720
the bottom boundary of the lithosphere might be now start to look something like this,

72
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,725
the magma has kind of broken through the hardened part, the rigid part of the mantle,

73
00:04:55,725 --> 00:04:59,986
so maybe it looks like this right now.

74
00:04:59,986 --> 00:05:03,938
You have the hotspot right over here.

75
00:05:03,938 --> 00:05:07,151
It's got that far now.

76
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:12,938
And all the crust on top, what we normally see,

77
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:17,223
has now been pulled apart to kind of have to cover this new surface area.

78
00:05:17,223 --> 00:05:19,723
So now it looks something like this.

79
00:05:19,723 --> 00:05:23,699
It's been pushed apart, let me see how well I can draw this.

80
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:27,701
So now it's been pushed apart, and as it gets pushed apart, it kind of thins out a little bit.

81
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:30,871
As you can imagine it's almost exactly as the bread analogy.

82
00:05:30,871 --> 00:05:37,113
When you look at bread like this, the rift, the depression which is expanding most vigorously,

83
00:05:37,113 --> 00:05:44,124
those parts of the bread are actually thinner and they're not as hard as the parts that moved away.

84
00:05:44,124 --> 00:05:49,710
And you see that exact same thing happening with the land.

85
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:56,521
And all of this stuff is going to start getting pushed, continuously getting pushed outwards,

86
00:05:56,521 --> 00:05:58,516
essentially to kind of make space for this hotspot.

87
00:05:58,516 --> 00:06:02,153
Now, this step right over here you might have a volcano or two,

88
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:06,313
but more importantly, you're going to have what's called a rift valley.

89
00:06:06,313 --> 00:06:08,660
Right now we're assuming that we're not below the sea level yet,

90
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,568
or we're assuming that this kind of depression in the land that you see here

91
00:06:12,568 --> 00:06:14,931
hasn't come in contact with another body of water,

92
00:06:14,931 --> 00:06:19,143
and so it'll just become a little valley in between higher land.

93
00:06:19,143 --> 00:06:22,393
You actually see that on Earth.

94
00:06:22,393 --> 00:06:25,794
And the most famous is the African Great Rift Valley.

95
00:06:25,794 --> 00:06:28,355
That's right about this region.

96
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:32,790
Actually, I've got a better diagram that depicts the African Rift Valley right over here.

97
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:40,922
This whole region of Africa is actually a big valley created by a hotspot right over there.

98
00:06:40,922 --> 00:06:44,393
Now, as a hotspot kind of keeps maturing,

99
00:06:44,393 --> 00:06:50,047
eventually some of the rift

100
00:06:50,047 --> 00:06:53,970
will become so depressed that'll actually be below the sea level.

101
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:58,119
Remember, all of this land appear is being stretched apart.

102
00:06:58,119 --> 00:07:01,481
So let me go to the next step. The next step will be right over here.

103
00:07:01,481 --> 00:07:06,787
The land on top is now maybe below sea level, in this next step

104
00:07:06,787 --> 00:07:10,073
and comes in contact with what we view an ocean or a sea.

105
00:07:10,073 --> 00:07:12,730
And so now it might look like this.

106
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:17,528
So now the land is super-thin on top, I'll do my best to draw it.

107
00:07:17,528 --> 00:07:24,819
So super-thin on top, and remember it's keep on getting pulled apart,

108
00:07:25,803 --> 00:07:32,799
from this bubble of hot magma that's coming up from below.

109
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:35,740
Let me draw it like this.

110
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,900
This is all solid rock here.

111
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:46,238
What I do in orange is the crust, this is kind of the rocky part of the mantle,

112
00:07:46,238 --> 00:07:48,406
so the combination is the lithosphere.

113
00:07:48,406 --> 00:07:52,936
And now you have the hot magma coming up like this.

114
00:07:52,936 --> 00:07:57,936
And it might peak through every now and then and create a volcano there,

115
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:03,327
but in generall it's keep pushing the land up and outwards.

116
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,774
And so this land, even though you say: 'hey, it's been pushed up!',

117
00:08:05,774 --> 00:08:09,590
because of the outward motion, this land over here is going to be lower than the land around it,

118
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,323
like the loaf of bread,

119
00:08:11,323 --> 00:08:15,987
it get low enough, below sea level actually, it comes in contact with the body of water,

120
00:08:15,987 --> 00:08:22,544
or even if it doesn't actually, water will start to gather over there.

121
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:28,894
And once again, we actually see that in the rift forming

122
00:08:28,894 --> 00:08:31,343
between the African and Arabian plates.

123
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:34,392
The Red Sea is actually an example of exactly that.

124
00:08:34,392 --> 00:08:40,722
The Arabian Plate is moving away from the African Plate because of this hotspot.

125
00:08:40,722 --> 00:08:44,426
This is pushing all of the land up and out right over here,

126
00:08:44,426 --> 00:08:46,861
and so this is going out, that is going out,

127
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:48,795
it's moving outward in every direction,

128
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:52,012
and so it creates these depressions where water can flow inwards.

129
00:08:52,012 --> 00:08:56,936
The Rift Valley hasn't had water flown into it, the way the Red Sea has just yet,

130
00:08:56,936 --> 00:09:01,398
but if it kept capping, eventually it's get low enough so that the water will flow into it.

131
00:09:01,398 --> 00:09:03,328
So the Red Sea it exactly that.

132
00:09:03,328 --> 00:09:08,531
You essentially have the Indian Ocean flowing into this rift that formed from this hotspot.

133
00:09:08,531 --> 00:09:13,762
And the if you fast-forward a bunch so that finally the magma can kind of surface,

134
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:19,844
so let's fast-forward from this point even more,

135
00:09:19,844 --> 00:09:22,665
and let's say now the land has been pushed a good bit apart.

136
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:25,799
Now the hotspot is actually surfaced.

137
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:30,757
Now the crust might look something like this.

138
00:09:30,757 --> 00:09:34,798
So it's been pushed apart a good bit at this point,

139
00:09:34,798 --> 00:09:40,334
you know, now we're talking about on the order of hundreds or tens of thousands of years,

140
00:09:40,334 --> 00:09:45,140
for example, the land that was here might now be out here,

141
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:49,732
and this part of the land might now be out here.

142
00:09:49,732 --> 00:09:54,478
What's going to happen is that this hotspot is going to continue fuel,

143
00:09:54,478 --> 00:09:56,664
and we're assuming everything is under water at this point,

144
00:09:56,664 --> 00:09:59,538
since this depression that was created it now so low,

145
00:09:59,538 --> 00:10:01,478
the crust was stretched thin,

146
00:10:01,478 --> 00:10:05,334
We assume that all of this under water.

147
00:10:05,334 --> 00:10:13,724
The hotspot is essentially going to come out of underwater volcanoes

148
00:10:13,724 --> 00:10:19,394
and start creating what's now in this body of water that's got large enough

149
00:10:19,394 --> 00:10:21,944
that we can call it a mid-oceanic ridge.

150
00:10:21,944 --> 00:10:25,021
And so it'll actually start creating, I'll set a different color,

151
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:30,940
it'll start creating an actual ridge with volcanoes in the centre.

152
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:39,864
So that's why One: we see things like the the Rift Valley in Africa,

153
00:10:39,864 --> 00:10:41,798
we see things like the Red Sea,

154
00:10:41,798 --> 00:10:48,191
and maybe more importantly, we see something like The Mid-Atlantic Rift in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

155
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:53,063
Where you have all this depressed land, that was essentially analogous to that Rift Valley,

156
00:10:53,063 --> 00:10:56,532
but is at a much later stage and that's why it's able to collect water,

157
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:58,595
because the when the land was pushed out,

158
00:10:58,595 --> 00:11:01,028
it stretched thin, water was able to flow into it,

159
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:05,603
going back to the bread analogy, it's essentially when this bread was baking

160
00:11:05,603 --> 00:11:10,624
in this part the crust pushed outwards, you have this rift formed,

161
00:11:10,624 --> 00:11:13,664
and then if there was some water on the bread or it was raining

162
00:11:13,664 --> 00:11:17,443
or it was in kind of body of water, water would eventually flow into here.

163
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:20,204
   

164
00:11:20,204 --> 00:11:22,272
And if that bread kept growing, this rift would have kept growing

165
00:11:22,272 --> 00:11:24,197
eventually in the size of the Atlantic Ocean, our theoretical bread,

166
00:11:24,197 --> 00:11:28,624
and so that's why you have this huge depressed area where an ocean can form

167
00:11:28,624 --> 00:11:34,529
but in the middle of it you have this submerged mountain chain,

168
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:38,338
this submerged chain of vulcanoes, this submerged rift

169
00:11:38,338 --> 00:11:43,336
where the land actually does go up a little bit because of all that magma flowing directly out of it.

170
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:45,734
So hopefully that clears up a little bit, that was a little confusing to me,

171
00:11:45,734 --> 00:11:49,537
why you see uplifted land and everithing around the uplifted land

172
00:11:49,537 --> 00:11:54,201
is much lower, while the whole thing is submerged as it's moving away.

173
00:11:54,201 --> 00:11:58,000
So hopefully that cleared things up a little bit.
