1
00:00:01,977 --> 00:00:04,748
After coursing throughout the blood vessels of our bodies,

2
00:00:04,748 --> 00:00:08,183
a hormone eventually meets a receptor that was created

3
00:00:08,183 --> 00:00:11,828
specifically for it by the target cells it was sent to stimulate.

4
00:00:11,828 --> 00:00:14,308
The way that hormone interacts with the receptor

5
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:16,623
happens in one of two very characteristic ways.

6
00:00:16,623 --> 00:00:19,719
I want to show you today how that happens.

7
00:00:20,195 --> 00:00:23,122
The first major mechanism of hormone action at the cell

8
00:00:23,122 --> 00:00:26,432
that i'm going to start with, is by secondary messengers.

9
00:00:33,261 --> 00:00:35,804
I'm going to start with secondary messengers because,

10
00:00:35,804 --> 00:00:38,695
historically, they're a little more confusing.

11
00:00:38,695 --> 00:00:44,112
Essentially what's happening is a hormone is binding to a receptor on a cell.

12
00:00:44,112 --> 00:00:47,683
So let me draw a cell and it's receptor.

13
00:00:48,252 --> 00:00:50,426
And I'll draw a hormone binding to it.

14
00:00:50,872 --> 00:00:56,480
The process of that binding, instead of just stimulating the effect,

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,157
it sets off this chain reaction that leads to secondary

16
00:00:59,157 --> 00:01:01,450
messengers inside the cell being released.

17
00:01:01,527 --> 00:01:03,484
So let me draw those.

18
00:01:03,761 --> 00:01:06,530
You've got these secondary messengers being released,

19
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,981
and these are actually what is stimulating whatever effect is desired.

20
00:01:09,981 --> 00:01:12,662
Whether that may be insulin being released,

21
00:01:12,662 --> 00:01:15,658
glucose being taken up inside the cell,

22
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:18,093
or any of the coutless other things taking place in our

23
00:01:18,093 --> 00:01:20,529
bodies that are controlled by hormones.

24
00:01:20,975 --> 00:01:24,651
In order to give you a visual for how this might take place in a cell,

25
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:27,038
I have pre-drawn some pictures.

26
00:01:27,038 --> 00:01:28,344
So let me pull those in here.

27
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,532
I want you to understand that these drawings are not to scale in any way.

28
00:01:32,901 --> 00:01:36,138
This is the best I can do in explaining the process,

29
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:40,554
because all of this is happening at the atomic level, and atoms are really tiny.

30
00:01:40,554 --> 00:01:43,788
Anyway, what we have in this picture is a receptor,

31
00:01:43,866 --> 00:01:48,198
I have drawn that in pink, and it's located inside the cell membrane.

32
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:52,567
This is the phospholipid bi-layer of this cell membrane

33
00:01:52,567 --> 00:01:56,726
and we've got the inside of this cell and the outside.

34
00:01:57,434 --> 00:02:02,801
Then also in the cell membrane, we've got a G protein, and I have drawn that in green.

35
00:02:02,801 --> 00:02:08,809
It's called a G protein because it binds to molecules that include the nucleotide guanine.

36
00:02:08,809 --> 00:02:13,708
Which is the same G from the DNA bases which you might be a little more familiar with.

37
00:02:13,784 --> 00:02:18,937
It's currently bound to a molecule called guanine diphosphate.

38
00:02:19,779 --> 00:02:23,021
We'll see how that changes, but we also have this

39
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:27,356
adenylate cyclase enzyme that's in the cell membrane.

40
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:30,028
Remember that enzymes speed up reactions,

41
00:02:30,028 --> 00:02:33,091
so we're going to see how adenylate cyclase speeds up a reaction.

42
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:37,781
What start's this process off is the hormone is going to bind to the receptor.

43
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:40,549
It's going to look like that.

44
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:44,047
You're going to have the hormone bound to the receptor.

45
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:47,755
Once that hormone binds to the receptor, it's going to change shape.

46
00:02:47,755 --> 00:02:51,611
That's going to allow it to interact with the G protein here.

47
00:02:51,887 --> 00:02:54,329
That looks like this.

48
00:02:54,576 --> 00:02:58,505
What you saw happen as the G protein interacts with

49
00:02:59,058 --> 00:03:02,647
the receptor and hormone complex, it's going to

50
00:03:02,647 --> 00:03:07,888
exchange that GDP that it started with, that guanine diphosphate, for GTP.

51
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,584
Essentially, it is exchanging a guanine bound to two

52
00:03:11,584 --> 00:03:15,446
phosphates for a guanine bound to three phosphates.

53
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:19,509
What happens is, that enables the G protein to move

54
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:23,424
through the cell membrane and interact with adenylate cyclase.

55
00:03:24,254 --> 00:03:27,195
That activates adenylate cyclase.

56
00:03:30,964 --> 00:03:35,067
As an enzyme, the activated adenylate cyclase facilitates

57
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:40,646
the conversion of ATP, which is the energy currency of the cell, into cAMP.

58
00:03:40,646 --> 00:03:45,169
And cAMP stands for cyclic adenosine monophosphate.

59
00:03:45,276 --> 00:03:51,920
We've taken this ATP, Adenosine triphosphate, and created cyclic adenosine monophosphate.

60
00:03:52,578 --> 00:03:55,659
We also have the additional two phosphates.

61
00:03:55,858 --> 00:04:00,448
It's the cAMP molecule that activates the protein inside the cell,

62
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:03,996
who's effect is really being targeted by the hormone in the first place.

63
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,672
Eventually the system resets, but not before several adenylate cyclase

64
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:21,488
enzymes were activated, resulting in a lot of cAMP being produced.

65
00:04:22,441 --> 00:04:25,956
We call this signal amplification.

66
00:04:26,126 --> 00:04:29,502
What I mean by signal amplification is that,

67
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:32,645
in theory, one hormone can bind to a receptor.

68
00:04:32,645 --> 00:04:38,758
That process can set off a chain reaction that leads to a lot of cAMP being produced.

69
00:04:38,758 --> 00:04:43,727
It can mean that less hormone is required to, ultimately,

70
00:04:43,727 --> 00:04:48,282
activate the protein or the effect that's being desired.

71
00:04:48,282 --> 00:04:53,885
Secondary messengers are a means in which hormones act on the cell.

72
00:04:53,885 --> 00:04:58,527
But, really, if I'm being honest, this effect happens differently for a lot of cells,

73
00:04:58,527 --> 00:05:02,614
and all of of the mechanisms of secondary messenger

74
00:05:02,614 --> 00:05:04,580
hormone action aren't known right now.

75
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:09,215
Also, there are a lot of secondary messengers other than cAMP.

76
00:05:09,215 --> 00:05:13,154
Really, the take away, is that, for the majority of the hormones in your body,

77
00:05:13,154 --> 00:05:16,757
binding to the cells surface activates series of reactions

78
00:05:16,757 --> 00:05:19,497
that initiate a response inside the cell.

79
00:05:20,466 --> 00:05:25,119
It's very similar to the use of a phone service provider.

80
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,018
Because we, as people-- let me draw us.

81
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:36,766
Because we are unable to communicate directly with people sometimes--

82
00:05:36,782 --> 00:05:41,180
because of separation or convenience or lack of efficiency.

83
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:47,171
We use a phone service to project our voice to them through a phone conversation.

84
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:53,324
Through a phone conversation we'll direct our voice to people

85
00:05:53,324 --> 00:05:59,157
that we want to communicate with, or maybe we use the delivery of a text message.

86
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:06,802
A text message will trasmit some intended message that we have

87
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:10,534
for people that we can't communicate directly with.

88
00:06:11,303 --> 00:06:16,468
That's very similar to how secondary messengers assist hormones

89
00:06:16,468 --> 00:06:22,054
that can't communicate directly with a receptor inside a cell.

90
00:06:22,054 --> 00:06:24,821
Peptide hormones and catecholamines,

91
00:06:28,235 --> 00:06:31,301
both of which can't cross the cell membrane,

92
00:06:31,301 --> 00:06:34,689
use secondary messangers to communicate.

93
00:06:34,997 --> 00:06:39,584
The other method of hormone action on a cell is as a primary messanger.

94
00:06:47,443 --> 00:07:00,718
Certain hormones, like steroids and thyroid hormones, can cross the cell membrane.

95
00:07:00,718 --> 00:07:05,276
This eliminates this entire middle man system that we set up before.

96
00:07:05,276 --> 00:07:08,106
Let me pull in another cell membrane.

97
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:15,521
The hormone crosses the cell membrane and binds to a receptor

98
00:07:15,521 --> 00:07:19,136
that's located in either the cytosol or the nucleus.

99
00:07:20,966 --> 00:07:26,535
We could imagine a nucleus, there might be DNA inside,

100
00:07:26,966 --> 00:07:29,140
but when the hormone binds to the receptor

101
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,823
that's either in the cytoplasm, or inside the nucleus,

102
00:07:32,823 --> 00:07:38,728
that binding process is going to directly affect transcription in the nucleus,

103
00:07:38,728 --> 00:07:44,432
or translation in the cytoplasm of the protein that's being activated by the hormone.

104
00:07:47,308 --> 00:07:53,651
This process has quite a few less moving parts than the secondary messenger system did.

105
00:07:53,651 --> 00:07:59,410
Again, it stems back to the fact that these are steroid and thyroid hormones

106
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,974
that are typically lipid bases and are capable of

107
00:08:01,974 --> 00:08:04,918
crossing through the cell membrane all on their own.

108
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:09,359
They don't need all of that extra machinery set up for them.

109
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:14,068
Anyway these are both primary messengers and secondary messengers.

110
00:08:14,068 --> 00:08:21,518
Those are the two main processes by which hormones act on the cell they are created to target.
