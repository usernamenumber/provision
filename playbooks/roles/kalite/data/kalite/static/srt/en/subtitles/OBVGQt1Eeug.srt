1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,570
   

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,110
We're told to make a
table and solve.

3
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:07,090
So they tell us that we have
50 ounces of a 25% saline

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,180
solution, a mixture
of water and salt.

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,230
How many ounces of a 10% saline
solution must you add

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,700
to make a new solution
that is 15% saline?

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,190
So let's make this table that
they're talking about.

8
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,180
Let's write amount
of solution.

9
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:31,130
Let me write total amount of
solution or maybe I should say

10
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,510
total volume of solution.

11
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,195
And then the next column I'll
say percent saline.

12
00:00:36,195 --> 00:00:40,490
   

13
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,610
And then we can use this
information to figure out

14
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:43,860
total amount of saline.

15
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:50,740
   

16
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,380
And let's list it for each of
the two solutions that they

17
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,210
talk about.

18
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,900
We're starting with 50 ounces
of a 25% saline solution.

19
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,220
So this is what we start with.

20
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:09,050
Starting solution, we have
50 ounces of it, so

21
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:09,850
I'll just write 50.

22
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,220
We'll assume everything
is in ounces.

23
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:17,000
It is 25% saline.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,190
So if we wanted to figure out
the total ounces of saline, we

25
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,900
say, well, we have 50 ounces.

26
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,240
Multiply that by 25% and we
have the total amount of

27
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,940
saline in this solution.

28
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:33,510
So 50 times 25%, that's the same
thing as 50 divided by 4,

29
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:38,870
so that's 12.5 ounces
of saline in

30
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,470
this 50 total ounces.

31
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,560
It's 25% saline.

32
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,760
Now, let's talk about what we're
going to add to it, so

33
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,010
solution added.

34
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:54,310
   

35
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,450
Now, they say how many ounces
of a 10% solution?

36
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,600
So we don't even know how many
ounces we're going to add.

37
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,480
That's what we have to
actually solve for.

38
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,140
So let's call that x for the
amount of solution that we

39
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:05,980
have to add.

40
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,120
So we don't know how much we're
going to add, but we do

41
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,506
know that it is a 10%
saline solution.

42
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:14,620
   

43
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,750
And if we know what x is, we
know the total amount of

44
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:22,630
saline is going to
be 10% of x.

45
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,790
If we had 50 here, it
would be 10% of 50.

46
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,200
If we had 10 here, it
would be 10% of 10.

47
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,370
So the amount of saline we have
in this solution, in x

48
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:37,040
ounces of this solution, is
going to be 0.1x, or 10%

49
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,600
percent of x.

50
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,560
That's what 10% of the solution
being saline means.

51
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,070
Now, when we add it, what
do we end up with?

52
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,450
So let me do this in
a different color.

53
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:49,945
Resulting solution.

54
00:02:49,945 --> 00:02:56,170
   

55
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:00,230
Well, if we started with 50
ounces and we add x ounces,

56
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:05,170
we're going to end up with
50 plus x ounces.

57
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:08,600
That's our total volume of
the resulting solution.

58
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,060
What percent saline is it?

59
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,080
Well, our goal is to make a 15%
saline solution, so it has

60
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,210
to be 15% saline.

61
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:20,090
Now, what's the total amount
of saline in it?

62
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:26,340
And this is kind of the main
box or cell in this table.

63
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,140
There's two ways to get
to the total amount of

64
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,590
saline in the solution.

65
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,600
One, we could just multiply the
percent saline times the

66
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,450
total value, so we
could do that.

67
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,150
So let write that.

68
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:41,270
It's 0.15 times 50 plus x.

69
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,560
All I did, I multiplied
the percent saline

70
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,720
times my total volume.

71
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,170
That's one way to get the
total amount of saline.

72
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,020
The other way to get the total
amount of saline is to add

73
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,190
these two numbers.

74
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,250
The 50-ounce solution had
12.5 ounces of saline.

75
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,910
We added 0.1x ounces of saline,
so if we add these two

76
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,860
numbers, it should also
be equal to the

77
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,180
total amount of saline.

78
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:07,180
So this has to be equal to the
sum of these two things.

79
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:16,290
It has to be equal to
12.5 plus 0.1x.

80
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,990
And just like that, because 15%
of this has to be the same

81
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,340
thing as the sum of this, we
have one equation and one

82
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,030
unknown, and we can solve
for x, which is what we

83
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,570
need to solve for.

84
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,840
How much solution do
we need to add?

85
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,430
So let's just do that.

86
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,630
So 0.15 times 50.

87
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:37,090
Let's see, that's 7.5, if
I'm doing that right.

88
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:40,430
Yeah, because 0.15 times
100 would be 15.

89
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:49,650
So this is 7.5 plus 0.15x--
that's the left-hand side-- is

90
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:54,080
equal to 12.5 plus 0.1x.

91
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,560
Let me scroll to the
right a little bit.

92
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,370
   

93
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:02,082
Now, we can subtract 7.5 from
both sides of this equation.

94
00:05:02,082 --> 00:05:04,590
Let me do it in a new color.

95
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:09,390
So if we subtract 7.5 from both
sides of this equation,

96
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,660
the left-hand side,
that cancels out.

97
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:16,700
We're just left with 0.15x
is equal to-- 12.5

98
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,580
minus 7.5 is just 5.

99
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,630
5 plus 0.1x.

100
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,890
Now, we could subtract
0.1x from both

101
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:26,980
sides of this equation.

102
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,950
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

103
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:34,170
Let me subtract 0.1, or I could
say 0.10x from both

104
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,420
sides of this equation.

105
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,920
   

106
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,340
These are the same number.

107
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,790
So they cancel out.

108
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,640
The left-hand side, we
just end up with

109
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,900
0.05x is equal to 5.

110
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:56,850
And now we just divide
both sides by 0.05.

111
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:01,160
And we get x is equal to
5 divided by 0.05.

112
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,150
That's the same thing as 5
divided by 1/20, or the same

113
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,970
thing as 5 times 20.

114
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:10,030
So we get x is equal to 100.

115
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,060
So we're done!

116
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,380
If you add 100 ounces--
so we figured out that

117
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:15,900
x is equal to 100.

118
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,750
If you add 100 ounces of 10%
saline solution, you will end

119
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:25,870
up with 150 ounces of
15% saline solution.

120
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,920
So if you add 100,
10% of that, we

121
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,960
actually added 10 ounces.

122
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,700
So you have 12.5 plus 10 ounces
is 22.5 ounces of

123
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:41,450
saline in a solution of 150
ounces, which will be 15%.

124
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,060
And we're done.
