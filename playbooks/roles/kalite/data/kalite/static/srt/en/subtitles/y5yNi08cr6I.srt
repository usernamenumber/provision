1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
   

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,360
We're asked which of these
lines are parallel.

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,000
So they give us three equations
of three different

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,270
lines and if they're parallel,
then they have to have the

5
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:08,975
same slope.

6
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:11,570
So all we have to do over here
is figure out the slopes of

7
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:12,830
each of these lines, and
if any of them are

8
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:14,060
equal, they're parallel.

9
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,970
So let's do line A.

10
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:21,870
Line A, it's 2y is equal
to 12x plus 10.

11
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,010
We're almost in slope-intercept
form, we can

12
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:29,210
just divide both sides of
this equation by 2.

13
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:33,420
We get y is equal to 6x--
right, 12 divided by

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,330
2 -- 6x plus 5.

15
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,860
So our slope in this case, we
have it in slope-intercept

16
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:43,710
form, our slope in this
case is equal to 6.

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,570
Let's try line B.

18
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,810
Line B is y is equal to six.

19
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,670
You might say this hey, this is
a bizarre character, how do

20
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,920
I get this into slope-intercept

21
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,790
form, where's the x?

22
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,680
And my answer to you is
that it already is in

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,640
slope-intercept form.

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,670
I could just rewrite it as
y is equal to 0x plus 6.

25
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,170
The x term is being multiplied
by 0 because the

26
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,150
slope here is 0.

27
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,130
y is going to be equal
to six no matter how

28
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,280
much you change x.

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,690
Change in y is always
going to be 0, it's

30
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,880
always going to be 6.

31
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:26,030
So here, our slope is 0, so
these two lines are definitely

32
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:29,060
not parallel, they have
different slopes.

33
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,690
So let's try line C.

34
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,030
Line C-- I'll do it down here.

35
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:40,780
Line C, so it's y minus 2 is
equal to 6 times x plus 2.

36
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,120
And this is actually in
point-slope form, where the

37
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,410
point x is equal to negative
2, y is equal to 2.

38
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,910
So the point negative 2, 2, is
being represented here because

39
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,870
you're subtracting the points.

40
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:56,590
And the slope is 6, so we
already know that the slope is

41
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,340
equal to 6.

42
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,340
And sometimes people are
more comfortable with

43
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,110
slope-intercept form, so let's
put it in slope-intercept form

44
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,006
just to confirm that if we put
it in this form, the slope

45
00:02:06,006 --> 00:02:07,240
will still be equal to 6.

46
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,320
So if we distribute the 6, we
get y minus 2 is equal to 6

47
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:15,690
times x, 6x, plus
6 times 2 is 12.

48
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,870
And if you add this 2 -- if you
add 2 to both sides of the

49
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:24,410
equation, you get y-- because
these guys cancel out-- is

50
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,330
equal to 6x plus 14.

51
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,710
So you see, once again,
the slope is 6.

52
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:35,700
So line A and line C have the
same the slope, so line A and

53
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,100
line C are parallel.

54
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,210
And they're different lines.

55
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,460
If they had the same
y-intercept, then they would

56
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,490
just be the same line.

57
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:41,933
