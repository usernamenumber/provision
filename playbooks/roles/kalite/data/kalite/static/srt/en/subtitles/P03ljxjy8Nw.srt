1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,780
   

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,740
Here's another interesting
word problem that was

3
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,560
sent by [? Cortagio ?].

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,720
A woman cycles to work
alongside a railroad track

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,190
at 6 kilometers per hour.

6
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:11,790
That's an interesting
piece of data.

7
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,590
6 kilometers per hour.

8
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,190
Every day she arrives
at a crossing the same

9
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,360
time that a train does.

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,070
OK.

11
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:23,120
One day she was 50 minutes
late, and was overtaken by

12
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,940
the train 6 kilometers
from the crossing.

13
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,630
In how many minutes will the
train reach the crossing.

14
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,390
Let's see if we can draw a
diagram here that can somewhat

15
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,960
describe what's going
on in this problem.

16
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,210
So what's on a normal day?

17
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,780
On a normal day, she leaves
from home, she leaves from

18
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,060
home, and she goes and she
travels alongside

19
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,710
a railroad track.

20
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,700
Not too different than my own
commute on my own bicycle.

21
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,150
Actually, I actually do travel
on a bike path that's right

22
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,370
along a railroad track.

23
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,580
Anyway, let's say she leaves
here at time is equal to 0.

24
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,270
Time is equal to 0.

25
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,000
And right at this point right
here, maybe that's where the

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,790
railroad crossing is, right
there, the train passes her up.

27
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,420
And she's traveling at
6 kilometers per hour.

28
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,610
6 kilometers per hour.

29
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,060
6 kilometers per hour.

30
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,150
And what else does it tell us?

31
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,570
It doesn't tell us how
long it takes her, or

32
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,026
how far she travels.

33
00:01:22,026 --> 00:01:28,470
So let's just say she arrives
here at t is equal to a hours.

34
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,730
t is equal to a.

35
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,800
We'll do time in hours, since
we're in kilometers per hour.

36
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,600
So this path takes her
a hours to travel.

37
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,410
So it takes her a hours.

38
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:43,560
If we care about
the time, a hours.

39
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,080
Now on this next day,
she's 50 minutes late.

40
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,900
So on this day, she has to
travel the same distance in

41
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,850
time, well in both
distance and time.

42
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,250
But this is this day.

43
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,970
She leaves not a t equals 0.

44
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,320
She leaves 50 minutes late.

45
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,770
Since we're dealing with
hours, let's write

46
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,350
50 minutes in hours.

47
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,500
So she leaves at-- if this was
time equal 0, that's when she

48
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,260
normally leaves --she's now
leaving at that time is equal

49
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:13,400
to 50 minutes, or time
is equal to 5/6 hours.

50
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:13,670
Right?

51
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:19,410
50 minutes is just 50/60 hours
or 5/6 hours of time is

52
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,490
equal to 5 over 6 hours.

53
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,940
This time is equal to 0 hours.

54
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:31,050
And let's see, it says that she
was overtaken by the train 6

55
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,550
kilometers from the crossing.

56
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,410
So she was overtaken by
the train some place over

57
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,170
here, and this distance.

58
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,890
Right this is where the
crossing is, that's

59
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,090
that crossing.

60
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,680
This is 6 kilometers.

61
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,530
6 kilometers.

62
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,190
In how many minutes will the
train reach the crossing?

63
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:53,800
So if we can figure out some
way of expressing this time, if

64
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,410
we can figure out with this
time is, we know that the train

65
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,010
reaches the crossing
a t is equal to a.

66
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,810
So if we know this time, we
can just find the difference

67
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,000
between these two times and we
would have solved the problem.

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,940
So let's see if we can
figure out this time.

69
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,600
So we know that it normally
takes her a hours to travel

70
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,280
this whole distance.

71
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,240
It doesn't matter when she
leaves it takes her a hours.

72
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,290
So in this case it should
also take her a hours.

73
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,570
And how long does she have to
go when the train passes up on

74
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,400
this day that she was late?

75
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,530
How long will it take her to
go this distance right there?

76
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,885
Well she's traveling at 6
kilometers per hour, she

77
00:03:25,885 --> 00:03:27,690
has to go 6 kilometers.

78
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,820
So in time, this is going
to take her 1 hour.

79
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,400
To get-- you know, the train
will have long passed her --but

80
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,220
to get back to the crossing,
she's going to have to

81
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,850
travel for another hour.

82
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:43,480
So if her whole route takes her
a hours, this whole length

83
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,410
in time is a hours.

84
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,650
Then this distance right
here is going to have

85
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,810
to take her, what?

86
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,380
She has an hour left, her whole
trip is going to be a hours, so

87
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,970
this is going to be
a minus 1 hours.

88
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,280
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

89
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,330
This is going to take
her a minus 1 hours.

90
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:05,680
So if on the day she was late
it took her a minus 1 hours to

91
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,500
get passed by the train, what
time are we talking

92
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,310
about right here?

93
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,330
What time is this?

94
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:17,080
This is t is equal to--
well we started at 5/6

95
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,380
--t is equal to 5/6.

96
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,350
That's where we started.

97
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:24,040
Plus the amount of hours she
traveled plus a minus 1.

98
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,580
So there we, I think, we now
have all the information we

99
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,330
need to solve this problem.

100
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,490
On the day she is late, the
train passes or at time is

101
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:37,390
equal to 5/6 plus a minus 1
hours, where a is the amount of

102
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,690
time it normally takes her to
travel her entire route

103
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:40,660
to the crossing.

104
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:45,720
We know that the train passes
this point at t is equal to a.

105
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,550
So if we want to know how many
minutes does it take the train

106
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,130
to go from this point to
this point, we just have to

107
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,080
subtract the two times.

108
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,990
So the minutes it takes,
well the hours because

109
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,890
we're doing it hours.

110
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,260
And remember I said 50 minutes
was 5/6 of an hour, so the

111
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:09,080
minutes it takes is a,
that a, minus this.

112
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,050
Minus 5/6 plus a minus 1.

113
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:14,300
Right?

114
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,630
That's just the difference in
time for the train, in hours.

115
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:22,760
So this is a minus
5/6 minus a plus 1.

116
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,150
Luckily the a's cancel out.

117
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:29,600
a minus a, and you're left with
1 minus 5/6 hours, which is

118
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,060
just equal to 1/6 hours.

119
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,390
There are 60 minutes
in an hour, so 1/6 of

120
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,220
that is 10 minutes.

121
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,040
So it takes the train 10
minutes to get to the

122
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,160
crossing from the point
that it passed her.

123
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,260
Another neat problem, and
I thank [? Cortagio ?].

124
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:43,740
for that.

125
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,720
And then you can actually use
this information if you want

126
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,280
figure out how fast the train
is going, or you could even

127
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,850
think of other types of
derivative problems

128
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,580
off of this one.

129
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,710
Anyway, another good problem.

130
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:53,855
