1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,730
   

2
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:01,970
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:05,390
I'm now going to use definite
integrals to figure out the

4
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,890
areas under a bunch of curves
and, if we have time, maybe

5
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,290
even between some curves.

6
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,660
So let me right down the
fundamental theorem

7
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,350
of calculus.

8
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,560
I know I covered it really fast
in the last presentation.

9
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,310
Just to make sure you
understand this formula.

10
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,020
The last couple presentations
were really to give you an

11
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,800
intuition for this
exact formula.

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:34,440
Let's say that big f prime of
x is equal to f of x, right?

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,200
That's also like saying that
the -- that's equivalent to

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,950
saying that f of x -- big f
of x -- is equal to the

15
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:56,000
antiderivative of
f of x, right?

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,880
Well, let's just that it's one
of the possible antiderivatives

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,760
of f of x, right?

18
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,420
Because there's always a
constant term here and you're

19
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,090
not sure whether it is.

20
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,760
And this is why people tend to
use this standard because we

21
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,590
know that f of x is the
derivative of big f prime of x.

22
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,850
Big f of x is just one of the
antiderivatives of f of x.

23
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,100
So this is a little bit
not true, but I think

24
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:21,800
you get the idea.

25
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,430
But the fundamental theorem of
calculus tells us if this top

26
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:38,480
line is true, then the definite
integral from a to b of f of x

27
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:45,520
d x is equal to its
antiderivative evaluated at b

28
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,010
minus its antiderivative
evaluated at a.

29
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:53,300
And I know I said here that
big f isn't the only

30
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,310
antiderivative, right?

31
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,760
Because you could at any
constant to this and that would

32
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,200
also be the antiderivative.

33
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,110
But when you subtract here, the
constants will cancel out.

34
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,575
So it really doesn't
matter which of the

35
00:02:02,575 --> 00:02:03,250
constants you pick.

36
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,420
The constant actually
doesn't matter.

37
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,765
So that's why I actually
said the antiderivative.

38
00:02:06,765 --> 00:02:08,150
But let's apply this.

39
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,960
You might be
confused right now.

40
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,795
So let me draw a graph.

41
00:02:13,795 --> 00:02:21,740
   

42
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,160
There you go.

43
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,630
Look how straight that is.

44
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,220
Draw the x-axis.

45
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,510
Not perfect but it'll do.

46
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:37,640
   

47
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:47,570
Let's say that my f of x is
equal to x squared plus 1.

48
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,620
So f of x looks like this.

49
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,630
This is 1.

50
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,810
   

51
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:54,770
So it'll start at 1.

52
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,880
It'll just be a parabola.

53
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,600
Let me see how good
I can draw this.

54
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,900
I've done worse.

55
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,550
OK.

56
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,550
So that's f of x.

57
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,260
It's a parabola.
y-intercept at 1.

58
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,660
And let's say I want to figure
out the area under the curve --

59
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,570
between the curve and,
really, the x-axis.

60
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,180
Let's say I want to figure out
the area between the curve and

61
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:20,030
the x-axis from x equals
negative 1 to, I don't

62
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,190
know, x equals 3.

63
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,220
So this is the area I
want to figure out.

64
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,220
I'm going to shade it in.

65
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,970
   

66
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,470
So this is the area.

67
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,980
All of this stuff.

68
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,660
I want to figure out this area.

69
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,620
And you could imagine, before
you knew calculus, figuring out

70
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,870
an area of something with a
curve -- it's kind

71
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,630
of top boundary.

72
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,100
It would have been
very difficult.

73
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,000
But we will now use the
fundamental theorem of calculus

74
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,970
and hopefully you have an
intuition of why this works and

75
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,470
how the integral is really just
a sum of a bunch of little,

76
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,400
little, small squares with
infinitely small bases.

77
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,030
But if you watched the last
videos, hopefully that

78
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,540
hit the point home.

79
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,310
But now we'll just mechanically
compute because, actually,

80
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,925
understanding it is a bit
harder than just doing it.

81
00:04:02,925 --> 00:04:04,390
But let's just
mechanically compute it.

82
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:07,470
So we are essentially just
going to figure out the

83
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:16,780
integral from minus 1 to 3
of f of x, which is x

84
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:23,970
squared plus 1 d x.

85
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,850
What's the antiderivative
of x squared plus 1?

86
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,010
This just equals the
antiderivative.

87
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:34,630
So it's just x to the third --
we could say 1/3 x to the third

88
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:39,860
or x to the third over
3 -- plus x, right?

89
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,130
The derivative of x is 1.

90
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,770
And then we don't have to worry
about plus c because we're

91
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,600
going to subtract out the c's.

92
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,030
You'll see.

93
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,850
I think you'll get the point.

94
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:46,340
It doesn't matter.

95
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,800
You could pick an arbitrary
c right here and it'll

96
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,900
just cancel out.

97
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,960
And we're going to evaluate
that at 3 and negative 1 and

98
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,590
we're going to subtract
out big f of negative

99
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,650
1 from big f of 3.

100
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,940
This is just the
notation they use.

101
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,070
You figure out the
antiderivative and

102
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,710
you say where you're
going to evaluate it.

103
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:08,430
And then this is equal to
-- So if I evaluate 3.

104
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,820
3 to the third power is what?

105
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,370
That's 27.

106
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:18,010
27 divided by 3 is 9.

107
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:21,420
And then 9 plus 3 is 12.

108
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,360
Right?

109
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,150
This is just big f of 3, right?

110
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,520
Because I figured out the
end -- This is big f of x.

111
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,150
You can kind of view
this as big f of x.

112
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,340
But not to be confused with
small, cursive f of x.

113
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,860
This is big f of x.

114
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,430
So this big f of 3.

115
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,480
And then, from that
we'll subtract big f

116
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,280
of negative 1, right?

117
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,950
Minus big f of negative 1.

118
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,640
And if we put minus 1 here.

119
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,020
Let's see, minus 1 to the
third power is minus 1.

120
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:54,570
So it's minus 1/3 and then
plus minus 1, right?

121
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,610
So minus 1/3 plus minus 1.

122
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:02,690
I think that equals
minus 4/3, correct?

123
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:03,470
I think so.

124
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:06,420
Maybe I'm making a mistake
with negative signs.

125
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,790
Minus 1/3 minus 4/3.

126
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,840
And I'm going to
subtract that, right?

127
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,010
So if I'm subtracting minus
4/3, it's the same thing

128
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:16,850
as adding minus 4/3.

129
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,040
And then we have our answer.

130
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:25,460
Actually, it's 12 and 4/3
-- whatever -- units.

131
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,290
Squared units.

132
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,880
12 and 4/3 squared units.

133
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,480
We could write this as a
mixed number as well.

134
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,520
Let's do another one.

135
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,285
I'll do a slight variation.

136
00:06:33,285 --> 00:06:40,020
   

137
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,850
OK.

138
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:45,110
Let me draw again.

139
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,596
Some coordinates.

140
00:06:47,596 --> 00:06:49,210
I don't know if I'm going
to have time to do it in

141
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,040
this video but I'll try.

142
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,000
I always try.

143
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,060
   

144
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:07,440
Let's say I have f of x is
equal to the square root of x.

145
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,590
So it looks something
like this.

146
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:14,750
   

147
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,910
That's actually a pretty nice
looking, kind of sideways

148
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,790
parabola, I think.

149
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,960
This is f of x.

150
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,660
And let's say I have
another function.

151
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:32,250
g of x which equals x squared.

152
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,790
So g of x is actually going
to look something like this.

153
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:41,980
   

154
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,840
Whoops!

155
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,650
I was doing well and then
something happened.

156
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,750
And, of course, it'll continue
on this side as well.

157
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,810
Because it is defined
for negative numbers.

158
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,990
But anyway, my question to you,
or my question to myself,

159
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:58,170
really, is what is the
area between the curves

160
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,730
where they intersect?

161
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,340
What is this?

162
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,420
What is this area?

163
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:08,980
   

164
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,830
Well, the first thing you have
to figure out is just what

165
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,690
are the boundary points?

166
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,922
What is this point?

167
00:08:12,922 --> 00:08:15,350
And what is this point?

168
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,800
Well this point, I
think, is pretty clear.

169
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,220
It's 0, 0, right?

170
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,570
They both intersect at 0, 0.

171
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:24,640
And even this point, you could
probably do it from intuition.

172
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:30,310
But if you don't, I guess, want
to do it through intuition, you

173
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,990
could just set these 2
equations equal to

174
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:33,580
each other, right?

175
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:38,690
You could say x squared
is equal to the square

176
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,790
root of x, right?

177
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,330
And then you could do
a bunch of things.

178
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:50,450
You could square both sides or
-- well, actually, this is the

179
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,910
same thing as doing
it by intuition.

180
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,170
But I think it's pretty obvious
that the only places where x

181
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,390
squared is equal to the square
root of x are the points x

182
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:02,510
equals 0, which you already
know, and x equals 1.

183
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:06,060
So this is the point 1, 1.

184
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,310
Which is true for both of them.

185
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,005
And this is more algebra,
so I won't go into that

186
00:09:09,005 --> 00:09:09,890
in too much detail.

187
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:12,220
I'm kind of running
out of time.

188
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,400
So we want to figure out the
area between these 2 curves.

189
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,280
So what we can do is -- maybe
you want to pause it and think

190
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,320
about it yourself -- we
can figure out the area

191
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,840
under the grey curve.

192
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,180
We could figure out this area.

193
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,940
   

194
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,840
So we want to figure out --
this is a boundary, right?

195
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,760
Between 0 and 1.

196
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,970
We could figure out this area
and then we could figure out

197
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,640
the entire area under the green
curve separately and then we

198
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,700
could subtract the difference.

199
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,930
Which is exactly how we're
going to do it in the next

200
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,630
video because I have
run out of time.

201
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,400
