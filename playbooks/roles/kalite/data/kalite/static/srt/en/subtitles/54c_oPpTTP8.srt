1
00:00:02,148 --> 00:00:04,861
So, two words often get thrown around

2
00:00:04,861 --> 00:00:06,903
and confused for one another,

3
00:00:06,903 --> 00:00:09,693
and I thought we would take a few minutes

4
00:00:09,693 --> 00:00:11,645
to clarify the differences between

5
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:15,573
salts and sodium.

6
00:00:15,573 --> 00:00:16,944
And we know they're related,

7
00:00:16,944 --> 00:00:20,277
but I want to get at exactly what the differences are

8
00:00:20,277 --> 00:00:22,999
and how to, kind of, make sense of all the

9
00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:25,186
numbers I hear about how much

10
00:00:25,186 --> 00:00:27,064
I'm supposed to get every day.

11
00:00:27,064 --> 00:00:30,343
So, I always think of, for salts,

12
00:00:30,343 --> 00:00:32,023
of my salt shaker at home

13
00:00:32,023 --> 00:00:34,409
that sits right next to my pepper shaker,

14
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,999
and whenever I have dinner,

15
00:00:35,999 --> 00:00:37,810
I often reach for it,

16
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,632
and sometimes I think that I'm eating too much of it;

17
00:00:40,632 --> 00:00:43,565
am I putting on more than I should?

18
00:00:43,565 --> 00:00:47,686
I was thinking about this in terms of a spoon,

19
00:00:47,686 --> 00:00:50,804
so if you have a spoon, let's say a teaspoon,

20
00:00:50,804 --> 00:00:54,854
of salt.

21
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:56,710
And, let's say I took this teaspoon

22
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,446
of salt - here it is - and I weighed it

23
00:01:00,446 --> 00:01:02,776
on a scale.

24
00:01:02,776 --> 00:01:04,418
I would find that one teaspoon of salt

25
00:01:04,418 --> 00:01:07,270
weighs about 6 grams.

26
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,140
Let me write that here.

27
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,437
So it's about 6 grams,

28
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:16,276
and 6g is the same as 6,000mg,

29
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:19,902
so that's the weight of one teaspoon of salt.

30
00:01:19,902 --> 00:01:21,078
Now, the question comes up:

31
00:01:21,078 --> 00:01:25,024
how much of that is from sodium?

32
00:01:25,024 --> 00:01:26,112
So, to answer that, we know that

33
00:01:26,112 --> 00:01:31,639
sodium chloride (NaCl) is [table] salt.

34
00:01:31,639 --> 00:01:33,110
That is what salt is made of,

35
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,766
and if I imagine that there's nothing

36
00:01:34,766 --> 00:01:36,909
in my salt shaker except for Sodium Chloride,

37
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:40,812
no ants have gotten in there, you know,

38
00:01:40,812 --> 00:01:44,808
no other stuff besides the NaCl,

39
00:01:44,808 --> 00:01:48,463
then I can assume that all 6,000mg of salt

40
00:01:48,463 --> 00:01:51,104
is going to be either from the Sodium or the Chloride.

41
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:55,231
Now the 'Na', let me be totally clear,

42
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:57,503
is the Sodium part,

43
00:01:57,503 --> 00:01:59,511
and the 'Cl' is the Chloride part,

44
00:01:59,511 --> 00:02:01,308
that's what that means.

45
00:02:01,308 --> 00:02:07,527
And actually all atoms have an atomic mass unit.

46
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:11,570
You can actually weigh the atoms

47
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,021
and line them up by size

48
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:17,191
by which is the smallest or largest in weight,

49
00:02:17,191 --> 00:02:21,563
and sodium weighs out at about 23 units.

50
00:02:21,563 --> 00:02:24,495
Chloride is about 35 units.

51
00:02:24,495 --> 00:02:27,692
So, this is chloride right here and this is sodium.

52
00:02:27,692 --> 00:02:34,106
If I [were] to sum it up, I would get 58 units.

53
00:02:34,106 --> 00:02:40,357
Units is atomic mass units.

54
00:02:40,357 --> 00:02:44,163
So, now that I have the total atomic mass units,

55
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:47,445
I can try to figure out what proportion

56
00:02:47,445 --> 00:02:50,024
is from the sodium and what is from the chloride.

57
00:02:50,024 --> 00:02:53,637
So, for the first part, which is sodium,

58
00:02:53,637 --> 00:03:00,610
I can take the 23 units over the 58 unit total,

59
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,030
and the units cancel out,

60
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,521
and that works out to about 40%.

61
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:09,106
So about 40% of the weight of salt

62
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,527
is actually coming from the sodium part

63
00:03:11,527 --> 00:03:15,602
The chloride part is the rest of it,

64
00:03:15,602 --> 00:03:18,359
so I've got 35 units over 58 units,

65
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:22,022
and that is about 60%,

66
00:03:22,022 --> 00:03:23,694
and again the units cancel out.

67
00:03:23,694 --> 00:03:26,608
So, I know that, in salt,

68
00:03:26,608 --> 00:03:29,358
40% of the weight is coming from sodium;

69
00:03:29,358 --> 00:03:31,933
60% [is] from chloride.

70
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:36,068
Now, I have to go back to my teaspoon,

71
00:03:36,068 --> 00:03:40,276
and in my teaspoon, I had 6g or 6,000mg.

72
00:03:40,276 --> 00:03:44,112
So in that teaspoon, I can just multiply it

73
00:03:44,112 --> 00:03:45,692
by these numbers to figure out

74
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,509
how much of the weight comes from sodium

75
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:50,779
and how much comes from the chloride.

76
00:03:50,779 --> 00:03:55,172
So the sodium gives me 40% of 6,000,

77
00:03:55,172 --> 00:03:57,868
which when you multiply those two numbers

78
00:03:57,868 --> 00:04:04,672
you get 2,400mg of Sodium.

79
00:04:04,672 --> 00:04:12,141
60% x 6,000mg = 3,600mg of chloride.

80
00:04:12,141 --> 00:04:14,270
So now I know, in each teaspoon

81
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:17,461
I have 2,400mg of Sodium.

82
00:04:17,461 --> 00:04:20,175
And now I've actually looked and I've seen

83
00:04:20,175 --> 00:04:23,028
that there are recommendations on how much

84
00:04:23,028 --> 00:04:24,938
sodium you should get in your diet

85
00:04:24,938 --> 00:04:27,523
if you're not having any medical problems

86
00:04:27,523 --> 00:04:28,408
in general,

87
00:04:28,408 --> 00:04:40,131
so I'll call that a 'normal amount'.

88
00:04:40,131 --> 00:04:43,606
This is a regular amount,

89
00:04:43,606 --> 00:04:48,026
and this would be a low-salt diet.

90
00:04:48,026 --> 00:04:49,361
If you're on a low-salt amount diet,

91
00:04:49,361 --> 00:04:50,909
we'll figure out how much salt

92
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:52,609
you're supposed to take in,

93
00:04:52,609 --> 00:04:55,068
or how much sodium you're supposed to take in.

94
00:04:55,068 --> 00:04:56,855
And same for regular.

95
00:04:56,855 --> 00:04:59,529
How much you should be taking if you're on a regular diet.

96
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:03,748
I'm going to do it both from a salt perspective

97
00:05:03,748 --> 00:05:06,197
and from a sodium perspective.

98
00:05:06,197 --> 00:05:08,307
So let's do the sodium perspective first.

99
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:09,961
So the normal amount that you should get,

100
00:05:09,961 --> 00:05:16,297
actually let me write 'per day'.

101
00:05:16,297 --> 00:05:23,520
Sodium, and over here we'll do salt.

102
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,859
So, the regular amount of sodium

103
00:05:24,859 --> 00:05:26,523
that you should get per day,

104
00:05:26,523 --> 00:05:35,279
is about 2,300mg

105
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,356
And on a low-salt diet,

106
00:05:37,356 --> 00:05:41,041
you should get about 1,500mg.

107
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:46,190
Now, we know that one teaspoon has 2,400mg,

108
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:50,907
and 2,400 and 2,300 are pretty close,

109
00:05:50,907 --> 00:05:55,363
so in my conversion, I'm going to assume that that

110
00:05:55,363 --> 00:06:02,673
means I can have about 1 teaspoon per day of salt.

111
00:06:02,673 --> 00:06:04,469
And on a low salt diet,

112
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:06,356
you're recommended to have no more than

113
00:06:06,356 --> 00:06:09,004
about 1,500mg of sodium,

114
00:06:09,004 --> 00:06:12,856
and if one teaspoon equals 2,400mg

115
00:06:12,856 --> 00:06:18,196
then 1,500mg is about 2/3 of a teaspoon of salt.

116
00:06:18,196 --> 00:06:26,525
So, when I look at a teaspoon of salt,

117
00:06:26,525 --> 00:06:30,306
I just remember that if this is my teaspoon,

118
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:30,500
that if I'm on a regular,

119
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:37,195
I can basically eat one of them each day,

120
00:06:37,195 --> 00:06:38,606
not each meal, but each day,

121
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,328
and if I'm on a low-salt diet,

122
00:06:40,328 --> 00:06:43,431
I can only fill it up about 2/3 of the way,

123
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:44,897
and I'd have to stop there,

124
00:06:44,897 --> 00:06:47,862
because that's the limit of sodium

125
00:06:47,862 --> 00:06:49,000
that I'm recommended.
