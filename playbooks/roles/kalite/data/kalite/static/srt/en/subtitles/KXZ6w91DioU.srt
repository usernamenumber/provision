1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,970
Let's start off with segment AB, so that's point A,

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,760
this is point B right over here,

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,810
and lets set up a perpendicular bisector of this segment

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,140
So it, it will be both perpendicular and it will split

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,750
the segment in two, so thus we can call that line L,

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,380
that's going to be a perpendicular, it's a perpendicular bisector,

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,740
so it's gonna be, it'll intersect in a 90 degree angle

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,160
and it bisects it

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,200
This length and this length are equal,

10
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,720
and we can even set, let's call this point right over here,

11
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,360
let's call that M, maybe M for midpoint

12
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,620
What I wanna prove first in this video,

13
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,420
is that if we pick an arbitrary point on this line,

14
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,960
that is a perpendicular bisector, off AB,

15
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,210
then that arbitrary point will be an equal distant from A

16
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,940
or the distance from that point to A,

17
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,880
will be the same as that distance to the to the point,

18
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,930
the same as that distance to the point,

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,990
same as that distance from that point to B

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,500
So let me pick an Arbitrary point from this perpendicular bisector,

21
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:00,170
so let's call it, Let's call that arbitrary point C,

22
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,560
and so you can imagine, we like to draw a triangle,

23
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,440
so let's draw a triangle, where we draw a line from C to A,

24
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:08,450
and then another one from C to B,

25
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,580
and since that We can prove that CA is equal to CB,

26
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,450
then we've proven what we want to prove,

27
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,070
that C is an equal distance from A, as it is from B

28
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,590
Well there's a couple of interesting things we see here,

29
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,660
we know that AM is equal to MB

30
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,520
Now, we also know that CM is equal to itself,

31
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,210
Obviously any segment is going to be equal to itself,

32
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,930
and we know if this is the right angle, this is also right angled,

33
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,500
This line is a perpendicular bisector of AB,

34
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,720
and so we have two right triangles

35
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,410
And if you don't even have to worry about that they're right

36
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,880
Triangles, if you look at triangle AMC,

37
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,250
you have this side is congruent to the corresponding

38
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,420
side on triangle BMC,

39
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,670
then you have an angle in between that corresponds to this

40
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,990
angle over here, angle AMC, corresponds to angle BMC,

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,190
and they're both 90 degrees,

42
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,080
So they're congruent, and then you have the side MC,

43
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,850
that's on both triangles, and those, those are congruent

44
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,870
So we can just use SAS, Side Angle Side congruency,

45
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,540
Side Angle Side congruency

46
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:17,000
So, we can write that triangle AMC, AMC is congruent,

47
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:22,680
congruent to triangle BMC, to triangle BMC,

48
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:29,740
by Side Angle Side congruency, Side Angle Side congruency,

49
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,790
and so if both, if they are congruent,

50
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,330
Then all of the corresponding sides are congruent,

51
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:39,150
and AC corresponds to BC, so these two things must be congruent,

52
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,420
this length must be the same as this length right over there,

53
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,350
and so we've proven what we wanna prove

54
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,150
This arbitrary point C that sits on the perpendicular bisector of AB,

55
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,850
is equidistant from both A and B,

56
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,990
and I could've known that if I drew my C over here, or here,

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,730
I would've made the exact same argument,

58
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,970
so any C that sits on this line, so that's fair enough,

59
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,100
so let me just write it, so this means that

60
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,960
AC is equal to, is equal to BC

61
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,660
Now let's go the other way around,

62
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:13,820
let's say we find some point that is equidistant from A and B

63
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,610
Let's prove that it has to sit on the perpendicular bisector

64
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:23,130
So, let's do this again, so I'll draw like this, so this is my A,

65
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:28,960
This is my B, and let's draw out some point, well call it C again,

66
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,660
So let's say that's C right over here, and I'll, maybe I'll draw a C

67
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,390
right down here

68
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,270
So this is C and we're gonna start from the assumption

69
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,690
that C is equidistant from A and B,

70
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,850
so CA is going to be equal to CB,

71
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,550
this is what we're gonna start of with,

72
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,940
this is going to be our assumption,

73
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,650
and what we want to prove is, is that C sits

74
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:58,220
On the perpendicular bisector of, the perpendicular bisector of AB

75
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,410
So, we've drawn a triangle here, and we've done this before,

76
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,640
And we can always drop an altitude, from this side of the triangle

77
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,730
right over here, so we can set up a line, right over here,

78
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,140
if we draw it like this, so let's call,

79
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,720
let's, let's just drop an altitude right over here,

80
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,590
though we're really not dropping,

81
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,860
we're kind of lifting an altitude in this case,

82
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,110
but, if you rotated this around,

83
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,700
so that the triangle look like this,

84
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:24,120
so that the triangle look like this,

85
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:30,250
so that this was, so this was B, this is A and that C was up here,

86
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,470
you could, you'd really be dropping this altitude,

87
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,090
and so you can construct this line,

88
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,940
so it, it has that, it is at a right angle with AB, and let me call

89
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,360
this, the point in which it intersects M

90
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,340
So to prove that C lies on the perpendicular bisector,

91
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,930
we really have to show that CM is a segment

92
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,500
on the perpendicular bisector, and the way we've constructed it,

93
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,380
it is already perpendicular, we really just have to

94
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,030
show that it bisects AB

95
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,970
So what we have right over here,

96
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,580
we have two right angles, this is the right angle here,

97
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,440
this one clearly has to be, the way we constructed it,

98
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:07,660
it's, it's at a right angle, and then we know that,

99
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:10,280
we know that CM is going to be equal to,

100
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:13,550
we know that CM is going to be equal to,

101
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,470
is going to be equal to itself,

102
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,140
and so we know by, this is a right angle, we have a leg

103
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:23,320
and we have a hypotenuse, we know by the RSH postulate,

104
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:27,940
RSH postulate, RSH, we have a right angle,

105
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,840
we have one corresponding leg that's congruent

106
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,150
to the other corresponding leg,

107
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,260
On the other triangle, we have a hypotenuse that's congruent to

108
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,300
the other hypotenuse,

109
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,830
so that means that our two triangles are congruent,

110
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:49,250
So triangle ACM is congruent to triangle BCM by the RSH postulate,

111
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,890
Well if they're congruent, then their corresponding sides

112
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,540
are going to be congruent, so that means that AM,

113
00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:01,440
so that tells us that AM must be equal to BM,

114
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,340
cause they're their corresponding sides,

115
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,790
so this side right over here, is going to be congruent to that side,

116
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,920
so this really is bisecting AB,

117
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:13,290
so this line MC really is on the perpendicular bisector,

118
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,460
it really is a part of the perpendicular bisector,

119
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,400
and the whole reason why we're doing this,

120
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:22,390
is now we can do some interesting things with perpendicular bisectors,

121
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,150
and points that are equidistant from points,

122
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,300
and do them with triangles

123
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,420
So this was a new, you know, just to review,

124
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,430
we found, hey if any point sits on a perpendicular bisector

125
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,270
of a segment, it's equidistant from the end points of a segment,

126
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,660
And we went the other way, if any point is equidistant

127
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,110
from the end points of a segment,

128
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,320
it sits on the perpendicular bisector of that segment

129
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,890
So let's apply those ideas to a triangle now,

130
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,590
So let me draw myself an arbitrary triangle,

131
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,500
I'm trying to draw it fairly large, so let's say that's a triangle

132
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,890
of some kind, let me give ourselves some labels to this triangle,

133
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:01,830
it's point A, point B, and point C, we can call this triangle ABC

134
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,500
Now, let me just construct the perpendicular bisector of segment AB,

135
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:12,270
so it's going to bisect it, so this distance is going to be equal to

136
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,220
this distance, and it's going to be perpendicular,

137
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:18,720
so it looks something like that, and it will be,

138
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,580
it will be perpen, actually, let me draw this a little different,

139
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,560
coz the way I've drawn this triangle,

140
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,420
it's, it's get, it's making us get close to a special case

141
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,530
Which we will actually talk about in the next video

142
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,560
Let me draw this triangle a little bit differently,

143
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,810
let me draw it a little bit

144
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:38,960
Everytime I, okay, and then, let me draw it, let me,

145
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,620
okay this one might be a little bit better,

146
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,450
and we'll see which special case I was referring to,

147
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,910
so let's, this is going to be A,

148
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,470
this is going to be B, this is going to be C

149
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,890
Now let me take this point, right over here,

150
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,550
which is the midpoint of A and B, and draw a perp,

151
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,900
then draw the perpendicular bisector,

152
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,300
so the perpendicular bisector might look

153
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:02,310
something like that, might look something like that,

154
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,730
and I don't want to make it necessarily intersecting C,

155
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,560
coz that's not necessarily going to be the case,

156
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,710
but this is going to be a 90 degree angle

157
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,200
and this length is equal to that length

158
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,850
And let me take, let me do the same thing

159
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,660
for segment AC right over here,

160
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,660
let me take it's midpoint which,

161
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,170
if I just roughly draw it, it looks

162
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,500
like it's right over there, and then let me draw

163
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:25,690
it's perpendicular bisector, so it would look something like this,

164
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,140
it would look something like this

165
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:32,700
So this length right over here, is equal to that length,

166
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,380
and we see that they intersect at some point,

167
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:40,230
let's call that point, just for fun, let's call that point O,

168
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,090
and now there's some interesting properties of point O,

169
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:47,830
we know that since O sits on AB's perpendicular bisector,

170
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,520
we know that the distant, the distance from O to B

171
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,200
is going to be the distance from O to A

172
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,700
That's what we proved in this first little proof over here,

173
00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:01,410
so we know, we know that OA, is going to be equal to OB,

174
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,190
well that's kind of neat, but we also know that,

175
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,020
coz it's the intersection of this green perpendicular bisector,

176
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,880
and this yellow perpendicular bisector,

177
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,370
we also know because it sits on the perpendicular bisector

178
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:16,810
of, of, of AC, that is equidistant from A as it is to C,

179
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,830
so we know that OA is equal to OC

180
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,250
Now, this is interesting, OA is equal to OB,

181
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,130
and OA is also equal to OC, so OC and OB

182
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,720
have to be the same thing as well, so we also know that OC

183
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:35,030
must be equal to, must be equal to OB,

184
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:41,000
OC must be equal to OB, well if a point is equal, sorry,

185
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,690
If a point is equidistant from two other points

186
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,700
that sit on either end of a segment,

187
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,920
then that point must sit on the perpendicular bisector of that segment,

188
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,480
that's that second proof that we did,

189
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:57,570
Right over here, so it must sit on the perpendicular bisector of BC,

190
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:02,490
So if I draw the perpendicular bisector, right over there, then it

191
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,980
Will look, it will, this definitely lies on BC's perpendicular,

192
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,550
perpendicular bisector

193
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,930
And what's neat about this simple little proof

194
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,920
that we've set up on this video, is if we've shown,

195
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:19,460
there's a unique point, in this triangle, that is equidistant,

196
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,030
from all of the vertices of the triangle,

197
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,560
and it sits on the perpendicular bisectors of the three sides,

198
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,250
or another way to think of it, we've shown

199
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,110
that the perpendicular bisectors of the

200
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,580
three sides, intersect at a unique point, that is equidistant

201
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:37,420
from the vertices, and this unique point, on a triangle

202
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:43,120
has a special name, we call O a circumcenter, circumcenter,

203
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:49,230
Circum, circumcenter, and because O is equidistant

204
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,700
to the vertices, so this distance, let me do this in a color

205
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,640
I haven't used before,

206
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:58,960
this distance right over here, this distance right over here,

207
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:01,100
is equal to that distance right over there,

208
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,220
is equal to that distance over there,

209
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,440
if we construct a circle that has a center

210
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,870
At O, and whose radius, is this orange distance,

211
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,290
whose radius is any of this distance over here,

212
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,570
will have a circle that goes through all of the vertices of B,

213
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,460
oh so all of the vertices of our triangle centered at O,

214
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,310
so our circle would look something like this,

215
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,250
my best attempt to draw it, and so what we've constructed right here,

216
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,430
is one we've shown that we can construct something like this,

217
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,000
but we call this thing a circumcircle,

218
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:36,740
circumcircle, and this distance right here, circumradius,

219
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:41,540
circumradius, and once again, we know we can construct it,

220
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:45,690
Coz there is a point here, and it is centered at O, and this circle

221
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,670
Because it goes through the vertices of our triangle,

222
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,600
all of the vertices of our triangle, we say that it is circumscribe,

223
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:57,230
circumspri, circum, I have trouble saying it, circumscribed,

224
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,090
about the triangle, so we can say right over here, that the

225
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:06,970
circle O, the circumcircle O, so circle O, circle O right over here,

226
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:17,440
is circumscribed, circumscribed, about, about triangle ABC,

227
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:21,220
which just means that, all three vertices lie on the circle,

228
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:26,430
and that the circle has it, every point, is the circumradius away,

229
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,700
from this circumcenter
