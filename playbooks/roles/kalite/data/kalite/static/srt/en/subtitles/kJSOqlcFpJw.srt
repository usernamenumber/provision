1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:07,333
In the last video we had a large cloud of hydrogen atoms, eventually condensing into

2
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:13,933
a high pressure, high mass, I guess you could say, ball of hydrogen atoms, and when the pressure

3
00:00:13,933 --> 00:00:20,400
when the pressure and the temperature got high enough, and so this is what we saw in the last video

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,533
when the pressure and the temperature got high enough. we were able to get the hydrogen protons

5
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:29,667
the hydrogen nucleuses close enough to each to other, or hydrgen nuclei

6
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:35,933
close enough to each other for the strong force to take over and fusion to happen and release energy

7
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:43,800
and then that energy begins to offset the actually gravitational force

8
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,667
so that the whole star, what is now a star, does not collapse on itself

9
00:00:47,667 --> 00:00:51,000
and once we're there, we're now in the main sequence of a star

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,133
What I want to do in this video is to take off from that starting point and think about what happens

11
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:59,267
in the star next, so the main sequence, we have the core of the star

12
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:02,200
So this is the star's core.

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:12,533
and you have hydrogen fusing into helium.

14
00:01:12,533 --> 00:01:18,129
and it's releasing just a ton of energy.

15
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:23,333
That energy is what keeps the core from imploding, it's kind-of the outward force to

16
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:28,267
offset the gravitational force that wants to implode everything, that wants to crush everything

17
00:01:28,267 --> 00:01:30,867
So you have the core of a star

18
00:01:30,867 --> 00:01:36,933
like the sun, and that energy then heats up all the other gas on the outside of the core

19
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:42,133
to create that really bright object that we see as a star, or in our case,

20
00:01:42,133 --> 00:01:44,867
in our Sun's case, the Sun!

21
00:01:44,867 --> 00:01:49,733
Now as this hydrogen is fusing into helium, you can imagine that more and more helium

22
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:57,129
is forming in the core, so I'll do the helium as green, so more and more helium

23
00:01:57,129 --> 00:01:59,800
forms in the core, it will especially form

24
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,600
the closer you get to the center, the higher the pressures will be and the faster this fusion

25
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,333
this ignition, will happen. In fact the bigger the mass of the star, the more pressure,

26
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,667
the faster the fusion occurs.

27
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:19,800
And so you have this helium building up inside of the core as the hydrogen in the core gets fused.

28
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,867
Now what's going to happen there? Helium is a more dense atom.

29
00:02:24,867 --> 00:02:31,600
It's packing more mass in a smaller space, so as more and more of this hydrogen here turns into helium

30
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:39,579
what you're going to have is the core itself is going to shrink.

31
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:48,144
so let me a draw a smaller core here, so the core itself is going to shrink

32
00:02:48,144 --> 00:02:56,800
and now it has a lot more Helium in it, now let's just stick to the extreme point

33
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,267
where it's all helium, where it's depleted, but it's much denser

34
00:03:01,267 --> 00:03:05,800
That same amount of mass that was in this sphere is now in a denser sphere

35
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,533
in a helium sphere, so it's going just as much attraction to it, gravitational attraction

36
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:16,867
but things can get even closer to it, and we know that the closer you are to a mass

37
00:03:16,867 --> 00:03:23,400
the stronger the pull of gravity, so instead of having just the hydrogen

38
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:33,795
fusion occurring at the core, you're now going to have hydrogen fusion in a shell around the core

39
00:03:33,795 --> 00:03:44,738
Hydrogen fusing in a shell around the core.

40
00:03:44,738 --> 00:03:47,467
And let me just be clear, this doesn't just happen all-of-a-sudden

41
00:03:47,467 --> 00:03:51,467
it is a gradual process, as we have more and more helium in the core

42
00:03:51,467 --> 00:03:54,800
the core gets denser and denser and denser

43
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:03,200
and so the pressures become even larger and larger near the core because you are able to get closer

44
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,467
to a more massive core since it is now more dense

45
00:04:06,467 --> 00:04:11,338
and as that pressure near the core increases even more and more the fusion reacion happens

46
00:04:11,338 --> 00:04:15,467
faster and faster and faster, until you get to this point

47
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:21,800
so let me be clear, you have a helium core, all of the hydrogen in the core has been used up

48
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,267
and then you have the hydrogen right outside the core under enormous pressure

49
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:29,933
it's actually under more pressure than it was when it was just a pure hydrogen core

50
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:38,267
because there's so much mass on the outside here trying to, I guess you could say

51
00:04:38,267 --> 00:04:47,133
exerting downward or gravitational force down, trying to get to that even denser helium core

52
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:52,000
because everything is able to get closer in, and so now you have fusion occurring even faster

53
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,533
even faster

54
00:04:56,533 --> 00:05:03,533
and it's occurring over a larger radius, so this faster fusion over a larger radius

55
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:07,267
is then going to, the force is now going to expel...

56
00:05:07,267 --> 00:05:12,133
The energy that's released from this fusion is now going to expel these outer

57
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:15,133
layers of the star even further.

58
00:05:15,133 --> 00:05:19,200
so the whole time, this gradual process as the hydrogen turns into helium

59
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:26,800
or fuses into helium in the core the hydrogen right outside the core starts to burn faster and faster

60
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,267
I shouldn't say burn, it starts to fuse faster and faster

61
00:05:31,267 --> 00:05:36,333
and over a larger and larger radius, so you might, the unintuitive thing is

62
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:40,956
the fusion is happening faster over a larger radius and the reason that is because you have even a denser core

63
00:05:40,956 --> 00:05:44,867
that is causing even more gravitational pressure.

64
00:05:44,867 --> 00:05:47,600
and as that's happening the star is getting brighter

65
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,800
and it's also, the fusion reactions, since they're happening in a more intense way

66
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:59,867
and over a larger radius are able to expel the material of the star even larger

67
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:05,400
so the radius of the star itself is getting bigger and bigger and bigger

68
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,733
so this star looked like this if this star, maybe I'll draw it in white

69
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:17,267
if this star looked like this, that's not white, this star looked like this

70
00:06:17,267 --> 00:06:19,000
oh what's happening to my color changer?

71
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,067
there you go, ok that's

72
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:25,800
this star looked like this, right over here

73
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,067
now this star over here since the faster fusion reaction is happening over a larger radius

74
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:35,533
is going to be far larger, and I'm not even drawing it to scale

75
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:39,600
in the case of our sun, when it get's to this point it's going to be 100x the diameter

76
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,800
and at this point it is a red giant

77
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,200
and the reason that it's "redder"

78
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,533
than this one over here, is that even though the fusion is happeneing more furiously

79
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:59,733
that energy is being dissipated over a larger surface area, so the actual surface temperature of the

80
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:05,133
red giant at this point is actually going to be cooler

81
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:10,933
so it's going to emit light at a larger wavelength.

82
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:13,133
a redder wavelength than this over here

83
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:17,267
this thing, the core, was not burning as furiously as this thing over here

84
00:07:17,267 --> 00:07:22,400
but that energy was being dissipated over a smaller volume, so this had a

85
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:29,133
higher surface temperature.

86
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:35,533
This over here, the core is no longer burning, the core is now helium that is not burning

87
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:40,533
it's getting denser and denser as the helium packs in on itself.

88
00:07:40,533 --> 00:07:43,867
but the hydrogen fusion over here is occurring more intensely,

89
00:07:43,867 --> 00:07:48,467
it's occurring in a hotter way but the surface here is less hot

90
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:54,200
because it's just a larger surface area so the increased heat is more than mitigated

91
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,933
by how large the star has become.

92
00:07:56,933 --> 00:07:59,133
now this is going to keep happening, and keep happening

93
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:04,533
and the pressures keep intensifying because more helium is being produced

94
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:07,867
and this core keeps collapsing

95
00:08:07,867 --> 00:08:13,467
and the temperature here keeps going up

96
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:20,467
so we said that the first ignition, the first fusion occurs at around 10mK

97
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:25,600
This thing will keep heating up until it gets to 100mK!

98
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,467
and now I'm talking about a star that is about as massive as the sun

99
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:32,267
some stars will never even be massive enough to condense it's core

100
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:36,267
so that the temperature reaches 100mK but let's just talk about the case in which it does

101
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:42,718
so eventually you'll get to a point, so we're still sitting in the red giant phase

102
00:08:42,718 --> 00:08:48,200
we're this huge star over here we've got this helium core

103
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:54,467
that helium core keeps getting condensed and condensed, and then we have a shell of hydrogen

104
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:59,800
that keeps fusing into helium around it, so this is our hydrogen shell

105
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:07,067
hydrogen fusion is occurring in this yellow shell over here that's causing the radius of this star

106
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:14,133
to get bigger and bigger, to expand, but when the temperature gets sufficiently hot.

107
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:18,733
And now I think you're going to get a sense of how heavier and heavier elements form in the universe

108
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:22,800
and all of the heavy elements you see around you, including the ones that are in you

109
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,133
were formed this way from, initially, hydrogen.

110
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:35,800
When it gets hot enough, at 100mK in this core because of such enormous pressures

111
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,067
then the helium itself will start to fuse.

112
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:47,225
so then we're going to have a core in here where the helium itself will start to fuse

113
00:09:47,225 --> 00:09:52,067
and now we're talking about a situation where we have helium and hydrogen

114
00:09:52,067 --> 00:09:56,867
and all sorts of combinations will form but in general the helium is mainly going to fuse

115
00:09:56,867 --> 00:10:02,400
into carbon and oxygen and it will form into other things and it becomes much more complicated

116
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,000
and I don't want to get into all of the details.

117
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,933
Let me just show you a Periodic Table

118
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:09,400
I didn't have this when I somehow lost it

119
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:15,733
Hydrogen here has one proton, it actually has no neutrons, it was getting fused in the main sequence

120
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:17,667
into helium

121
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:21,200
2 protons, 2 neutrons, we would need 4 of these to get one of those

122
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,000
because this actually has an atomic mass of 4, if we're talking about helium-4

123
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,333
And then the helium, once we get to 100mK can start being fused

124
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:32,400
if you get roughly 3 of them, and you know there are all these other things

125
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
coming and leaving the reactions

126
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,067
you can get to a carbon, you get 4 of them

127
00:10:37,067 --> 00:10:40,467
you, 4 of them at least is the starting raw material and you get to an oxygen

128
00:10:40,467 --> 00:10:44,600
so we're starting to fuse heavier and heavier elements, so what happens here

129
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,733
is this helium is fusing into carbon and oxygen so you start building a carbon

130
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:54,467
and oxygen core, so I'm going to leave you there, I realize I'm already past

131
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:57,600
my self imposed limit of 10 minutes

132
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,667
What I want you to think about is what is likely to happen here?

133
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:06,933
What is likely to happen here if this star will never have the mass to begin to fuse this carbon

134
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,000
and oxygen

135
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,067
if it does have the mass, if it is a super massive star, it will eventually

136
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:16,733
will be able to raise even this carbon and oxygen core to 600mK

137
00:11:16,733 --> 00:11:19,800
and begin to fuse that into even heavier elements

138
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,600
but lets think about what's going to happen for something like the sun where it will

139
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,800
never have the mass, it will never have the pressure, to start to fuse carbon and oxygen

140
00:11:26,800 --> 99:59:59,000
And that will be the topic of the next video
