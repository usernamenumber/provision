00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,070
Problem 17: Michelle read a book review

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,050
and predicted that the number of girls

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,190
who will like the book will be more than

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:13,720
twice the number of boys who will like the book.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,370
So, she predicted that the girls would be more than twice

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,120
let me box it out -- more than twice

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,000
the number of boys who will like the book.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,020
Which table shows data that supports her prediction?

9
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:26,740
So essentially,

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,530
we just need to find one of the tables

11
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,230
where the number of girls who like the book,

12
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,730
that's just this column right here --

13
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,030
the number who like the book --

14
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,040
should be more than twice the number of boys.

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,430
Let's see the girls here is 40,

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,000
the boys here are 35,

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,780
there are more girls than boys,

18
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,020
but it's not more than twice the boys.

19
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,050
The boys are 35.

20
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,300
Twice the boys would be 70,

21
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,500
and girls is definitely not more than 70,

22
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,960
so that's not our answer.

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,530
Let's just go here, well,

24
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,030
here the boys are more than the girls,

25
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,520
which definitely isn't going to be the case.

26
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,200
We need a situation where the girls are more than

27
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,630
twice the number of boys.

28
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,840
So that's not our situation,

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,080
because the girls are actually smaller than the boys here.

30
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,050
Here we have 35 boys,

31
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,890
if you multiply that by 2,

32
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,660
you would get 70 boys.

33
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,060
So twice the boys is 70.

34
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,420
And we see that the girls, at 80,

35
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,310
are more than twice the boys at 70.

36
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,050
So that is our choice.

37
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:24,000
The girls are more than twice the boys.

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,800
And if you look here, the boys and girls are even,

39
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,480
so the girls are definitely not more than twice the boys.

40
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,040
So we know definitely, that B is our answer.

41
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,590
Go to the next page, Problem 18:

42
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:41,360
Anna has the letter tiles below in a bag.

43
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,820
It's very interesting,

44
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,020
it just happens to spell out statistics.

45
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,070
She reached in the bag, and pulled out an S.

46
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:51,000
She then put the tile back in the bag.

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,520
OK, so all of them are still in the bag.

48
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,850
If Anna randomly selects a tile from the bag,

49
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:01,000
what is the probability she will select an S again?

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,830
So this is a trick question on some level,

51
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,810
because this first part,

52
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:10,000
that she reached in the bag and pulled out an S and

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,070
she then put the tile back in the bag.

54
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,740
That doesn't do anything!

55
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,180
The fact that she pulled out an S,

56
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,720
and then put it back in the bag,

57
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,510
that shouldn't change what happens afterward.

58
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,750
If she took out the S and kept the S out,

59
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,800
then this would be a different type of problem.

60
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,160
But since she took out the S and put it back in,

61
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,000
this is almost useless information.

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,040
We still have all of these letters in the bag.

63
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,030
It says if Anna randomly selects a tile from the bag,

64
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,050
what is the probability she'll select an S?

65
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,400
So all we have to say is,

66
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,910
all of these are in the bag,

67
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,040
so what are the possible outcomes?

68
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:50,060
So there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 possible outcomes.

69
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,860
10 possible outcomes,

70
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,080
so that's going to be the denominator for our probability.

71
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,390
And then, what are the outcomes that satisfy our conditions?

72
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,030
Or, what are the outcomes where she selects an S?

73
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,860
She selects an S,

74
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,010
so there's 1 S, 2 S, and 3 S's.

75
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:10,270
There's 3 out of the 10 situations involve selecting an S,

76
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,010
so the answer is 3/10.

77
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,440
And the reason why I said it's a trick question,

78
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,600
is because they write statement

79
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,330
which really doesn't change the problem it all.

80
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,010
She took out an S, she put it back.

81
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:21,410
If she said that she took out an S,

82
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,020
and then she did not put it back in the bag,

83
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,400
then you would say, oh gee,

84
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,970
then there's only 9 tiles left;

85
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,240
and only two of them are S's,

86
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,660
and then you would have said 2/9.

87
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,780
But since she did put the S back in the bag,

88
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,350
we could say, oh, there's 10 letters in the bag,

89
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:40,030
3 of them are S's, so the answer is 3/10.

90
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:45,150
Problem 19: The scatterplot below shows the ages

91
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,030
of some children and the distance each lives from school.

92
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,500
So this is the ages,

93
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,000
and then this is the distance in that axis.

94
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,940
Which statement best describes the relation between age

95
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,070
and distance from the school?

96
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,680
Just looking at this, I really don't see any relation,

97
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,220
it seems to be fairly random.

98
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,630
Let's see what the statements tell us.

99
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,050
As age and increases,

100
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,100
the distance from school increases.

101
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,950
No, not really, I mean,

102
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,610
that would look something like this.

103
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:27,140
So this is our age axis, this is our distance axis,

104
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,180
what A is describing is as age increases,

105
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,870
the distance from school increases.

106
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,080
The data points should look something like this.

107
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,290
They should generally increase --

108
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,470
distance should generally increase as age increases.

109
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,190
That's not what we see here,

110
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,010
I mean this really kind of seems arbitrary.

111
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,090
It's not like this nice upward trend.

112
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:47,430
B, as age increases the distance from school decreases.

113
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,700
Well I don't even see a downward trend either,

114
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,080
what B is describing,

115
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,090
the data would look like this.

116
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,630
Where we have this downward trend.

117
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,260
I don't see that here, either.

118
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,090
C, as age increases,

119
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:03,000
the distance from school remains constant.

120
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What C is describing would have data that looks like this.

121
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,010
That regardless of age,

122
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,270
the distance from school is about the same.

123
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,530
I don't really see that either.

124
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,010
There's still a huge spread of distances.

125
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:18,460
And then D, there is no relationship between

126
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,020
the age and distance from school.

127
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,530
I'll go with that one because, you could imagine,

128
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,320
if I tried to draw trend line,

129
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,700
I could draw something like that,

130
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,490
maybe that makes it look like there's a trend.

131
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,240
But I just as easily could have drawn that.

132
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,030
And looks just is good to me.

133
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,010
Or I just as easily could have drawn that.

134
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:36,010
None of these look like it fits the data any better.

135
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:40,900
So, at least the answer that I feel comfortable with is D.
