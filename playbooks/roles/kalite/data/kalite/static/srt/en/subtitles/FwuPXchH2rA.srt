1
00:00:00,608 --> 00:00:02,738
What I want to do in this video

2
00:00:02,738 --> 00:00:06,533
is make sure we're comfortable with ways to represent

3
00:00:06,533 --> 00:00:11,667
and visualize complex numbers.

4
00:00:11,667 --> 00:00:14,467
So you're probably familiar with the idea

5
00:00:14,467 --> 00:00:16,667
complex number -- let's call it z

6
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:20,933
and z is the variable we do tend to use for complex number.

7
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:26,400
Let's say that z is equal to a+bi.

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,600
We call it complex because it has a real part

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,733
it has a real part

10
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:33,667
and it has an imaginary part.

11
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:36,000
And it has an imaginary part.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,400
And just so you're used to the notation, sometimes

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,733
you'll see someone write the real part,

14
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:43,800
give me the real part of Z.

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,800
This is a function that you input a complex number

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,733
and it will output the real part.

17
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:50,800
In this case the real part is equal to a.

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,067
And you can have another function

19
00:00:53,067 --> 00:00:55,733
called the imaginary part.

20
00:00:55,733 --> 00:00:57,667
The imaginary part of z.

21
00:00:57,667 --> 00:00:59,267
You input some complex number

22
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:01,533
and it'll output the imaginary part

23
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:05,933
The imaginary part -- it'll say how much you're scaling up i.

24
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:07,933
And in this case it would be b.

25
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:12,000
It would be b -- this is a real number -- but this tells us how much the i

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,333
is scaled up in the complex number z.

27
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:16,733
Right over there.

28
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:19,133
Now, one way to visualize complex numbers

29
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:21,467
and this is actually a very helpful way to visualize them

30
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:23,933
when we start to think about roots of numbers

31
00:01:23,933 --> 00:01:25,800
especially the complex roots

32
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,308
Is using something called an Argand diagram.

33
00:01:29,308 --> 00:01:33,769
Argand diagram.

34
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:35,067
So this is this

35
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:36,667
And so it looks a lot like coordinate axes

36
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:38,133
and it is a coordinate axes

37
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:40,800
but instead of having an x and y axis

38
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,200
it has a real and imaginary axis

39
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,200
so the example of z being a+bi

40
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,933
we would plot it really as a position vector

41
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:55,933
where we have the real part on the horizontal axis

42
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:57,333
so let's say that this is a.

43
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:01,000
And then the imaginary part along the vertical axis

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,533
or the imaginary axis.

45
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:04,533
So let's say that this is b.

46
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:07,000
And so we would represent in an argand diagram

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,133
the vector z as a position vector

48
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:13,000
that starts at zero and has a tip

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,595
at the coordinate a, b.

50
00:02:15,595 --> 00:02:19,825
So this right here -- this right here

51
00:02:19,825 --> 00:02:21,933
is our complex number.

52
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:25,667
This right here is a represation in an argand diagram

53
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:29,933
of the complex number a+bi or of z.

54
00:02:29,933 --> 00:02:31,800
Now when you draw it this way,

55
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,133
when you draw it as a position vector --

56
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:35,800
and if you're familiar with polar coordinates

57
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,867
you're probably thinking -- hey I don't have to

58
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,467
represent this complex number just as kind of coordinates

59
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:47,533
just as an a+bi, maybe I can represent this as some angle here

60
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:51,933
as some angle here - let's call that angle phi.

61
00:02:51,933 --> 00:02:55,452
And some distance here - let's call that r.

62
00:02:55,452 --> 00:02:57,179
Which is kind of the magnitude of this vector.

63
00:02:57,179 --> 00:02:58,659
And you could.

64
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:00,400
If you gave some angle and some distance,

65
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,600
that would also specify this point in a complex plane.

66
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,133
And this is actually called the argument of the complex number

67
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:10,133
And this right here is called the magnitude

68
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:13,400
or sometimes the modulus

69
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,600
or the absolute value of the complex number

70
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,800
So let's think about it little bit

71
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,333
Let's think about how we would actually calculate these values

72
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:23,133
So r, which is the modulus or the magnitude

73
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:27,467
its denoted by the magnitude or the absolute value of z1.

74
00:03:27,467 --> 00:03:29,067
What's this going to be?

75
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:32,000
Well we have right triangle here.

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,667
We have a right triangle here.

77
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:36,667
This side is b, length b.

78
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:39,800
The base right here has length a.

79
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,933
So to calculate r we could just use the pythagorean theorem

80
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:45,467
r squared is going to be a squared plus b squared

81
00:03:45,467 --> 00:03:53,333
or r is going to be equal to the square root of a squared plus b squared.

82
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,333
If we want to figure out the argument.

83
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:59,067
Let's say we want to figure out the argument.

84
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:01,933
This is going to be equal to what?

85
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:03,600
Let's think about this a little bit.

86
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,333
We have b and a. So what trig function deals with

87
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,667
the opposite side of an angle and the adjacent side

88
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:14,667
So let me write the famous sohcahtoa appear.

89
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:20,267
Sohcahtoa - tangent deals with opposite over adjacent.

90
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:25,067
So the tangent of this angle, which we called the argument

91
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:26,333
of the complex number.

92
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,933
The tangent of the argument is going to be equal to

93
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:30,733
the opposite side over the adjacent side

94
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:34,400
It is equal to b over a.

95
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,000
And so if we wanted a solve for this argument

96
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,267
we would say that the argument is equal to the arctan

97
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:45,000
or the inverse tangent of b over a.

98
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,600
Now, if we wanted to represent -- let's say we had the complex number

99
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,410
Let's say that we were given the argument and the

100
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,462
let's say that we were given --

101
00:04:56,462 --> 00:05:00,867
Let's say that we were given the modulus and the argument

102
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:01,933
Let's say we were given that.

103
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:03,000
How do we go the other way?

104
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,800
Right now if we have the a's and the b's of the real and complex part

105
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,933
I just showed you how to get the magnitude

106
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,062
and how to get the angle or the argument.

107
00:05:10,062 --> 00:05:12,215
But if you're given this, how to you go the other way?

108
00:05:12,518 --> 00:05:17,000
Well here, if you're trying to figure out a given r and theta.

109
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,533
So you're trying to figure out adjacent side

110
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:22,067
given an angle and the hypotenuse.

111
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:25,067
So adjacent over hypotenuse is equal to cosine.

112
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:31,467
So you would have cosine of the argument is equal to r --

113
00:05:31,467 --> 00:05:35,733
is equal to the adjacent over the hypotenuse.

114
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:39,733
Is equal to a over r. Multiply both sides by r.

115
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:44,867
you get r * cosine of phi is equal to a.

116
00:05:44,867 --> 00:05:48,200
Do something very similar for b.

117
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,800
If we use sine -- opposite over hypotenuse

118
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,333
sine of the argument is equal to b over r.

119
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,933
Is equal to b over the magnitude.

120
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:05,467
Multiply both sides by r, you get r * sine of phi is equal to b.

121
00:06:05,467 --> 00:06:08,067
So how would we write this complex number?

122
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,533
So this complex number z.

123
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:16,200
The complex number z is going to be equal to it's real part

124
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,933
which is r*cosine of phi

125
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:23,800
r*cosine of phi plus the imaginary part times i

126
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:31,867
plus r -- we do that same green -- plus r*sine of phi times i.

127
00:06:31,867 --> 00:06:37,667
times i -- Now this might pop out at you as something that's pretty interesting

128
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:39,467
if you've ever seen Euler's formula.

129
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:41,267
Let's factor out this r over here.

130
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:43,867
So this is going to be equal to factor of an r.

131
00:06:43,867 --> 00:06:46,133
r times of cosine of phi

132
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:50,867
cosine of phi plus -- i put the i up front --

133
00:06:50,867 --> 00:06:55,856
i sine of phi.

134
00:06:55,856 --> 00:06:57,577
Now what is this?

135
00:06:57,577 --> 00:07:01,267
And if you've seen the videos i did in the Taylor series

136
00:07:01,267 --> 00:07:04,133
Series of videos in the calculus playlist --

137
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:07,267
And it's really one of the most profound results in all of mathematics

138
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:10,000
it still gives me chills -- this is Euler's formula.

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This is -- or this by Euler's formula is the same thing.

140
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,267
This is the same thing.

141
00:07:16,267 --> 00:07:18,467
And we show it by looking at the Taylor series representations

142
00:07:18,467 --> 00:07:23,267
of e to the x and the Taylor series representations of

143
00:07:23,267 --> 00:07:25,000
cosine of x and sine of x.

144
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,533
But this is -- if we're dealing with radians -- e to the i, phi

145
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,667
e to the i, phi.

146
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:34,133
So z is going to be equal to r

147
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:39,267
is going to be equal to r times e to the i,phi

148
00:07:39,267 --> 00:07:43,533
e to the i, phi.

149
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:47,333
So there are two ways to write a complex number

150
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,467
You could write it like this, where you have the real and the imaginary part

151
00:07:50,467 --> 00:07:52,067
That's my "do what we're used to"

152
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:54,800
or we can write it in exponential form

153
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,133
where you have the modulus or the magnitude

154
00:07:57,133 --> 00:08:00,800
being multiplied by a complex exponential.

155
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,933
We're gonna see that this can be super useful especially

156
00:08:02,933 --> 00:08:04,982
when we're trying do find roots

157
00:08:04,982 --> 00:08:07,733
Now just to make this tangible let's actually do this,

158
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:11,933
with an actual example. So let's say that i had

159
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:19,375
I don't know -- let's say that i had z1 is equal to

160
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:30,200
square root of three over two plus i.

161
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,267
And so we want to figure out.

162
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:37,200
We want to figure out it's magnitude and

163
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,200
we want to figure out it's argument.

164
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,933
So let's do that. So that magnitude

165
00:08:44,966 --> 00:08:47,000
the magnitude of z1 is going to be equal to the square root of this square

166
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,867
so this is going to be equal to

167
00:08:48,867 --> 00:08:54,133
this is going to be equal to three over four -- three fourths

168
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:58,000
plus one squared -- we're gonna actually say

169
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,200
plus four fourths, so this is going to be equal to

170
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,933
square root of seven over four which is equal to

171
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:09,133
the square root of seven over two.

172
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:11,800
And now let's figure out it's argument.

173
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,000
So let's draw -- if I were to draw this on an Argand diagram

174
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,533
on an Argand diagram, it would look like this.

175
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:25,333
It's going to be in the first quadrant so that's all I have to worry about.

176
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,800
So let me draw it.

177
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,600
Let me draw it like this.

178
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,800
And so we have a situation.

179
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,733
So it's going to be square root of three

180
00:09:35,733 --> 00:09:37,467
actually let me change this up a little bit

181
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:38,933
just so the numbers get a little bit cleaner

182
00:09:38,933 --> 00:09:40,133
sorry about this

183
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:42,605
let me ma make it a little bit, slightly cleaner.

184
00:09:42,605 --> 00:09:46,446
So just so that we have a slightly cleaner result.

185
00:09:46,446 --> 00:09:50,400
We want to make our first example a simple one.

186
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,874
So let's make square root of three over two plus one half

187
00:09:53,874 --> 00:09:56,335
plus one half i.

188
00:09:56,335 --> 00:09:58,192
So let's figure out the magnitude

189
00:09:58,192 --> 00:10:02,419
the magnitude here -- z1 is equal to the square root of

190
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:06,784
square three over two squared is equal to three over four

191
00:10:06,784 --> 00:10:10,128
plus one half square is equal to one fourth.

192
00:10:10,128 --> 00:10:11,706
This makes things a lot nicer.

193
00:10:11,706 --> 00:10:14,493
This is equal to the square root of one which is one.

194
00:10:14,493 --> 00:10:17,744
And now let's think about it -- let's draw it on an Argand diagram

195
00:10:17,744 --> 00:10:20,667
do visualize the argument.

196
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:25,200
So this my imaginary axis.

197
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,200
That is my imaginary axis.

198
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,800
This is my real axis.

199
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,400
My real axis.

200
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,467
And so this complex number is square of three over two

201
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:41,133
square of three over two is 1.7 so if we have like one

202
00:10:41,133 --> 00:10:45,533
it would be like -- so this is one -- it'll be right over here.

203
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:47,333
Some place right over here.

204
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,667
This is square root of three over two.

205
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:51,333
The real part.

206
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,533
The imaginary part is one half.

207
00:10:52,533 --> 00:10:57,133
So if this is one, this is one half, the imaginary part is right over here -- one half

208
00:10:57,133 --> 00:11:01,467
And we actually also know it's length -- or magnitude is one.

209
00:11:01,467 --> 00:11:04,333
So how to we figure out

210
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,067
how do we figure out phi over here

211
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:09,933
We know this side over here is square root of three over..

212
00:11:09,933 --> 00:11:12,333
Oh let me be careful -- we know that side over there is one half.

213
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:16,600
That's the imaginary part and we know the base is square root of three over two.

214
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,333
So a bunch of ways we can do this

215
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:23,800
One. You could just look at -- do the tangent

216
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,867
because that involves the opposite over the adjacent.

217
00:11:25,867 --> 00:11:30,533
You could say that tangent of phi is equal to the opposite.

218
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:35,600
is equal to one half over the square root of three over two.

219
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,800
And then you can take the inverse tan of both sides.

220
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,600
So this is to be the same thing as

221
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,400
phi being equal to the inverse tangent

222
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,933
or the arc tangent of

223
00:11:44,933 --> 00:11:47,400
if you multiply the numeral denominator by 2

224
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,667
this is one over the square root of three.

225
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,400
You could do it like that.

226
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:56,200
You could also say that phi is equal to the inverse sine of

227
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,600
So the sine of phi is going to be equal to the opposite over the hypotenuse.

228
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,467
So sine of phi is equal to one half over one-

229
00:12:03,467 --> 00:12:08,733
Or phi is equal to arc sine of one half -- and you could put that in your calculator.

230
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:12,133
Or you could recognize, this is a 30-60-90 triangle.

231
00:12:12,133 --> 00:12:14,400
This base right here is square root of three over two.

232
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,969
This is one half -- This is one.

233
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:18,867
So this angle right here is going to be 30 degrees

234
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:21,667
and that's just from pattern matching from a 30-60-90 triangle.

235
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:24,267
You could look at these and also get something similar.

236
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:26,533
Now, I want to put this in radiant form,

237
00:12:26,533 --> 00:12:29,867
because whenever I use the exponential form you want it to be in radiant.

238
00:12:29,867 --> 00:12:32,000
So phi is equal to 30 degrees.

239
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,667
phi is equal to 30 degrees which is the same thing as phi over six.

240
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:43,000
So if I wanted to represent z1 in exponential form

241
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,867
it would be exact same thing as r or it's magnitude which is 1.

242
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:48,933
I put the one out there but you really don't have to

243
00:12:48,933 --> 00:12:57,467
one times e to the pi over six i

244
00:12:57,467 --> 00:13:01,810
e to the pi over six i.

245
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,441
And we're done!
