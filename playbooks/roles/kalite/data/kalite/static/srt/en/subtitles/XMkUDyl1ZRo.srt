1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,830
   

2
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:02,790
So where I had left off
is we had the circuit.

3
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,010
We had these little
leads here.

4
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,550
This was kind of
our innovation.

5
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,320
And this is actually called a
commutator, where this part

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,800
that's connected to our rotating
piece, that's the

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,080
commutator.

8
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,300
And these are the brushes.

9
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,570
So you could imagine, you could
design them as brushes

10
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:15,950
that always stay in touch.

11
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:20,900
Kind of like the brushes
on a, what was that?

12
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,900
What are those cars at
the amusement park?

13
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,260
Bumper cars, right?

14
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,000
On the bumper cars you have a
pole behind your bumper car.

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,960
I'll draw that for fun.

16
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,880
So let's say this is
your bumper car.

17
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,070
Looks like a shoe
a little bit.

18
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,910
This is you driving
your bumper car.

19
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,200
And they have a pole.

20
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,350
And at the top of the pole,
you'll see these brushes that

21
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,720
are touching the
ceiling, right?

22
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,320
You could view that as the
same type of brush.

23
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,260
And what it allows is a constant
electric current to

24
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,430
flow through the ceiling.

25
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,950
I don't know what direction
it's going in.

26
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,580
But it allows a current to
flow through the ceiling.

27
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,570
And maybe your car is grounded
so the current can flow down

28
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,370
to ground, so that your car
could be powered by the

29
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,470
ceiling and not have to carry
a battery in every car.

30
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,890
Which would be kind of a waste
of energy and probably some

31
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,590
type of a health hazard
and safety risk,

32
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,540
et cetera, et cetera.

33
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,450
So those brushes on your bumper
cars might not be all

34
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:10,620
that different from the brushes
that are touching the

35
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,420
commutators here.

36
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,710
Just a little bit
of terminology.

37
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,120
And it never hurts to
introduce bumper car

38
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,672
references.

39
00:01:18,672 --> 00:01:20,360
I probably should have done
them earlier when we were

40
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,860
learning about momentum
and things.

41
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,210
But anyway.

42
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,980
So what was happening here?

43
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,870
So going back to our
first video.

44
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,910
We have the current going
down like this.

45
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,090
And then if you use your right
hand rule with the cross

46
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,680
product, you know that the net
force from the magnetic field

47
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,270
is going to be downwards on the
left hand side, upward on

48
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,250
the right hand side.

49
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,890
So you have a net torque
rotating it like that.

50
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,050
Rotating the right out of the
page, the left into the page

51
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,800
or into the video screen.

52
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,900
Up to the point that you've
rotated 90 degrees and now

53
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,880
you're looking kind of, so
this side right here.

54
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,480
Let me do it in a different
color so you can see it.

55
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,210
This side is this side,
right on top.

56
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,960
And this side is on the bottom,
below the page.

57
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,240
This side is now
above the page.

58
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,830
If this distance is r,
this side is now r

59
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,320
units above the page.

60
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,180
And I said ideally maybe your
commutator loses touch with

61
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,530
the brushes at this
point, right?

62
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,820
Because they're popping out a
little bit, so when you're

63
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,940
vertical, you actually lose
touch with the brushes.

64
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,620
So you have no circuit flowing,
so you save a little

65
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,280
battery energy.

66
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,210
And you just let a little bit of
the angular momentum carry

67
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,950
this whole rotating contraption
further a little

68
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,860
bit to the point that
your configuration

69
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,190
will look like this.

70
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:40,810
So I know I keep changing
colors, but the whole

71
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,320
contraption will now
look like this.

72
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:51,920
   

73
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,420
OK, that's my positive,
negative, positive, negative,

74
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,660
current flows like this.

75
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,670
Now we assume that the
commutator has

76
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,960
gotten back in touch.

77
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,100
And let me color code this.

78
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,610
So if this side is this
color, right?

79
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,140
Now this is when we're looking
at top on, where it's popping

80
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,320
out of the screen, where
it's above the screen.

81
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,980
And now we've rotated 180
degrees and this side is on

82
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,340
this side, right?

83
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,860
Let me pick a suitable color.

84
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,470
If this side was green.

85
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:25,280
Now this side, we flip the whole
thing over 180 degrees.

86
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,920
And now something interesting
happens.

87
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,390
Remember, before we had this
commutator and everything, if

88
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:33,760
we just flipped it over, the
current, because before when

89
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,500
we didn't have the commutator,
the current here was flowing

90
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,860
down here, up here.

91
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,380
And before the commutator, we
had the current flowing down

92
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,470
here and up here.

93
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,510
And so we were switching
directions.

94
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,540
And so you would have had this
thing that would never

95
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,440
completely rotate.

96
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,410
It would just keep flipping
over, right?

97
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,640
Which may be useful for, I don't
know, if you wanted to

98
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,600
flip things.

99
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,120
But it's not useful
as a motor.

100
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,390
So what happens here?

101
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,580
Now this side, all of a sudden
instead of being connected to

102
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,800
this lead, is now connected
to this lead.

103
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,390
And this green side is now
connected to this lead.

104
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,160
So something interesting
happens.

105
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,600
Now the current on the left side
is still flowing down,

106
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,580
right, and the current
on the right side is

107
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,140
still flowing up.

108
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,820
So we're back to this
configuration except that this

109
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,820
contraption has flipped over.

110
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,550
The brown side is now on the
left and the green side is now

111
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,410
on the right.

112
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,690
And what that allows is that
those net torques are still

113
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,440
going in that same rotational
direction.

114
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,720
Use your right hand rule.

115
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,770
The current is flowing
down here.

116
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,250
So if your magnetic field is
coming to the left, then the

117
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,680
net force is going to be
down there and it's

118
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,140
going to be up there.

119
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,170
And so we can continue
indefinite, and we solve our

120
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,250
other problem.

121
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,360
That we will never keep twisting
these wires here.

122
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,780
So now using the commutator, we
have essentially created an

123
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,655
electric motor.

124
00:04:51,655 --> 00:04:53,710
And remember I drew that little
thing, that could be

125
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,390
like the axle.

126
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,200
Maybe that turns the wheels
or something.

127
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,880
So if you have a constant
magnetic field and you just by

128
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,120
using this commutator which,
as soon as you get to that

129
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,300
kind of vertical point, it cuts
the current, and then

130
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,060
when you go a little bit past
vertical, a little bit past 90

131
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,190
degrees, it switches the
direction of the current.

132
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,600
So on the left hand side you
always have the current coming

133
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,840
down, and on the right hand
side you always have the

134
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,720
current going up.

135
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,450
So that the net torque is always
going to be pushing, is

136
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:28,540
always going to be rotating this
contraption down on the

137
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,990
left hand side and up on
the right hand side.

138
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,040
Coming out of the page on the
right hand side and then down

139
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,990
on the left hand side.

140
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,730
And you could actually
turn a wheel now.

141
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,400
You could create an
electric car.

142
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,380
So that is the basics
really of how

143
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,150
electric motors are created.

144
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,190
Well, there's another way
you could have done it.

145
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,320
You didn't have to use
the commutator.

146
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,100
One methodology you could have
used is you could have had the

147
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,650
magnetic field going until you
get to this point, and then

148
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,770
you turn off the magnetic
field, right?

149
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:02,150
And maybe you wait for this
situation to go all the way

150
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:05,060
180 degrees and then you turn
the magnetic field back on

151
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,130
again, right?

152
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,550
That's one possibility.

153
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,460
But that's maybe not as
efficient cause half of the

154
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,910
cycle you're not powering it.

155
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,325
Or maybe you switch
the direction of

156
00:06:13,325 --> 00:06:14,310
the magnetic field.

157
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,240
Or another option, you don't
have to use a commutator.

158
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,890
Maybe you use some other
contraption to switch the

159
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,160
direction of the
magnetic field.

160
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,030
But this is probably the
simplest way to do it.

161
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:24,010
And I think it gives you a
general idea of how an

162
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,480
electric motor can be created.

163
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,460
And then we could play around
with the mechanics of

164
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,230
innovations on it.

165
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,500
But all electric motors are
essentially some variation of

166
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,020
what you have learned
in this video.

167
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,820
Isn't it neat to learn
something useful?

168
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,070
See you in the next video.

169
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:39,900
