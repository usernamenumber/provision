1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490
   

2
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,840
In this video, I want to do a
bunch of examples involving

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,200
exponent properties.

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,860
But, before I even do that,
let's have a little bit of a

5
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,970
review of what an exponent
even is.

6
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:15,380
So let's say I had 2
to the third power.

7
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,630
You might be tempted to
say, oh is that 6?

8
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,010
And I would say no,
it is not 6.

9
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,580
This means 2 times itself,
three times.

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,940
So this is going to be equal to
2 times 2 times 2, which is

11
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,549
equal to 2 times 2 is 4.

12
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:35,220
4 times 2 is equal to 8.

13
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,090
If I were to ask you what 3 to
the second power is, or 3

14
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:45,110
squared, this is equal to 3
times itself two times.

15
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,220
This is equal to 3 times 3.

16
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,030
Which is equal to 9.

17
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,060
Let's do one more of these.

18
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,080
I think you're getting the
general sense, if you've never

19
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,080
seen these before.

20
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:03,020
Let's say I have 5 to
the seventh power.

21
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,120
That's equal to 5 times
itself, seven times.

22
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:16,280
5 times 5 times 5 times 5
times 5 times 5 times 5.

23
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:16,960
That's seven, right?

24
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,200
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,560
This is going to be a really,
really, really, really, large

26
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,710
number and I'm not going to
calculate it right now.

27
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,470
If you want to do it by hand,
feel free to do so.

28
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,620
Or use a calculator, but this
is a really, really, really,

29
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,320
large number.

30
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,400
So one thing that you might
appreciate very quickly is

31
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,000
that exponents increase
very rapidly.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,700
5 to the 17th would be even a
way, way more massive number.

33
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,920
But anyway, that's a review
of exponents.

34
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,130
Let's get a little bit steeped
in algebra, using exponents.

35
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,610
So what would 3x-- let me do
this in a different color--

36
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:59,670
what would 3x times
3x times 3x be?

37
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,340
Well, one thing you need to
remember about multiplication

38
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,990
is, it doesn't matter what
order you do the

39
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,060
multiplication in.

40
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,440
So this is going to be the same
thing as 3 times 3 times

41
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,550
3 times x times x times x.

42
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,620
And just based on what we
reviewed just here, that part

43
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,160
right there, 3 times 3,
three times, that's 3

44
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,780
to the third power.

45
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,210
And this right here, x times
itself three times.

46
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,750
that's x to the third power.

47
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,050
So this whole thing can be
rewritten as 3 to the third

48
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,570
times x to the third.

49
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,960
Or if you know what 3 to the
third is, this is 9 times 3,

50
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,240
which is 27.

51
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,180
This is 27 x to the
third power.

52
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,840
Now you might have said, hey,
wasn't 3x times 3x times 3x.

53
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,830
Wasn't that 3x to
the third power?

54
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:53,140
Right?

55
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,480
You're multiplying 3x times
itself three times.

56
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,560
And I would say, yes it is.

57
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,210
So this, right here, you could
interpret that as 3x to the

58
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,730
third power.

59
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,950
And just like that, we stumbled
on one of our

60
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,280
exponent properties.

61
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,290
Notice this.

62
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,600
When I have something times
something, and the whole thing

63
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,430
is to the third power, that
equals each of those things to

64
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,490
the third power times
each other.

65
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:21,290
So 3x to the third is the same
thing is 3 to the third times

66
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:27,860
x to the third, which is
27 to the third power.

67
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,730
Let's do a couple
more examples.

68
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:39,050
What if I were to ask you what
6 to the third times 6 to the

69
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,410
sixth power is?

70
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,860
And this is going to be a really
huge number, but I want

71
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,480
to write it as a power of 6.

72
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,290
Let me write the 6 to the sixth
in a different color.

73
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,460
6 to the third times 6 to the
sixth power, what is this

74
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,540
going to be equal to?

75
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,200
Well, 6 to the third, we
know that's 6 times

76
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,880
itself three times.

77
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,400
So it's 6 times 6 times 6.

78
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,440
And then that's going to be
times-- the times here is in

79
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,060
green, so I'll do it in green.

80
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,430
Maybe I'll make both
of them in orange.

81
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,990
That is going to be times
6 to the sixth power.

82
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,430
Well, what's 6 to
the sixth power?

83
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,540
That's 6 times itself
six times.

84
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:27,180
So, it's 6 times 6 times
6 times 6 times 6.

85
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,380
Then you get one
more, times 6.

86
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,620
So what is this whole
number going to be?

87
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,740
Well, this whole thing-- we're
multiplying 6 times itself--

88
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,560
how many times?

89
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,650
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven,

90
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,640
eight, nine times, right?

91
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,450
Three times here and then
another six times here.

92
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,450
So we're multiplying 6 times
itself nine times.

93
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,910
3 plus 6.

94
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:55,360
So this is equal to 6 to
the 3 plus 6 power or 6

95
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,100
to the ninth power.

96
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,650
And just like that,
we/ve stumbled on

97
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,130
another exponent property.

98
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:04,100
When we take exponents, in this
case, 6 to the third, the

99
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,760
number 6 is the base.

100
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,190
We're taking the base to
the exponent of 3.

101
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,900
When you have the same base,
and you're multiplying two

102
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:17,360
exponents with the same base,
you can add the exponents.

103
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,850
Let me do several more
examples of this.

104
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:23,020
Let's do it in magenta.

105
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:29,420
Let's say I had 2 squared times
2 to the fourth times 2

106
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,030
to the sixth.

107
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,840
Well, I have the same base
in all of these, so

108
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,340
I can add the exponents.

109
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:41,490
This is going to be equal to 2
to the 2 plus 4 plus 6, which

110
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,970
is equal to 2 to
the 12th power.

111
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,680
And hopefully that makes sense,
because this is going

112
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,440
to be 2 times itself two times,
2 times itself four

113
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,880
times, 2 times itself
six times.

114
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,000
When you multiply them all out,
it's going to be 2 times

115
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,350
itself, 12 times or 2
to the 12th power.

116
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:04,740
Let's do it in a little bit more
abstract way, using some

117
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,150
variables, but it's the
same exact idea.

118
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:14,570
What is x to the squared or x
squared times x to the fourth?

119
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,610
Well, we could use the property
we just learned.

120
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,060
We have the exact
same base, x.

121
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,300
So it's going to be x to
the 2 plus 4 power.

122
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,100
It's going to be x to
the sixth power.

123
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,380
And if you don't believe
me, what is x squared?

124
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,210
x squared is equal
to x times x.

125
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,110
And if you were going to
multiply that times x to the

126
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,630
fourth, you're multiplying it by
x times itself four times.

127
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:46,200
x times x times x times x.

128
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,560
So how many times are you now
multiplying x by itself?

129
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,470
Well, one, two, three, four,
five, six times.

130
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:56,280
x to the sixth power.

131
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,470
Let's do another one of these.

132
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:02,280
The more examples you see,
I figure, the better.

133
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,760
So let's do the other
property, just to

134
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,590
mix and match it.

135
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:14,320
Let's say I have a to the third
to the fourth power.

136
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,610
So I'll tell you the property
here, and I'll show you why it

137
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,450
makes sense.

138
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,880
When you add something to an
exponent, and then you raise

139
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,680
that to an exponent, you can
multiply the exponents.

140
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:28,160
So this is going to be a to the
3 times 4 power or a to

141
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,020
the 12th power.

142
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,730
And why does that make sense?

143
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:35,340
Well this right here
is a to the third

144
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,820
times itself four times.

145
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,330
So this is equal to a to the
third times a to the third

146
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:45,300
times a to the third times
a to the third.

147
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,430
Well, we have the same base, so
we can add the exponents.

148
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,620
So there's going to be a to
the 3 times 4, right?

149
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,910
This is equal to a to the 3
plus 33 plus three plus 3

150
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:03,600
power, which is the same thing
is a the 3 times 4 power or a

151
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,010
to the 12th power.

152
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,580
So just to review the properties
we've learned so

153
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,560
far in this video, besides
just a review of what an

154
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:19,830
exponent is, if I have x to the
a power times x to the b

155
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,550
power, this is going
to be equal to x to

156
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,120
the a plus b power.

157
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,950
We saw that right here.

158
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,615
x squared times x to the fourth
is equal to x to the

159
00:08:30,615 --> 00:08:32,490
sixth, 2 plus 4.

160
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:39,500
We also saw that if I have x
times y to the a power, this

161
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,440
is the same thing is
x to the a power

162
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,680
times y to the a power.

163
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,810
We saw that early on
in this video.

164
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,570
We saw that over here.

165
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,000
3x to the third is the same
thing as 3 to the third times

166
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,130
x to the third.

167
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,410
That's what this is
saying right here.

168
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,460
3x to the third is the same
thing is 3 to the third times

169
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,730
x to the third.

170
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:05,720
And then the last property,
which we just stumbled upon

171
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,710
is, if you have x to the a and
then you raise that to the bth

172
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:15,430
power, that's equal to
x to the a times b.

173
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,460
And we saw that right there. a
to the third and then raise

174
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,690
that to the fourth power is the
same thing is a to the 3

175
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:25,280
times 4 or a to the
12th power.

176
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:32,970
So let's use these properties
to do a handful of more

177
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:48,070
complex problems. Let's say
we have 2xy squared times

178
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:55,060
negative x squared
y squared times

179
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,900
three x squared y squared.

180
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,330
And we wanted to
simplify this.

181
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:04,980
   

182
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,550
This you can view as
negative 1 times x

183
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,930
squared times y squared.

184
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:13,350
So if we take this whole thing
to the squared power, this is

185
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,670
like raising each of these
to the second power.

186
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:19,590
So this part right here could
be simplified as negative 1

187
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:26,320
squared times x squared squared,
times y squared.

188
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,270
And then if we were to simplify
that, negative 1

189
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,890
squared is just 1, x squared
squared-- remember you can

190
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:35,100
just multiply the exponents-- so
that's going to be x to the

191
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,770
fourth y squared.

192
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,345
That's what this middle
part simplifies to.

193
00:10:40,345 --> 00:10:43,760
And let's see if we can merge
it with the other parts.

194
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,410
The other parts, just to
remember, were 2 xy squared,

195
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:51,350
and then 3x squared y squared.

196
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,380
Well now we're just going ahead
and just straight up

197
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,400
multiplying everything.

198
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,710
And we learned in multiplication
that it doesn't

199
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,860
matter which order you
multiply things in.

200
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,930
So I can just rearrange.

201
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,150
We're just going and multiplying
2 times x times y

202
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,600
squared times x to the fourth
times y squared times 3 times

203
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,550
x squared times y squared.

204
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:10,290
So I can rearrange this, and I
will rearrange it so that it's

205
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,800
in a way that's easy
to simplify.

206
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,995
So I can multiply 2 times 3, and
then I can worry about the

207
00:11:16,995 --> 00:11:18,610
x terms.

208
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:19,960
Let me do it in this color.

209
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:30,330
Then I have times x times x to
the fourth times x squared.

210
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:36,080
And then I have to worry about
the y terms, times y squared

211
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,036
times another y squared times
another y squared.

212
00:11:40,036 --> 00:11:42,950
   

213
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,600
And now what are
these equal to?

214
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,880
Well, 2 times 3.

215
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,200
You knew how to do that.

216
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,330
That's equal to 6.

217
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:53,450
And what is x times x to the
fourth times x squared.

218
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:56,310
Well, one thing to remember is
x is the same thing as x to

219
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,340
the first power.

220
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,480
Anything to the first power
is just that number.

221
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,130
So you know, 2 to the first
power is just 2.

222
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,970
3 to the first power
is just 3.

223
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:08,780
So what is this going
to be equal to?

224
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:13,190
This is going to be equal to--
we have the same base, x.

225
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:19,760
We can add the exponents, x to
the 1 plus 4 plus 2 power, and

226
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,250
I'll add it in the next step.

227
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:25,510
And then on the y's, this
is times y to the 2

228
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,100
plus 2 plus 2 power.

229
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,120
And what does that give us?

230
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:36,840
That gives us 6 x to the
seventh power, y

231
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,250
to the sixth power.

232
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,310
And I'll just leave you with
some thing that you might

233
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,290
already know, but it's
pretty interesting.

234
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:44,900
And that's the question of what
happens when you take

235
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,710
something to the zeroth power?

236
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:50,360
So if I say 7 to the zeroth
power, What does that equal?

237
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,350
And I'll tell you right now--
and this might seem very

238
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:56,820
counterintuitive-- this is equal
to 1, or 1 to the zeroth

239
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,740
power is also equal to 1.

240
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,600
Anything that the zeroth power,
any non-zero number to

241
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,060
the zero power is going
to be equal to 1.

242
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,230
And just to give you
a little bit of

243
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,320
intuition on why that is.

244
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,460
Think about it this way.

245
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:17,100
3 to the first power-- let me
write the powers-- 3 to the

246
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,260
first, second, third.

247
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,800
We'll just do it the
with the number 3.

248
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,420
So 3 to the first power is 3.

249
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,340
I think that makes sense.

250
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,760
3 to the second power is 9.

251
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,610
3 to the third power is 27.

252
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,590
And of course, we're trying to
figure out what should 3 to

253
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,700
the zeroth power be?

254
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,410
Well, think about it.

255
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,040
Every time you decrement
the exponent.

256
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,680
Every time you take the exponent
down by 1, you are

257
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,160
dividing by 3.

258
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,640
To go from 27 to 9,
you divide by 3.

259
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,000
To go from 9 to 3,
you divide by 3.

260
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,400
So to go from this exponent to
that exponent, maybe we should

261
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,630
divide by 3 again.

262
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,950
And that's why, anything to
the zeroth power, in this

263
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:58,050
case, 3 to the zeroth
power is 1.

264
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,940
See you in the next video.
