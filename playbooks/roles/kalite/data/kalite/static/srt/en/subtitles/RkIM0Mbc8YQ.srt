1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,880
   

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,460
The government has said a lot
about the fact that this $700

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,240
billion might not just be a
blank check, that we're

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,490
actually buying assets.

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,150
And, who knows, maybe
we'll even make a

6
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,530
profit on the assets.

7
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,920
And I've hinted and other people
have hinted that, well,

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,500
that's very unlikely because
these assets, they're probably

9
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,820
not worth what the government's

10
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,460
going to pay for it.

11
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,090
And one could argue that even
some of these are worth 0.

12
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,230
And I've gotten some letters and
I've heard other people on

13
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,720
the news actually say, well,
how could they be worth 0?

14
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,370
They're backed by mortgages,
which are backed by houses,

15
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,119
which are the collateral.

16
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,350
That's where the collateral
comes from, the collateralized

17
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,330
debt obligations.

18
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:38,200
So in this video I'm going to
do, hopefully, a reasonably

19
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,980
straightforward example to show
you why some of these

20
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,180
collateralized debt obligations
could be worth

21
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,030
very little or maybe
even nothing.

22
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,050
So let's do something simple.

23
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,680
Let's not talk in terms of
millions of homes, let's talk

24
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,720
in terms of 10 homes.

25
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,820
Let's say I were to create
a very small

26
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,140
mortgage-backed security.

27
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,180
Essentially, I give
out 10 mortgages.

28
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:00,460
Right?

29
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,010
Let's say each mortgage
is $1 million.

30
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:09,050
Let's say that's 10 times
1 million more.

31
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,320
10 times $1 million.

32
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,720
And the people who I give those
mortgages to buy ten $1

33
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,450
million houses.

34
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,440
Right?

35
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,910
So, I create a corporation, a
special purpose entity, for

36
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,630
the sake of this mortgage-backed
security for

37
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,620
constructing these
collateralized debt

38
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,870
obligations.

39
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,470
   

40
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:34,800
That's my company I create,
the balance sheet of it.

41
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,130
What are the assets?

42
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:40,370
Well, I have 10 mortgages times
a million so I have $10

43
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:45,400
million in loans, essentially,
$10 million in mortgages.

44
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,190
And they're collateralized
or they're backed by the

45
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:52,330
underlying houses that these
mortgages were used to buy.

46
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:55,390
$10 million in mortgages,
$10 million more, right?

47
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:59,750
Now, how is this special purpose
entity-- we'll call it

48
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,160
an S.P.E.-- how is this S.P.E.

49
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,550
funded?

50
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,390
Well, it's essentially funded
by the people who are buying

51
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,470
the collateralized
debt obligations.

52
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,050
And collateralized debt
obligations are essentially

53
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,350
just debt that is used to
fund these mortgages.

54
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,000
And what's interesting about
a collateralized debt

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,075
obligation-- see in a
mortgage-backed security, I

56
00:02:18,075 --> 00:02:20,470
would have just given these
$10 million mortgages and

57
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:25,650
then, in this corporation, I
would have just issued a

58
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:26,650
thousand shares.

59
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,600
And so each share would hold
1/1000 of this value, right?

60
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,230
That's a mortgage-backed
security.

61
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,810
But in a collateralized
debt obligation, I

62
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,260
split it into buckets.

63
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:40,830
So what I do is, let's say
I borrow three tranches.

64
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,080
Just call that buckets.

65
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,030
   

66
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,660
So I go to some people and I
borrow, I don't know, of that

67
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,060
$10 million that I said you lent
out, I borrow-- I don't

68
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:57,120
know-- let me say-- I'll make
up a number-- $5 million.

69
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,850
%5 million from these people,
and these are

70
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:59,930
the senior debt holders.

71
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,370
So essentially, both this debt
holder and this debt holder

72
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,930
has to get wiped out before
this guy gets impaired.

73
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,280
Impaired just means that
you get less money

74
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,830
than you lent, right?

75
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:15,730
So I borrow $5 million from
somebody else and I'm going to

76
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,900
pay them the lowest interest
rate because this is the

77
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,770
safest bucket.

78
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:23,060
So think of it this way: let's
say these 10 mortgages, let's

79
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:28,200
say that I'm getting 8%.

80
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,370
And let's say that I'm paying,
let me draw, they're giving me

81
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,190
$5 million.

82
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,010
Let's say that I'll
pay these guys 5%.

83
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,600
And why are they willing to take
a lower interest rate?

84
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,460
Because essentially any default
on this side will hit

85
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,750
these two buckets before
it hits these people.

86
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,640
So this'll be an arguably very
safe debt instrument.

87
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,010
And I'll do more about
that in a second.

88
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:56,380
And let's say I borrow
another $4 million

89
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,190
from some other people.

90
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,360
So they gave me $4 million.

91
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,600
I have to pay a little bit
higher interest to them.

92
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:07,410
I have to pay 6% interest
to them, right?

93
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:12,180
And then, finally, I borrow
another $1 million.

94
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,400
I borrow $1 million from people
who are willing to take

95
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,140
the biggest risk.

96
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,920
So if there's any defaults over
here, these people are

97
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,064
going to be wiped out before
these people get touched.

98
00:04:20,064 --> 00:04:22,230
And actually, we can figure out
the appropriate amount of

99
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:22,760
interest, right?

100
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,680
How much money is coming in per
month before anyone starts

101
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,170
defaulting?

102
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:29,750
Let's see, I'm getting $800,000
in per month.

103
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,190
That's the inflow.

104
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,950
And then on the outflow, I have
to pay these people 5

105
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,650
million times 5%.

106
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,990
That's $250,000.

107
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,360
So that's how much I'm paying
to that tranche.

108
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,750
$250,000.

109
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,500
And then four times 6%.

110
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,650
That's $240,000, minus 240.

111
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,100
So that's what, 800 minus 490.

112
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:59,370
So then I have 310,000
left, right?

113
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,590
So I can essentially pay
this $310,000 per

114
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,100
year to this tranche.

115
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,460
So they're going to actually get
a 31% interest. And that

116
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:08,920
sounds great.

117
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,230
That's why they call that the
equity tranche normally in a

118
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:14,700
CDO because those people
get a lot of upside.

119
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,930
But guess what: if there's any
default, these people get

120
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:22,570
wiped out first. And just to
make this example clear, let's

121
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,880
do it very simply because you
could model this out and

122
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,560
assume some type of prepayment
et cetera, et cetera.

123
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,150
Let me scratch this
out right here.

124
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,330
Let's say that one year out,
half of the mortgages, I don't

125
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,330
know, the people refinance or
they move or they sell their

126
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:39,920
house or whatever.

127
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,450
So they just prepay
the mortgage.

128
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,670
So let's say in one year.

129
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:49,280
Let me redraw this balance
sheet in one year.

130
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,030
So in one year, let's say five
of those borrowers-- so this

131
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,490
is a year later.

132
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,170
Magenta is my color
for a year later.

133
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:02,050
A year later, half of those
borrowers just refinance or

134
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,160
they sell their house.

135
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,370
And so they just pay us back
$5 million, right?

136
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,050
So we get $5 million.

137
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,530
I'll put that on the
asset side of the

138
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,170
balance sheet, right?

139
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,420
This is assets.

140
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,210
   

141
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,130
There's a bunch of videos on
assets and liabilities and

142
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,530
balance sheets if this
confuses you.

143
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,380
And there's no equity in
this company, right?

144
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,270
Because assets minus liability
is equity.

145
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,330
And I did that because these are
special purpose entities.

146
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,560
Their whole purpose is to
structure these securities.

147
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,920
Their purpose really isn't to
be an ongoing operation that

148
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,020
has net income in and of
itself, although there

149
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,070
probably was equity in the
bank who constructed this

150
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,320
probably took at all.

151
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,380
   

152
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,660
OK, so we said half the
people refinance.

153
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,100
Those people were great.

154
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,520
They were worth giving the money
to because they paid off

155
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,570
their loans in whole.

156
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:47,250
But guess what?

157
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:54,140
The other half of the people,
the title of subprime was

158
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,700
deserving of them,
and they default.

159
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,010
And we have to foreclose on
them a year later, right?

160
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,090
But all is not lost, right?

161
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:05,280
We don't lose that $5 million
that we lent those other 5

162
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,450
million people because they
had homes, right?

163
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,290
These are collateralized
debt obligations.

164
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:12,460
We are able to take
their houses.

165
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,990
Unfortunately, it's a really
weak real estate market and

166
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,200
let's say, just for the sake
of argument, we take those

167
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,550
five houses from the people
who didn't pay, right?

168
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,770
Five paid, five didn't pay.

169
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,790
We take the five who
didn't pay houses.

170
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:28,830
And let's say, when we sell
them, let's say we're only

171
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:34,230
able to get, I don't know, 60%
on those houses, right?

172
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,820
So 60% of $5 million.

173
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,750
We're essentially only able to
get $3 million for the houses

174
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,000
we've foreclosed on.

175
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,970
   

176
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,660
So a year later, what are
all of our assets?

177
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,850
We get the $5 million in cash
from the people who are good

178
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,270
and paid off their mortgages.

179
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,100
And then we get the $3 million
from the people who

180
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:53,940
foreclosed.

181
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,930
And then we only got 60% of
the original purchase

182
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:57,610
price of the homes.

183
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,180
We only got that on
the foreclosure.

184
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,850
That makes sense because
credit's getting tighter, and

185
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,450
it's a tough mortgage market,
and all these houses were in

186
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,490
South Florida or Las
Vegas or whatever.

187
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,860
But what happens now?

188
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,890
There's really no purpose for
this entity to even exist

189
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,870
anymore because everyone's
paid off.

190
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,730
There's no income streams
coming in or out.

191
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,520
So essentially we will just
dissolve the corporation and

192
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,900
give everyone what
they're due.

193
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,650
Well, this guy, he gets first
dibs on it, right?

194
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,270
He took the lowest interest rate
in exchange for having

195
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,550
the lowest risk.

196
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:30,130
So that guy right there, I'll
draw him in green because he's

197
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,710
good to go.

198
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:37,570
This tranche right here, he
gets a full $5 million.

199
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:38,230
That's great.

200
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:42,020
He got 5% interest and he got
all of his money back.

201
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,809
Sounds great.

202
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:44,980
The CDOs look safe so far.

203
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,600
But what about this next
tranche, this $4 million guy.

204
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,440
He didn't do so good, right?

205
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,050
The $4 million guy, that's what
he was owed, that's what

206
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,490
he essentially lent the special
purpose entity.

207
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,710
This $4 million tranche
of CDOs.

208
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,350
He's owed $4 million,
but guess what?

209
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,410
After you pay this guy $5
million, there's only $3

210
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,480
million left.

211
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,470
So this guy only gets
$3 million.

212
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,280
So for every $4 he lent,
he only gets $3.

213
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,993
So this guy gets $0.75
on the dollar.

214
00:09:13,993 --> 00:09:18,620
   

215
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,870
That's a seven, right there.

216
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,310
I write my sevens
like a European.

217
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:26,080
   

218
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,640
But what happens to that equity

219
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,980
tranche, this guy up here?

220
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,360
This $1 million, right?

221
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,740
He thought he was a genius.

222
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,570
He lent this money and he was
getting a 31% interest.

223
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:40,370
Sounded good and, frankly, the
bank probably wasn't able to

224
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:43,010
unload this to anyone because
pension funds and a lot of

225
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,210
these foreign governments,
they only buy the safer

226
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:45,970
assets, right?

227
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,230
So this is the stuff that's
probably sitting on a lot of

228
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,210
these investment bank
balance sheets.

229
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,970
These are the smelly, toxic,
stinky assets that people are

230
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,090
talking about.

231
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,330
And guess what?

232
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,280
There's nothing left to pay this
$1 million to this guy.

233
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,780
You pay $5 to this guy.

234
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:02,710
This guy only got $0.75
on the dollar, right?

235
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,690
He was impaired by
$1 million here.

236
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:08,540
And then this last tranche
up here: he gets nothing.

237
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,470
So the question is: these CDOs
that are on banks's balance

238
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,400
sheets, are they these CDOs?

239
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,720
Are they a share in that tranche
of debt, in which

240
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,770
case, they're very safe.

241
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:19,190
But I would argue in which case
the banks probably aren't

242
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,230
looking to unload them as
quickly, or they can probably

243
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,220
find buyers.

244
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,580
Are they this tranche, in which
case maybe they're worth

245
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,600
$0.75, but you know even at
$0.75, you're just going to

246
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,440
break even?

247
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,120
Maybe they're worth, at $0.60
on the dollar, maybe

248
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,840
they're a good deal.

249
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,450
Or are they this stuff?

250
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,780
And if they're this stuff,
then they really, really,

251
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,480
really are worth nothing,
at least in the

252
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,760
example I just gave.

253
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:43,800
