1
00:00:00,485 --> 00:00:07,140
Let's see if we can write 0.0727 as a fraction.

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,486
Now let's just think about what places these are in.

3
00:00:09,486 --> 00:00:12,726
This is in the tenths place...

4
00:00:12,726 --> 00:00:16,673
This is in the hundredths place...

5
00:00:16,673 --> 00:00:21,790
This 2 is in the thousandths place...

6
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:27,445
and this last 7 is in the ten-thousandths place.

7
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:31,073
So, there are a couple of ways we can do this. The way I like to think this,

8
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:39,391
this term right here is in the ten-thousandths place, we can view this whole thing right over here as "727 ten-thousandths,"

9
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:42,991
cuz this is the smallest place, right over here.

10
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:53,271
So let's just rewrite it. This is equal to 727 over 10,000.

11
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:58,160
And, we've already written it as a fraction, and I think that's about as simplified as we can get.

12
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,477
This number up here is not divisible by 2, it's not divisible by 5.

13
00:01:02,477 --> 00:01:09,220
In fact, it's not divisible by 3, which means it's not divisible by 6 or 9. Doesn't even look to be divisible by 7.

14
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,220
It might be a prime number. But I think we are done.
