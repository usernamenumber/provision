1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,907
Let's now tackle a classic thought experiment in probability

2
00:00:03,907 --> 00:00:06,490
called the Monty Hall problem.

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,189
And it's called the Monty Hall problem because

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,270
Monty Hall was the game show host

5
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,861
in Let's Make a Deal where

6
00:00:11,861 --> 00:00:14,554
they would set up a situation very similar to

7
00:00:14,554 --> 00:00:15,890
the Monty Hall problem

8
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,319
that we're about to say.

9
00:00:17,319 --> 00:00:19,675
So let's say that on the show, you're presented with

10
00:00:19,675 --> 00:00:20,694
three curtains.

11
00:00:20,694 --> 00:00:21,672
So you're the contestant

12
00:00:21,672 --> 00:00:23,541
this little character right over there

13
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:25,368
You're presented with three curtains:

14
00:00:25,368 --> 00:00:27,292
curtain number one, curtain number two, and

15
00:00:27,292 --> 00:00:29,456
curtain number three.

16
00:00:29,456 --> 00:00:31,769
And you're told that behind one of these three curtains

17
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:33,588
there is a fabulous prize.

18
00:00:33,588 --> 00:00:35,723
Something that you really want, a car, or a vacation

19
00:00:35,723 --> 00:00:37,906
or some type of large amount of cash.

20
00:00:37,906 --> 00:00:40,108
And then behind the other two,

21
00:00:40,108 --> 00:00:41,624
and we don't know which they are,

22
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:43,756
there is something that you do not want,

23
00:00:43,756 --> 00:00:45,923
say a new pet goat, an ostrich,

24
00:00:45,923 --> 00:00:48,120
or something like that, or beachball,

25
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,468
something that is not as good as the cash prize.

26
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:52,178
And so your goal is to try to find

27
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:53,528
the cash prize.

28
00:00:53,528 --> 00:00:55,273
And they say: "guess which one"

29
00:00:55,273 --> 00:00:56,989
or "which one you would like to select".

30
00:00:56,989 --> 00:00:58,641
And so let's say that you select

31
00:00:58,641 --> 00:00:59,842
door number one,

32
00:00:59,842 --> 00:01:00,992
or curtain number one,

33
00:01:00,992 --> 00:01:03,660
then the Monty Hall and Let's Make a Deal crew

34
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,980
will make it a little more interesting.

35
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,723
They won't just show you whether or not you won,

36
00:01:07,723 --> 00:01:11,029
They'll then show you one of the other two doors,

37
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,728
or one of the other two curtains.

38
00:01:12,728 --> 00:01:14,893
And they'll show you one of the other two curtains that does not

39
00:01:14,893 --> 00:01:16,323
have the prize.

40
00:01:16,323 --> 00:01:17,848
And no matter which one you pick,

41
00:01:17,848 --> 00:01:18,525
there will always be at least

42
00:01:18,525 --> 00:01:21,049
one other curtain that does not have the prize.

43
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:22,193
There might be two if you pick right,

44
00:01:22,193 --> 00:01:23,472
but there will always be

45
00:01:23,472 --> 00:01:24,414
at least one other curtain

46
00:01:24,414 --> 00:01:25,795
that does not have the prize.

47
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:27,432
And then they will show it to you.

48
00:01:27,432 --> 00:01:28,898
And so let's say that they

49
00:01:28,898 --> 00:01:29,593
show you curtain number three,

50
00:01:29,593 --> 00:01:33,541
and that curtain number three has the goat.

51
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:35,344
And then they will ask you,

52
00:01:35,344 --> 00:01:42,031
do you want to switch to curtain number two,

53
00:01:42,031 --> 00:01:43,749
and the question here is,

54
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:45,095
does it make a difference?

55
00:01:45,095 --> 00:01:46,798
Are you better off holding fast,

56
00:01:46,798 --> 00:01:49,950
sticking to your guns, staying with your original guess,

57
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,844
or are you better off switching

58
00:01:51,844 --> 00:01:53,748
to whatever curtain is left,

59
00:01:53,748 --> 00:01:55,401
or does it not matter,

60
00:01:55,401 --> 00:01:57,166
it's just random probability and

61
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:58,177
it's not going to make a difference

62
00:01:58,177 --> 00:01:59,729
whether you switch or not.

63
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:01,530
So that is the brain teaser.

64
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,678
Start - pause the video now,

65
00:02:04,678 --> 00:02:05,883
I encourage you to think about it.

66
00:02:05,883 --> 00:02:07,102
In the next video,

67
00:02:07,102 --> 00:02:08,967
we will start to analyze the solution

68
00:02:08,967 --> 00:02:10,529
a little bit deeper.

69
00:02:10,529 --> 00:02:12,367
Whether it makes any difference at all.

70
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,624
So now I've assumed that you've unpaused it,

71
00:02:15,624 --> 00:02:17,027
that you've thought deeply about it,

72
00:02:17,027 --> 00:02:18,915
perhaps you have an opinion about it,

73
00:02:18,915 --> 00:02:20,336
now let's work it through a little bit.

74
00:02:20,336 --> 00:02:21,368
And at any point,

75
00:02:21,368 --> 00:02:22,537
I encourage you to pause it,

76
00:02:22,537 --> 00:02:23,299
and kind of extrapolate beyond

77
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:25,202
what I've already talked about.

78
00:02:25,202 --> 00:02:27,420
So let's think about the game show from

79
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,249
the show's point of view.

80
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,735
So the show knows

81
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:32,061
where there is a goat and

82
00:02:32,061 --> 00:02:33,119
where there isn't a goat.

83
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,320
So that's door number one,

84
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,913
door number two, and door number three.

85
00:02:37,913 --> 00:02:39,983
So let's say that our prize is

86
00:02:39,983 --> 00:02:42,130
right over here.

87
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:45,037
So our prize is the car.

88
00:02:45,037 --> 00:02:46,931
Our prize is the car and we have

89
00:02:46,931 --> 00:02:50,006
a goat over here, goat over here and

90
00:02:50,006 --> 00:02:52,632
over here we also have, we have two goats

91
00:02:52,632 --> 00:02:54,200
in this situation.

92
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,069
So what are we going to do as a game show

93
00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:57,051
remember, the contestants don't know this

94
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,316
we know this.

95
00:02:58,316 --> 00:03:01,101
So the contestant picks door number one

96
00:03:01,101 --> 00:03:02,633
right over here,

97
00:03:02,633 --> 00:03:04,186
then we can't lift door number two

98
00:03:04,186 --> 00:03:05,548
cause there's a car back there.

99
00:03:05,548 --> 00:03:06,787
We're going to lift door number three

100
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:08,735
and we're going to expose

101
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:10,094
we're going to expose

102
00:03:10,094 --> 00:03:11,503
this goat, in which case it probably

103
00:03:11,503 --> 00:03:14,879
would be good for the person to switch.

104
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,651
If the person picks door number two,

105
00:03:19,651 --> 00:03:21,537
then, we as the game show,

106
00:03:21,537 --> 00:03:23,635
can show either door number one or

107
00:03:23,635 --> 00:03:25,271
door number three,

108
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:26,597
and then it actually does not make sense

109
00:03:26,597 --> 00:03:28,204
for the person to switch.

110
00:03:28,204 --> 00:03:30,431
If they picked door number three,

111
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:33,823
then we have to show door number one

112
00:03:33,823 --> 00:03:35,500
because we can't pick door number two

113
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,669
and in that case, it actually makes a lot of sense

114
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:41,584
for the person to switch.

115
00:03:41,584 --> 00:03:42,940
Now, with that out of the way,

116
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,334
let's think of the probabilities

117
00:03:44,334 --> 00:03:46,007
given the two strategies.

118
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:47,705
So if you don't switch,

119
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:50,913
Don't switch

120
00:03:50,913 --> 00:03:53,032
Or another way to think about this strategy is

121
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,412
you always stick to your guns

122
00:03:54,412 --> 00:03:56,620
you always stick to your first guess.

123
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,957
Well, in that situation,

124
00:03:57,957 --> 00:03:59,807
what is your probability,

125
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:01,866
what is your probability of winning.

126
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,792
Well, there are three doors,

127
00:04:03,792 --> 00:04:05,790
the prize is equally likely to be

128
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,290
behind any of them,

129
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,800
so there are three possibilities.

130
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,332
One has the outcome that you desire.

131
00:04:10,332 --> 00:04:12,305
The probability of winning will be one third

132
00:04:12,305 --> 00:04:14,256
if you don't switch.

133
00:04:14,256 --> 00:04:18,763
Likewise, your probability of losing

134
00:04:18,763 --> 00:04:20,492
well, there are two ways you can lose

135
00:04:20,492 --> 00:04:21,298
out of three possibilities,

136
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:23,025
going to be two thirds.

137
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:24,377
And these are the only possibilities,

138
00:04:24,377 --> 00:04:25,365
and these add up to one over here.

139
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,712
So don't switch, one third chance of winning.

140
00:04:27,712 --> 00:04:30,803
Now let's think about the switching situation.

141
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:35,082
So let's say always, when you always switch

142
00:04:35,082 --> 00:04:39,361
let's think about how this might play out.

143
00:04:39,361 --> 00:04:43,930
What is your probability of winning;

144
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,585
and before we can think about that,

145
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,194
think about how you would win

146
00:04:47,194 --> 00:04:48,791
if you always switched.

147
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,878
So if you picked wrong the first time,

148
00:04:50,878 --> 00:04:52,708
if you picked wrong the first time,

149
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,324
they're going to show you this

150
00:04:54,324 --> 00:04:55,494
so you should always switch.

151
00:04:55,494 --> 00:04:56,673
So if you picked door number one,

152
00:04:56,673 --> 00:04:58,226
they're going to show you door number three

153
00:04:58,226 --> 00:04:59,729
you should switch!

154
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:00,846
If you picked wrong door number three,

155
00:05:00,846 --> 00:05:02,913
they're going to show you door number one

156
00:05:02,913 --> 00:05:04,539
you should switch!

157
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:06,955
If you picked wrong and switch,

158
00:05:06,955 --> 00:05:09,739
you will always win!

159
00:05:09,739 --> 00:05:11,646
Let me write this down.

160
00:05:11,646 --> 00:05:12,919
And this insight actually came from

161
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:14,614
one of the middle school students

162
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:15,573
in the summer camp that

163
00:05:15,573 --> 00:05:16,402
Khan Academy's running,

164
00:05:16,402 --> 00:05:17,371
it's actually a fabulous way

165
00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:18,966
to think about this.

166
00:05:18,966 --> 00:05:19,981
So if you pick wrong,

167
00:05:19,981 --> 00:05:22,253
so if it's step one: initial pick is wrong

168
00:05:22,253 --> 00:05:27,583
Initial pick is wrong.

169
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:28,753
So you pick one of the two

170
00:05:28,753 --> 00:05:29,885
wrong doors.

171
00:05:29,885 --> 00:05:31,315
And then step two, you always switch

172
00:05:31,315 --> 00:05:35,903
You always switch.

173
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:38,196
You will land on the car,

174
00:05:38,196 --> 00:05:39,786
because if you pick one of the wrong doors,

175
00:05:39,786 --> 00:05:41,919
they have to show the other wrong door,

176
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,064
and so if you switch you are going to end up

177
00:05:44,064 --> 00:05:45,637
on the right answer.

178
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,184
So what is the probability of winning

179
00:05:47,184 --> 00:05:48,320
if you always switch?

180
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,474
Well, it's going to be the probability

181
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,151
that you initially picked wrong.

182
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:52,330
Well, what's the probability that you

183
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,917
initially picked wrong?

184
00:05:53,917 --> 00:05:55,841
Well, there are two out of three ways

185
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:57,259
to initially pick wrong.

186
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:59,480
So you actually have a two-thirds chance

187
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,735
of winning.

188
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:01,847
There's a two-thirds chance you

189
00:06:01,847 --> 00:06:02,579
are going to pick wrong,

190
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:04,783
and are going to switch into the right one.

191
00:06:04,783 --> 00:06:07,723
Likewise, what's your probability of losing?

192
00:06:07,723 --> 00:06:09,390
What's your probability of losing, given

193
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,852
that you're always going to switch?

194
00:06:11,852 --> 00:06:13,838
Well, the way that you would lose is

195
00:06:13,838 --> 00:06:17,177
you pick right,

196
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:19,801
you pick correctly,

197
00:06:19,801 --> 00:06:21,256
in step two they're going to show an empty,

198
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,539
they're going to show one of the two empty,

199
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:24,980
or non-prized doors,

200
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,487
and then in step three you are going to

201
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:29,705
switch into the other empty,

202
00:06:29,705 --> 00:06:34,120
Switch into the other empty door.

203
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,797
But either way, you are definitely going to switch,

204
00:06:35,797 --> 00:06:36,980
so the only way to lose if you're

205
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,972
always going to switch

206
00:06:37,972 --> 00:06:40,410
is to pick right the first time.

207
00:06:40,426 --> 00:06:42,631
Well what's the probability of you

208
00:06:42,631 --> 00:06:44,104
picking right the first time?

209
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:46,044
Well that is only one-third.

210
00:06:46,044 --> 00:06:47,707
So what you see here is sometimes

211
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:48,607
counterintuitive, but hopefully

212
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:50,476
this makes sense as to why it isn't.

213
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:53,361
You have a one-third chance of winning

214
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:54,918
if you stick to your guns,

215
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:56,620
and a two-thirds chance of winning

216
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,228
if you always switch.

217
00:06:58,228 --> 00:06:59,973
Another way to think about it is,

218
00:06:59,973 --> 00:07:02,069
when you first make your initial pick,

219
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:06,961
there's a one-third chance that it's there,

220
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:10,494
and there's a two-thirds chance

221
00:07:10,494 --> 00:07:12,565
that it's in one of the other two doors.

222
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,114
And they're going to empty out

223
00:07:14,114 --> 00:07:15,247
one of them, so when you switch,

224
00:07:15,247 --> 00:07:16,767
you essentially are capturing that

225
00:07:16,767 --> 00:07:18,461
two-third probability.

226
00:07:18,461 --> 00:07:20,208
And we see that right there.

227
00:07:20,208 --> 99:59:59,999
So hopefully you enjoyed that.
