1
00:00:00,644 --> 00:00:04,311
I now want to re-figure out what this mystery mass is,

2
00:00:04,311 --> 00:00:08,448
but we're going to start using a little bit more of mathematics.

3
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:13,652
And mathematics really are just a language of symbols for representing ideas --

4
00:00:13,652 --> 00:00:16,422
for representing relationships between things.

5
00:00:16,422 --> 00:00:21,373
And so the first thing I want you to do is think about if you can express a relationship mathematically

6
00:00:21,373 --> 00:00:25,104
between this side of the scale and that side of the scale.

7
00:00:25,104 --> 00:00:25,604
And I'll give you some hints:

8
00:00:25,604 --> 00:00:31,724
we know that they have equal mass, so maybe you set some type of relationship using an equal sign --

9
00:00:31,724 --> 00:00:40,035
somehow showing that this right over here is equal to that and I'll give you a few seconds to do that.

10
00:00:40,035 --> 00:00:43,384
So let's think about it a little bit. What do we have on this side?

11
00:00:43,384 --> 00:00:44,318
Well, we have our mystery mass,

12
00:00:44,318 --> 00:00:50,034
and I'll represent that mystery mass by the question mark - right over here.

13
00:00:50,034 --> 00:00:55,780
But that's not the only thing we have on the left hand side: we also have these other three kilograms.

14
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,018
So let me write over here, I'll just add, we'll assume that we're dealing with kilograms.

15
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:06,264
So we have the mystery mass in kg plus three more kg. That's what we have here on the left hand side.

16
00:01:06,264 --> 00:01:14,559
Now what do we have here on the right hand side. Well just have 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 kg.

17
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:19,704
So we just have 10 on the right hand side.

18
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:21,389
And what else do we know?

19
00:01:21,389 --> 00:01:23,472
Well, we know that the scale is balanced --

20
00:01:23,472 --> 00:01:30,109
that the mass here is equal to the mass here, because the scale is balanced, the way it's been drawn.

21
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:34,909
We know that these two things are equal.

22
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:39,473
So we have just set up an equation. We're using question mark as our unknown.

23
00:01:39,488 --> 00:01:42,025
We don't know what this mystery mass is.

24
00:01:42,025 --> 00:01:48,761
If we add 3 kg to it, then we see that it has the exact same mass as 10 kg.

25
00:01:48,761 --> 00:01:52,830
Now my question to you is, what can we do to this equation

26
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,742
so that we can essentially solve for the unknown,

27
00:01:55,742 --> 00:02:01,875
so that we can figure out what the unknown is.

28
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:05,736
Well we saw in the last little problem that we had

29
00:02:05,736 --> 00:02:07,491
that if we wanted to figure out this mystery mass

30
00:02:07,491 --> 00:02:10,695
we had to remove, 3 of these, 3 kg from both sides.

31
00:02:10,695 --> 00:02:14,494
If we just removed 3 kg from one side

32
00:02:14,494 --> 00:02:15,728
then the scale wouldn't be balanced any more.

33
00:02:15,728 --> 00:02:17,443
And we really wouldn't be able to say that the mystery mass

34
00:02:17,443 --> 00:02:19,061
is equal to the thing on the right.

35
00:02:19,061 --> 00:02:22,372
In order to say they're equal this stuff actually has to actually be balanced.

36
00:02:22,372 --> 00:02:30,224
So in the last video, we removed three of these, we removed three kg from both sides

37
00:02:30,224 --> 00:02:32,994
in order to keep the scale balanced.

38
00:02:32,994 --> 00:02:36,095
So mathematically we'll do the exact same thing over here.

39
00:02:36,095 --> 00:02:39,111
We will remove 3 not from side --

40
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:42,707
if we remove three from one side then it wouldn't be equal anymore --

41
00:02:42,707 --> 00:02:46,024
we need to remove three from both sides.

42
00:02:46,024 --> 00:02:49,622
So we need to remove three, we need subtract three,

43
00:02:49,622 --> 00:02:53,879
from both sides of the equation in order to keep the scale balanced.

44
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,214
So on the left hand side, what are we left with?

45
00:02:56,214 --> 00:02:59,343
Well, just like over here, we're left with just the question mark.

46
00:02:59,343 --> 00:03:01,463
Three minus three is zero.

47
00:03:01,463 --> 00:03:04,589
So on the left hand side we're left with just the question mark.

48
00:03:04,589 --> 00:03:10,073
And on the right hand side, we're left with ten minus three which is seven.

49
00:03:10,073 --> 00:03:12,664
10 - 3 which is 7.

50
00:03:12,664 --> 00:03:17,418
And we get the exact same result: question mark is equal to seven.

51
00:03:17,418 --> 99:59:59,999
And if we're doing it in kg then this is seven kg.
