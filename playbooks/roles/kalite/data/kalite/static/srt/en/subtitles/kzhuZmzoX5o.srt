1
00:00:01,339 --> 00:00:05,708
Arturo Potori here, but you can call me Art.

2
00:00:05,708 --> 00:00:11,056
This is explorations in art history starring me!

3
00:00:11,081 --> 00:00:14,516
And, the hand.

4
00:00:14,516 --> 00:00:18,688
Well, without the rest of me, how embarrassing,

5
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:23,460
people watching from around the world and I'm stuck waiting on some five-fingered prima donna.

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:33,201
Oh, well that's better. It looks like we'll be talking about the Renaissance Period.

7
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:38,512
During the medieval period, the torch lit by the Greeks, carried on by the Romans, had been rejected,

8
00:00:38,512 --> 00:00:44,117
Medieval values instead elevated the spiritual and denounced the flesh.

9
00:00:44,117 --> 00:00:49,854
Then, in the mid-14th century, Petrarch, an Italian poet and scholar of Latin,

10
00:00:49,854 --> 00:00:55,626
was able to reconcile Christianity and classical Roman and Greek thought in his writings,

11
00:00:55,626 --> 00:01:00,197
and revive interest in what had been dismissed as the pagan past.

12
00:01:00,197 --> 00:01:05,135
This started the period called the Renaissance, or rebirth.

13
00:01:05,135 --> 00:01:13,508
The shift of focus from god-centered toward human-centered interest became known as Humanism.

14
00:01:13,508 --> 00:01:18,348
Of course, there wouldn't have been much of a Renaissance without a Renaissance man or two,

15
00:01:18,348 --> 00:01:21,663
a man with expertise in many fields.

16
00:01:21,663 --> 00:01:27,498
Take Brunelleschi, who was a goldsmith, architect, engineer, sculptor and mathematician.

17
00:01:27,498 --> 00:01:35,646
As an artist, he discovered the principles of linear perspective, which gives the illusion of 3-dimensional space, to 2-dimensional art.

18
00:01:35,646 --> 00:01:42,274
Start with the horizon line, add a vanishing point, and then lines that converge to that vanishing point.

19
00:01:42,274 --> 00:01:48,025
Now you have a framework for making objects appear farther away. Or closer.

20
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:53,165
Of course, Brunelleschi was most famous for his massive dome. No, not that dome.

21
00:01:53,165 --> 00:01:58,889
The dome he built for the Florence Cathedral, equal in size to the dome of the Pantheon.

22
00:01:58,889 --> 00:02:04,726
Brunelleschi's new method of construction was so different that some Florentines wondered if he was mad!

23
00:02:04,726 --> 00:02:09,798
He devised a way to build the dome without scaffolding, and without using flying buttresses,

24
00:02:09,798 --> 00:02:14,536
commonly used in Gothic architecture to support the weight of large structures.

25
00:02:14,536 --> 00:02:19,509
Sixteen years later when the dome was completed, it was recognized as a marvel of the era,

26
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:25,355
and Brunelleschi was heralded as a genius.

27
00:02:26,617 --> 00:02:29,452
Donatello also started as a goldsmith.

28
00:02:29,452 --> 00:02:32,831
No, no, no, no, Donatello was not a crime-fighting turtle,

29
00:02:32,831 --> 00:02:38,194
but Donatello did study the old Roman styles of sculpture and ornamentation.

30
00:02:38,194 --> 00:02:43,602
His David is famous as the first free-standing bronze sculpture cast during the Renaissance.

31
00:02:43,602 --> 00:02:49,005
It depicts David as the beautiful youth of the Bible, just after decapitating the giant Goliath,

32
00:02:49,005 --> 00:02:53,497
and uses classical techniques like contrapposto in its design.

33
00:02:53,497 --> 00:02:59,116
Donatello also developed a new way of sculpting in shallow relief, that applied the rules of linear perspective

34
00:02:59,116 --> 00:03:02,150
to create a greater illusion of depth.

35
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,135
He would have been hailed as the most accomplished sculptor of the Renaissance,

36
00:03:06,135 --> 00:03:08,431
if not for the coming of Michelangelo,

37
00:03:08,431 --> 00:03:13,522
who, along with da Vinci and Raphael kicked the art world into high gear for the High Renaissance.

38
00:03:13,522 --> 00:03:22,748
Perhaps no one exemplifies the ideal of the Renaissance man more than Leonardo da Vinci.

39
00:03:22,748 --> 00:03:29,879
No, Renaissance man was not a superhero. Really, read your history.

40
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:36,018
Leonardo was a talented painter, sculptor, scientist, architect, and even a military engineer.

41
00:03:36,018 --> 00:03:40,090
He painted the most famous portrait in the world, the Mona Lisa.

42
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:45,596
His boundless curiosity was best exemplified by his notebooks, which were filled with inventions,

43
00:03:45,596 --> 00:03:49,901
like a tank, flying machine, and a parachute.

44
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:57,507
In 1482, Leonardo went to Milan where he painted his famous mural, The Last Supper, on the wall of a monastery.

45
00:03:57,507 --> 00:04:02,914
He chose to portray the emotional moment when Jesus predicts that one of the apostles will betray him,

46
00:04:02,914 --> 00:04:06,716
and the betrayer will take bread at the same time he does.

47
00:04:06,716 --> 00:04:12,855
The apostles react in different degrees of surprise and horror, except for Judas, who, distracted by the commotion,

48
00:04:12,855 --> 00:04:16,491
reaches for a piece of bread.

49
00:04:16,491 --> 00:04:20,896
Leonardo used perspective lines as a compositional device that leads the eye to Jesus' face,

50
00:04:20,896 --> 00:04:24,065
the calm center of the chaos.

51
00:04:24,065 --> 00:04:29,581
Though The Last Supper had been painted by others, Leonardo's was the first to depict the apostles as

52
00:04:29,581 --> 00:04:36,748
acting, or reacting, like real people.

53
00:04:36,748 --> 00:04:43,085
Now we come to Michelangelo. You think we can do this one straight? Ok.

54
00:04:43,085 --> 00:04:48,393
At 24, Michelangelo carved the famous Pieta, which in Italian, means pity.

55
00:04:48,393 --> 00:04:54,030
The Pieta depicts the body Jesus on his mother Mary's lap, as she mourns his death by crucifixion,

56
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:59,081
and combines the Renaissance ideals classical beauty and realism.

57
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:03,831
Shortly after installing the Pieta, Michelangelo overheard someone say that the sculpture

58
00:05:03,831 --> 00:05:05,914
was the work of another artist.

59
00:05:05,914 --> 00:05:08,211
That night Michelangelo chiseled the words,

60
00:05:08,211 --> 00:05:14,081
"Michelangelo Bourinati Florentine made this" across the sash running across Mary's breast.

61
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:17,386
Later, Michelangelo regretted this act. It was the only

62
00:05:17,386 --> 00:05:21,425
statue he ever signed. Michelangelo was reluctant to accept the commision

63
00:05:21,425 --> 00:05:26,229
to paint the Sistine chapel, but Pope Julius II insisted.

64
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:30,700
Contrary to popular belief, Michelangelo did not lay on his back to paint,

65
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,004
but stood on specially designed scaffolding and had to reach upward

66
00:05:34,004 --> 00:05:38,413
craning his neck awkwardly to paint. Fresco required painting in to a newly

67
00:05:38,413 --> 00:05:41,712
applied layer of wet plaster, and Michelangelo, also a

68
00:05:41,712 --> 00:05:46,049
poet, complained in a letter to a friend, "My beard turns up to heaven

69
00:05:46,049 --> 00:05:50,253
my nape falls in, a rich embroidery bedews my face,

70
00:05:50,253 --> 00:05:53,756
from brushstrokes thick and thin." Four years later the arduous

71
00:05:53,756 --> 00:06:01,248
task was done, and a masterpiece created.

72
00:06:01,248 --> 00:06:05,914
The paintings of the Sistine Chapel had a profound effect on other artists. One story

73
00:06:05,914 --> 00:06:09,438
claims that Raphael slipped into the chapel to examine the paintings

74
00:06:09,438 --> 00:06:15,019
when Michelangelo was absent. "Mamma mia!

75
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:16,648
What's the matter with me? It's back to the drawing board."

76
00:06:16,648 --> 00:06:21,256
Raphael scraped the fresco he was working on off the wall and repainted it.

77
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:25,287
Imititating the more powerful style of Michelangelo. Raphael became

78
00:06:25,287 --> 00:06:29,059
a favorite of the Pope, and was commissioned to paint other rooms in the Vatican.

79
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:32,629
His greatest masterpiece, The School of Athens, portrays Plato,

80
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:36,733
Aristotle and other Greek philosophers, mathematicians, scientists, from

81
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:41,438
classical antiquity, sharing their ideas, learning from each other.

82
00:06:41,438 --> 00:06:45,082
It's a kind of intellectual fantasy gathering, since these figures

83
00:06:45,082 --> 00:06:48,914
all lived at different times, and it shows that Humanism had become

84
00:06:48,914 --> 00:06:52,830
accepted in the church. Raphael even included himself standing

85
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:57,020
with the astronomers. Sounds like my kind of party, Plato,

86
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:03,092
Aristotle, Arturo, huh?

87
00:07:03,092 --> 00:07:04,293
Oh. We haven't mentioned the

88
00:07:04,293 --> 00:07:08,663
Northern Renaissance. No, no, no, Leonardo, Michelangelo,

89
00:07:08,663 --> 00:07:12,468
and Raphael did not go North for a skiing trip. Sorry folks,

90
00:07:12,468 --> 00:07:17,081
you'll have to excuse the hand today, it's just that, well, for many, the Renaissance

91
00:07:17,081 --> 00:07:20,509
was an intoxicating time. Ok, so what happened in Italy

92
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:24,782
didn't stay in Italy. The ideas of the Renaissance migrated

93
00:07:24,782 --> 00:07:28,248
up into the rest of Europe, and started what was called the Northern Renaissance.

94
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:32,664
Jan van Eyck pioneered the techniques of painting with oil

95
00:07:32,664 --> 00:07:36,164
based paints on wooden panels. Artists of the North had a

96
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:40,230
fondness for meticulous detail, and were more interested in realism than

97
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:44,233
classicism. Albrecht Dürer traveled to Italy and was friends with

98
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:48,164
Raphael and other artists of the Renaissance. He was able to incorporate the

99
00:07:48,164 --> 00:07:51,941
Italian and Northern ideas into his paintings and prints.

100
00:07:51,941 --> 00:07:55,812
He became one of the most influential artists of printmaking, and elevated this

101
00:07:55,812 --> 00:07:59,983
relatively art form to new levels of aesthetic quality and

102
00:07:59,983 --> 00:08:03,832
popularity.

103
00:08:03,832 --> 00:08:08,258
After the death of Leonardo in 1519 and Raphael in 1520

104
00:08:08,258 --> 00:08:11,331
artists rejected the values of the High Renaissance for

105
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:16,432
a more heightened or more mannered approach. Mannerists like Tito and

106
00:08:16,432 --> 00:08:19,970
Regel created unbalanced compositions that gave for visual tension

107
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,614
to the work. Tintoreto's painting of The Last Supper shifts the table

108
00:08:23,614 --> 00:08:27,709
from the center to the left side, and emphasizes dramatic lighting and

109
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:31,614
motion to increase the drama of the image. Mannerist artists also

110
00:08:31,614 --> 00:08:35,718
intentionally distorted and stylized the human body and spatial relationships

111
00:08:35,718 --> 00:08:39,754
like this painting of the Madonna, by Parmegianino.

112
00:08:39,754 --> 00:08:43,359
The figures are elongated, and instead of balancing the angels on either side

113
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:47,029
of Mary, they are deliberately squeezed into the left side with only a tiny

114
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:51,498
Saint Jerome on the right. Oww, how does she

115
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:54,871
do it!

116
00:08:54,871 --> 00:08:59,209
The Renaissance was a period of great discovery, invention, and creativity

117
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:05,783
The Renaissance included the discovery of the New World by Columbus, the invention of the printing press by Gutenberg,

118
00:09:05,783 --> 00:09:09,686
the beginning of the Protestant Reformation by Martin Luther, and the scientific

119
00:09:09,686 --> 00:09:13,389
advances of Copernicus and Galileo, to name a few.

120
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:17,427
The influence of the Renaissance on Western art is ongoing, and even

121
00:09:17,427 --> 00:09:23,661
went viral without Facebook or Twitter or Youtube, because of the

122
00:09:23,661 --> 00:09:24,873
strength of its ideas, and the beauty

123
00:09:24,873 --> 00:09:35,913
of its creations.
