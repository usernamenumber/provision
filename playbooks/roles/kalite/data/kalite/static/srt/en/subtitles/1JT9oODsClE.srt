1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,360
   

2
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,180
We want to test the hypothesis
that more than 30% of U.S.

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,300
households have internet access
with a significance

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,720
level of 5%.

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,270
We collect a sample of 150
households, and find that 57

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,640
have access.

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,940
So to do our hypothesis test,
let's just establish our null

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,550
hypothesis and our alternative
hypothesis.

9
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,780
So our null hypothesis is that
the hypothesis is not correct.

10
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:30,430
Our null hypothesis is that
the proportion of U.S.

11
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,140
households that have internet
access is less

12
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,910
than or equal to 30%.

13
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,890
And our alternative hypothesis,
is what our

14
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,030
hypothesis actually is, is
that the proportion is

15
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,110
greater than 30%.

16
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:44,910
We see it over here.

17
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,980
We want to test the hypothesis
that more than 30% of U.S.

18
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,580
households have internet
access.

19
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,860
That's that right here.

20
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:52,910
This is what we're testing.

21
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,530
We're testing the alternative
hypothesis.

22
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,870
And the way we're going to do it
is we're going to assume a

23
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,950
P-value based on the
null hypothesis.

24
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,129
We're going to assume a
proportion based on the null

25
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:05,850
hypothesis for the population.

26
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,310
And the given that assumption,
what is the probability that

27
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:19,410
57 out of 150 of our samples
actually have internet access.

28
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:25,810
And if that probability is less
than 5%, if it's less

29
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:29,610
than our significance level,
then we're going to reject the

30
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,790
null hypothesis in favor
of the alternative one.

31
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,550
So let's think about
this a little bit.

32
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,580
So we're going to start off
assuming-- we're going to

33
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:42,930
assume the null hypothesis
is true.

34
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,780
And in that assumption we're
going to have to pick a

35
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,150
population proportion or a
population mean-- we know that

36
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,095
for Bernoulli distributions
do the same thing.

37
00:01:51,095 --> 00:01:53,250
And what I'm going to do is I'm
going to pick a proportion

38
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,460
so high so that it maximizes
the probability of getting

39
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,070
this over here.

40
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,710
And we actually don't even
know what that number is.

41
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,940
And actually so that we can
think about a little more

42
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,180
intelligent, let's just find
out what our sample

43
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,630
proportion even is.

44
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:10,060
We had 57 people out of 150
having internet access.

45
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,150
So 57 households out of 150.

46
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,430
So our sample proportion
is 0.38, so let me

47
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,070
write that over here.

48
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:23,870
Our sample proportion
is equal to 0.38.

49
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:28,290
So when we assume our null
hypothesis to be true, we're

50
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:39,210
going to assume a population
proportion that maximizes the

51
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,970
probability that we get
this over here.

52
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,530
So the highest population
proportion that's within our

53
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,440
null hypothesis that will
maximize the probability of

54
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,560
getting this is actually
if we are right at 30%.

55
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,910
So if we say our population
proportion, we're going to

56
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,940
assume this is true.

57
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,630
This is our null hypothesis.

58
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,160
We're going to assume that
it is 0.3 or 30%.

59
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,430
And I want you understand that--
29% would have been a

60
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,170
null hypothesis.

61
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,570
28% that would have been
a null hypothesis.

62
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,550
But for 29% or 28%, the
probability of getting this

63
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,870
would have been even lower.

64
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,870
So it wouldn't have been
as strong of a test.

65
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:16,060
If we take the maximum
proportion that still

66
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,070
satisfies our null hypothesis,
we're maximizing the

67
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,610
probability that we get this.

68
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,150
So if that number is still low,
if it's still less than

69
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,380
5%, we can feel pretty good
about the alternative

70
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,440
hypothesis.

71
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,210
So just to refresh ourselves
we're going to assume a

72
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,700
population proportion of 0.3,
and if we just think about the

73
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,660
distribution-- sometimes it's
helpful to draw these things,

74
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,890
so I will draw it.

75
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,900
So this is what the population
distribution looks like based

76
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,350
on our assumption,
based on this

77
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,360
assumption right over here.

78
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,930
Our population distribution
has-- or maybe I should write

79
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,560
30% have internet access.

80
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,740
And I'll signify
that with a 1.

81
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,585
And then the rest don't
have internet access.

82
00:03:56,585 --> 00:04:00,790
   

83
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,560
70% do not have internet
access.

84
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,070
This is just a Bernoulli
distribution.

85
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,500
We know that the mean over here
is going to be the same

86
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,390
thing as the proportion that
has internet access.

87
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:22,160
So the mean over here is going
to be 0.3, same thing as 30%.

88
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,370
This is the population mean.

89
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,510
And maybe I should
write this way.

90
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:30,850
The mean assuming our null
hypothesis, the population

91
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,510
mean assuming our null
hypothesis is 0.3.

92
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,810
And then the population
standard deviation.

93
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,510
Let me write this over
here in yellow.

94
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:43,190
The population standard
deviation assuming our null

95
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,880
hypothesis.

96
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,160
And we've seen this when we
first learned about Bernoulli

97
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,210
distributions.

98
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:58,620
It is going to be the square
root of the percentage of the

99
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,310
population that has internet
access, so 0.3 times the

100
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,470
proportion of the population
that does not have internet

101
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:09,520
access, times 0.7
right over here.

102
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,430
So this is the square
root of 0.21.

103
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,290
And we could deal with this
later using our calculator.

104
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,630
Now, with that out of the way,
we want to figure out the

105
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:25,600
probability of getting a sample

106
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,100
proportion that has a 0.38.

107
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,850
So let's look at the
distribution of sample

108
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:33,550
proportions.

109
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,160
So you could literally look at
every combination of getting

110
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,570
150 households from this, and
you would actually get a

111
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,350
binomial distribution.

112
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,780
And we've also seen
this before.

113
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,300
You would actually get a
binomial distribution where

114
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:51,010
you'd get a bunch of
bars like that.

115
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:55,530
But if your n is suitably large,
and in particular-- and

116
00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:02,670
this is kind of the test for
it-- the test if n times p--

117
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:06,190
and in this case we're saying
p is 30%-- if n times p is

118
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:11,940
greater than 5, and n times 1
minus p is greater than 5, you

119
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:16,570
can assume that the distribution
of the sample

120
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,410
proportion or the sample
proportion distribution is

121
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,220
going to be normal.

122
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,770
So if you looked at all of the
different ways you could

123
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,820
sample 150 households from this
population, you get all

124
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,790
of these bars.

125
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:30,250
But since our n is pretty big,
it's 150, and 150 times 0.3 is

126
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,550
obviously greater than 5.

127
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,210
150 times 0.7 is also
greater than 5.

128
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,375
You can approximate that with
a normal distribution.

129
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,070
So let me do that.

130
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:42,090
So you can approximate it with
a normal distribution.

131
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:48,540
So this is a normal distribution
right over there.

132
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,120
Now the mean of the distribution
of the proportion

133
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,190
data that we're assuming is a
normal distribution is going

134
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,270
to be-- and remember, working
under the context that the

135
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,500
null hypothesis is true.

136
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:04,210
So this mean is going to be--
this mean right here-- so the

137
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:11,550
mean of our sample proportions
is going to be the same thing

138
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,150
as our population mean.

139
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:18,180
So this is going to be 0.3,
same value as that.

140
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,860
And the standard deviation---
this comes straight from the

141
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,320
central limit theorem.

142
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:28,870
So the standard deviation of
our sample proportions, the

143
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:34,200
standard deviation is going to
be the square root-- let me

144
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,230
put it this way-- it's going to
be our population standard

145
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,180
deviation, the standard
deviation we're assuming with

146
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,610
our null hypothesis divided by
the square root of the number

147
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,630
of samples we have. And in this
case we have 150 samples.

148
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,320
It's going to be 150 samples
and we can calculate this.

149
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,370
This value on top we just
figured out is the

150
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,610
square root of 0.21.

151
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,770
So this is the square root
of 0.21 over the

152
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:05,270
square root of 150.

153
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:09,150
And I can get the calculator
out to calculate this.

154
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,825
So I'll just do it the
way I wrote it.

155
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:19,890
The square root of 0.21-- and
I'm going to divide that, so

156
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,630
whatever answer is I'm going to
divide that by the square

157
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:26,320
root of 150.

158
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,320
So it's 0.037.

159
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,630
So we figured out the standard
deviation here of our-- or the

160
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:38,100
distribution of our sample
proportions is going to be--

161
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,120
let me write this down, I'll
scroll over to the right a

162
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,580
little bit-- it is 0.037.

163
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,150
I think I'm falling off the
screen a little bit.

164
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,770
So we'll just say 0.037.

165
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:54,360
Now to figure out the
probability of having a sample

166
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,270
proportion of 0.38, we just have
to figure out how many

167
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:02,420
standard deviations that is
away from our mean, or

168
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:07,140
essentially calculate a
Z-statistic for our sample,

169
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,650
because a Z-statistic or a
Z-score is really just how

170
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,100
many standard deviations you
are away from the mean.

171
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,600
And then figure out whether
the probability of getting

172
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:20,310
that Z-statistic is more
or less than 5%.

173
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,350
So let's figure out how many
standard deviations we are

174
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,360
away from the mean.

175
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,640
So just remind ourselves, this
sample proportion we got we

176
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,880
can view as just a sample from
this distribution of all of

177
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,220
the possible sample
proportions.

178
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,670
So how many standard
deviations away

179
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,110
from the mean is this?

180
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:40,540
So if we take our sample
proportion, subtract from that

181
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,820
the mean of the distribution
of sample proportions and

182
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,480
divide it by the standard
deviation of the distribution

183
00:09:49,480 --> 00:10:00,360
of the sample proportions, we
get 0.38, 0.38 minus 0.3.

184
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,290
All of that over this
value which we just

185
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:06,190
figured out was 0.037.

186
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,180
So what does that give us?

187
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:13,460
The numerator over
here is a 0.08.

188
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:17,120
The denominator is 0.037.

189
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,240
So let's figure this out.

190
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,910
So our numerator is 0.08 divided
by this last number

191
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,520
right here, which
is the 0.037.

192
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:32,660
So second answer and we get
2.1-- I'll just round it to

193
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,650
2.14 standard deviations.

194
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:43,460
So this is equal to-- this right
here is equal to 2.14

195
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,250
standard deviations.

196
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,430
Or we could say that our
Z-statistic, right, we could

197
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,350
call this our Z-score or our
Z-statistic, the number of

198
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:56,540
standard deviations we are away
from our mean is 2.14.

199
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,020
We're at 2.14, and to be exact,
we're 2.14 standard

200
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,800
deviations above the mean.

201
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,620
We're going to care about a
one-tailed distribution.

202
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,970
Now is the probability
of getting this more

203
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,530
or less than 5%?

204
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:12,490
If it's less than 5% we're
going to reject the null

205
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:15,160
hypothesis in favor of
our alternative.

206
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,740
So how do we think about that?

207
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,580
Well let's think about just
a normalized normal

208
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,450
distribution.

209
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,330
Or maybe you could call the
Z-distribution if you want.

210
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,950
If you look at a normal
distribution, a completely

211
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,320
normalized normal distribution,

212
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,570
it's mean is at 0.

213
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:33,040
   

214
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,730
And essentially each
of these values

215
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,440
are essentially Z-scores.

216
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,130
Because a value of 1 literally
means you are 1 standard

217
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:43,140
deviation away from this
mean over here.

218
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:49,120
So we need to find a critical
Z-value right over here.

219
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:55,770
Let me call that a critical Z--
we could even say critical

220
00:11:55,770 --> 00:12:00,930
Z-score or critical Z-value--
so that the probability of

221
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:04,450
getting a Z-value higher
than that is 5%.

222
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:08,540
So that this whole area
right here is 5%.

223
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,480
And that's because that's what
our significance level is.

224
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,450
Anything that has a lower than
5% a chance of occurring, for

225
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:19,150
us will be validation to reject
our null hypothesis.

226
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,830
Or another way of thinking about
it is that area's 5%,

227
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:26,870
this whole area right
over here is 95%.

228
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,690
And once again, this is a
one-tailed test, because we

229
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,990
only care about values
greater than this.

230
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,890
Z-values greater than that will
make us reject the null

231
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:35,870
hypothesis.

232
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,700
And to figure out this critical
Z-value you can

233
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,590
literally just go
to a Z-table.

234
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:44,210
And we say OK, the probability
of being a Z-value less than

235
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,650
that is 95%.

236
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,440
And that's exactly the number
that this gives us.

237
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,090
The cumulative probability
of getting a

238
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,800
value less than that.

239
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,800
So if we just scan this,
we're looking for 95%.

240
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,610
We have 0.9495, we
have 0.9505.

241
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,330
So I'll go with this just
to make sure we're

242
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,490
a little bit closer.

243
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:07,060
So this Z-value, and the z-value
here is 1.6, and the

244
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,550
next digit is 5.

245
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,260
1.6 5.

246
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:15,380
So this critical Z-value
is equal to 1.65.

247
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:23,910
So the probability of getting
a Z-value less than 1.65, or

248
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,730
even in a completely
normalized normal

249
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,720
distribution, the probability
of getting a

250
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,310
value less than 1.65.

251
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:33,570
Or in any normal distribution,
the probability of being less

252
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:37,790
than 1.65 standard deviations
away from the mean

253
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,620
is going to be 95%.

254
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,800
So that's our critical
Z-value.

255
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,200
Now does Z-value, or the
Z-statistic, for our actual

256
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,140
sample is 2.14.

257
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,940
Our actual Z-value
we got is 2.14.

258
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,140
It's sitting all the way
out here some place.

259
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,710
So the probability of
getting that was

260
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,135
definitely less than 5%.

261
00:13:59,135 --> 00:14:01,050
And actually we could even say
what's the probability of

262
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,360
getting that or a more
extreme result.

263
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,720
And if you figured out this
area, and you could actually

264
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,760
figure it out by looking at a
Z-table, you could figure out

265
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,980
the P-value of this result.

266
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,160
But anyway, the whole exercise
here is just to figure out if

267
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,810
can reject the null hypothesis
with a significance level 5%.

268
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:18,890
We can.

269
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:22,250
This is a more extreme result
than our critical Z-value, so

270
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:28,240
we can reject the null
hypothesis in favor of our

271
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,490
alternative.

272
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:29,999
