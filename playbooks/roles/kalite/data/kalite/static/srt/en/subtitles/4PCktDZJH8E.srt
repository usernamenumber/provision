1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,240
   

2
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,570
You now know what a
transformation is, so let's

3
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:10,120
introduce a special kind of
transformation called a linear

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,450
transformation.

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,940
It only makes sense that we have
something called a linear

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,400
transformation because we're
studying linear algebra.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,530
We already had linear
combinations so we might as

8
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,370
well have a linear
transformation.

9
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,110
And a linear transformation,
by definition, is a

10
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,730
transformation-- which we
know is just a function.

11
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:35,260
We could say it's from the set
rn to rm -- It might be

12
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,080
obvious in the next video why
I'm being a little bit

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,930
particular about that, although
they are just

14
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,540
arbitrary letters -- where
the following two

15
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,800
things have to be true.

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,490
So something is a linear
transformation if and only if

17
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,870
the following thing is true.

18
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:57,140
Let's say that we have
two vectors.

19
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,990
Say vector a and let's
say vector b, are

20
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,780
both members of rn.

21
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,820
So they're both in our domain.

22
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,660
So then this is a linear
transformation if and only if

23
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,070
I take the transformation of
the sum of our two vectors.

24
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,080
If I add them up first, that's
equivalent to taking the

25
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,900
transformation of each of the
vectors and then summing them.

26
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,100
That's my first condition
for this to be a linear

27
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:28,840
transformation.

28
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,280
And the second one is, if I take
the transformation of any

29
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,420
scaled up version of a vector
-- so let me just multiply

30
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:40,550
vector a times some scalar
or some real number c .

31
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,490
If this is a linear
transformation then this

32
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:48,500
should be equal to c times
the transformation of a.

33
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,080
That seems pretty
straightforward.

34
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,940
Let's see if we can apply these
rules to figure out if

35
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,100
some actual transformations
are linear or not.

36
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,790
So let me define a
transformation.

37
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,800
Let's say that I have the
transformation T.

38
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:10,199
Part of my definition I'm going
to tell you, it maps

39
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,500
from r2 to r2.

40
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,710
   

41
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,060
So if you give it a
2-tuple, right?

42
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,270
Its domain is 2-tuple.

43
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:25,230
So you give it an x1 and an x2
let's say it maps to, so this

44
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:36,260
will be equal to, or it's
associated with x1 plus x2.

45
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,490
And then let's just say it's 3
times x1 is the second tuple.

46
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,330
Or we could have written this
more in vector form.

47
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,950
This is kind of our
tuple form.

48
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,710
We could have written it -- and
it's good to see all the

49
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,500
different notations that you
might encounter -- you could

50
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,390
write it a transformation of
some vector x, where the

51
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:56,970
vector looks like
this, x1, x2.

52
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,610
Let me put a bracket there.

53
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:05,230
It equals some new vector,
x1 plus x2.

54
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,930
And then the second component
of the new

55
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,160
vector would be 3x1.

56
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,880
That's a completely legitimate
way to express our

57
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,450
transformation.

58
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,490
And a third way, which I never
see, but to me it kind of

59
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,760
captures the essence of what
a transformation is.

60
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,200
It's just a mapping or
it's just a function.

61
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,640
We could say that the
transformation is a mapping

62
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:32,470
from any vector in r2 that looks
like this: x1, x2, to--

63
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,620
and I'll do this notation-- a
vector that looks like this.

64
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,710
x1 plus x2 and then 3x1.

65
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,770
All of these statements
are equivalent.

66
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,870
But our whole point of writing
this is to figure out whether

67
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,420
T is linearly independent.

68
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,590
Sorry, not linearly
independent.

69
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,250
Whether it's a linear
transformation.

70
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,240
I was so obsessed with linear
independence for so many

71
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,260
videos, it's hard to get it out
of my brain in this one.

72
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,560
Whether it's a linear
transformation.

73
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,530
So let's test our
two conditions.

74
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,070
I have them up here.

75
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:08,230
So let's take T of, let's say
I have to vectors a and b.

76
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,660
They're members of r2.

77
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,530
So let me write it.

78
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:23,570
A is equal to a1, a2, and
b is equal to b1, b2.

79
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,795
Sorry that's not a vector.

80
00:04:24,795 --> 00:04:26,630
I have to make sure that
those are scalars.

81
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,100
These are the components
of a vector.

82
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,060
And b2.

83
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,670
So what is a1 plus b?

84
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:37,110
Sorry, what is vector
a plus vector b?

85
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,970
Brain's malfunctioning.

86
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:39,590
All right.

87
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,750
Well, you just add up
their components.

88
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,010
This is the definition
of vector addition.

89
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,290
So it's a1 plus b1.

90
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,270
Add up the first components.

91
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,800
And the second components is
just the sum of each of the

92
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,220
vector's second compnents.
a2 plus b2.

93
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,340
Nothing new here.

94
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,990
But what is the transformation
of this vector?

95
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:04,280
So the transformation of vector
a plus vector b, we

96
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,640
could write it like this.

97
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,740
That would be the same thing as
the transformation of this

98
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:16,520
vector, which is just a1
plus b1 and a2 plus b2.

99
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,670
Which we know it equals
a vector.

100
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,820
It equals this vector.

101
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,490
Or what we do is for the first
component here, we add up the

102
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,930
two components on this side.

103
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,150
So the first component here
is going to be these

104
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,220
two guys added up.

105
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:36,630
So it's a1 plus a2
plus b1 plus b2.

106
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,280
And then the second component
by our transformation or

107
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,410
function definition is just 3
times the first component in

108
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,810
our domain, I guess
you could say.

109
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,000
So it's 3 times the first one.

110
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,130
So it's going to be 3 times
this first guy.

111
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:54,270
So it's 3a1 plus 3b1.

112
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,320
Fair enough.

113
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,810
Now what is the transformation
individually of a and b?

114
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:06,710
So the transformation of a is
equal to the transformation of

115
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,340
a -- let me write it this
way -- is equal to the

116
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,500
transformation of a1
a2 in brackets.

117
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,020
That's another way of
writing vector a.

118
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,200
And what is that equal to?

119
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,770
That's our definition of our
transformation right up here,

120
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:28,040
so this is going to be equal to
the vector a1 plus a2 and

121
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,655
then 3 times a1.

122
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,290
It just comes straight out
of the definition.

123
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,450
I essentially just replaced
an x with a's.

124
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:39,410
By the same argument, what
is the transformation

125
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,650
of our vector b?

126
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,520
Well, it's just going to be the
same thing with the a's

127
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,370
replaced by the b's.

128
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,880
So the transformation of our
vector b is going to be -- b

129
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:53,050
is just b1 b2 -- so it's
going to be b1 plus b2.

130
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,550
And then the second component in
the transformation will be

131
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,300
3 times b1.

132
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:04,090
Now, what is the transformation
of vector a

133
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,390
plus the transformation
of vector b?

134
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,795
Well, it's this vector
plus that vector.

135
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:11,200
And what is that equal to?

136
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,790
Well, this is just pure vector
addition so we just add up

137
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,910
their components.

138
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:21,300
So it's a1 plus a2
plus b1 plus b2.

139
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,010
That's just that component
plus that component.

140
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:26,040
The second component is 3a1 and
we're going to add it to

141
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,950
that second component.

142
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:31,810
So it's 3a1 plus 3b1.

143
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,790
Now, we just showed you that if
I take the transformations

144
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,940
separately of each of the
vectors and then add them up,

145
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,530
I get the exact same thing as
if I took the vectors and

146
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:44,210
added them up first and then
took the transformation.

147
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,130
So we've met our
first criteria.

148
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,990
That the transformation of the
sum of the vectors is the same

149
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,900
thing as the sum of the
transformations.

150
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,120
Now let's see if this works
with a random scalar.

151
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,700
So we know what the

152
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,180
transformation of a looks like.

153
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,970
What does ca look like,
first of all?

154
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,340
I guess that's a good
place to start.

155
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:09,810
c times our vector a is going
to be equal to c times a1.

156
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,740
And then c times a2.

157
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,280
That's our definition of scalar

158
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,530
multiplication time's a vector.

159
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:19,740
So what's our transformation --
let me go to a new color.

160
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,890
What is our -- let me do a color
I haven't used in a long

161
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:23,980
time, white.

162
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,530
What is our transformation
of ca going to be?

163
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:37,179
Well, that's the same thing as
our transformation of ca1, ca2

164
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:40,649
which is equal to a new vector,
where the first term

165
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:44,720
-- let's go to our definition
-- is you sum the first and

166
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,470
second components.

167
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:48,550
And then the second term is 3
times the first component.

168
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,820
So our first term
you sum them.

169
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,470
So it's going to be
ca1 plus ca2.

170
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,770
And then our second term
is 3 times our first

171
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,020
term, so it's 3ca1.

172
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,810
   

173
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,190
Now, what is this equal to?

174
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:02,890
This is the same thing.

175
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,350
We can view it as factoring
out the c.

176
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:10,640
This the same thing as c times
the vector a1 plus a2.

177
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,460
And then the second
component is 3a1.

178
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,120
But this thing right here,
we already saw.

179
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,460
This is the same thing as
the transformation of a.

180
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,530
So just like that, you see that
the transformation of c

181
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:27,510
times our vector a, for any
vector a in r2 -- anything in

182
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:31,340
r2 can be represented this way
-- is the same thing as c

183
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,290
times the transformation of a.

184
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:38,010
So we've met our second
condition, that when you when

185
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,030
you -- well I just stated it, so
I don't have to restate it.

186
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:46,560
So we meet both conditions,
which tells us that this is a

187
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,170
linear transformation.

188
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:53,390
And you might be thinking,
OK, Sal, fair enough.

189
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,480
How do I know that all
transformations aren't linear

190
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,240
transformations?

191
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,760
Show me something
that won't work.

192
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,940
And here I'll do a very
simple example.

193
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,190
Let me define my
transformation.

194
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:10,270
   

195
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:15,040
Well, I'll do it from r2
to r2 just to kind

196
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,970
of compare the two.

197
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:19,150
I could have done it from r to r
if wanted a simpler example.

198
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,120
But I'm going to define
my transformation.

199
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:28,690
Let's say, my transformation
of the vector x1, x2.

200
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:36,710
Let's say it is equal to
x1 squared and then

201
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,890
0, just like that.

202
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:42,770
Let me see if this is a
linear transformation.

203
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:46,510
So the first question
is, what's my

204
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,330
transformation of a vector a?

205
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:53,530
So my transformation of a vector
a-- where a is just the

206
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:56,770
same a that I did before--
it would look like this.

207
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:00,970
It would look like a1 squared
and then a 0.

208
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:05,330
Now, what would be my
transformation if I

209
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,380
took c times a?

210
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:14,540
Well, this is the same thing as
c times a1 and c times a2.

211
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,920
And by our transformation
definition -- sorry, the

212
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,700
transformation of c times this
thing right here, because I'm

213
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,380
taking the transformation
on both sides.

214
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,100
And by our transformation
definition this will just be

215
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,290
equal to a new vector that
would be in our codomain,

216
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,390
where the first term is
just the first term

217
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,770
of our input squared.

218
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:37,940
So it's ca1 squared.

219
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,020
And the second term is 0.

220
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,080
What is this equal to?

221
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,090
Let me switch colors.

222
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:48,130
This is equal to c squared
a1 squared and

223
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:50,880
this is equal to 0.

224
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:57,720
Now, if we can assume that c
does not equal 0, this would

225
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,280
be equal to what?

226
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,310
Actually, it doesn't
even matter.

227
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:03,150
We don't even have to make
that assumption.

228
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,780
So this is the same thing.

229
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:12,130
This is equal to c squared times
the vector a1 squared 0.

230
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,460
Which is equal to what?

231
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,750
This expression right here
is a transformation of a.

232
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:21,880
So this is equal to c squared
times the transformation of a.

233
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,130
Let me do it in the
same color.

234
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,610
   

235
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,810
So what I've just showed
you is, if I take the

236
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:32,000
transformation of a vector being
multiplied by a scalar

237
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,590
quantity first, that that's
equal to -- for this T, for

238
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:39,690
this transformation that I've
defined right here -- c

239
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,650
squared times the transformation
of a.

240
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:48,220
And clearly this statement right
here, or this choice of

241
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:54,510
transformation, conflicts with
this requirement for a linear

242
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,510
transformation.

243
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,540
If I have a c here I should
see a c here.

244
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,160
But in our case, I have
a c here and I

245
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,840
have a c squared here.

246
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,370
So clearly this negates
that statement.

247
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:14,550
So this is not a linear
transformation.

248
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,660
And just to get a gut feel
if you're just looking at

249
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,710
something, whether it's going to
be a linear transformation

250
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,910
or not, if the transformation
just involves linear

251
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,890
combinations of the different
components of the inputs,

252
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:27,200
you're probably dealing with
a linear transformation.

253
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,910
If you start seeing things where
the components start

254
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:33,130
getting multiplied by each
other or you start seeing

255
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,870
squares or exponents, you're
probably not dealing with a

256
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,950
linear transformation.

257
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,800
And then there's some functions
that might be in a

258
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,010
bit of a grey area, but it
tends to be just linear

259
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:44,500
combinations are going to lead
to a linear transformation.

260
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,340
But hopefully that gives you
a good sense of things.

261
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:49,060
And this leads up to what I
think is one of the neatest

262
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,680
outcomes, in the next video.

263
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:51,943
