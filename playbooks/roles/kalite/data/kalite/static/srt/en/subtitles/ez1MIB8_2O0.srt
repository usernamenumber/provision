00:00:00,773 --> 00:00:03,398
PROBLEM: "Where is 30 on the number line?"

2
00:00:03,398 --> 00:00:05,637
So on the number line right over here, we see that

3
00:00:05,637 --> 00:00:09,475
as we go from 0, the first slash isn't 1. It's 3.

4
00:00:09,475 --> 00:00:10,793
So with each slash we move to the right,

5
00:00:10,793 --> 00:00:12,222
the numbers go up by 3.

6
00:00:12,222 --> 00:00:14,064
So let's see if we can figure out where 30 is.

7
00:00:14,064 --> 00:00:16,230
So this slash is marked as 3.

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,734
So this is going to be 3 more. So it's 6.

9
00:00:18,734 --> 00:00:28,366
Then 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, and 30.

10
00:00:28,366 --> 00:00:29,692
Another way you could have thought about this is

11
00:00:29,692 --> 00:00:32,546
since each of these marks is 3, to get to 30,

12
00:00:32,546 --> 00:00:34,158
we have to step through 10 of these marks.

13
00:00:34,158 --> 00:00:41,214
So we go [COUNTING] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

14
00:00:41,214 --> 00:00:43,274
Let's do a few more.

15
00:00:43,274 --> 00:00:45,851
PROBLEM: "Where is 24 on the number line?"

16
00:00:45,851 --> 00:00:48,535
Well, once again, each of these marks is 3.

17
00:00:48,535 --> 00:00:57,325
So it's going to be 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24.

18
00:00:57,325 --> 00:00:58,454
Let's do one more.

19
00:00:58,454 --> 00:01:00,207
So in this problem, each mark is 4.

20
00:01:00,207 --> 00:01:06,634
So we're going to go 4, 8,12, 16, and 20.

21
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:08,526
Another way you could think about it

22
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:09,501
is that if each step is 4,

23
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:12,228
you have to go up 5 times to get up to 20.

24
00:01:12,228 --> 00:01:15,587
So this is 1 2 3, 4, 5.

25
00:01:15,587 --> 00:01:18,838
Either way, this should be the right answer.
