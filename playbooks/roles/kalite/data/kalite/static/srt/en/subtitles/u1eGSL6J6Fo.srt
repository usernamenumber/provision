1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,160
Let's remind ourselves a little
bit of what we already

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,200
know about orbitals and I've
gone over this early on in the

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,710
regular chemistry playlist.
Let's say that this is the

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,250
nucleus of our atom, super
small, and around that we have

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,280
our first orbital,
the 1s orbital.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,290
The 1s orbital, you can kind
of just view it as a cloud

7
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:22,940
around the nucleus.

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,890
So you have your 1s orbital and
it can fit two electrons,

9
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,820
so the first electron will go
into the 1s orbital and then

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,140
the second electron will also
go into the 1s orbital.

11
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,690
For example, hydrogen has
only one electron, so it

12
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,020
would go into 1s.

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,570
Helium has one more,
so that will also

14
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,320
go into the 1s orbital.

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,340
After that is filled, then you
move onto the 2s orbital.

16
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,330
The 2s orbital, you can view
it as a shell around the 1s

17
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,760
orbital, and all of these, you
can't really view it in our

18
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,980
conventional way of thinking.

19
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,340
You can kind of view it as a
probability cloud of where you

20
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,820
might find the electrons.

21
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,150
But for visualization purposes,
just imagine it's

22
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:09,290
kind of a shell cloud around
the 1s orbital.

23
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:13,850
So imagine that it's kind of
a fuzzy shell around the 1s

24
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,390
orbital, so it's around the
1s orbital, and your next

25
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,390
electron will go there.

26
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,370
Then the fourth electron will
also go there, and I drew

27
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,870
these arrows upward and downward
because the first

28
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,750
electron that goes into the 1s
orbital has one spin and then

29
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,190
the next electron to go into
1s orbital will have the

30
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,950
opposite spin, and so they keep
pairing up in that way.

31
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,070
They have opposite spins.

32
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,125
Now, if we keep adding
electrons, now we move to the

33
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:42,660
2p orbitals.

34
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,960
Actually, you can view it as
there are three 2p orbitals

35
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,760
and each of them can hold two
electrons, so it can hold a

36
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,490
total of six electrons
in the 2p orbitals.

37
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,960
Let me draw them for you just
so you can visualize it.

38
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,710
So if we were to label our axis
here, so think in three

39
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,490
dimensions.

40
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,405
So imagine that that right
there is the x-axis.

41
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:10,919
Let me do this in different
colors.

42
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:17,550
Let's say that this right
here is our y-axis and

43
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,700
then we have a z-axis.

44
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,490
I'll do that in blue.

45
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:25,340
Let's say we have a z-axis
just like that.

46
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,080
You actually have a p orbital
that goes along

47
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,190
each of those axes.

48
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:35,810
So you could have your
two-- let me do

49
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,020
it in the same color.

50
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:43,560
So you have your 2p sub x
orbital, and so what that'll

51
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,725
look like is a dumbbell shape
that's going in the

52
00:02:45,725 --> 00:02:46,500
x-direction.

53
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,220
So let me try my best attempt
at drawing this.

54
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,640
It's a dumbbell shape that goes
in the x-direction, in

55
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,510
kind of both directions, and
it's actually symmetric.

56
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,800
I'm drawing this end bigger than
that end so it looks like

57
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,535
it's coming out at you a little
bit, but let me draw it

58
00:02:59,535 --> 00:03:00,950
a little bit better than that.

59
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,230
I can do a better job.

60
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:06,670
And maybe it comes
out like that.

61
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,760
Remember, these are really just
probability clouds, but

62
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,190
it's helpful to kind of
visualize them as maybe a

63
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,690
little bit more things that we
would see in our world, but I

64
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,640
think probability cloud is the
best way to think about it.

65
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,350
So that is the 2px orbital,
and then I haven't talked

66
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,340
about how they get filled yet,
but then you also have your

67
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,220
2py orbital, which'll go in this
axis, but same idea, kind

68
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,530
of a dumbbell shape in the
y-direction, going in both

69
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,570
along the y-axis, going in that

70
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,820
direction and in that direction.

71
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:39,230
Then, of course, so let me do
this 2py, and then you also

72
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:47,870
have your 2pz, and that goes
in the z-direction up like

73
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:52,790
that and then downwards
like that.

74
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,120
So when you keep adding
electrons, the first-- so far,

75
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,480
we've added four electrons.

76
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:04,700
If you add a fifth electron, you
would expect it to go into

77
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,380
the 2px orbital right there.

78
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,130
So even though this 2px orbital
can fit two electrons,

79
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,220
the first one goes there.

80
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,905
The very next one won't
go into that one.

81
00:04:14,905 --> 00:04:17,550
It actually wants to separate
itself within the p orbital,

82
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:22,110
so the very next electron that
you add won't go into 2px,

83
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,440
it'll go into 2py.

84
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,170
And then the one after that
won't go into 2py or 2px,

85
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,060
it'll go into 2pz.

86
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,640
They try to separate
themselves.

87
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,210
Then if you add another
electron, if you add-- let's

88
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,880
see, we've added one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven.

89
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,030
If you add an eighth electron,
that will then go into the 2px

90
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,290
orbital, so the eighth electron
would go there, but

91
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,290
it would have the
opposite spin.

92
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,590
So this is just a little bit of
review with a little bit of

93
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,790
visualization.

94
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,010
Now, given what we just
reviewed, let's think about

95
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,620
what's happening with carbon.

96
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,795
Carbon has six electrons.

97
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:07,300
Its electron configuration, it
is 1s2, two electrons in the

98
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,090
1s orbital.

99
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:14,700
Then 2s2, then 2p2, right?

100
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,270
It only has two left,
because it has a

101
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,310
total of six electrons.

102
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,350
Two go here, then there,
then two are left

103
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,260
to fill the p orbitals.

104
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,780
If you go based on what we just
drew and what we just

105
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:29,310
talked about here, what you
would expect for carbon-- let

106
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,930
me just draw it out the
way I did this.

107
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,930
So you have your 1s orbital,
your 2s orbital, and then you

108
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:41,570
have your 2px orbital, your 2py
orbital, and then you have

109
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,790
your 2pz orbital.

110
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,460
If you just go straight from
the electron configuration,

111
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,890
you would expect carbon, so the
1s orbital fills first, so

112
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,520
that's our first electron,
our second

113
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,900
electron, our third electron.

114
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,580
Then we go to our 2s orbital,
That fills next, third

115
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,000
electron, then fourth
electron.

116
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,700
Then you would expect maybe
your fifth electron

117
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,330
to go in the 2px.

118
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,020
We could have said 2py or 2z.

119
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,410
It just depends on how
you label the axis.

120
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,150
But you would have your fifth
electron go into one of the p

121
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,660
orbitals, and then you
would expect your

122
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,780
sixth to go into another.

123
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,720
So you would expect that
to be kind of the

124
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,980
configuration for carbon.

125
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:21,880
And if we were to draw it--
let me draw our axes.

126
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:28,320
That is our y-axis and then
this is our x-axis.

127
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,390
Let me draw it a little
bit better than that.

128
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,190
So that is the x-axis and, of
course, you have your z-axis.

129
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,130
You have to think in three
dimensions a little bit.

130
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,230
Then you have your z-axis,
just like that.

131
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,060
So first we fill the 1s orbital,
so if our nucleus is

132
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,480
sitting here, our
1s orbital gets

133
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,480
filled with two electrons.

134
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,480
You can imagine that
as a little

135
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,350
cloud around the nucleus.

136
00:06:54,350 --> 00:07:00,020
Then we fill the 2s orbital
and that would be a cloud

137
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,630
around that, kind of a
shell around that.

138
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:06,330
Then we would put one electron
in the 2px orbital, so one

139
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,430
electron would start kind of
jumping around or moving

140
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,920
around, depending how you want
to think about it, in that

141
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,530
orbital over there, 2px.

142
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,450
Then you'd have the next
electron jumping around or

143
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,140
moving around in the 2py
orbital, so it would be moving

144
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,580
around like this.

145
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,950
If you went just off of this,
you would say, you know what?

146
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:29,380
These guys, this guy over
here and that guy

147
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,560
over there is lonely.

148
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,780
He's looking for a opposite
spin partner.

149
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,270
This would be the only places
that bonds would form.

150
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:39,710
You would expect some type of
bonding to form with the

151
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,190
x-orbitals or the y-orbitals.

152
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,360
Now, that's what you would
expect if you just straight-up

153
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,600
kind of stayed with this model
of how things fill and how

154
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,040
orbitals look.

155
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,210
The reality of carbon, and I
guess the simplest reality of

156
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:57,040
carbon, is if you look at a
methane molecule, is very

157
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,800
different than what you
would expect here.

158
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,490
First of all, what you would
expect here is that carbon

159
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,770
would probably-- maybe it
would form two bonds.

160
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:07,840
But we know carbon forms four
bonds and it wants to pretend

161
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,490
like it has eight electrons.

162
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,390
Frankly, almost every atom wants
to pretend like it has

163
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,550
eight electrons.

164
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,800
So in order for that to happen,
you have to think

165
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,840
about a different reality.

166
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,450
This isn't really what's
happening when carbon bonds,

167
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:31,400
so not what happens
when carbon bonds.

168
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,890
What's really happening when
carbon bonds, and this will

169
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,915
kind of go into the discussion
of sp3 hybridization, but what

170
00:08:37,915 --> 00:08:39,159
you're going to see
is it's not that

171
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,120
complicated of a topic.

172
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,830
It sounds very daunting, but
it's actually pretty

173
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:42,919
straightforward.

174
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,180
What really happens when carbon
bonds, because it wants

175
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,740
to form four bonds with things,
is its configuration,

176
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,510
you could imagine, looks
more like this.

177
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,830
So you have 1s.

178
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,050
We have two electrons there.

179
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:04,760
Then you have your 2s,
2px, 2py and 2pz.

180
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,480
Now what you can imagine is it
wants to form four bonds.

181
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,740
It has four electrons that are
willing to pair up with

182
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,680
electrons from other
molecules.

183
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,100
In the case of methane, that
other molecule is a hydrogen.

184
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,760
So what you could imagine is
that the electrons actually--

185
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,900
maybe the hydrogen brings this
electron right here into a

186
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,550
higher energy state and
puts it into 2z.

187
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,200
That's one way to
visualize it.

188
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,670
So this other guy here maybe
ends up over there, and then

189
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,570
these two guys are over
there and over there.

190
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:37,240
Now, all of a sudden, it looks
like you have four lonely guys

191
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,520
and they are ready to bond,
and that's actually more

192
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,060
accurate of how carbon bonds.

193
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,670
It likes to bond with
four other people.

194
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,440
Now, it's a little bit arbitrary
which electron ends

195
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,350
up in each of these things, and
even if you had this type

196
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:55,610
of bonding, you would expect
things to bond along the x, y,

197
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,180
and z axis.

198
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:01,850
The reality is, the reality of
carbon, is that these four

199
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,870
electrons in its second shell
don't look like they're in

200
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,895
just-- the first one doesn't
look like it's just in the s

201
00:10:07,895 --> 00:10:12,100
orbital and then the p's x and y
and z for the other three.

202
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,340
They all look like they're a
little bit in the s and a

203
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,010
little bit in the p orbitals.

204
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,440
Let me make that clear.

205
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,390
So instead of this being a 2s,
what it really looks like for

206
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:26,570
carbon is that this looks
like a 2sp3 orbital.

207
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:30,430
This looks like a 2sp3 orbital,
that looks like a

208
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:34,310
2sp3 orbital, that looks
like a 2sp3 orbital.

209
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:37,110
They all look like they're kind
of in the same orbital.

210
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,520
This special type of--
it sounds very fancy.

211
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,790
This sp3 hybridized orbital,
what it actually looks like is

212
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,520
something that's in between
an s and a p orbital.

213
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:51,050
It has a 25% s nature
and a 75% p nature.

214
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:55,460
You can imagine it as being a
mixture of these four things.

215
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,170
That's the behavior
that carbon has.

216
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,750
So when you mix them all,
instead of having an s

217
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,510
orbital, so if this is
a nucleus and we do a

218
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:08,540
cross-section, an s orbital
looks like that and the p

219
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:15,000
orbital looks something like
that in cross-section.

220
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,080
So this is a an s
and that is a p.

221
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,790
When they get mixed up, the
orbital looks like this.

222
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,960
An sp3 orbital looks something
like this.

223
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,170
This is a hybridized
sp3 orbital.

224
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:36,500
Hybrid just means a combination
of two things.

225
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,720
A hybrid car is a combination
of gas and electric.

226
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,800
A hybridized orbital is a
combination of s and p.

227
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,750
Hybridized sp3 orbitals are the
orbitals when carbon bonds

228
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,300
with things like hydrogen
or really when

229
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,320
it bonds with anything.

230
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,480
So if you looked at a molecule
of methane, and people talk

231
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,970
about sp3 hybridized orbitals,
all they're saying is that you

232
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:03,400
have a carbon in the center.

233
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,760
Let's say that's the carbon
nucleus right there.

234
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,460
And instead of having one s and
three p orbitals, it has

235
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,320
four sp3 orbitals.

236
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:19,190
So let me try my best at drawing
the four sp3 orbitals.

237
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:22,350
Let's say this is the big lobe
that is kind of pointing near

238
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,320
us, and then it has a small
lobe in the back.

239
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,180
Then you have another one that
has a big lobe like that and a

240
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,110
small lobe in the back.

241
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:35,852
Then you have one that's going
back behind the page, so let

242
00:12:35,852 --> 00:12:36,910
me draw that.

243
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,940
You can kind of imagine a
three-legged stool, and then

244
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,180
its small lobe will come
out like that.

245
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,990
And then you have one where
the big lobe is pointing

246
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:50,400
straight up, and it has a
small lobe going down.

247
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,580
You can imagine it as kind
of a three-legged stool.

248
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,410
One of them is behind like
that and it's pointing

249
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:59,120
straight up, So a three-legged
stool with something-- it's

250
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,960
kind of like a tripod, I
guess is the best way

251
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,560
to think about it.

252
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,690
So that's the carbon nucleus
in the center and then you

253
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:08,720
have the hydrogens, so that's
our carbon right there.

254
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,770
Then you have your hydrogens.

255
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:11,935
You have a hydrogen here.

256
00:13:11,935 --> 00:13:16,530
A hydrogen just has one electron
in the 1s orbital, so

257
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,520
the hydrogen has a 1s orbital.

258
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,735
You have a hydrogen here that
just has a 1s orbital.

259
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:24,400
It has a hydrogen here,
1s orbital,

260
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,590
hydrogen here, 1s orbital.

261
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:29,550
So this is how the hydrogen
orbital and the carbon

262
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,710
orbitals get mixed.

263
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:35,990
The hydrogens 1s orbital bonds
with-- well, each of the

264
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:38,590
hydrogen's 1s orbital bonds
with each of the

265
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,710
carbon's sp3 orbitals.

266
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,540
Just so you get a little bit
more notation, so when people

267
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,620
talk about hybridized sp3
orbitals, all they're saying

268
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,580
is, look, carbon doesn't bond.

269
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,900
Once carbon-- this
right here is a

270
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,280
molecule of methane, right?

271
00:13:54,280 --> 00:14:01,500
This is CH4, or methane, and it
doesn't bond like you would

272
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,240
expect if you just want
with straight

273
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,060
vanilla s and p orbitals.

274
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,910
If you just went with straight
vanilla s and p orbitals, the

275
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,080
bonds would form.

276
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,000
Maybe the hydrogen might be
there and there, and if it had

277
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,450
four hydrogens, maybe there and
there, depending on how

278
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,230
you want to think about it.

279
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,180
But the reality is it doesn't
look like that.

280
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,110
It looks more like a tripod.

281
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:21,080
It has a tetrahedral shape.

282
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,780
The best way that that can be
explained, I guess the shape

283
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,950
of the structure, is if you have
four equally-- four of

284
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:37,130
the same types of orbital
shapes, and those four types

285
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:40,980
of orbital shapes are hybrids
between s's and p's.

286
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,180
One other piece of notation to
know, sometimes people think

287
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:49,550
it's a very fancy term, but when
you have a bond between

288
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:52,390
two molecules, where the
orbitals are kind of pointing

289
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,240
at each other, so you can
imagine right here, this

290
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,330
hydrogen orbital is pointing
in that direction.

291
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,130
This sp3 orbital is pointing
that direction, and they're

292
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:04,170
overlapping right around here.

293
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:13,730
This is called a sigma bond,
where the overlap is along the

294
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:17,100
same axis as if you connected
the two molecules.

295
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,420
Over here, you connect the two
molecules, the overlap is on

296
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,510
that same axis.

297
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:25,330
This is the strongest form of
covalent bonds, and this'll be

298
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,480
a good basis for discussion
maybe in the next video when

299
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,630
we talk a little bit
about pi bonds.

300
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,110
The big takeaway of this video
is to just understand what

301
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:32,910
does it mean?

302
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,530
What is an sp3 hybridized
orbital?

303
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:36,580
Nothing fancy, just a

304
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,580
combination of s and p orbitals.

305
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:44,670
It has 25% s character, 75% p
character, which makes sense.

306
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:48,120
It's what exists when carbon
forms bonds, especially in the

307
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,880
case of methane.

308
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,920
That's what describes it's
tetrahedral structure.

309
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,580
That's why we have an angle
between the various branches

310
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:01,580
of a 109.5 degrees, which some
teachers might want you know,

311
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,300
so it's useful to know.

312
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,350
If you take this angle right
here, 109.5, that's the same

313
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,910
thing as that angle, or if you
were to go behind it, that

314
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:13,380
angle right there, 109.5
degrees, explained by sp3

315
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,460
hybridization.

316
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,500
The bonds themselves
are sigma bonds.

317
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,420
The overlap is along the axis
connecting the hydrogen.
