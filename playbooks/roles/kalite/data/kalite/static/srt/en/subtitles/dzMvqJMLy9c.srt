1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
   

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,260
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,360
In the last video, I was
confusing you with compound

4
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,620
interest, and now I
will continue to do so.

5
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:09,210
But the general notion is I
threw out this 100% interest

6
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,550
rate, and that was if we just
say you pay me 100% of what

7
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:14,710
you borrow after a year.

8
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,710
And then we talked about what
happens if instead you want

9
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,800
half the rate for six months,
but then I will compound the

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,310
interest over the
next six months.

11
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,020
Then we said what happens if
it's for every month or every

12
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,780
day, and this was the
case for every day.

13
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,830
And if I charged you 2.7% every
day, but I compound it for 365

14
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,690
days, it becomes-- I'm
just using Excel here.

15
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,520
Let me clear all of this.

16
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:48,540
It becomes 1.027 to
the 365th power.

17
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,070
Oh, I'm using my
Excel incorrectly.

18
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,050
Oh, that's not right.

19
00:00:54,050 --> 00:01:09,650
Let's see, plus 1.027
to the 365th-- no, I'm

20
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,400
making a mistake here.

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,500
Let me make sure I got
this 1.027 right.

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,690
So if I takes 100% and I divide
it by 365, so 100% is the same

23
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:25,890
thing as 1 divided by 365,
that is-- oh, it's 0.00.

24
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,330
Sorry.

25
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,120
So I'm not going to
charge you 2% a day.

26
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,820
Yeah, that seems high.

27
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:40,450
I'm going to charge you
1.-- that is 0.00274.

28
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,490
I'm charging you 0.2%, right?

29
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,910
This would be-- this is the
kind of one percentage

30
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,410
place, so this is 0.2%.

31
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:52,860
So I'm charging you
0.274% per day.

32
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,520
I don't know why I put
brackets around that.

33
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,860
So if I were to compound that
over 365 days, you take it

34
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,820
to the 365th power, and
what does that get me?

35
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:11,070
Let's see, if I do plus
1.00274 to the 365th

36
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:16,500
power, I get 2.7148.

37
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,540
It equals 2-- that's how much
you're going to owe me.

38
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,650
If you just keep the money, you
keep kind of reborrowing it

39
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:29,430
every day, you'll owe me
$2.7148 after the

40
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,970
end of one year.

41
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,440
Now, let's say that's not
enough for you because this

42
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,530
interest rate is so high,
you want the option to

43
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,800
pay it by the hour.

44
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,285
You want this thing to compound
every hour of the day.

45
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,060
So let's see.

46
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,760
Let's first of all figure
out how many hours

47
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,250
there are in a year.

48
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,390
So let's see.

49
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:53,550
In a year, there's 365 days
times 24 hours per day, so

50
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,390
there's 8,760 hours in a year.

51
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,060
And then if we want to divide
100%, which is just 1, divided

52
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:11,450
by that number, I could charge
you 0.01-- what is that number?

53
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,200
Yeah, it's 0.0114.

54
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:22,330
So hourly compounding-- I
should've been doing this

55
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,590
in green since it's money.

56
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:31,610
Hourly compounding, I will
charge you 100% divided by the

57
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:42,590
number of hours in a year,
which equals 0.0114% per hour.

58
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:48,850
So over a year, I would take
it to this power, right?

59
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:55,640
So let's say after one hour,
you'll owe me 1.01-- sorry,

60
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:02,960
it's 01% so it's 1.000114.

61
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,560
That's how much you're going
to owe me after one hour.

62
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,460
So $1 plus a very small
fraction of a cent.

63
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,900
But then after another
hour, you're going to owe

64
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,520
that times that again.

65
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,010
Because this'll be the new
principal after an hour,

66
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,390
so then you're going to
owe that same fraction

67
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,010
times it again, right?

68
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,960
Then after three hours,
you'll multiply it again.

69
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,480
So after the total number of
hours in the year, which is

70
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:36,660
1.000114, and there's 8,760
hours in a year, let's

71
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:41,250
see what you'll owe me.

72
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:58,860
So if I do plus 1.000114 to
the 8,760th power: 2.71443.

73
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,430
So now, at the end of the year
after compounding roughly 8,700

74
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:11,030
hours, you'll owe me $2.71 and
then some fractions of a penny.

75
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,790
And I know you thought that
these videos were about e and

76
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,620
you were just learning about
how to take advantage of

77
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,120
someone in need, but there
should be something interesting

78
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,050
here that maybe you observed.

79
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,640
   

80
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,230
When we started compounding, at
first you owed me $2, just when

81
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,690
I did one period, which
is the whole year.

82
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:36,300
Then it got to $2.25, and then
it kept getting higher as we

83
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,000
compounded shorter and shorter
periods, but it seems to be

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,670
approaching some number.

85
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,810
It seems to be
approaching, right?

86
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,570
When I compounded every day, at
the end of the year, you owed

87
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,190
me $2.71 and some change.

88
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:50,520
And then if I compounded every
hour, which is 24 times as

89
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,570
many compounds, you still owe
me a very similar number.

90
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,370
So it seems like it's
gravitating towards this

91
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,390
mystical number here, and
that mystical number is e.

92
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:06,230
So let's kind of formalize what
I've been meandering around

93
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,590
for a video and a half now.

94
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,500
And I'll switch colors.

95
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,080
So, in general, the amount
of money you owed me at the

96
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,540
end of the year was the
amount you borrowed.

97
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,445
   

98
00:06:20,445 --> 00:06:22,210
Let me do that in blue.

99
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,800
Let's call that the principal.

100
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,340
That's not bright enough.

101
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:31,640
The principal times 1 plus--
and what was the interest rate?

102
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,840
It was 100%.

103
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,240
100% divided by the number
of times you wanted to

104
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,090
compound in the year.

105
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:42,280
We'll call that n, right?

106
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,770
And we raise that
to the n power.

107
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:49,380
So in the case of when there's
only one compounding period,

108
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,320
where you just borrowed it for
the year, and the principal

109
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,740
in our example was 1, right?

110
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,330
So this is just 1 times-- the
principal is just what you

111
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:02,200
borrowed-- 1 plus-- 100% is the
same thing as 1, right, or

112
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,850
1.00, and when there was one
compounding period, we just did

113
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:11,860
that, and you owed me $2
at the end of the year.

114
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,480
And this is exactly what
I've done in the last

115
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,030
video and a half.

116
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,780
I'm just formalizing it with
a couple of variables.

117
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,630
When we compounded it every
month, it turned into this: the

118
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:25,900
principal you borrowed was 1
times 1 plus 100% over 12 to

119
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:31,930
the 12th power, which
equaled-- let's see.

120
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:35,230
I erased the numbers
so I will redo it.

121
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:45,090
So it's 1 plus 1 divided by 12
equals 1 plus-- I'm using Excel

122
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,070
for those of you who have never
seen it before-- 12

123
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,300
to the 12th power.

124
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:58,980
That equaled 2.613.

125
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:03,030
And when I compounded every
day, I got-- the principal you

126
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:11,210
borrowed was that times 1 plus
1 over 365 to the 365th power,

127
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:14,780
and that equaled 2.71 and
then some, some, something.

128
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,410
So as you see, as I make n
larger and larger in this

129
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:22,270
original equation, I approach
this magical number.

130
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:26,410
I approach this magical number
2.71 something, something,

131
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:29,610
something, and that
magical number is e.

132
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,250
And it amazes me that this--
and it never repeats.

133
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,610
It's one of these
transcendental numbers like pi,

134
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,960
and later on in future videos,
we'll see that it shows up

135
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,930
all over the place.

136
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:42,270
It shows up in random
combinatorics, it shows up in

137
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:45,570
complex analysis, and as we
see here, and maybe most

138
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,810
importantly, it shows up
in compound interest.

139
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,980
So, in general, what we
could say is the limit.

140
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,470
And the limit is just
what happens as you

141
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,270
approach something.

142
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,370
The limit as n
approaches infinity.

143
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,840
And in our example, that's as
we compound over smaller and

144
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:09,540
smaller periods of time of 1
plus 1 over n to the nth power

145
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,960
is equal to this magical
number, and I'll do it in a

146
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,750
bold color-- well, that's not
that bold, but I'll highlight

147
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,120
with another bold color-- is e.

148
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,290
And that is equal to 2.71.

149
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,150
I forget all the digits.

150
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,600
It keeps going on.

151
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,020
And it's really fun
to experiment.

152
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,610
Put in a crazy, huge-- put
in like a million there.

153
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,920
And if you put it there,
you have to put a

154
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,130
million there, too.

155
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,660
And you'll see that the larger
numbers you get, you just

156
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,000
get closer and closer and
closer to this number e.

157
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,070
And a fun project would be
to see how many digits

158
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:41,450
of e you can get.

159
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:44,420
But the fact that as you
compound something over smaller

160
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,970
and smaller periods it
converges to this number, to

161
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,000
me is pretty interesting.

162
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,470
So with that out of the way, in
the next video I'll show you

163
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,610
how to figure-- and so, in
the limit, as n approaches

164
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:56,800
infinity, what are you doing?

165
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,760
You're actually
compounding continuously.

166
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,610
You're compounding every
zillionth of a second.

167
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:04,770
And the fact that you can
actually calculate an interest

168
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,950
rate compounding every
zillionth of a second to me is

169
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,830
a fairly amazing result.

170
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,240
But anyway, I'll see you
in the next video because

171
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,810
I've run out of time.

172
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:13,900
