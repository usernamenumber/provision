1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
   

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,590
All right, so where we left
off, we had simplified our

3
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,850
algebraic expression for the
squared error to the line from

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,040
the n data points.

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,090
We kind of visualized it.

6
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,410
This expression right here would
be a surface, I guess

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,520
you could view it as a surface
in three dimensions, where for

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,340
any m and b is going to be a
point on that surface that

9
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,780
represents the squared
error for that line.

10
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,860
Our goal is to find the m and
the b, which would define an

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,760
actual line, that minimize
the squared error.

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,570
The way that we do that, is we
find a point where the partial

13
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,190
derivative of the squared error
with respect to m is 0,

14
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,820
and the partial derivative
with respect to b is also

15
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:41,590
equal to 0.

16
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,600
So it's flat with
respect to m.

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,540
So that means that the slope
in this direction

18
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,660
is going to be flat.

19
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,430
Let me do it in the
same color.

20
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,110
So the slope in this direction,
that's the partial

21
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,720
derivative with respect to
m, is going to be flat.

22
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,640
It's not going to change
in that direction.

23
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,420
The partial derivative
with respect to b

24
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,400
is going to be flat.

25
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,870
So it will be a flat point
right over there.

26
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,680
The slope at that point in that
direction will also be 0,

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,580
and that is our minimum point.

28
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,960
So let's figure out the m and
b's that give us this.

29
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,090
So if I were to take the partial
derivative of this

30
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,220
expression with respect to m.

31
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,710
   

32
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,700
Well this first term has
no m terms in it.

33
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,330
So it's a constant from the
point of view of m.

34
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,030
Just as a reminder, partial
derivatives, it's just like

35
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,630
taking a regular derivative.

36
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,690
You're just assuming that
everything but the variable

37
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,290
that you're doing the partial
derivative with respect to,

38
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,350
you're assuming everything
else is a constant.

39
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,860
So in this expression, all the
x's, the y's, the b's, the

40
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,490
n's, those are all constant.

41
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,820
The only variable, when we take
the partial derivative

42
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,500
with respect to m, that
matters is the m.

43
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,190
So this is a constant.

44
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,510
There's no m here.

45
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,920
This term right over
here, we're taking

46
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,700
with respect to m.

47
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,690
So the derivative of this with
respect to m, it's kind of the

48
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:57,880
coefficients on the m.

49
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,560
So negative 2 times n times the
mean of the xy's, that's

50
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,830
the partial of this
with respect to m.

51
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:10,430
Then this term or right
here has no m's in it.

52
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,700
So it's constant with
respect to m.

53
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,450
So its partial derivative
with respect to m is 0.

54
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,610
Then this term here, you have
n times the mean of the x

55
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,080
squared times m squared.

56
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,100
So this is going to be-- we're
talking about a partial

57
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:31,740
derivative with respect to m--
so it's going to be 2 times n

58
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,690
times the mean of the
x [? squareds ?]

59
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,960
times m.

60
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,060
The derivative of m squared is
2m, and then you just have

61
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,990
this coefficient
there as well.

62
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,400
Now this term, you also
have an m over there.

63
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,950
So let's see, everything
else is just kind of a

64
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,250
coefficient on this m.

65
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,940
So the derivative with respect
to m is 2bn times

66
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,120
the mean of the x's.

67
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,500
If I took the derivative of 3m,
the derivative is just 3.

68
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,340
It's just the coefficient
on it.

69
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,530
Then finally, this is a constant
with respect to m.

70
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,910
So we don't see it.

71
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,510
So this is the partial
derivative with respect to m.

72
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,670
That's that right over there.

73
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,800
We want to set this
equal to 0.

74
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,020
Now let's do the same thing
with respect to b.

75
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,930
This term, once again, is
a constant from the

76
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,520
perspective of b.

77
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,940
There's no b here.

78
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,380
There's no b over here.

79
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,050
So the partial derivatives
of either of these with

80
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,440
respect to b is 0.

81
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,390
Then over here you have a
negative 2n times the mean of

82
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,450
y's as a coefficient on a b.

83
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,990
So the partial derivative with
respect to b is going to be

84
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:40,500
minus 2n, or negative 2n, times
the mean of the y's.

85
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,230
Then there's no b over here.

86
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,550
Then we do have a b over here.

87
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:47,480
So it's plus 2mn times
the mean of the x's.

88
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:53,090
   

89
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,490
This is essentially
the coefficient

90
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,480
on the b over here.

91
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,520
It was written in a mixed order,
but all of these are

92
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,850
constants from the point
of view of b.

93
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,860
They are the coefficient
in front of the b.

94
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,670
The partial derivative of that
with respect to b is just

95
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,330
going to be the coefficient.

96
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,860
Then finally, the partial
derivative of this with

97
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,820
respect to b is going to be 2nb,
Or 2nb to the first you

98
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,070
could even say.

99
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:21,860
   

100
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,820
We want to set this
equal to 0.

101
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,650
So it looks very complicated.

102
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,840
But remember, we're just trying
to solve for the m's

103
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,530
and the b 's.

104
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,290
We have two equations with
two unknowns here.

105
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:37,820
We have the m's and then
we have the b's.

106
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,080
To simplify this, both of these
equations, actually the

107
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,900
top one and the bottom
one, both sides are

108
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,220
divisible by 2n.

109
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,630
I mean 0 is divisible
by anything.

110
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,530
It'll be just 0.

111
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,440
So let's divide the top equation
and by 2n and see

112
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,020
what we get.

113
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:55,940
If we divide the top equation by
2n, this'll become just 1.

114
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,950
That goes away, and then
those go away.

115
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:04,220
You would just be left with
negative times the mean, the

116
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:12,630
negative mean of the xy's plus
m times the mean of the x

117
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:22,260
squareds, plus b times the mean
of the x's is equal to 0.

118
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,550
That's this first expression
when you divide both sides by

119
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,060
negative 2n.

120
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,820
The second expression will
be, this will go away.

121
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,440
This is when you divide
it by 2n.

122
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,500
I don't want to say
negative 2n.

123
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,240
When you divide this by 2n,
that'll go away, that will go

124
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,330
away, and then those
will go away.

125
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:45,120
You're just left with the
negative mean of the y's plus

126
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:55,630
m times the mean of the x's
plus b is equal to 0.

127
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:59,030
So if we find the m and the b
values that satisfy the system

128
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:04,620
of equations, we have minimized
the squared error.

129
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,100
We could just solve it
in a traditional way.

130
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,860
But I want to rewrite this,
because I think it's kind of

131
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,760
interesting to see what these
really represents.

132
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,680
So let's add this mean
of the xy's to both

133
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,930
sides of this top equation.

134
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:22,200
   

135
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,260
What do we get?

136
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:28,930
We get m times the mean of
the x [? squareds ?]

137
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:36,110
plus b times the mean of the
x's is equal to, these are

138
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:42,700
going to cancel out, is equal
to the mean of the xy's.

139
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,390
That's that top equation.

140
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:49,070
This bottom equation, right
here, let's add the mean of y

141
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,880
to both sides of
this equation.

142
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,040
I do that so that that
cancels out.

143
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,730
And then we're left with m--
I'll do that in the blue color

144
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,940
to show you the same equation--
we have m times the

145
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:13,990
mean of the x's plus b is equal
to the mean of the y's.

146
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,630
Now, I actually want to
get both of these

147
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,960
into mx plus b form.

148
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,100
This is actually
already there.

149
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:24,260
Actually you can see, that if
our best-fitting line is going

150
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:28,550
to be y is equal to mx plus b--
we still have to find the

151
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,350
m and the b-- but we see on
that best-fitting line,

152
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,710
because the m and the b that
satisfy both of these

153
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,740
equations are going to be
the m and the b on that

154
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,830
best-fitting line.

155
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:42,950
So that best-fitting line
actually contains the point,

156
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,780
and we get this from the second
equation right here.

157
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,150
It contains the point.

158
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,160
   

159
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,120
I should write it this way.

160
00:07:52,120 --> 00:08:04,080
The coordinate mean of x mean
of y lies on the line.

161
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,640
And you could see it
right over here.

162
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:10,800
If you put the mean of x in this
for the optimal m and b,

163
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,720
you are going to get
the mean of the y.

164
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,710
So that's interesting.

165
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,690
This optimal line.

166
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,160
Let's never forget what we're
even trying to do.

167
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,370
This optimal line is going to
contain some point on it-- let

168
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,315
me do that in a new color--
it's going to contain some

169
00:08:28,315 --> 00:08:31,627
point on it right here that is
the mean of all of the x

170
00:08:31,627 --> 00:08:36,260
values and the mean of
all the y values.

171
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,140
That's just interesting.

172
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,340
It kind of makes sense.

173
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,270
It kind of makes intuitive
sense.

174
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,330
Now this other thing, just to
kind of get it in the same

175
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:43,970
point of view.

176
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,590
Then it will actually become a
kind of an easier way to solve

177
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,000
the system.

178
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,880
You could solve this a million
different ways.

179
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,210
But just to give us an intuition
of what even is

180
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,690
going on here, what's another
point that's on the line?

181
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,840
Because if you have two points
on the line, you know what the

182
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,940
equation of the line
is going to be.

183
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,630
Well the other point, we want
this to be in mx plus b form.

184
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:05,180
So let's divide both sides of
this equation by this term

185
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,250
right here, by the
mean of the x 's.

186
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:12,710
If we do that, we get m times
the mean of the x

187
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,080
[? squareds ?]

188
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:21,450
divided by the mean of the x's
plus b is equal to the mean of

189
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:26,350
the xy's divided by the
mean of the x's.

190
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,560
So when you write it in this
form, this is the exact same

191
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,890
equation as that, I just divided
both sides by the mean

192
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,860
of the x's, you get another
interesting point that will

193
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:38,130
lie on this optimal fitting
line, at least from the point

194
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,970
of view of the squared
distances.

195
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:49,060
So another point that will lie
on it, on this optimal line,

196
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:53,720
the x value is going to be
this, the mean of the x

197
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,380
[? squareds ?]

198
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,630
divided by the mean
of the x's.

199
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:01,020
Then the y value is going to
be the mean of the xy's

200
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,380
divided by the mean
of the x's.

201
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,370
I'll let you think about
that a little bit more.

202
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,560
But already, this is actually
the two points that lie on the

203
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:22,125
line, so both of these on the
best-fitting line based on how

204
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,860
we're measuring a good fit,
which is the squared distance.

205
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,930
These are on the line
that minimize

206
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:27,930
that squared distance.

207
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,850
What I'm going to do in next
video, and this is turning

208
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:34,180
into like a six or seven video
saga on trying to prove the

209
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,260
best-fitting line or finding
the formula for the

210
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:36,770
best-fitting line.

211
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,750
But it's interesting.

212
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,810
There's all sorts of kind of
neat little mathematical

213
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,390
things to ponder over here.

214
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,930
But in the next video, we can
actually use this information.

215
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,020
We could have just solved
the system straight up.

216
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,550
But we can actually use this
information right here to

217
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,710
solve for our m and b's.

218
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:53,140
Maybe we'll do it both ways
depending on my mood.

219
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:53,467
