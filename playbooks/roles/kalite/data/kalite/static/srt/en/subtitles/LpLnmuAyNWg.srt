1
00:00:00,502 --> 00:00:05,010
Use a number line to compare 11.5 and 11.7.

2
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:06,879
So let's draw a number line here.

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,564
And I am going to focus between 11 and 12

4
00:00:09,564 --> 00:00:11,671
because that's where our two numbers are sitting.

5
00:00:11,671 --> 00:00:14,487
They are 11 and then something else, some number of tenths.

6
00:00:14,487 --> 00:00:19,179
So this right here is 11. This right here would be 12.

7
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:21,673
And then let me draw the tenths.

8
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,114
So this would be, smack-dab in between,

9
00:00:24,114 --> 00:00:28,696
so that would be eleven and five tenths, or that would be 11.5.

10
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:30,102
Well, I've already done the first part.

11
00:00:30,102 --> 00:00:35,785
I've figured out where 11.5 is. It's smack-dab in between 11 and 12.

12
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,316
It's eleven and five tenths.

13
00:00:37,316 --> 00:00:39,815
But let me find everything else. Let me mark everything else on this number line.

14
00:00:39,815 --> 00:00:44,698
So that's 1 tenth, 2 tenths, 3 tenths, 4 tenths, 5 tenths,

15
00:00:44,698 --> 00:00:50,085
6 tenths, 7 tenths, 8 tenths, 9 tenths and then 10 tenths right on the 12.

16
00:00:50,085 --> 00:00:53,333
It's not completely drawn to scale. I'm hand-drawing it as good as I can.

17
00:00:53,348 --> 00:00:58,212
So where is 11.7 going to be? Well this is 11.5.

18
00:00:58,212 --> 00:01:00,711
This is 11.6. This is 11.7.

19
00:01:00,711 --> 00:01:02,173
Eleven and seven tenths.

20
00:01:02,173 --> 00:01:06,370
1 tenth, 2 tenths, 3 tenths, 4 tenths, 5 tenths, 6 tenths, 7 tenths.

21
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,207
This is 11.7.

22
00:01:09,207 --> 00:01:12,413
And the way we've drawn our number line, we are increasing as we go

23
00:01:12,413 --> 00:01:16,188
to the right. 11.7 is to the right of 11.5.

24
00:01:16,188 --> 00:01:21,854
It's clearly greater than 11.5. 11.7 > 11.5

25
00:01:21,854 --> 00:01:26,173
And really, seriously, you didn't have to draw a number line to figure that out.

26
00:01:26,173 --> 00:01:31,781
They're both 11 and something else. This is 11 and 5 tenths. This is 11 and 7 tenths.

27
00:01:31,797 --> 00:01:35,199
So, clearly, this one is going to be greater.

28
00:01:35,199 --> 99:59:59,999
Both have 11, but this has 7 tenths as opposed to 5 tenths.
