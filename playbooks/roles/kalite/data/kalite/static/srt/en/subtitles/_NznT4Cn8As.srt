1
00:00:00,637 --> 00:00:05,071
In pretty much all of the vidoes so far we have been asuming an economic ideal.

2
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:10,533
And that economic ideal is perfect... perfect competition.

3
00:00:10,533 --> 00:00:15,157
And perfect competiton is exactly what you think it is... a competition.

4
00:00:15,157 --> 00:00:18,772
But what I want do in this video is think about in a little bit more exact terms.

5
00:00:18,772 --> 00:00:24,486
In terms of what are the ground rules we need to have, to really have this ideal perfect competition.

6
00:00:24,486 --> 00:00:27,183
It's important to realize that there is very few markets

7
00:00:27,183 --> 00:00:29,480
that are truly perfectly competitive

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,667
and those that are very good for consumers

9
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:34,772
but there are, that get very close to being perfectly competitive.

10
00:00:34,772 --> 00:00:37,884
And if we have time we will discuss those in this video.

11
00:00:37,884 --> 00:00:41,791
Now to be perfectly competive, you have to have many competitors.

12
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,423
So one of the first stipulations is

13
00:00:43,423 --> 00:00:48,213
many players... many... players.

14
00:00:48,213 --> 00:00:51,471
And they need to be competing for the kind of the same buyer

15
00:00:51,471 --> 00:00:53,372
and the kind of offering the same thing.

16
00:00:53,372 --> 00:00:57,573
And so they need to have identical products.

17
00:00:57,573 --> 00:01:00,262
Remeber this, we are talking about an economic ideal here,

18
00:01:00,262 --> 00:01:05,681
there is very few markets where the product is absolutely identical or the service is absolutely identical.

19
00:01:05,681 --> 00:01:08,404
But we are talking about an economic ideal over here.

20
00:01:08,404 --> 00:01:10,808
The next condition we need is -

21
00:01:10,808 --> 00:01:12,690
- no barriers to entry -

22
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:17,367
no barriers... no barriers to entry.

23
00:01:17,367 --> 00:01:22,504
So if at any given moment, it looks attractive for other people to go into that market.

24
00:01:22,504 --> 00:01:25,362
Other people will go into that market and there is nothing that's

25
00:01:25,362 --> 00:01:27,117
really going to stop them.

26
00:01:27,117 --> 00:01:30,237
If the firms that are already in the market are already making an economic profit -

27
00:01:30,237 --> 00:01:32,790
- that means that it's good -

28
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,234
it's a good option for people to do that.

29
00:01:35,234 --> 00:01:39,167
You can do better in this market than your opportunity cost.

30
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:41,708
And so people will enter into that market.

31
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:46,099
In order for this market to be perfectly competitive, we can't have any barriers.

32
00:01:46,099 --> 00:01:48,304
Nothing stoping those people.

33
00:01:48,304 --> 00:01:50,456
On top of that there can be

34
00:01:50,456 --> 00:01:53,301
no advantage for established firms.

35
00:01:53,301 --> 00:01:59,636
No advantange for existing firms.

36
00:01:59,636 --> 00:02:02,548
So once someone jumps into the fray

37
00:02:02,548 --> 00:02:05,452
and they' re going to be and assuming they are somewhat competent,

38
00:02:05,452 --> 00:02:08,903
they are going to be able to compete on kind of equal terms

39
00:02:08,903 --> 00:02:11,036
with the people that are already there.

40
00:02:11,036 --> 00:02:13,709
And at the last one - and this is important -

41
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:16,959
is that you have to have really good price information

42
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,673
that the buyers and the sellers all have to know about each others

43
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:20,170
prices.

44
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,611
The buyers needs to know all the prices,

45
00:02:21,611 --> 00:02:24,411
so they can really do good comparison shopping.

46
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:26,481
And the sellers needs to know everyones prices,

47
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:28,568
so they can really match prices really well.

48
00:02:28,568 --> 00:02:34,617
So good price information.

49
00:02:34,617 --> 00:02:37,505
Now there are many different types of markets that

50
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:39,501
somewhat approximate perfect competition.

51
00:02:39,501 --> 00:02:42,968
There are very few that are completely purly perfect competion.

52
00:02:42,968 --> 00:02:47,237
But one of them does come to mind. One of them does that definitely come to mind,

53
00:02:47,237 --> 00:02:49,709
is the US airline industry.

54
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:52,433
And the US airline and we can think about these bullet points

55
00:02:52,433 --> 00:02:53,754
and how closely it matches it,

56
00:02:53,754 --> 00:02:57,937
there are definitely many different airlines,

57
00:02:57,937 --> 00:03:00,367
they don't offer identical products how do

58
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:03,434
i'm sure the airlines would take. Would not agree

59
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:05,423
they would say they are differentiating on their service..

60
00:03:05,423 --> 00:03:06,575
What apple food they give or I guess

61
00:03:06,575 --> 00:03:07,905
don't give to you.

62
00:03:07,905 --> 00:03:09,901
How much they are charging for the baggage check in and all the rest.

63
00:03:09,901 --> 00:03:12,812
But for the most part of consumers it just look like

64
00:03:12,812 --> 00:03:15,425
they just want an economy class ticket from San Francisco to New York

65
00:03:15,425 --> 00:03:18,095
and they view them as almost identical products.

66
00:03:18,095 --> 00:03:22,970
So the airline industry does pretty well in this first point -

67
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,474
- no barriers to entry -

68
00:03:24,474 --> 00:03:27,707
Well, there are some barriers to entry in the US airline industry,

69
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,343
you need a few billion dollars,

70
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:34,430
you need to either find or borrow or whatever so you can buy the capital so you can start operating

71
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,463
planes or I guess you can rent the planes.

72
00:03:36,463 --> 00:03:39,167
Either way you need a lot of capital to get into this business.

73
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:41,547
You need access to airport terminal that you have to lease

74
00:03:41,547 --> 00:03:44,208
and landing rights and all the rest.

75
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,633
So there are some barriers to entry,

76
00:03:45,633 --> 00:03:49,063
but for the most part, at least in the United states, if you are a US,

77
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:52,305
a US operator and you know this,

78
00:03:52,305 --> 00:03:54,571
there are some barriers specific for entry of foreign operators.

79
00:03:54,571 --> 00:03:56,828
But if you are an US operator and you have the capital,

80
00:03:56,828 --> 00:04:02,540
you will be able to be the next Virgin America or SWA or Jet blue.

81
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,018
So for little some barriers to entry, but they are low,

82
00:04:06,018 --> 00:04:10,371
it is not like the government just saying that no-one else can start a new airlines.

83
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:12,558
No advantage for existing airlines.

84
00:04:12,558 --> 00:04:14,166
Yeah that's somewhat true!

85
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:17,416
If i'll start a new airlines tomorrow and it's offering

86
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:21,575
comparable rates and comparable service I could imagine people

87
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:23,902
would be willing to take to this airlines.

88
00:04:23,902 --> 00:04:25,870
So the airline industry seems pretty good there

89
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,711
and good price information,

90
00:04:27,711 --> 00:04:30,286
this is why the airline industry definitely came to my mind because

91
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:34,730
I can't imagine an industry where you have better price information that

92
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,934
at least now after the internet came about

93
00:04:36,934 --> 00:04:38,906
that than in the airline industry.

94
00:04:38,906 --> 00:04:43,027
You want a flight from SF to NY you go to any of these travel sites

95
00:04:43,027 --> 00:04:46,036
Orbitz, Kayak, Expedia or where ever you go to

96
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:50,159
and you get all the flights listed for you and listed by price.

97
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:58,707
They can sort them by price and you can actually pick and you know you can and it's no people do they pick a flight that might be 5 or 6 Dollars,

98
00:04:58,707 --> 00:05:05,624
but they can compare based on few Pennys or on few Dollars. So there is extremely good...there is extremely good price information.

99
00:05:05,624 --> 00:05:12,304
Now we'll see the sellers have all of the IT systems to keep track of the airlines pressure is going as well.

100
00:05:12,304 --> 00:05:18,286
So their air travelling discreet like most discreet is not absolutely perfect competition but they gets pretty close to

101
00:05:18,286 --> 00:05:21,087
perfect competition. And you even see that in real world

102
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:29,568
that's very hard for the airlines to make really a lot of profit and the really and you know what do you know about accounting profit or even economic profit.

103
00:05:29,568 --> 00:05:35,505
And you could see that when I've from this supply-demand curve right over here, so on this axis,

104
00:05:35,505 --> 00:05:39,948
the horizontal axis, this is the quantity, this is a measure of quantity of kind of airline service

105
00:05:39,948 --> 00:05:44,408
and we're measuring in billions of seat miles per week and

106
00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:50,015
I don't know, it sounds like the strange thing. But really what the strange, Ok, give me a week, tell me all of the seats

107
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:58,427
that are any use and multiply those number of seats, so the number as seat miles and give a weak number of seats

108
00:05:58,427 --> 00:06:14,807
times the miles that be or the average miles per seat in a given week and that gives you how much aircraft, this is air measure of air travel in the scene of US in that week.

109
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:21,350
And on this axis, this is the price, this is price per, and we should actually say price per seat miles.

110
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:31,230
Price per seat mile. And of course you have your supply curve right over here - this is your supply curve. At first

111
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:37,756
they start providing those first few miles, it's relative to the airlines doing and willing to do that relatively inexpensively

112
00:06:37,756 --> 00:06:43,895
maybe they are finding most ABS airports, that maybe their landing rates are cheaper or it's cheaper to lease things or whatever,

113
00:06:43,895 --> 00:06:49,048
but I'll say start doing running more and more routes between smaller and smaller cities, maybe smaller in

114
00:06:49,048 --> 00:06:54,904
less efficient planes. It's nice to come more and more expensive for them to supply those incremental miles.

115
00:06:54,904 --> 00:07:01,500
And we'll see on the demand side if air travel is very very expensive, very few people are going to want to travel,

116
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:09,506
they're going to be very low travel and it happens, if it's very cheap many people are going to want to travel.

117
00:07:09,506 --> 00:07:16,354
Now let's say this is where the market is right now, and now we'll see we have an equilibrium price, we have an quilibrium price

118
00:07:16,354 --> 00:07:23,438
right over there, and we have an equlibrium quantity of seat miles. But let's say, let's say that the price level

119
00:07:23,438 --> 00:07:32,170
in order for the players that actually have an economic profit is over here. So it is right over here.

120
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:48,284
So this is the price needed, this is the price needed for zero economic profit, or you could say for neutral economic profit or you could even say for normal profit.

121
00:07:48,284 --> 00:07:59,891
For economic profit to be equal to 0. So that point if that was, if that is the price,

122
00:07:59,891 --> 00:08:06,971
than the firms are offering airline travels, they are a kind of neutral between shuting down and continuing to offer service. But note this,

123
00:08:06,971 --> 00:08:14,551
the way I draw it here, there is substantial lower than the current equilibrium price. So what this is saying, is the current equilibrium

124
00:08:14,551 --> 00:08:22,901
price is good behind this or just higher at all, these firms in the market right now are generating an economic profit.

125
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:32,122
Definitely positive economic profit. So what's happening, there is a positive economic profit, that means there is an accent in for other firms to enter into,

126
00:08:32,122 --> 00:08:38,001
to enter into this industry. So what's going to happen is, this is going to be supply curve right at the moment,

127
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:44,077
but as soon as other carrier realizes that they can or any of the carrier realizes they can offer a more,

128
00:08:44,077 --> 00:08:50,490
it doesn't mean to have new carriers entry, it could be existing carriers just offering maybe buying more planes or offering more routes.

129
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:58,573
Than maybe a little bit later the supply curve shifts like this, the supply curve shifts like that and this would be our new equilibrium price.

130
00:08:58,573 --> 00:09:06,801
And we're still making an economic profit, because new equlibrium price is still, is still higher than the price needed for zero economic profit.

131
00:09:06,801 --> 00:09:13,077
So still more people will continue to enter and so than you might have a new supply curve that looks like this.

132
00:09:13,077 --> 00:09:20,637
And this is our new equlibrium price and what's happening, we're travelling, we're travelling down to the right along the demand curve.

133
00:09:20,637 --> 00:09:31,638
As more supply comes on, we're seeing the decreasing quantity and the price is going down. But still, the equlibrium price is higher than this line right over here,

134
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:38,636
so even more people will enter, even more people will enter till we get to the point right over there, and that point

135
00:09:38,636 --> 00:09:46,017
now the equlibrium price is the price in which all of the players are having zero economic profit, and there is no incentive

136
00:09:46,017 --> 00:09:54,107
for more people to enter into it, because than the equilibrium price will go down,or there, essentialy right now, the economic profit is zero.

137
00:09:54,107 --> 00:09:59,562
So everyone is neutral in this scenario. So I'll want to leave you there, so this is what happens

138
00:09:59,562 --> 00:10:05,303
when perfect competition, that there is no barriers to enter, there is more people to enter in in in, the price goes down,

139
00:10:05,303 --> 00:10:14,351
the quantity is dropping. In this scenario, we're willing to do next interesting. But if we didn't have a perfect competition, especially what happens if something like,

140
00:10:14,351 --> 00:10:17,000
something like, I don't know, something like a monopoly?
