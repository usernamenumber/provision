00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,136
Find the probability of rolling doubles on two six-sided dice numbered from 1 to 6.

2
00:00:07,136 --> 00:00:12,807
So when they're talking about rolling doubles they're just saying if I roll the two dice I get the same number on the top of both.

3
00:00:12,807 --> 00:00:15,598
So for example, a 1 and a 1; that's doubles.

4
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:22,136
Two and a two, that is doubles. A three and a three, a four and a four, a five and a five, a six and a six.

5
00:00:22,136 --> 00:00:32,355
All of those are instances of doubles. So the event in question is rolling doubles on two six-sided dice numbered from 1 to 6.

6
00:00:32,355 --> 00:00:38,872
So let's think about all of the possible outcomes. Or another way to think about it, let's think about the sample space here.

7
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:47,541
So what can we roll on the first die? So let me write this as die number 1. What are the possible rolls?

8
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:51,536
Well they're numbered from 1 to 6: it's a six sided die.

9
00:00:51,536 --> 00:00:57,536
So I can get a one, a two, a three, a four, a five, or a six.

10
00:00:57,536 --> 00:01:02,610
Now let's think about the second die. So die number 2.

11
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:11,108
Well exact same thing. I can get a one, a two, a three, a four, a five, or a six.

12
00:01:11,108 --> 00:01:17,139
Now, given these possible outcomes for each of the die, we can now think of the outcomes for both die.

13
00:01:17,139 --> 00:01:27,204
So for example, in this, in this... (Let me draw a grid here just to make it a little bit neater. Draw a line there, and then a line right over there...)

14
00:01:27,204 --> 00:01:33,203
Let me draw actually, several of these just so we can really just do this a little bit clearer.

15
00:01:33,203 --> 00:01:39,537
Let me draw a full grid. All right.

16
00:01:39,537 --> 00:01:41,939
And then the vertical lines.

17
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:47,736
Only a few more left. There we go.

18
00:01:47,736 --> 00:01:53,473
Now, all this top row, these are the outcomes where I roll a one on the first die.

19
00:01:53,473 --> 00:01:59,335
So I roll a one on the first die. These are all of those outcomes.

20
00:01:59,335 --> 00:02:02,735
And this would be a one on the second die, but I'll fill that in later.

21
00:02:02,735 --> 00:02:07,411
These are all the outcomes where I roll a two on the first die.

22
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:13,030
This is where I roll a three on the first die.

23
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:19,540
Four... I think you get the idea (on the first die). And then a five on the first die...

24
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:27,472
Then this last row is all the outcomes where I roll a six on the first die.

25
00:02:27,472 --> 00:02:34,279
Now, we can go through the columns, and this first column is where we roll a one on the second die.

26
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:44,469
This is where we roll a two on the second die.

27
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:51,691
Here's where we roll a three on the second die.

28
00:02:51,691 --> 00:03:01,072
Here's where we have a four.

29
00:03:01,072 --> 00:03:08,536
And then here's where we roll a five on the second die.

30
00:03:08,536 --> 00:03:18,714
(Filling this in... Whoops..) This last column is where we roll a six on the second die.

31
00:03:18,915 --> 00:03:29,530
Now every one of these represents a possible outcome. This outcome is where we roll a one on the first die and a one on the second die.

32
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:36,726
This outcome is where we roll a three on the first die and a two on the second die. This outcome is where we roll a four on the first die and a five on the second die.

33
00:03:36,726 --> 00:03:42,583
And you can see here there are thirty-six possible outcomes: Six times six possible outcomes.

34
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:55,327
Now with this out of the way, how many of these outcomes satisfy our criteria... Satisfy the criteria of rolling doubles on two six-sided die?

35
00:03:55,327 --> 00:04:01,139
How many of these outcomes are essentially described by our event?

36
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:12,560
Well, we see them right here. Doubles, that's rolling a one and a one, a two and a two, a three and a three, a four and a four, a five and a five, and a six and a six.

37
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:23,661
So we have one, two, three, four, five, six events that satisfy this event (or the outcomes that are consistent with this event)...

38
00:04:23,661 --> 00:04:32,327
Now given that, let's answer our question. What is the probability of rolling doubles on two six-sided die numbered from 1 to 6?

39
00:04:32,327 --> 00:04:41,889
Well the probability is going to be equal to the number of outcomes that satisfy our criteria, or the number of outcomes for this event.

40
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:53,661
... Which are six (we just figured that out) over the total number of outcomes... Over the size of our sample space.

41
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:56,803
So this right over here, we have thirty-six total outcomes.

42
00:04:56,803 --> 00:05:06,391
So we have thirty-six outcomes, and if you simplify this, six over thirty-six is the same thing as 1/6.

43
00:05:06,391 --> 99:59:59,999
So the probability of rolling doubles on two six-sided die numbered from 1 to 6 is 1/6.
