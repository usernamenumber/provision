1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,674
If you've practiced

2
00:00:01,674 --> 00:00:04,729
and hopefully, memorized your multiplication tables,

3
00:00:04,729 --> 00:00:08,785
you'll now find out that you're prepared to do most any multiplication problem.

4
00:00:08,785 --> 00:00:11,058
You just have to understand,

5
00:00:11,058 --> 00:00:12,699
I guess for lack of a better word,

6
00:00:12,699 --> 00:00:14,340
the system of how to do it.

7
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,836
But we're not just going to teach you the system,

8
00:00:15,836 --> 00:00:17,760
we're going to show you why it works.

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,280
So let's start with a multiplication problem

10
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,420
that you probably think that you don't know how to do.

11
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:30,119
Let's do sixteen times nine.

12
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,865
Sixteen times nine.

13
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:32,858
And you immediately might say,

14
00:00:32,858 --> 00:00:36,004
Sal, I haven't memorized my sixteen times tables,

15
00:00:36,004 --> 00:00:38,790
there's no way I'm going to be able to do that problem.

16
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,214
And my answer to you is, you can absolutely do it

17
00:00:41,214 --> 00:00:43,294
because we can break it down into problems

18
00:00:43,294 --> 00:00:45,262
that you do know the answer to.

19
00:00:45,262 --> 00:00:46,532
The way you do this one

20
00:00:46,532 --> 00:00:49,710
is first multiply nine times the ones place here.

21
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,240
So you multiply nine times six.

22
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,820
And I think you know what nine times six is.

23
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,760
I'll write it down here.

24
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:01,090
So nine times six is fifty-four.

25
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,380
You know that from your multiplication tables.

26
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,861
And so what you do is you write fifty-four,

27
00:01:05,861 --> 00:01:08,975
but you only write the four down here in the ones place,

28
00:01:08,975 --> 00:01:11,935
and you carry the five.

29
00:01:11,935 --> 00:01:13,710
That's exactly what you're doing.

30
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,004
We also use word carry when you add

31
00:01:17,004 --> 00:01:19,755
and you kind of have an extra five to deal with,

32
00:01:19,755 --> 00:01:21,113
but let's just call that carrying.

33
00:01:21,128 --> 00:01:24,113
For lack of better words.

34
00:01:24,113 --> 00:01:28,429
Now, we then multiply nine times one.

35
00:01:28,429 --> 00:01:29,329
Nine times one.

36
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:31,158
Well, that's straightforward.

37
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:33,490
Nine times one is equal to nine.

38
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,650
Anything times one is equal to itself.

39
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,670
But we have this five sitting up here, so nine times one,

40
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,740
we have to add that five.

41
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:45,144
So we have to add that plus five.

42
00:01:45,144 --> 00:01:47,102
And so what do we get?

43
00:01:47,102 --> 00:01:50,160
So nine times one plus five

44
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:55,638
is nine plus five, which is fourteen.

45
00:01:55,638 --> 00:01:57,702
Let me write it right there.

46
00:01:57,702 --> 00:01:59,689
Fourteen.

47
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:00,590
And there you have it.

48
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,180
Sixteen times nine is one hundred forty-four.

49
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,534
And if you remembered your times tables up to twelve

50
00:02:06,534 --> 00:02:08,440
you also realize that's twelve times twelve.

51
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,260
But just knowing only these two pieces of information,

52
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,655
we were able to solve a harder problem.

53
00:02:14,655 --> 00:02:17,499
Now you might say, Okay Sal, that's a neat little trick you just did,

54
00:02:17,499 --> 00:02:19,220
but how does it work?

55
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,540
And you should always ask that.

56
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,160
You shouldn't just take it--

57
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,150
you shouldn't just memorize the system and assume that it works.

58
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,920
And to explain that I'm just going to rewrite these numbers.

59
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,870
I can rewrite sixteen as ten-- let me do it right here.

60
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,980
Ten plus six.

61
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,930
This is sixteen.

62
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:37,865
And I can rewrite nine,

63
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:40,760
well, I'm just going to write nine as nine. Right there.

64
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,190
And now let me do the multiplication problem.

65
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,960
I'll put a little multiplication sign out there.

66
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,830
So first I want to multiply the nine times the six.

67
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,810
And you might say, hey Sal, why did you divide it this way?

68
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:56,490
Well, I wanted to separate the ones place from the tens place.

69
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,580
This one here that's in the second column,

70
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,990
it isn't a one, it's a ten.

71
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,880
It's a ten plus a six,

72
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,390
so that's why I wanted to write it that way.

73
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,050
But anyway, let's do this problem.

74
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,310
So we do it the exact same way we did it before.

75
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,707
We say nine times six--

76
00:03:10,707 --> 00:03:11,838
let me write that down.

77
00:03:11,838 --> 00:03:15,400
Nine times six is equal to fifty-four.

78
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,528
But instead of writing fifty-four,

79
00:03:16,528 --> 00:03:21,740
I'm going to write that's equal to fifty plus four.

80
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,060
Nine times six is equal to fifty plus four.

81
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,270
Well, this is my ones column right here.

82
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,340
Let me make a little dotted line.

83
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,580
This is my ones column.

84
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,847
So I can only put a four down here,

85
00:03:32,847 --> 00:03:35,410
but I need something to do with the fifty.

86
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,773
I have to put it some place

87
00:03:36,773 --> 00:03:39,537
and just the convention or at least the way that I've learned it,

88
00:03:39,537 --> 00:03:40,685
you put the fifty up here.

89
00:03:40,685 --> 00:03:42,166
I could've put the fifty down here too,

90
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:46,730
as long as we remember that this fifty now goes into this column.

91
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,330
So you can stick the fifty over here.

92
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,470
That's what we did in the first video.

93
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,370
I just wrote a five.

94
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,854
In that first video, I just put a five here

95
00:03:55,854 --> 00:03:57,830
because that was in the tens place.

96
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,827
A five here really means fifty.

97
00:03:59,827 --> 00:04:01,710
A one here really means ten.

98
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,479
But now I'm writing it out,

99
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:06,620
so you can see that they really mean fifty and ten.

100
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,952
And then you say, what's nine times ten?

101
00:04:09,952 --> 00:04:14,853
Nine times ten.

102
00:04:14,853 --> 00:04:16,278
Well, you've memorized this.

103
00:04:16,278 --> 00:04:18,860
And anything times ten is just that anything with a zero.

104
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,430
So it's ninety.

105
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,831
So it's nine times ten is ninety,

106
00:04:22,831 --> 00:04:25,043
and then we want to add fifty to it.

107
00:04:25,043 --> 00:04:26,860
So we want to add fifty to it.

108
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,709
What's ninety plus fifty?

109
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:33,850
It is one hundred forty.

110
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,850
So nine times ten is ninety,

111
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,010
plus fifty is one hundred forty.

112
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,543
And we could rewrite one hundred forty

113
00:04:40,543 --> 00:04:45,620
as one hundred plus forty just to be consistent.

114
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,553
So what we'll do is we'll put the forty down here,

115
00:04:50,553 --> 00:04:51,872
and then we carry the one hundred,

116
00:04:51,872 --> 00:04:53,406
but the one hundred really doesn't go anywhere.

117
00:04:53,406 --> 00:04:54,925
I mean we could write it up here.

118
00:04:54,925 --> 00:04:57,342
We could put it--

119
00:04:57,342 --> 00:04:58,882
Well, we could write the one hundred over here.

120
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,250
We could put it over here.

121
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,180
There's a bunch of different places we could put the one hundred,

122
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:06,125
but the important thing is that it sticks out into this next column

123
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,230
that I haven't drawn yet.

124
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,020
So then you'll put one hundred here.

125
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,207
So our answer is one hundred plus forty plus four,

126
00:05:13,207 --> 00:05:16,154
which is one hundred forty-four.

127
00:05:16,154 --> 00:05:19,440
Hopefully you found that reasonably explanatory.

128
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,001
Let's try a couple of other problems,

129
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:24,860
because I think it's all about seeing examples.

130
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:35,155
So let's try fifty-five times eight.

131
00:05:35,155 --> 00:05:37,774
Fifty-five times eight.

132
00:05:37,774 --> 00:05:39,255
Same exercise.

133
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,510
First, you start with the eight.

134
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,800
Eight times five.

135
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,820
Let me write it down.

136
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,130
Eight times five we know is forty.

137
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,950
So eight times five, you write the zero down here.

138
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,840
It's zero plus forty.

139
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,820
And then you say eight times five again.

140
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,000
That's forty.

141
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:59,560
But then you add the four to here, so you get forty-four.

142
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,100
So it's four hundred forty.

143
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,184
And you can try to do it the same way I did that last one

144
00:06:04,184 --> 00:06:07,170
where I broke it out into fifty plus five and then an eight.

145
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,183
But I think with more examples,

146
00:06:08,183 --> 00:06:11,910
you'll see this will all become a bit of second nature to you.

147
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,714
So let me do another one in this--

148
00:06:14,714 --> 00:06:18,830
let me do it in this salmon. This light red, salmon color.

149
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:27,260
So let's say I had seventy-eight times-- let's do it times seven.

150
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,950
Eight times seven.

151
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,240
Eight times seven is fifty-six.

152
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,050
Let me write it-- this is a different problem now.

153
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,550
So eight times seven is equal to fifty-six.

154
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:40,470
We write the six down here, put the five up there.

155
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,590
Seven times seven is forty-nine.

156
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,540
Seven times seven is equal to forty-nine.

157
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,750
But we have to add this five up here, so you add this five.

158
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,045
What's forty-nine plus five?

159
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:53,480
Well, that's fifty-four.

160
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,580
So seven times seven is forty-nine.

161
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,960
Plus five is fifty-four.

162
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,790
Five hundred forty-six.

163
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,562
Ten minutes ago,

164
00:07:02,562 --> 00:07:06,175
you probably never thought that you could figure out the seventy-eight multiplication tables,

165
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,190
but you see it's a pretty straightforward process.

166
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,680
Let's do a bunch more.

167
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,810
I'm just going to do these until we all just collapse.

168
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,804
Collapse from multiplication fatigue.

169
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:25,865
Let's do an eighty-nine times-- let's do it times three.

170
00:07:25,865 --> 00:07:27,600
What's three times nine?

171
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,390
Three times nine is equal to twenty-seven.

172
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,070
Put the seven in the ones place.

173
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,287
Put the two up here in the tens place,

174
00:07:35,287 --> 00:07:36,847
because it's twenty plus seven.

175
00:07:36,847 --> 00:07:38,360
Two tens is twenty.

176
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,330
Plus seven is twenty-seven.

177
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,950
And then three times eight is twenty-four.

178
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,240
Three times eight is equal to twenty-four.

179
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,535
But I have this two sitting up here

180
00:07:47,535 --> 00:07:49,120
so I'm going to have to add a two.

181
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,150
So I get twenty-six.

182
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,940
Three times eight is twenty-four.

183
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,510
Plus two is twenty-six.

184
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,760
Two hundred sixty-seven.

185
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,135
Now I'm going to do another one,

186
00:07:59,135 --> 00:08:04,147
but I'm going to up the stakes a little bit.

187
00:08:04,147 --> 00:08:06,689
Just when you thought you were getting comfortable with this,

188
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:09,177
I'm going to make you uncomfortable!

189
00:08:09,177 --> 00:08:20,374
Let's do two hundred thirty-nine times six.

190
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:23,178
I thought this was a video about two-digit multiplication times one-digit.

191
00:08:23,178 --> 00:08:24,712
Well, it is, but I just want to show you

192
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:27,992
that you can really do any number of digits times this one digit,

193
00:08:27,992 --> 00:08:29,562
and it's really the same process.

194
00:08:29,562 --> 00:08:32,480
You could probably guess how we're going to do it.

195
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,446
So what's six times nine?

196
00:08:34,446 --> 00:08:35,870
Let me write it here.

197
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,870
Six times nine.

198
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,430
We saw this show before.

199
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,670
This is fifty-four.

200
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:45,080
So we put the four down here, we put the five in the tens place

201
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:48,640
because the fifty in fifty-four is really five tens.

202
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,820
Fair enough.

203
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,184
Now we're going to do six times three.

204
00:08:52,184 --> 00:08:54,397
So six times three,

205
00:08:54,397 --> 00:08:56,742
that's equal to eighteen.

206
00:08:56,742 --> 00:08:58,530
We still have that five hanging out there,

207
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:02,178
so we have to add that five up there and we get--

208
00:09:02,178 --> 00:09:03,682
what's eighteen plus five?

209
00:09:03,682 --> 00:09:10,160
So six times three is eighteen, plus five is twenty-three.

210
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,902
Just to be clear,

211
00:09:10,902 --> 00:09:13,788
we didn't multiply six times three and add five.

212
00:09:13,788 --> 00:09:14,645
We actually,

213
00:09:14,645 --> 00:09:18,360
if you looked at where we are in our place on the problem,

214
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,973
this is actually a thirty.

215
00:09:19,973 --> 00:09:21,400
I just happened to do a three here.

216
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,490
But this is six times thirty plus fifty.

217
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,830
Because thirty-nine is three tens or thirty.

218
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:32,200
So this number, actually, even though we said six times three is eighteen.

219
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,140
Plus five is twenty-three.

220
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,390
This number is really two hundred thirty.

221
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,790
So we put the three in the tens place.

222
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,490
Actually, let me do it in a different color

223
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,800
than what I did up here.

224
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,380
This is equal to twenty-three.

225
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,228
We can put the three in the tens place

226
00:09:49,228 --> 00:09:52,610
and then put this two up here.

227
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:57,350
Now we're almost done, one multiplication left.

228
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:01,140
This is the six times the two.

229
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,290
That's an easy one.

230
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,490
That's twelve.

231
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,710
But I have this other two hanging out up here,

232
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,320
so I have to add this other two.

233
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,770
So plus two.

234
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,251
And what is that equal to?

235
00:10:12,251 --> 00:10:15,025
That is equal to

236
00:10:15,025 --> 00:10:17,365
twelve plus two is equal to fourteen.

237
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,620
So I write the four.

238
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,120
So six times two is twelve.

239
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,830
Plus two is fourteen.

240
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,500
I write the four down here.

241
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,497
If there was any more digits I would write the one up there,

242
00:10:25,497 --> 00:10:26,740
but there aren't any more digits.

243
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,090
So I write the one over here.

244
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:35,210
So two hundred thirty-nine times six is one thousand four hundred thirty-four.

245
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:38,197
Let's do another one.

246
00:10:38,197 --> 00:10:40,980
I need to get some space cleaned out.

247
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,869
And hey, while we're escalating the situation,

248
00:10:42,869 --> 00:10:46,615
let's go to four-digits.

249
00:10:46,615 --> 00:10:53,058
Let's do seven thousand three hundred sixty-two times--

250
00:10:53,058 --> 00:10:53,814
let's do a hard one.

251
00:10:53,814 --> 00:10:56,210
Times nine.

252
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,320
So what's nine times two?

253
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,900
And I won't do this side math over here.

254
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,260
I think you're getting the pattern.

255
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,380
What's nine times two?

256
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,202
Nine times two is eighteen.

257
00:11:06,202 --> 00:11:08,130
Eighteen.

258
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:10,125
Then we do nine times six.

259
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:13,960
Nine times six is fifty-four.

260
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:18,675
And fifty-four plus one is fifty-five.

261
00:11:18,675 --> 00:11:20,841
Fifty-five.

262
00:11:20,841 --> 00:11:23,254
What's nine times three?

263
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:27,140
Nine times three is twenty-seven-- if we have that memorized.

264
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:34,370
And then twenty-seven plus five is thirty-two.

265
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,348
Let me switch colors.

266
00:11:36,348 --> 00:11:38,961
Thirty-two.

267
00:11:38,961 --> 00:11:40,707
And then you have nine times seven.

268
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:44,158
That's sixty-three, but we have this three hanging out there.

269
00:11:44,158 --> 00:11:47,350
So that's nine times seven is sixty-three,

270
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,460
plus three is sixty-six.

271
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,032
You write the six here,

272
00:11:52,032 --> 00:11:54,552
and then you have no where to put the sixty in the sixty-six,

273
00:11:54,552 --> 00:11:56,872
so you write that down here as well.

274
00:11:56,872 --> 00:12:00,494
And so seven thousand three hundred sixty-two times nine

275
00:12:00,494 --> 00:12:05,024
is sixty-six thousand two hundred fifty-eight.

276
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:07,200
Hopefully you found that useful.
