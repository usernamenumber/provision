1
00:00:00,636 --> 00:00:04,158
Let's do some examples dividing fractions

2
00:00:04,436 --> 00:00:08,373
Let's say that I have negative 5/6

3
00:00:08,524 --> 00:00:15,988
divided by 3/4.

4
00:00:15,988 --> 00:00:19,524
We've already talked about, when you divide by something,

5
00:00:19,524 --> 00:00:22,936
it is the exact same thing as multiplying by its reciprocal,

6
00:00:22,966 --> 00:00:32,516
so this is going to be the exact same thing as negative 5/6 times the reciprocal of

7
00:00:32,516 --> 00:00:40,825
3/4, which is 4/3. I'm just swapping the numerator with the denominator, its going to be 4/3.

8
00:00:40,825 --> 00:00:47,076
We've already seen examples multiplying fractions, this is going to be the numerators times each other,

9
00:00:47,076 --> 00:01:03,913
so we are multiplying -5 times 4. And the denominator is 6 times 3

10
00:01:03,913 --> 00:01:09,936
Now the numerator here you see we have a negative number. You might already know that 5 times 4 is 20,

11
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:13,528
and you just have to remember, look we are multiplying in negative times a positive.

12
00:01:13,528 --> 00:01:21,002
We are going to essentially gonna have a -5, 4 times (-5 + -5 + -5 + -5) = -20.

13
00:01:21,002 --> 00:01:27,139
So the numerator here is -20, and the denominator is 18.

14
00:01:27,139 --> 00:01:30,315
You get -20 over 18, but we can simplify this.

15
00:01:30,315 --> 00:01:38,322
Both the numerator and the denominator are both divisible by 2, so lets divide them by 2.

16
00:01:38,322 --> 00:01:42,920
If we divide the numerator and the denominator by 2 just to simplify this,

17
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,861
and I've picked to because it is the largest number that goes into both of these.

18
00:01:45,892 --> 00:01:53,323
Its the greatest common divisor of 20 and 18. 20 divided by 2 is 10, and 18 divided by 2 is 9.

19
00:01:53,323 --> 00:02:02,220
So negative 5/6 divided by 3/4.. Oh, I have to be very careful here, it is -10

20
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:07,464
Just how we always learned, if you have a negative divided by a positive,

21
00:02:07,464 --> 00:02:09,730
then you're going to get a negative value.

22
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:24,327
Let's do another example, let's say that I have -4 divided by -1/2.

23
00:02:24,327 --> 00:02:30,139
So using the exact logic that we just said, we said "Hey, dividing by something is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal".

24
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:36,726
So this is going to be equal to -4. Instead as writing it as -4, let me just write it

25
00:02:36,726 --> 00:02:41,217
as a fraction, so we are clear at what its numerator and its denominator is.

26
00:02:41,217 --> 00:02:45,138
So -4 is the exact same thing as -4/1

27
00:02:45,138 --> 00:02:51,727
And we are going to multiply that times the reciprocal of -1/2.

28
00:02:51,727 --> 00:02:56,817
The reciprocal of -1/2 is -2/1.

29
00:02:56,817 --> 00:03:05,276
You could view it as 2/-1 or -2/1, or you could just have as -2. Either way, these are all the same value.

30
00:03:05,276 --> 00:03:08,260
And now we are ready to multiply. Notice all I did here

31
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:13,463
I rewrote the -4 just as -4/1. -4 / 1 is -4

32
00:03:13,463 --> 00:03:19,224
And here for the -1/2, since I am multiplying now by its reciprocal,

33
00:03:19,224 --> 00:03:29,373
I've swapped the denominator and the numerator.

34
00:03:29,373 --> 00:03:34,996
And I'm ready to multiply, this is going to be equal to

35
00:03:34,996 --> 00:03:42,320
-4 times -2 in the numerator, then in the denominator,

36
00:03:42,320 --> 00:04:00,260
its going to be 1 times 1. And so this gives us a negative times a negative, so we will get a positive value here

37
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:04,260
and 4 times 2 is 8, so this is a positive 8 over 1, and 8 / 1 is just 8.
