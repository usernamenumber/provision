1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,532
So when we name organic molecules,

2
00:00:03,532 --> 00:00:05,565
the core of what we think about

3
00:00:05,565 --> 00:00:09,065
is just how many carbons form the chain or

4
00:00:09,065 --> 00:00:11,070
form the ring that we're looking at?

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,799
So let's say I have something like this.

6
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:14,872
And hopefully, you're reasonably familiar

7
00:00:14,872 --> 00:00:16,484
with what this represents.

8
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:17,645
And I'll review it a little bit.

9
00:00:17,645 --> 00:00:20,207
So let's say I have something like this.

10
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,660
That is the molecular structure right there.

11
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,912
And so the first question you should be asking is

12
00:00:24,912 --> 00:00:27,632
how many carbons are there there?

13
00:00:27,632 --> 00:00:28,938
And some of you might say, wait,

14
00:00:28,938 --> 00:00:30,142
how is that even a molecule?

15
00:00:30,142 --> 00:00:32,590
And just as a review, the end point of every line

16
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,120
represents a carbon.

17
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,620
So that's a carbon, that's a carbon, that's a carbon,

18
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,860
that's a carbon, that's a carbon, that's a carbon.

19
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:46,950
And we have one, two, three, four, five, six carbons

20
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,210
and we have no double bonds.

21
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,107
So if you have all of that information

22
00:00:51,107 --> 00:00:53,500
you're ready to name this molecule.

23
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,370
And before I actually name it, let me just kind of give you

24
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,290
all of the different prefixes.

25
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:03,370
So if you have one carbon, the prefix is meth-.

26
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,400
If you have two carbons, the prefix is eth-.

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,930
And it's good to memorize at least up to about 10.

28
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,760
And actually it kind of repeats after that.

29
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,760
If you have three carbons, the prefix is prop-.

30
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,390
Prop- like propane, and you've heard of ethane and methane.

31
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,140
So you'll see all of that soon.

32
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,560
Four, you're talking about but-.

33
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,850
Five, and after five it kind of becomes the traditional

34
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,480
prefixes that we associate with a lot of these numbers.

35
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,770
So at five, it's pent-, like pentagon.

36
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,280
Six, it's hex- like hexagon.

37
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,850
Seven is hept-.

38
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,410
Eight is oct-, like octagon.

39
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,000
Nine is non-.

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,355
Ten is dec-.

41
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,410
And then after that,

42
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,918
it kind of starts to have a pattern here and

43
00:01:55,918 --> 00:01:58,260
you're not going to really deal with things much beyond

44
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,189
the teens, but I'll just write them down here

45
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:01,460
just out of interest.

46
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:05,850
Eleven is undec-.

47
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,306
And for those of you who know French,

48
00:02:07,306 --> 00:02:09,362
I'm not one of them, but I know that

49
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:12,360
one in French is une, or in Spanish, uno.

50
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,400
So it's 1 and 10: 11.

51
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,320
Twelve is dodec-.

52
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,510
Do or dos, if you're speaking Spanish, for 2.

53
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,720
Dec for 10, 2 and 10, that's 12.

54
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,980
Thirteen, you could imagine what it's going to be.

55
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,537
It is tridec-.

56
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:37,734
Fourteen is tetradec-.

57
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,330
A tetrapod is something with four legs.

58
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,520
And after that it, becomes very systematic.

59
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:47,529
At fifteen is pentadec-.

60
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,730
Notice pent-, 5 and 10.

61
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,870
Sixteen is hexadec-.

62
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,690
Seventeen is heptadec-.

63
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,390
So it just goes on and on and on.

64
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,328
I don't think I've got to go-- it's hexadec-, heptadec-,

65
00:02:59,328 --> 00:03:01,486
octodec- is eighteen,

66
00:03:01,486 --> 00:03:03,463
nineteen is nonadec-,

67
00:03:03,463 --> 00:03:05,886
and then twenty is actually iso-.

68
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,140
But we won't even go into that.

69
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,570
This'll probably serve our purposes.

70
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:12,920
I mean, I could go up to sixteen is hexadec-.

71
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,690
So this is just how many carbons are

72
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,730
in our longest chain.

73
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,460
What I drew here is just one chain.

74
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,430
So we could immediately--let's try to name it.

75
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,310
Well, how many carbons do we have here?

76
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,110
Well, we have one, two, three, four, five, six carbons.

77
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:30,260
So we'll be dealing with hex- as a prefix.

78
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,760
And then to get, I guess, the post-fix on this prefix, or

79
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,252
the kind of the root, you look to see if there are

80
00:03:35,252 --> 00:03:36,940
any double bonds here.

81
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,420
And there are no double bonds here.

82
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,470
And if we have no double bonds in this carbon chain,

83
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,560
we're dealing with an alkane.

84
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,180
This is called an alkane,

85
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,992
which is a general term for all of the chains of carbons

86
00:03:48,992 --> 00:03:50,805
that have no double bonds on them

87
00:03:50,805 --> 00:03:53,390
or no triple bonds: all single bonds.

88
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,025
So in this situation, you take hex- for six,

89
00:03:56,025 --> 00:03:58,660
so this is hex-.

90
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,710
And then, because it's an alkane, it gets

91
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,170
the -ane from alkane.

92
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,490
So this is hex- this is hexane.

93
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,190
Let's do another one.

94
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,120
Let's say I have this thing right here.

95
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,640
I'll draw-- let's make it even longer.

96
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,529
So let's say I have that thing right there.

97
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:18,160
So how many carbons do we have?

98
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,660
We have 1-2-3-4-5-6-7 carbons.

99
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,850
They're all single bonds, so it's an alkane.

100
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,640
So this will be seven carbons.

101
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:37,800
It is heptane because we have all single bonds.

102
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,900
Now, if things form a chain, or if things form a ring,

103
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,850
I should say, we put the prefix cyclo- in front of it.

104
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,930
So if I have-- let me show you what I'm talking about.

105
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:53,910
So if I just have five carbons, one, two, three,

106
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,480
four, so one, two, three, four, five.

107
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,520
OK, so that's five right there.

108
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,570
I have one, two, three, four, five carbons in a chain.

109
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,643
If I just have five carbons in a chain like this,

110
00:05:04,643 --> 00:05:10,139
this would be pentane.

111
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,260
But if I have five carbons and they form a ring,

112
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,090
so let me draw it.

113
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,680
So it's one, two, three, four, five carbons

114
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,030
and it forms a ring.

115
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,230
Let me make the drawing a little bit better.

116
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,890
So it's really, I'm just drawing a pentagon.

117
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,980
But notice, this has five carbons on it.

118
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,910
I can draw the carbons here.

119
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,950
Carbon, carbon, carbon, carbon, carbon.

120
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,310
And just as a review, what you don't see is the hydrogens

121
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:33,900
they're bonded to.

122
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,741
Each of these guys have two bonds,

123
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:37,629
so they must have two bonds with something else

124
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:38,809
and those are going to be with hydrogens.

125
00:05:38,809 --> 00:05:41,360
And I'll draw it here just as a bit of a review, but you

126
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,160
notice very quickly, the drawing gets extremely messy

127
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,790
when you draw the two hydrogens

128
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,100
on each of these carbons.

129
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,210
So it's a little bit over-- maybe

130
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,260
I shouldn't be doing that.

131
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:52,800
But there you go.

132
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,420
So it becomes very messy when you draw the hydrogens, so

133
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,130
it's better to just assume that they're there.

134
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,110
If we don't draw all four bonds of the carbon, the other

135
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,810
two bonds are going to be with hydrogen.

136
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,413
So here, you might say, OK, this is an alkane,

137
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:05,450
because I don't have any double bonds here.

138
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,380
All of these are single bonds with the carbon.

139
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,320
I have five carbons, so you might say this is pentane, but

140
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,380
you have to think about one more thing.

141
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,670
It's in a ring, so we add the prefix cyclo- to it.

142
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:19,227
So this is, because it's a ring, we write cyclopentane.

143
00:06:19,227 --> 00:06:21,559
Cyclopentane.

144
00:06:23,543 --> 00:06:24,860
So let me just break that apart.

145
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,750
This tells us that we're dealing with a ring.

146
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,580
You see that this is a ring right there.

147
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:37,420
This tells us that we're dealing with five carbons,

148
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,255
and then this tells us right here,

149
00:06:39,255 --> 00:06:41,090
the -ane part, that tells us

150
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,880
that they are all single bonds.

151
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,180
All carbon-carbon single bonds.

152
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,940
No double or triple bonds.

153
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,030
All single bonds.

154
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:51,940
So let's go the other way.

155
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:56,030
Let's start with the word and let's see if we can figure out

156
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,225
what the actual structure would look like.

157
00:07:02,683 --> 00:07:11,318
Let's say I have cyclononane.

158
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,040
So what is this telling me?

159
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,120
This tells me I'm dealing with a ring.

160
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,570
That is a ring.

161
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,170
It's going to have a ring structure.

162
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:22,520
It's going to have nine carbons, nine C's, and then

163
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,026
it's an alkane, so they're all going to be single bonds.

164
00:07:29,651 --> 00:07:34,735
Single bonds

165
00:07:34,735 --> 00:07:36,850
So if I want to draw it, I want to draw nine carbons in a ring

166
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,465
it's not a trivial thing to draw.

167
00:07:38,465 --> 00:07:46,190
I'll try my best, so let's see, that's one, two, three,

168
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:51,690
four, five, six, seven, eight.

169
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,760
Let's see, let me draw it.

170
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,470
I'll try a little a better shot at it.

171
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:06,900
Let's see, I've one, two, three, four, five, six,

172
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,390
seven, eight, and then nine.

173
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,910
And then you can connect the last. So let me make sure that

174
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,870
this is-- and obviously, I could have drawn it better

175
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,950
than that, but hopefully, you can see all of the edges here.

176
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:24,660
So I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

177
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,650
nine carbons.

178
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,277
It's in a cycle, it's in a ring.

179
00:08:29,277 --> 00:08:30,460
I have nine carbons.

180
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,750
They're all single bonded, so this is cyclononane.

181
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,240
Although, there's probably better ways to draw that ring right there.

182
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:46,881
So if someone were to tell you: octane,

183
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:49,860
and that word might feel familiar to you from the gas station.

184
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,310
They are literally talking about the molecule octane.

185
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,060
And now you know, or at least you have a sense of what

186
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,720
they're talking about.

187
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:01,000
The oct- tells you that you have eight carbons.

188
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,680
There's no cyclo- in front of it, so it's not a cyclo.

189
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,180
It's just going to be a chain.

190
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,418
And then the -ane part tells you that they're all single bonds,

191
00:09:09,418 --> 00:09:11,580
so it's just going to be eight carbons in a chain.

192
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,580
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

193
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,600
It's just going to look like that.

194
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,980
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

195
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,290
In the next few videos, we'll add more to these molecules

196
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,990
and make the names even more complex.
