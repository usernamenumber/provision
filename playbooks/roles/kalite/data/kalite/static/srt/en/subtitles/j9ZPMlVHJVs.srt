1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,170
In the last video we were able to

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:05,970
calculate the total sum of squares for these 9 data points right here,

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,030
these 9 data points are grouped into three different groups,

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,800
or if you wanted to speak generally into "m" different groups.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,940
What I want to do in this video is to figure out how much of this total sum of squares

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,360
how much of this is due to variation within each group

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,230
versus variation between the actual groups.

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,970
So first let's figure out the total variation within the groups,

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:36,200
so let's call that the sum of squares within, I'll do that in yellow,

10
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,940
actually I've already used yellow so let's do this, I'm going to do blue.

11
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:45,910
So the sum of squares within.

12
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:50,850
Let me make that clear, that stands for within.

13
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,710
So we want to see how much of a variation is

14
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,960
due to how far each of these data points are from their central tendencies,

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,550
from their respective means.

16
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,300
So this is going to be equal to-- let's start with these guys.

17
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,220
So instead of taking the distance between each data point and the mean of means

18
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,530
I'm going to find the distance between each data point and that group's mean

19
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:16,550
because we want to square the total sum of squares

20
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:20,680
between each data point and their respective means

21
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,740
3 minus the mean here, it's 2. Squared.

22
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,700
+ 2 minus 2 squared,

23
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,480
+ 1 minus 2 squared.

24
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,600
I'm going to do this for all of the groups,

25
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,520
but for each group the distance between it's data point and it's mean

26
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:57,420
so + minus 4 squared, + 3 minus 4 squared, + 4 minus 4 squared

27
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,360
and finally we have the third group,

28
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,910
and we're finding all of the sum of squares from each point to it's central tendency

29
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,640
within that group, we're going to add them all up.

30
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,280
And then we find the third group so we have

31
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:20,550
5 minus 6 squared + 6 minus 6 squared, + 7 minus 6 squared.

32
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,390
And what is this going to equal?

33
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:29,050
So this is going to be equal to, so up here it is going to be 1 + 0 + 1,

34
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,510
that's going to be equal to 2,

35
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:39,660
+ this is going to be equal to 1 + 1 + 0, so another 2,

36
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:51,130
+ this is going to be equal to 1 + 0 + 1, so that's 2 over here.

37
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,470
Our total sum of squared within is 6.

38
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,870
So one way to think about it, our total variation was 30.

39
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:08,660
Based on that calculation 6 of that 30 comes from variation within these samples.

40
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,940
Now the next thing I want to think about is

41
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,560
how many degrees of freedom do we have in this calculation

42
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,300
how many, kind of, independent data points do we actually have,

43
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:27,610
well for each of these, over here, if you know we have 'n' data points for each one,

44
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,440
in particular n is 3 here, but if you know

45
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:37,900
n minus one of them, you can always find the 'n'th one, if you know the actual sample mean.

46
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,130
So in this case for any of these groups if you know 2 of these data points,

47
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,410
you can always figure out the third.

48
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,550
If you know these two, you can always

49
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,770
figure out the third if you can figure out the sample mean.

50
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,420
So in general let's figure out the degrees of freedom here.

51
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:57,330
You have, for each group, when you did this you had 'n' minus one degrees of freedom.

52
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:03,970
Remember 'n' is the number of data points you had in each group,

53
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:09,310
so you have n minus one degrees of freedom for each of these groups,

54
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,430
so it's n-1, n-1, n-1,

55
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:19,210
or you have, let me put it this way, you have 'n-1' for each of these groups, and

56
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,660
and there are m groups.

57
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:28,890
So there's m times n-1 degrees of freedom.

58
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:32,790
In this particular case, each group, n -1 is two

59
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,970
or each case, you have 2 degrees of freedom

60
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:45,680
and there's three groups about the there are 6 degrees of freedom.

61
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:51,340
In the future we may do a more detailed discussion of what degrees of freedom mean

62
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,380
how to mathematically think about it.

63
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:58,470
But the simplest way to think about it is really truly independent data points.

64
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,180
Assuming you knew in this case the central statistic

65
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,670
that we used to calculate the squared distances of each of these, if you know them already

66
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,230
the third data point actually could be calculated from the other 2.

67
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,490
So we have 6 degrees of freedom over here.

68
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:18,090
Now that was how much of the total variation is due to variation within each sample.

69
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:23,800
Now think about how much of the variation is due to variation between between the sample.

70
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,380
And to do that, we're going to calculate-- get a nice color here--

71
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,750
I think I've run out of all the colors--

72
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:40,570
we'll call it sum of squares between, the B stands for between.

73
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,560
So another way to think about it, how much of this total variation

74
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,300
is due to the variation between the means, between the central tendency

75
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,990
that's what we're going to calculate right now and

76
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:56,430
how much is due to variation from each data points to its mean.

77
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:01,480
Let's figure out how much is due variation between these guys over here.

78
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,840
One way to think about it for each of these data points--

79
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,360
let's just think about this first group.

80
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,850
For this first group, how much variation for each of these guys is

81
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:18,230
due to the variation between this mean and the mean of means.

82
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:23,200
For the first guy up here-- I'll just write it all out explicitly--

83
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:31,000
the variation is going to be its sample mean, 2, minus the mean of means, squared.

84
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,010
And then for this guy, it's going to be the same thing.

85
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:36,880
His sample mean, 2, minus the mean of means, squared.

86
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,220
Plus same thing for this guy.

87
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,920
His sample mean, 2, minus the mean of means, squared.

88
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:52,200
Or another way to think about it, this is equal to 3 times 2-4 squared,

89
00:06:52,440 --> 00:07:02,650
which is the same thing as 3 times 4. It's equal to 12.

90
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,810
I can do it for each of them. I actually want to find the total sum.

91
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,640
Let me just write it all out. I think that might be an easier thing to do.

92
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,230
For all of these guys combined

93
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:18,040
the sum of squares due to the differences between the samples.

94
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,460
So that's from the first sample, the contribution from the first sample.

95
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,130
And then from the second sample,

96
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,760
you have this guy here, five-- sorry, you don't want to calculate him.

97
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:33,040
For this data point, the amount of variation due to the difference between the means

98
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,530
is going to be 4-4 squared

99
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,090
Same thing for this guys, would be 4-4 squared.

100
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,610
We're not taking it into consideration. We're only taking its sample mean into consideration.

101
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,110
And then finally + 4-4 square.

102
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,370
We're taking this

103
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,500
minus this squared for each of these data points.

104
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,240
And then finally we'll do that with the last group.

105
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:09,940
Sample mean is 6, so it's going to be 6-4 squared plus 6-4 squared plus 6-4 squared.

106
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,070
Now, let's think about

107
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:19,490
how many degrees of freedom we had in this calculation right over here.

108
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:24,650
Well, in general, I guess the easiest way to think about it is,

109
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,410
how much information do we have, assuming that we knew the mean of means?

110
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:31,310
If we know the mean of means, how much here is new information?

111
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:37,160
If you know 2 of these if you know the mean of the means and you know 2 of the sample means,

112
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,470
you can always figure out the third.

113
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,590
If you know this one and this one, you can figure out that one.

114
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,710
If you know that one and that one, you can figure out that one.

115
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:46,190
That's because this is the mean of these means over here.

116
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,530
So in general, if you m groups or if you have m means,

117
00:08:51,660 --> 00:09:05,880
there are m-1 degrees of freedom here.

118
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,900
With that said, in this case m is 3.

119
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:14,760
So we could say, there's 2 degrees of freedom for this exact example.

120
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,670
Let's actually calculate the sum of squares between. So what is this going to be?

121
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:29,340
This is going to be equal to, this right here is, 2-4 is -2, squared is 4.

122
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:33,230
And then we have three fours over here, so three times four.

123
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:51,070
Plus 3 times 0, plus 3 times (6-4)2, which is 3 times 4. So plus 3 times 4.

124
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:59,730
And we get 3 times 4 is 12 + 0 + 12, is equal to 24.

125
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,960
So the sum of squares, or the variation due to

126
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,690
what's the difference between the groups, between the means is 24.

127
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,570
Not let's put this altogether. We said that

128
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:17,820
the total variation when you look at all 9 data points, is 30.

129
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,350
Let me write that over here.

130
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:25,500
So the total sum of squares is equal to 30.

131
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:32,590
We figured out the sum of squares between each data point and its central tendency, its sample

132
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:39,640
mean, we figure out and we totaled it all up, we got 6 for the sum of squares within.

133
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:48,800
The sum of squares within was equal to 6. In this case, it was 6 degrees of freedom.

134
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:54,430
If we wanted to write generally, there were m times n-1 degrees of freedom.

135
00:10:54,650 --> 00:11:03,300
Actually for the total, we figured out we had m times n -1 degrees of freedom.

136
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,140
Let me write the degrees of freedom in this column over here.

137
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,240
In this case, the number turned out to be 8.

138
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,930
And then just now, we calculated the sum of squares between the samples.

139
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:18,180
The sum of squares between the samples is equal to 24

140
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:24,200
and we figured out that it had m-1 degrees of freedom which ended up being 2.

141
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:31,210
Now the interesting thing here-- this is why this analysis of variance all fits nicely together.

142
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:35,230
In future videos we will think about how we can actually test hypotheses

143
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,040
using some of the tools that we're thinking about right now--

144
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,700
is that the sum of squares within plus the sum of squares between

145
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,940
is equal to the total sum of squares.

146
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,680
So the way to think about is that the total variation in this data right here

147
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,800
can be described as the sum of the variation within each of these groups

148
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
when you take that total

149
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:03,750
plus the sum of the variation between the groups.

150
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,970
And even the degrees of freedom work out.

151
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:08,900
The sum of squares between has 2 degrees of freedom.

152
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,730
The sum of squares within each of the groups had 6 degrees of freedom.

153
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,190
2+6 is 8.

154
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:19,120
That's the total degrees of freedom we have for all of the data combined.

155
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,910
It even works if you look at the more general.

156
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:26,730
Our sum of squares between had m-1 degrees of freedom.

157
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:33,140
Our sum of squares within had m(n-1) degrees of freedom.

158
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:37,900
This is equal to m-1+mn-m.

159
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:43,900
These guys cancel out. This is equal to mn-1 degrees of freedom,

160
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,610
which is exactly the total degrees of freedom we have for the total sum of squares.

161
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:53,660
So the whole point of the calculations that we did in the last and this video

162
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:58,880
is just to appreciate that this total variation over here

163
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,160
can be viewed as the sum of these two component variations,

164
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:12,150
how much variation within each of the samples

165
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:16,910
plus how much variation is there between the means of the samples.

166
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,580
Hopefully that's not too confusing.
