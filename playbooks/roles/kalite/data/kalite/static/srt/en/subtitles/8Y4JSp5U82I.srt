1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,920
   

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,860
We've learned a little
bit about gravity.

3
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,120
We've learned a little bit
about electrostatic.

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,280
So, time to learn about
a new fundamental

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,300
force of the universe.

6
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,180
And this one is probably second
most familiar to us,

7
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:13,890
next to gravity.

8
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,140
And that's magnetism.

9
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,310
   

10
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,240
Where does the word come from?

11
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,810
Well, I think several
civilizations-- I'm no

12
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:29,810
historian-- found these
lodestones, these objects that

13
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,260
would attract other objects
like it, other magnets.

14
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,720
Or would even attract metallic
objects like iron.

15
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,260
Ferrous objects.

16
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,320
And they're called lodestones.

17
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,150
That's, I guess, the Western
term for it.

18
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,800
And the reason why they're
called magnets is because

19
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,590
they're named after lodestones
that were found near the Greek

20
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:51,840
province of Magnesia.

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,800
   

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,330
And I actually think the people
who lived there were

23
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,160
called Magnetes.

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,790
But anyway, you could Wikipedia
that and learn more

25
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,459
about it than I know.

26
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,090
But anyway let's focus
on what magnetism is.

27
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,010
And I think most of us have at
least a working knowledge of

28
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,490
what it is; we've all played
with magnets and we've dealt

29
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:16,470
with compasses.

30
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,910
But I'll tell you this right
now, what it really is, is

31
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,250
pretty deep.

32
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,740
And I think it's fairly-- I
don't think anyone has-- we

33
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,940
can mathematically understand
it and manipulate it and see

34
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,410
how it relates to electricity.

35
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,890
We actually will show you the
electrostatic force and the

36
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:37,480
magnetic force are actually the
same thing, just viewed

37
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,090
from different frames
of reference.

38
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,420
I know that all of
that sounds very

39
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,560
complicated and all of that.

40
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,370
But in our classical Newtonian
world we treat them as two

41
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,040
different forces.

42
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,830
But what I'm saying is although
we're kind of used to

43
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:52,480
a magnet just like we're used to
gravity, just like gravity

44
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,620
is also fairly mysterious when
you really think about what it

45
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,530
is, so is magnetism.

46
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,290
So with that said, let's at
least try to get some working

47
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,550
knowledge of how we can
deal with magnetism.

48
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:07,650
So we're all familiar
with a magnet.

49
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,610
I didn't want it to be yellow.

50
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,060
I could make the boundary
yellow.

51
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,100
No, I didn't want it to
be like that either.

52
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:21,360
So if this is a magnet,
we know that a magnet

53
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,120
always has two poles.

54
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,330
It has a north pole
and a south pole.

55
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,450
And these were just labeled
by convention.

56
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,630
Because when people first
discovered these lodestones,

57
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,300
or they took a lodestone and
they magnetized a needle with

58
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,190
that lodestone, and then that
needle they put on a cork in a

59
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:44,840
bucket of water, and that needle
would point to the

60
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,000
Earth's north pole.

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,250
They said, oh, well the side of
the needle that is pointing

62
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,820
to the Earth's north, let's
call that the north pole.

63
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,860
And the point of the needle
that's pointing to the south

64
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,300
pole-- sorry, the point of the
needle that's pointing to the

65
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,210
Earth's geographic
south, we'll call

66
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,230
that the south pole.

67
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,050
Or another way to put it,
if we have a magnet, the

68
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,790
direction of the magnet or the
side of the magnet that

69
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,980
orients itself-- if it's allowed
to orient freely

70
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,330
without friction-- towards our
geographic north, we call that

71
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,280
the north pole.

72
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,820
And the other side is
the south pole.

73
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:23,710
And this is actually a little
bit-- obviously we call the

74
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,930
top of the Earth
the north pole.

75
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,600
You know, this is
the north pole.

76
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,530
And we call this
the south pole.

77
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,840
And there's another notion
of magnetic north.

78
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,380
And that's where-- I guess, you
could kind of say-- that

79
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:47,270
is where a compass, the
north point of a

80
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,690
compass, will point to.

81
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,730
And actually, magnetic north
moves around because we have

82
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,150
all of this moving fluid
inside of the earth.

83
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,215
And a bunch of other
interactions.

84
00:03:55,215 --> 00:03:56,690
It's a very complex
interaction.

85
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:01,130
But magnetic north is actually
roughly in northern Canada.

86
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,240
So magnetic north
might be here.

87
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,510
So that might be
magnetic north.

88
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,420
And magnetic south, I don't know
exactly where that is.

89
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,340
But it can kind of move
around a little bit.

90
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,360
It's not in the same place.

91
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,860
So it's a little bit off the
axis of the geographic north

92
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,180
pole and the south pole.

93
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,540
And this is another slightly
confusing thing.

94
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,720
Magnetic north is the geographic
location, where the

95
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,970
north pole of a magnet
will point to.

96
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:31,730
But that would actually be the
south pole, if you viewed the

97
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,980
Earth as a magnet.

98
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,240
   

99
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,800
So if the Earth was a big
magnet, you would actually

100
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,820
view that as a south
pole of the magnet.

101
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,780
And the geographic
south pole is the

102
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,640
north pole of the magnet.

103
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,390
You could read more about that
on Wikipedia, I know it's a

104
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,390
little bit confusing.

105
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,520
But in general, when most
people refer to magnetic

106
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,920
north, or the north pole,
they're talking about the

107
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,930
geographic north area.

108
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,940
And the south pole is the
geographic south area.

109
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,170
But the reason why I make this
distinction is because we know

110
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,520
when we deal with magnets,
just like electricity, or

111
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,590
electrostatics-- but I'll show
a key difference very

112
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:10,760
shortly-- is that opposite
poles attract.

113
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,770
So if this side of my magnet is
attracted to Earth's north

114
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:19,730
pole then Earth's north pole--
or Earth's magnetic north--

115
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:22,690
actually must be the south
pole of that magnet.

116
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,370
And vice versa.

117
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,110
The south pole of my magnet here
is going to be attracted

118
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,090
to Earth's magnetic south.

119
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,770
Which is actually the
north pole of the

120
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,660
magnet we call Earth.

121
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,220
Anyway, I'll take Earth out of
the equation because it gets a

122
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,070
little bit confusing.

123
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,650
And we'll just stick to bars
because that tends to be a

124
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,930
little bit more consistent.

125
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:44,220
Let me erase this.

126
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,500
There you go.

127
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,750
I'll erase my Magnesia.

128
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,680
   

129
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,200
I wonder if the element
magnesium was first discovered

130
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,370
in Magnesia, as well.

131
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,870
Probably.

132
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,200
And I actually looked
up Milk of

133
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,920
Magnesia, which is a laxative.

134
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,780
And it was not discovered
in Magnesia, but it has

135
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,780
magnesium in it.

136
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,060
So I guess its roots could be
in Magnesia if magnesium was

137
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,410
discovered in Magnesia.

138
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,530
Anyway, enough about Magnesia.

139
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,870
Back to the magnets.

140
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:18,350
So if this is a magnet, and let
me draw another magnet.

141
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,700
Actually, let me erase
all of this.

142
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,990
   

143
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,935
All right.

144
00:06:24,935 --> 00:06:26,730
So let me draw two
more magnets.

145
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:32,840
   

146
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,700
We know from experimentation
when we were all kids, this is

147
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,810
the north pole, this
is the south pole.

148
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:43,210
That the north pole is going to
be attracted to the south

149
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,700
pole of another magnet.

150
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,490
And that if I were to flip this
magnet around, it would

151
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:52,480
actually repel north-- two north
facing magnets would

152
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,330
repel each other.

153
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,930
And so we have this notion,
just like we had in

154
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:01,120
electrostatics, that a magnet
generates a field.

155
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,520
It generates these vectors
around it, that if you put

156
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,840
something in that field that can
be affected by it, it'll

157
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,630
be some net force
acting on it.

158
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,850
So actually, before I go into
magnetic field, I actually

159
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:24,030
want to make one huge
distinction between magnetism

160
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,360
and electrostatics.

161
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,140
Magnetism always comes in
the form of a dipole.

162
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:30,910
What does a dipole mean?

163
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,700
It means that we
have two poles.

164
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,520
A north and a south.

165
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:40,430
In electrostatics, you
do have two charges.

166
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,480
You have a positive charge
and a negative charge.

167
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,630
So you do have two charges.

168
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,530
But they could be
by themselves.

169
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,230
You could just have a proton.

170
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,600
You don't have to have
an electron there

171
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,490
right next to it.

172
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:54,620
You could just have a proton and
it would create a positive

173
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,140
electrostatic field.

174
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,950
And our field lines are
what a positive point

175
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,000
charge would do.

176
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,260
And it would be repelled.

177
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:05,340
So you don't always have to have
a negative charge there.

178
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,250
Similarly you could just
have an electron.

179
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,690
And you don't have to
have a proton there.

180
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,460
So you could have monopoles.

181
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,740
These are called monopoles, when
you just have one charge

182
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,770
when you're talking about
electrostatics.

183
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,420
But with magnetism you
always have a dipole.

184
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,200
If I were to take this magnet,
this one right here, and if I

185
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:28,510
were to cut it in half, somehow
miraculously each of

186
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,150
those halves of that
magnet will turn

187
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,560
into two more magnets.

188
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,260
Where this will be the south,
this'll be the north, this'll

189
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,679
be the south, this will
be the north.

190
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:41,200
And actually, theoretically,
I've read-- my own abilities

191
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,110
don't go this far-- there could
be such a thing as a

192
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,200
magnetic monopole, although
it has not been

193
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,320
observed yet in nature.

194
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,130
So everything we've seen in
nature has been a dipole.

195
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,260
So you could just keep cutting
this up, all the way down to

196
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,000
if it's just one
electron left.

197
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,230
And it actually turns out that
even one electron is still a

198
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,400
magnetic dipole.

199
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,400
It still is generating, it still
has a north pole and a

200
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,310
south pole.

201
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,830
And actually it turns out, all
magnets, the magnetic field is

202
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:12,380
actually generated by the
electrons within it.

203
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,710
By the spin of electrons and
that-- you know, when we talk

204
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,970
about electron spin we
imagine some little

205
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,430
ball of charge spinning.

206
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,910
But electrons are-- you
know, it's hard to--

207
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,900
they do have mass.

208
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,590
But it starts to get
fuzzy whether they

209
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,720
are energy or mass.

210
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,990
And then how does a ball
of energy spin?

211
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:27,510
Et cetera, et cetera.

212
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:31,900
So it gets very almost
metaphysical.

213
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,220
So I don't want to go
too far into it.

214
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,710
And frankly, I don't think you
really can get an intuition.

215
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,080
It is almost-- it is a
realm that we don't

216
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,790
normally operate in.

217
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:43,340
But even these large magnets
you deal with, the magnetic

218
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,120
field is generated by the
electron spins inside of it

219
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,040
and by the actual magnetic
fields generated by the

220
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,620
electron motion around
the protons.

221
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,350
Well, I hope I'm not
overwhelming you.

222
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,370
And you might say, well, how
come sometimes a metal bar can

223
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,700
be magnetized and sometimes
it won't be?

224
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,940
Well, when all of the electrons
are doing random

225
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,220
different things in a metal bar,
then it's not magnetized.

226
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:10,590
Because the magnetic spins, or
the magnetism created by the

227
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,920
electrons are all canceling
each other out,

228
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,790
because it's random.

229
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:16,100
But if you align the spins of
the electrons, and if you

230
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,130
align their rotations, then you
will have a magnetically

231
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,060
charged bar.

232
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,620
But anyway, I'm past the
ten-minute mark, but hopefully

233
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,140
that gives you a little bit
of a working knowledge of

234
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,190
what a magnet is.

235
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:31,170
And in the next video, I will
show what the effect is.

236
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:34,490
Well, one, I'll explain how we
think about a magnetic field.

237
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,100
And then what the effect
of a magnetic

238
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,870
field is on an electron.

239
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,140
Or not an electron, on
a moving charge.

240
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,010
See you in the next video.

241
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:43,400
