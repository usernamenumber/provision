1
00:00:00,815 --> 00:00:09,451
What I want to do in this video is to give you an intuitive 
sense of how a market for currencies would actually work.

2
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:11,726
And it's very nonintuitive for a lot of people.

3
00:00:11,726 --> 00:00:17,067
Because we're going to be talking about 
currencies becoming more expensive or cheaper —

4
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:20,467
or the price of a currency [becoming more 
expensive or cheaper] in terms of another one.

5
00:00:20,467 --> 00:00:22,593
And what I just want to do 
is give you a very intuitive feel for that.

6
00:00:22,593 --> 00:00:27,841
So let's say — just because 
it's a hot topic right now —

7
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:32,392
let's just make the two currencies 
the Chinese renminbi and the U.S. dollar.

8
00:00:32,392 --> 00:00:35,828
And the unit of exchange — 
and China's a little confusing —

9
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:38,400
Because sometimes they use the word "renminbi" — 
sometimes they use the word "Yuan."

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,819
The Yuan is the unit of [exchange for] the renminbi.

11
00:00:41,819 --> 00:00:46,138
So let's say right now, if I were 
to just go on some website —

12
00:00:46,138 --> 00:00:48,867
And this is not the actual 
exchange rate right now.

13
00:00:48,867 --> 00:00:57,841
But let's say, right now, the quoted 
exchange rate is 10 Yuan per U.S. dollar.

14
00:00:57,841 --> 00:01:02,113
10 Yuan is equal to 1 US dollar.

15
00:01:02,113 --> 00:01:07,733
And every time I say "dollar" in this video, 
I'm referring to the US dollar. ( — is equal to 1 US dollar.)

16
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:09,657
I think this makes sense to a lot of people.

17
00:01:09,657 --> 00:01:13,084
If I have one dollar, [and] I want 
to convert it to Yuan, I get 10 of them [Yuan].

18
00:01:13,084 --> 00:01:18,205
If I have 10 Yuan and I want to convert [them] 
to dollars, someone is going to give me a dollar for [them].

19
00:01:18,205 --> 00:01:20,109
Now let's imagine a situation —

20
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:26,378
(And in the next few videos, I'll construst actual 
trade imbalances where this would actually happen.)

21
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:31,858
But let's say we live in a reality where there are 1,000 —

22
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:34,877
— so let's say someone has 1,000 Yuan.

23
00:01:34,877 --> 00:01:59,745
So let's say that this person right here 
has 1,000 Yuan — and wants to convert to dollars.

24
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,532
Now, let's say, on this side —

25
00:02:02,532 --> 00:02:05,829
And if we just superficially looked at this 1000 Yuan — 
and looked at the quoted rate,we'd say

26
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:11,913
"Hey, that 1000 Yuan — you divide, you get 
10 Yuan/dollar, so that should be a hundred dollars, at the quoted rate."

27
00:02:11,913 --> 00:02:14,258
Let's say you have two other actors over here.

28
00:02:14,258 --> 00:02:17,230
And obvioulsy, this market involves 
many, many more than just three people.

29
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:22,617
But this will help us simplify or at least understand, 
how these exchange rates would work.

30
00:02:22,617 --> 00:02:24,707
Let's say that this person right here —

31
00:02:24,707 --> 00:02:28,608
let's say that this person 
right here with the mustache —

32
00:02:28,608 --> 00:02:32,276
let's say that this person right 
over there, and maybe a hat as well —

33
00:02:32,276 --> 00:02:56,541
Let's say that he has 50 dollars — he has 
100 dollars that he needs to convert to Yuan.

34
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,538
Maybe he wants to buy some Chinese goods.

35
00:02:58,538 --> 00:03:03,414
Maybe he is a Chinese factory owner 
who sold his goods in the US for 100 dollars.

36
00:03:03,414 --> 00:03:06,526
And now he needs to convert it 
back to Yuan to pay his employees

37
00:03:06,526 --> 00:03:08,755
or pay his own mortgage, or who knows what.

38
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:13,074
And let's say that there's another person — 
Let's say there's another character over here.

39
00:03:13,074 --> 00:03:38,337
And let's say that she also she also has 
a hundred that needs to be converted into Yuan.

40
00:03:38,337 --> 00:03:40,334
So, net-net, what's happening here?

41
00:03:40,334 --> 00:03:44,003
What's the total demand to convert
Yuan into dollars, and dollars into Yuan?

42
00:03:44,003 --> 00:03:48,467
Well, if you look at the whole market, 
you have $200 that need to be converted into Yuan.

43
00:03:48,467 --> 00:03:51,067
So let me write this down.

44
00:03:51,067 --> 00:04:04,788
We have a situation where 200 dollars 
need to be converted into Yuan.

45
00:04:04,788 --> 00:04:12,447
And then, on the other side of that transaction,
we have 1000 Yuan that need to be converted into dollars.

46
00:04:12,447 --> 00:04:30,280
So, now we have 1,000 Yuan 
need to be converted into dollars.

47
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,017
And for simplicity, these are the only actors.
They are representing the entire market.

48
00:04:35,017 --> 00:04:41,937
Although, as we know, in currency markets especially,
there are thousands — or even millions —

49
00:04:41,937 --> 00:04:45,141
of actors actively participating in them.

50
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:46,116
So what's going to happen?

51
00:04:46,116 --> 00:04:50,867
All of these people might just go on the Internet,
and look up the current exchange rate

52
00:04:50,867 --> 00:04:53,467
or the last exchange that occurred — and [say]

53
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:58,600
"Hey, you know what, me over here, this $100, 
I should be able to convert into a 1000 Yuan."

54
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,733
But she also says "I should be able to convert 
this 100 dollars into a thousand Yuan."

55
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:08,600
So they collectively think that that 200 dollars 
can be converted into 2000 Yuan.

56
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,497
So I'll put this in question marks.

57
00:05:10,497 --> 00:05:16,992
So will they be able to convert
this into 2000 Yuan?

58
00:05:16,992 --> 00:05:21,271
And on this person over here, he's saying, 
"Well, just at the current exchange rate

59
00:05:21,271 --> 00:05:26,658
maybe I'll be able to get for my 
thousand yuan — maybe I'll get 100 dollars."

60
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:30,977
But everyone wants to maximize the amount 
of the other currency they get — for obvious reasons.

61
00:05:30,977 --> 00:05:32,649
They want to maximize the amount of money they get.

62
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:38,272
Now. Will these 2 people be able 
to convert their money into 2000 Yuan?

63
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:40,312
Remember. What I said is that this is the entire market.

64
00:05:40,312 --> 00:05:41,658
It's a huge [over]simplification.

65
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:45,977
But there is this imbalance here: 
more dollars into Yuan than Yuan into dollars.

66
00:05:45,977 --> 00:05:51,179
Now, they won't be able to convert into 2,000 Yuan, 
because there's only 1,000 Yuan that wants to be traded.

67
00:05:51,179 --> 00:05:55,080
(There's only 1,000 Yuan 
that wants to be traded.)

68
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,652
So you could imagine, this guy over here, maybe he 
wants to do it slowly, just to kind of see what the market is like.

69
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:06,643
So, let's say, at first he puts 
10 Yuan up — essentially for bid.

70
00:06:06,643 --> 00:06:08,315
You could do it either way.

71
00:06:08,315 --> 00:06:11,659
You could say that maybe one of 
these people put a dollar up for bid.

72
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:14,491
And this guy is bidding on that dollar in terms of Yuan.

73
00:06:14,491 --> 00:06:17,324
Or this guy is putting Yuan up for bid.

74
00:06:17,324 --> 00:06:20,343
And these guys are going 
to bid on it in terms of dollars.

75
00:06:20,343 --> 00:06:23,687
Either one. And that's why it's 
sometimes confusing with currency.

76
00:06:23,687 --> 00:06:25,498
It's because you are buying another currency.

77
00:06:25,498 --> 00:06:31,837
But since this guy['s currency] 
is more in demand —

78
00:06:31,837 --> 00:06:38,756
To simplify things, I'll make him the person that's 
kind of able to create an auction-type situation —

79
00:06:38,756 --> 00:06:44,701
which really is what the markets are trying to do, 
so that you can equalize supply and demand.

80
00:06:44,701 --> 00:06:49,484
So he might put out — he might initially say: 
"Hey, you know what? I want to convert —"

81
00:06:49,484 --> 00:06:53,710
He has 100 Yuan, and he wants to convert it.

82
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,704
So he says, "You know what? 
I'm willing to sell 100 Yuan for $10."

83
00:06:57,704 --> 00:07:02,208
So, let's say he sells 
100 Yuan for 10 dollars.

84
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:18,787
So he sells 100 — or offers, I should say — 
offers to sell 100 Yuan for 10 dollars.

85
00:07:18,787 --> 00:07:22,131
She just thinks that's a fair 
offer price, right over there.

86
00:07:22,131 --> 00:07:27,007
And that's this guy over here, this 
guy actually converting yuan into dollars.

87
00:07:27,007 --> 00:07:28,308
Well, what's going to happen?

88
00:07:28,308 --> 00:07:30,490
Well, one of these people 
are just going to jump at that.

89
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,487
They say, "Oh. You know what? 
I think that's a fair price."

90
00:07:32,487 --> 00:07:35,200
And so, let's say, this woman 
right over here takes it.

91
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,639
Actually both of them, maybe, 
saw that offer to sell 100 Yuan for 10 dollars.

92
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,401
And they both tried to click their mouse, 
or however they're trying to make the transaction [happen].

93
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:47,116
But let's say she clicks her mouse 
a little faster, and she gets the transaction.

94
00:07:47,116 --> 00:07:56,218
So let's say — Let's call this Person B, 
and this is Person A, and this is Person C.

95
00:07:56,218 --> 00:08:06,063
So Person B accepts.
So two things happened just then.

96
00:08:06,063 --> 00:08:09,128
One is, Person C says, 
"Well, that was pretty fast."

97
00:08:09,128 --> 00:08:14,794
"Someone was very willing 
to take it for 10 yuan per US dollar."

98
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:18,649
And then this guy goes, "Oh my! I need 
to convert my money into Yuan; but I wasn't able to."

99
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:20,460
"Someone else beat me to the punch!"

100
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:26,822
So this guy over here is like, "Hey, maybe people 
are willing to give me more dollars per yuan."

101
00:08:26,822 --> 00:08:38,809
So, let's say that this guy right over here — 
this guy in orange — he then offers to sell.

102
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:46,768
Let's say he wants to sell 
90 yuan for 10 dollars.

103
00:08:46,768 --> 00:08:53,548
Notice. The price of the Yuan has now gone up — 
or the price of the dollar has now gone down.

104
00:08:53,548 --> 00:08:58,146
Either one, those are symmetric statements. 
They mean the exact same thing.

105
00:08:58,146 --> 00:09:02,975
So, all of a sudden, this person has 
a lot of dollars he needs to convert into Yuan.

106
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,855
So he accepts really fast. 
So, person A accepts.

107
00:09:05,855 --> 00:09:07,852
And I'm doing a huge oversimplification.

108
00:09:07,852 --> 00:09:10,638
But it gives you the general idea 
to show you that this really is a market.

109
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:14,957
So Person A accepts.

110
00:09:14,957 --> 00:09:17,279
All of a sudden we have 
a new quoted exchange rate.

111
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,926
All of a sudden we have 
an exchange rate of —

112
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,459
What is this? — 9 Yuan.

113
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:34,555
So we have [a] new quoted rate — 
or the transaction happens at 9 Yuan per dollar.

114
00:09:34,555 --> 00:09:35,623
Now, what's happening?

115
00:09:35,623 --> 00:09:37,852
And I think you see the dynamic that is going to happen.

116
00:09:37,852 --> 00:09:44,493
There are more dollars that need to be converted into 
Yuan than Yuan that need to be converted into dollars

117
00:09:44,493 --> 00:09:49,648
So, this guy — as he sees that there's 
a lot of demand to get his 1000 Yuan —

118
00:09:49,648 --> 00:09:53,641
he's going to keep offering 
fewer and fewer Yuan per dollar.

119
00:09:53,641 --> 00:10:00,514
Or, these guys are going to start accepting 
fewer and fewer Yuan for each of their dollars.

120
00:10:00,514 --> 00:10:04,601
So, as this happens, 
the price of the Yuan will go up.

121
00:10:04,601 --> 00:10:06,598
Notice: the price of Yuan went up here.

122
00:10:06,598 --> 00:10:09,895
It was 10 Yuan per dollar; 
now it is 9 Yuan per dollar.

123
00:10:09,895 --> 00:10:12,219
Or you can say that 
the price of the dollar has gone down.

124
00:10:12,219 --> 00:10:15,965
And this will just keep happening until 
all of them are able to get rid of their currency.

125
00:10:15,965 --> 00:10:17,999
It's actually dependent.

126
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:20,971
There's no mathematical formula 
to say what the clearing price is.

127
00:10:20,971 --> 00:10:24,594
It's actually dependent on how badly
each of these people are willing to transact

128
00:10:24,594 --> 00:10:27,287
and really how good they 
are at gaming each other.

129
00:10:27,287 --> 00:10:33,092
But the general results here — and this is 
what I really want you to get from this video

130
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:39,431
is that because there's no law in 
a market exchange rate mechanism that says,

131
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:44,075
"This has to be the exchange rate" — 
we'll explore how you can peg it in the future

132
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:47,233
but there's nothing that says 
that this has to always be the case.

133
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:50,855
If there's more demand for Yuan than dollars — 
as we see in this example —

134
00:10:50,855 --> 00:10:56,922
the price of the dollar will go down.

135
00:10:56,922 --> 00:11:05,136
I'll do this in a — 
Price of dollar will go down. And then —

136
00:11:05,136 --> 00:11:09,919
which is the exact same thing — 
which means the exact same thing as,

137
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:15,492
"The price of yuan will go up —"

138
00:11:15,492 --> 00:11:17,210
I really want you to internalize this.

139
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:21,390
— will go up in terms of dollars.

140
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,826
[The] price of dollars, 
in terms of Yuan, will go down.

141
00:11:24,826 --> 00:11:26,869
And this is the crux of foreign exchange.

142
00:11:26,869 --> 00:11:32,860
If you can, at least, internalize these ideas and 
understand that there really is this market out here,

143
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,229
based on the supply and demand of Yuan.

144
00:11:35,229 --> 00:11:41,870
Over here, the demand for Yuan 
is exceeding its supply so price will go up, and —

145
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,820
Or you can do it the other way.

146
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:49,625
The demand for dollars is below its supply. 
So, the price will go down.

147
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,808
Anyway, I'll let you think about that for a little bit.

148
00:11:51,808 --> 00:11:57,891
And in the next video, we're going to apply this concept 
to see how this freely floating exchange rate

149
00:11:57,891 --> 99:59:59,999
can help equalize — or should help equalize — 
trade imbalances in an ideal world.
