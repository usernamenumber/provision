00:00:09,786 --> 00:00:10,727
In the 16th century,

2
00:00:10,727 --> 00:00:13,043
an Italian mathematician named Cardano

3
00:00:13,043 --> 00:00:15,651
had a well-known gambling addiction.

4
00:00:15,651 --> 00:00:17,141
He wrote letters in which he bragged

5
00:00:17,141 --> 00:00:20,906
about his ability to beat his friends at dice games.

6
00:00:20,906 --> 00:00:22,759
His trick was to place his bets

7
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:24,866
using his ideas from mathematics –

8
00:00:24,866 --> 00:00:28,564
instead of hunches or luck.

9
00:00:28,564 --> 00:00:30,192
He came up with the method of calculating

10
00:00:30,192 --> 00:00:32,968
the exact probability of random events,

11
00:00:32,968 --> 00:00:36,391
such as, say, rolling 'snake eyes' – (a pair of 1's).

12
00:00:36,391 --> 00:00:39,807
It is based on a powerful property Cardano noticed.

13
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:42,511
Every outcome – no matter how many dice you roll –

14
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:44,570
is equally likely.

15
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,566
This allowed him to calculate the probability

16
00:00:46,566 --> 00:00:50,722
by developing what's now called a 'probability space.'

17
00:00:50,722 --> 00:00:53,785
First, he counts all possible outcomes –

18
00:00:53,785 --> 00:00:55,506
known as the 'sample space.'

19
00:00:55,506 --> 00:00:59,211
For a single dice, these are the 6 possible faces.

20
00:00:59,211 --> 00:01:01,881
Then, he defines the event in question –

21
00:01:01,881 --> 00:01:03,338
such as rolling a one –

22
00:01:03,338 --> 00:01:05,521
which can occur in one way.

23
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:07,174
The probability is then found

24
00:01:07,174 --> 00:01:10,369
by dividing the event by all possible events

25
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:13,358
which in this case works out to 1/6.

26
00:01:13,358 --> 00:01:16,047
Realize the cold, calculating logic here.

27
00:01:16,047 --> 00:01:17,956
There is no such things as a 'lucky number' –

28
00:01:17,956 --> 00:01:19,662
no 'divine intervention.'

29
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:23,840
The probability of rolling any number is exactly 1/6.

30
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,358
Now the same logic applies when we roll multiple dice.

31
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:32,981
Imagine he needed to know the probability of rolling a pair.

32
00:01:32,981 --> 00:01:35,485
First, he'd count the size of the sample space.

33
00:01:35,485 --> 00:01:36,748
With two dice rolls,

34
00:01:36,748 --> 00:01:42,056
there are 36 possible outcomes: 6 x 6.

35
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:47,215
Then, he'd count the number of ways this event can occur.

36
00:01:47,215 --> 00:01:50,291
There are six different pairs.

37
00:01:52,353 --> 00:01:56,992
So, 6 divided by 36 is the probability of rolling a pair –

38
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,532
also 1/6.

39
00:01:58,532 --> 00:02:01,088
This simple yet powerful idea allowed Cardano

40
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,199
to bet according to the true probability –

41
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:04,907
while his opponents placed their bets

42
00:02:04,907 --> 00:02:08,406
based on hunches and lucky numbers.

43
00:02:08,406 --> 00:02:10,434
Remember, this works with multiple rolls.

44
00:02:10,434 --> 00:02:11,730
[So,] Imagine we needed to know

45
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,538
the exact probability of rolling three 1's.

46
00:02:15,538 --> 00:02:16,884
Simple!

47
00:02:16,884 --> 00:02:19,404
First, we'd figure out the size of the sample space.

48
00:02:19,404 --> 00:02:24,533
For three dice, this is 6 x 6 x 6, – or 216.

49
00:02:24,533 --> 00:02:27,886
And there is only one way to roll three 1's,

50
00:02:27,886 --> 00:02:32,370
so, the probability is 1 divided by 216 (or 1/216).

51
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,636
This was the trick:

52
00:02:33,636 --> 00:02:37,492
It was not based on magic, but mathematics.

53
00:02:37,492 --> 00:02:40,962
Remember, to calculate the probability of a random event –

54
00:02:40,962 --> 00:02:42,242
such as a dice roll –

55
00:02:42,242 --> 00:02:45,494
you divide the number of ways that event can occur

56
00:02:45,494 --> 00:02:48,061
by all possible outcomes.
