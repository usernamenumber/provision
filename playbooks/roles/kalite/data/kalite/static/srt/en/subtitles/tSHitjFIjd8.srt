00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,420
Welcome to the presentation
on 45-45-90 triangles.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,200
Let me write that down.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,300
How come the pen--
oh, there you go.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:15,770
45-45-90 triangles.

5
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,050
Or we could say 45-45-90 right
triangles, but that might be

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,630
redundant, because we know any
angle that has a 90 degree

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,110
measure in it is a
right triangle.

8
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,790
And as you can imagine, the
45-45-90, these are actually

9
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:30,910
the degrees of the
angles of the triangle.

10
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,220
So why are these
triangles special?

11
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,720
Well, if you saw the last
presentation I gave you a

12
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:43,950
little theorem that told you
that if two of the base angles

13
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,000
of a triangle are equal-- and
it's I guess only a base angle

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,800
if you draw it like this.

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,830
You could draw it like this, in
which case it's maybe not so

16
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,410
obviously a base angle, but
it would still be true.

17
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,520
If these two angles are equal,
then the sides that they don't

18
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,000
share-- so this side and this
side in this example, or this

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,280
side and this side in this
example-- then the two sides

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,050
are going to be equal.

21
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:11,140
So what's interesting about
a 45-45-90 triangle is that

22
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,900
it is a right triangle
that has this property.

23
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,400
And how do we know that it's
the only right triangle

24
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,690
that has this property?

25
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:20,790
Well, you could imagine a
world where I told you that

26
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,140
this is a right triangle.

27
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,030
This is 90 degrees, so
this is the hypotenuse.

28
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:32,140
Right, it's the side opposite
the 90 degree angle.

29
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,780
And if I were to tell you that
these two angles are equal to

30
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,640
each other, what do those
two angles have to be?

31
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,840
Well if we call these two
angles x, we know that the

32
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,410
angles in a triangle
add up to 180.

33
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:49,220
So we'd say x plus x
plus-- this is 90-- plus

34
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,650
90 is equal to 180.

35
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:57,950
Or 2x plus 90 is equal to 180.

36
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,260
Or 2x is equal to 90.

37
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,500
Or x is equal to 45 degrees.

38
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,180
So the only right triangle in
which the other two angles are

39
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:17,990
equal is a 45-45-90 triangle.

40
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:22,680
So what's interesting about
a 45-45-90 triangle?

41
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,160
Well other than what I just
told you-- let me redraw it.

42
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,180
I'll redraw it like this.

43
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:35,190
So we already know this is 90
degrees, this is 45 degrees,

44
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,320
this is 45 degrees.

45
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,370
And based on what I just told
you, we also know that the

46
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:45,850
sides that the 45 degree
angles don't share are equal.

47
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:49,560
So this side is
equal to this side.

48
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,080
And if we're viewing it from a
Pythagorean theorem point of

49
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,240
view, this tells us that the
two sides that are not the

50
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,710
hypotenuse are equal.

51
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,400
So this is a hypotenuse.

52
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,660
   

53
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:09,500
So let's call this side
A and this side B.

54
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,360
We know from the Pythagorean
theorem-- let's say the

55
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,880
hypotenuse is equal to C-- the
Pythagorean theorem tells us

56
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:21,380
that A squared plus B squared
is equal to C squared.

57
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:21,863
Right?

58
00:03:21,863 --> 00:03:24,720
   

59
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,620
Well we know that A equals
B, because this is a

60
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,070
45-45-90 triangle.

61
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,010
So we could substitute
A for B or B for A.

62
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,580
But let's just
substitute B for A.

63
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,960
So we could say B squared
plus B squared is

64
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,530
equal to C squared.

65
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:47,490
Or 2B squared is
equal to C squared.

66
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:54,940
Or B squared is equal
to C squared over 2.

67
00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:03,640
Or B is equal to the square
root of C squared over 2.

68
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,530
Which is equal to C-- because
we just took the square root of

69
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,130
the numerator and the square
root of the denominator-- C

70
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,570
over the square root of 2.

71
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:15,250
And actually, even though this
is a presentation on triangles,

72
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,630
I'm going to give you a little
bit of extra information

73
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,930
on something called
rationalizing denominators.

74
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,270
So this is perfectly correct.

75
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:25,950
We just arrived at B-- and we
also know that A equals B-- but

76
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,510
that B is equal to C divided
by the square root of 2.

77
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,820
It turns out that in most of
mathematics, and I never

78
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,780
understood quite exactly why
this was the case, people

79
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,870
don't like square root of
2s in the denominator.

80
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,720
Or in general they don't
like irrational numbers

81
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,140
in the denominator.

82
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,030
Irrational numbers are numbers
that have decimal places that

83
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,920
never repeat and never end.

84
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,870
So the way that they get rid
of irrational numbers in the

85
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,230
denominator is that you do
something called rationalizing

86
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,570
the denominator.

87
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,456
And the way you rationalize
a denominator-- let's take

88
00:04:55,456 --> 00:04:56,110
our example right now.

89
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:00,640
If we had C over the square
root of 2, we just multiply

90
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,200
both the numerator and
the denominator by the

91
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,130
same number, right?

92
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,120
Because when you multiply the
numerator and the denominator

93
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,280
by the same number, that's just
like multiplying it by 1.

94
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,680
The square root of 2 over
the square root of 2 is 1.

95
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,530
And as you see, the reason
we're doing this is because

96
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,020
square root of 2 times square
root of 2, what's the

97
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,040
square root of 2 times
square root of 2?

98
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,220
Right, it's 2.

99
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,030
Right?

100
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,930
We just said, something times
something is 2, well the square

101
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,990
root of 2 times square root
of 2, that's going to be 2.

102
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:31,010
And then the numerator is C
times the square root of 2.

103
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:34,420
So notice, C times the square
root of 2 over 2 is the same

104
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,150
thing as C over the
square root of 2.

105
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,520
And this is important to
realize, because sometimes

106
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,090
while you're taking a
standardized test or you're

107
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,190
doing a test in class, you
might get an answer that looks

108
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,320
like this, has a square root of
2, or maybe even a square root

109
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,550
of 3 or whatever, in
the denominator.

110
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,420
And you might not see your
answer if it's a multiple

111
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,750
choice question.

112
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,710
What you ned to do in that case
is rationalize the denominator.

113
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,990
So multiply the numerator and
the denominator by square

114
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,470
root of 2 and you'll get
square root of 2 over 2.

115
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,250
But anyway, back
to the problem.

116
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,450
So what did we learn?

117
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,880
This is equal to B, right?

118
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,240
So turns out that B is equal
to C times the square

119
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,420
root of 2 over 2.

120
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,410
So let me write that.

121
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:18,760
So we know that A
equals B, right?

122
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:27,610
And that equals the square
root of 2 over 2 times C.

123
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,680
Now you might want to memorize
this, though you can always

124
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,440
derive it if you use the
Pythagorean theorem and

125
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,720
remember that the sides that
aren't the hypotenuse in a

126
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,110
45-45-90 triangle are
equal to each other.

127
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,370
But this is very good to know.

128
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,645
Because if, say, you're taking
the SAT and you need to solve a

129
00:06:44,645 --> 00:06:48,180
problem really fast, and if you
have this memorized and someone

130
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,943
gives you the hypotenuse, you
can figure out what are the

131
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:51,890
sides very fast, or i8f someone
gives you one of the sides,

132
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,100
you can figure out the
hypotenuse very fast.

133
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,290
Let's try that out.

134
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,250
I'm going to erase everything.

135
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:06,060
So we learned just now that A
is equal to B is equal to the

136
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,210
square root of 2
over 2 times C.

137
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:16,220
So if I were to give you a
right triangle, and I were to

138
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:23,760
tell you that this angle is 90
and this angle is 45, and that

139
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,570
this side is, let's
say this side is 8.

140
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:32,670
I want to figure out
what this side is.

141
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,590
Well first of all, let's
figure out what side

142
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,500
is the hypotenuse.

143
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,620
Well the hypotenuse is the side
opposite the right angle.

144
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,060
So we're trying to actually
figure out the hypotenuse.

145
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,640
Let's call the hypotenuse C.

146
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,560
And we also know this is a
45-45-90 triangle, right?

147
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,180
Because this angle is 45, so
this one also has to be 45,

148
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,620
because 45 plus 90 plus
90 is equal to 180.

149
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,840
So this is a 45-45-90 triangle,
and we know one of the sides--

150
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:05,880
this side could be A or B-- we
know that 8 is equal to the

151
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,030
square root of 2
over 2 times C.

152
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,160
C is what we're trying
to figure out.

153
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,400
So if we multiply both sides of
this equation by 2 times the

154
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,010
square root of 2-- I'm just
multiplying it by the inverse

155
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,600
of the coefficient on C.

156
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,750
Because the square root of 2
cancels out that square root

157
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,430
of 2, this 2 cancels
out with this 2.

158
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:37,640
We get 2 times 8, 16 over the
square root of 2 equals C.

159
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,200
Which would be correct, but as
I just showed you, people don't

160
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,120
like having radicals
in the denominator.

161
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,250
So we can just say C is equal
to 16 over the square root of

162
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:51,290
2 times the square root of 2
over the square root of 2.

163
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:58,790
So this equals 16 square
roots of 2 over 2.

164
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:04,330
Which is the same thing
as 8 square roots of 2.

165
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:10,170
So C in this example is
8 square roots of 2.

166
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:13,790
And we also knows, since this
is a 45-45-90 triangle,

167
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,700
that this side is 8.

168
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,940
Hope that makes sense.

169
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,740
In the next presentation
I'm going to show you a

170
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,680
different type of triangle.

171
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,900
Actually, I might even start
off with a couple more examples

172
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,080
of this, because I feel I
might have rushed it a bit.

173
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,450
But anyway, I'll see you soon
in the next presentation.
