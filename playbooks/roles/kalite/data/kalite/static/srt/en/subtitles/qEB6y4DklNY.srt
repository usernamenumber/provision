1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,240
   

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,580
Let's, just for the sake of our
imaginations, assume that I'm

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,940
the local loan shark, and you
need a dollar for whatever

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,510
purposes, to feed your
children, or start a

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,590
business or buy a new suit,
whatever it may be.

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,940
And you come to me, and you
say Sal, I need a dollar.

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,150
I need to borrow it for roughly
a year, and I'm going to get a

8
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,420
great job, or my children will
get a great job, and I'll

9
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,110
pay you back in a year.

10
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,480
And I say, oh, that sounds very
good, and I will lend you a

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,350
dollar for the low price, or
the low interest rate, of

12
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,750
100% annual interest.

13
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,280
So if you borrow $1 at 100%
interest, if you borrow a

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,840
dollar, in a year from now, I
want that dollar back, and

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,280
I also want 100% of that.

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,150
That's the interest rate.

17
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,800
The interest rate is
essentially what percentage

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,250
of the original
amount you borrowed.

19
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,910
That's called the principal
in finance terms.

20
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,770
That's how much I'm
essentially charging you

21
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:51,760
to borrow the money.

22
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:58,030
So it'll be $1 principal--
that's what you're borrowing,

23
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:02,460
and of course, you have to pay
that back-- plus 100% interest.

24
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,180
   

25
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:05,910
$1.

26
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,190
That's 100%, right?

27
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:09,870
100% interest.

28
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,550
   

29
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,060
And a year from now, you are
going to pay me the principal

30
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,340
plus the interest, so
you're going to pay me $2.

31
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,040
Well, you're fairly desperate,
so you say, OK, Sal, that's OK.

32
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,930
But seeing that this isn't the
lowest interest rate that

33
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,090
you've ever seen-- I think the
federal funds rate is at

34
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,830
something like 2.5 or 3%, so
clearly my 100% is what would

35
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,720
make any loan shark proud.

36
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,590
You figure, well, I want
to pay this thing off

37
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,510
as soon as possible.

38
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,010
So you say, Sal, what
happens if I have the

39
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,810
money in six months?

40
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,250
Well, I say, OK,
that's reasonable.

41
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,130
For six months, since you're
only borrowing it for half as

42
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:55,190
long, I tell you what:
You just have to pay me

43
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,560
50% after six months.

44
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,820
So this is after one year.

45
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:03,310
   

46
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:11,120
After six months, I want you
to pay $1 principal plus 50%

47
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,110
interest, plus 50 cents, right?

48
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,170
That's 50%.

49
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:19,360
And the logic being that if I'm
charging you 100%, I'm charging

50
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,190
you $1 for you to keep the
money for the whole year, I'm

51
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,790
only going to charge you
half as much to keep the

52
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,360
money half the year.

53
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,810
And so after six months,
I would expect you

54
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:33,030
to pay me $1.50.

55
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,300
This is after six months.

56
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,920
   

57
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,280
And then you say, OK,
Sal, that sounds-- that

58
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,340
makes sense so far.

59
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,100
But let's just say that I want
to-- I intend to pay you back

60
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,490
in six months, but just in case
I don't have the money in six

61
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,830
months, will I still just
owe you $2 in a year?

62
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:51,860
And I say no, no, no, no.

63
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:56,100
That I can't deal with because
now I'm giving you the

64
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,730
possibility of paying off
earlier, and if you pay this

65
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,950
money earlier, then I have to
figure out where I'm going to--

66
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:05,240
essentially who I'm going to
take advantage of next.

67
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,290
While if I just lock in my
money with you, I can take

68
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,870
advantage of you for
an entire year.

69
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,440
So what I say is if you want
to-- what you're going to have

70
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,900
to do is essentially reborrow
the money after six months

71
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,650
for another six months.

72
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,790
So instead of me paying you--
instead of me charging you 50

73
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,970
cents for the next six months,
I'm going to charge you 50%

74
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:29,810
for the next six months.

75
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,890
So this is how you can view it.

76
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,400
On day one, you
borrow $1 from me.

77
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,460
In six months, you
pay $1.50, right?

78
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,940
And we decided that 50 percent
was a fair interest rate

79
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,050
for six months, right?

80
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,980
So let's say that you really
do need the money for a year.

81
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,490
So we will just charge
you another 50% for

82
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,730
that next six months.

83
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,523
Now that other 50% is
not going to be on your

84
00:03:53,523 --> 00:03:54,790
initial principal.

85
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,280
Now, after six months,
you owe me $1.50.

86
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,720
So I'm going to charge you-- so
now this is starting at the

87
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,250
next period, you'd owe me
$1.50, and now I'm going to

88
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,340
charge you 50% of that,
so that's 75 cents.

89
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,550
So it's still a 50% interest
rate for the six months, but

90
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,160
your principal has
increased, right?

91
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,780
Because it was the old
principal plus the old

92
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,990
interest, and that's how much
you owe me now, and now

93
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,590
I'm going to charge the
interest rate on that.

94
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:27,690
And so now that equals
$2.25 over a year.

95
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,730
So you look at that, and you're
like, wow, you know, just to be

96
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,730
able to essentially have this
option to pay earlier, I'm

97
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,700
essentially on an annual rate.

98
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,270
My annual rate looks a lot more
like 125% interest, right?

99
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,730
Because my original principal--
your original principal was $1,

100
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,510
and now you're paying $1.25
in interest, so you're

101
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,420
paying 125% annual rate.

102
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:55,800
So that looks pretty bad to
you, but you are, I guess, in a

103
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,530
tough bind, so you agree to it.

104
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,460
And I explained to you that
this is actually just

105
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,320
a very common thing.

106
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,720
Even though it looks suspicious
to you, it is called

107
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,060
compounding interest.

108
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,360
It means that after every
period-- if we say something

109
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,420
compounds twice a year, after
every six months, we take the

110
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,100
interest off of the new
amount that you owe me.

111
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,200
You could pay me back what you
owe me at that point, or you

112
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,560
could essentially reborrow it
at the same rate for

113
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,180
another six months.

114
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,890
So you say, OK, Sal, you're
overwhelming me a little

115
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,890
bit, but I need the
money so I'll do it.

116
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,600
But once again, you know,
on an annual basis,

117
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,470
125% looks even worse.

118
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,260
You know, 50% over six
months still isn't cheap.

119
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,280
What if I have the
money in a month?

120
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,680
What if I have the money in a
month, where I say, OK, here's

121
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,750
the deal: same notion.

122
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:47,350
Instead of charging you 100%
per year, I'm going to charge

123
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:51,280
you-- so this is scenario
one, this is scenario two.

124
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,400
I'm going to charge
you 1/12 of that.

125
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,740
I'm going to charge you
100% divided by 12,

126
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,470
and what is that?

127
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:02,310
It's 12 goes into 100 eight
and a half times, right?

128
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,630
Yeah, 8 times 12 is 96,
and then you get another

129
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,220
half in there, right?

130
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,840
So now I'll say, well, if you
want to pay me on any given

131
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:18,110
month, I'll just charge
you 8.5% per month.

132
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,660
And once again, though,
it's going to compound.

133
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:25,280
So let's say you start with $1.

134
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,260
After one month, you're going
to owe me that $1 plus 8.5%.

135
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,540
So after one month,
you're going to owe

136
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,890
me 1 plus 8.5% of 1.

137
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:41,410
So plus 0.085, which
equals 1.085.

138
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,690
And then after a month,
you're going to owe me

139
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:47,990
this plus 8.5% of this.

140
00:06:47,990 --> 00:07:00,040
So it would be essentially
1.085 squared, and you can do

141
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,520
the math to figure that out.

142
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,490
And then after three months,
you'll owe me 1.085

143
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,450
to the third.

144
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:14,650
And after a full year, you'll
actually owe me 1.085 to the

145
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,390
12th power, and let's
see what that is.

146
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,440
I'm going to use my
little Excel here.

147
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,680
Let's see, if I have
plus 1.085 to the 12th,

148
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,650
you'll owe me $2.66.

149
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:35,120
That equals $2.66.

150
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,040
And you say, OK, that's
acceptable, reluctantly,

151
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,850
because this is now what?

152
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:43,290
166% effective interest rate.

153
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,550
And just keep in mind, all
I'm doing is I'm compounding

154
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,910
the interest, right?

155
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:51,370
This was $1.085, and I think
that makes sense to you.

156
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,080
And the reason why this is
squared is because this is

157
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:59,050
going to-- this is just this
principal times 1.085 Another

158
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,114
way to view it is this is the
same thing as-- I'm going to

159
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:02,930
do it in a different color.

160
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:12,390
It's equivalent to this
plus 0.085 times 1.085.

161
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:18,560
So it's 1.085 plus
0.085 times 1.085.

162
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,850
So if you think of this is 1
times 1.085 and this is 0.085

163
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:27,410
times 1.085, then you can
distribute-- you can take out

164
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,110
the 1.085, and you
would essentially get

165
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:36,190
1.085 times 1.085.

166
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,900
And it keeps going.

167
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,630
So now, in this situation.

168
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,450
we are compounding
the interest.

169
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,060
We said it's essentially 100%
interest, but we're dividing

170
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:49,000
it by 12 per month, but we're
compounding it 12 times.

171
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,265
So, in general, what's
the formula if I want

172
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:52,930
to compound it n times?

173
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:56,440
   

174
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,770
So how much are you going
to have to pay me at

175
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,530
the end of a year?

176
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,490
Well, let's say you want to
compound-- let's say you

177
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,480
want to pay every day.

178
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,270
You want the ability to pay
every day, and I say that's OK,

179
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:12,430
so each day, per day, I'll
charge you 100%, which was my

180
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:17,570
original annual rate, divided
by 365 days in a year, but I'm

181
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,770
going to compound it every day.

182
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:24,770
So after every day,
you're going to owe 1.--

183
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,270
what is this number?

184
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:36,190
Let's see, that number is 100
divided by 365-- whoops, plus

185
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:54,620
100 divided by 365,
so that's 0.27%.

186
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,320
After every day, you're
going to owe me this much

187
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,820
times the previous day.

188
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,580
So after 365 days, you're
going to owe me this

189
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,760
to the 365th power.

190
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,480
So, in general-- oh, I just
realized I ran out of time

191
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,530
so I will continue this
in the next video.

192
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,200
See you soon.

193
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,400
