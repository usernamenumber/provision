1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
We're on problem 106.

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,870
The present ratio of students to teachers

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,150
at a certain school is 30:1.

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:15,420
So the ratio of students to teachers is equal to 30:1.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,710
If the student enrollment were increased by 50 students,

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,590
and the number of teachers were increased by 5,

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,980
the ratio of students to teachers would then be 25:1.

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:33,400
So if we increase the students by 50 students,and increase

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:41,880
the teachers by 5,the new ratio is going to be 25:1.

10
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:47,350
What is the present number of teachers?

11
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,880
Let's just simplify these a little bit.

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,390
We could cross-multiply. We could just write s over T.

13
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:00,530
30 over 1 is equal to 30,or s is equal to 30T.

14
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,980
And let's substitute that into this equation,because we're

15
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,280
going to have to solve for the present number of teachers,

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,210
which is just T.

17
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:16,550
So substitute this here,so we get 30T plus 50,over T plus 5,

18
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,690
is equal to-- well,25 over 1,that's just 25.

19
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,760
And then let's multiply both sides of this equation by

20
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:37,330
T plus 5,and you get 30T plus 50 is equal to 25T,plus--

21
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:46,210
what's 25 times 5?-- 125. Let's subtract 25T from both sides.

22
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:51,780
You get 5T plus 50 is equal to 125.

23
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,950
Subtract 50 from both sides,you get 5T is equal to 75.

24
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:10,990
And then T is equal to 15. 15 times 5 is 50,plus 25,right,75.

25
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:15,390
T is 15. So the answer is E. Next question.

26
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,740
I don't want to run out of space,

27
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,950
so I'll just do it right here. Problem 107.

28
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:30,090
What is the smallest integer,n,for which 25 to the n is

29
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,810
greater than 5 to the 12th?

30
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,940
Whenever you see some type of an equation or inequality

31
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,070
where the variables are under the exponent,and you're

32
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,530
comparing numbers of different bases,your first thing that

33
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,990
should register in your brain is how can I get these to be

34
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,770
in the same base?

35
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,340
And it should be pretty obvious here,because 25 is

36
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,570
the same thing as 5 squared,so let's rewrite it that way.

37
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:55,270
This statement is equivalent to saying 5 squared to the n

38
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,800
is greater than 5 to the 12th.

39
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,060
And 5 squared to the n,that's the same thing as 5 to the 2n,

40
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,420
is greater than 5 to the 12th.

41
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:13,450
And this right here is going to be true when 2n is greater

42
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,020
than 12,when the exponent up here is greater than the

43
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,180
exponent up here. That's when it's going to be true.

44
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,430
You divide both sides by 2,and you get is greater than 6.

45
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,370
So what is the smallest integer,n,for which 25 to the n

46
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,090
is greater than 5 to the 12th?

47
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,060
So n has to be greater than 6,so we can't pick choice A,

48
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,130
which is 6,because if we pick 6,then we would have 5

49
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,490
to the 12th here. And then it would be an inequality,

50
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,000
but this is greater than.

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,270
So the smallest integer,n,now has to be greater than 6,

52
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,490
so n has to be 7. So that's choice B.

53
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,070
And don't get tricked there.

54
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,630
When you get 6 as your answer,you might want to pick A,

55
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,320
but n has to be greater than 6.

56
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,760
So it's essentially the smallest integer greater than 6,is 7.

57
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,980
Problem 108.

58
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,180
If x and y are different prime numbers,each greater than 2,

59
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,640
which of the following must be true?

60
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,020
Each greater than 2,they're both prime numbers.

61
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:28,510
So statement number 1: x plus y cannot equal 91.

62
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,860
Let me think about that.

63
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,210
If x are y are different prime numbers,each greater than 2,

64
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:40,160
which of the following must be true?x plus y cannot equal 91.

65
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,500
Let me think about that a little bit.

66
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,230
That means that I can't have two prime numbers that,

67
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,570
when I add them together,equal 91. Well,let's think about it.

68
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:55,880
They're greater than 2,and then they're prime.

69
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,880
So what do we know about all prime numbers greater than 2?

70
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,100
Well,we know that they're both odd.All prime numbers are odd.

71
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,690
2 is the only even prime number.

72
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,580
So both of these have to be odd.

73
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:12,770
So if I add an odd plus an odd,what do I get?

74
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,090
One way to think about it,this might be second nature to you

75
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,140
at this point,but an odd number can be written in the form,

76
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,330
2 times some integer plus 1.

77
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,840
It's some even integer,some even number plus 1.

78
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,180
So I could write the first odd number like that.

79
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:33,290
Maybe I'll say this is x. I'm just saying that x is odd.

80
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,840
I'm not saying that x is prime,but if you're larger than 2

81
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,010
and you're prime,you're going to be odd.

82
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,080
Otherwise,you're divisible by 2.

83
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,240
And let's say y is equal to 2 times some other integer,plus 1

84
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:49,030
So if you add two odd numbers together,you get 2 times k,

85
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:55,460
plus m,plus 2,which is an even number.

86
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:59,150
When you add two odd numbers,you get an even number.

87
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,230
So if you add two prime numbers greater than 2,

88
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,870
you're essentially adding two odd numbers greater than 2,

89
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,190
so they have to be equal to an even number.

90
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:14,460
So they can't be equal to 91. So statement 1 must be true.

91
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,350
Statement 2,let's think about it.

92
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:26,470
Statement 2 tells us,x minus y is even.

93
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,900
So once again,x and y are definitely going to be odd numbers.

94
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,480
When you add them,you get an even number.

95
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,560
What happens when you subtract them?

96
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:41,120
If I were to subtract y from x,what would I get here?

97
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,680
If I were to subtract it,I would get 2 times k,minus m,

98
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,370
and then the 1 minus 1.

99
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:57,170
But this k minus m is going to still be an integer.

100
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,120
These are two integers,

101
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,120
so this is still going to be an integer.

102
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,530
And they're different prime numbers,so k and m are going to

103
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,560
be different,so this isn't going to be equal 0.

104
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,550
So the difference has got to be an even integer.

105
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:14,630
It might be a negative even integer,because we don't know

106
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:18,280
that x is necessarily larger than y,but we know that

107
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,590
it has to be an even integer.

108
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:25,440
So statement 2 is also correct. Now statement 3.

109
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:35,980
x divided by y is not an integer.

110
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:41,740
Well,we know that x is prime,which means that it only has

111
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,590
two factors,1 and itself. And we know that x isn't 2.

112
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,650
We know that y is another prime number.

113
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:51,420
Now,if this statement right here-- if x divided by y--

114
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,890
if that were an integer,then that means that y divides

115
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:59,010
evenly into x. Which would mean that y is a factor of x.

116
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:03,030
Which would mean that x has a factor other than 1 and itself,

117
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,070
which would mean that x is not prime.

118
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,230
But they tell us it x is a prime number,

119
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,290
and y isn't just the number 1.

120
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,450
They're both prime numbers and they're each greater than 2,

121
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,830
so y is definitely not 1.

122
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:24,340
So in order for this to be an integer,x could not be prime.

123
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:28,520
Since x is prime,and y is some number greater than 2,

124
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,250
we know that this is not an integer.

125
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,760
So all three of these statements have to be true.

126
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,080
And that's statement E,answer E.

127
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,740
Problem 109. Let me do it in a different color.

128
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,580
All of the following have the same value except--

129
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,250
OK,so we're just going to try to do the math real fast here.

130
00:08:54,250 --> 00:09:00,740
1 plus 2,plus 3,plus 4,plus 5,all of that over 3.

131
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:07,820
1 plus 2 is 3,3 plus 3 is 6,6 plus 4 is 10,10 plus 5 is 15,

132
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,560
divided by 3,this is equal to 5.

133
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:18,470
B,1/3,times 1,plus 1,plus 1,plus 1,plus 1.

134
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:22,730
That's 1/3 times-- this is 5,so this is equal to 5/3.

135
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,280
So after we see the next answer we should know

136
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:26,900
where we're going.

137
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,160
So the next answer,we have 1/3 plus itself five times.

138
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,770
1/3 plus 1/3,plus 1/3,plus 1/3,plus 1/3.

139
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:39,890
Well,that's five 1/3s,so that's also equal to 5/3.

140
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:44,820
So we should immediately be able to recognize that

141
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,790
this is different than the other two.

142
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,290
And assuming there's only one answer--

143
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,930
they say all the following have the same value except--

144
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,450
I think we've done enough math,

145
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,860
because we know that B and C are the the same value.

146
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,210
And A is already different,

147
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,630
so A is probably going to be our choice.

148
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,580
And if we kept going,D and E are going to have the same value

149
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,170
And just eyeballing it,it does look like that's the case.

150
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,100
It definitely looks like that's the case,because
