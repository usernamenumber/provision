1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,260
Welcome back. We're now on problem number 11.

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:10,060
Let's see, at the top they write z, w, y, x.

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,980
And they say, the sequence above may be changed in

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,480
either of two ways:

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,770
either two adjacent letters may be interchanged,

6
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,360
or the entire sequence may be reversed.

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,920
So either I could switch w and y,

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,060
or I could just switch the order.

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,770
What is the least number of changes needed to put

10
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:34,020
the numbers into alphabetical order from left to right?

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,620
So, what is alphabetical order from left to right?

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,320
Let's do our goal,

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,010
because it's been a while since I've sung my alphabet.

14
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:48,370
So it's w, x, y, z, this is our goal, right?

15
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,040
So let's see what we can do.

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,030
w, x, y, z,

17
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,430
So we need to get w at the opposite end from--

18
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,640
So let's see, if I could switch these two,

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:07,080
then I would get z, w, x, y.

20
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,050
No, no, no, no, no, I want to get the w at the opposite end.

21
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:18,000
So what we want to do is switch w and y, right?

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,070
And we would get z, y, w, x.

23
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,000
Then you could switch x and w.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,020
You would get z, y, x, w.

25
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,220
And then the other option we can do is just reverse,

26
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,040
and then we can reverse.

27
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,030
And when we reverse it, we get w, x, y, z.

28
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,330
And that's our goal.

29
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:44,000
So that took us one step, two steps, three steps.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,010
So that's choice B.

31
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,050
I'm not sure if that's the right answer.

32
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,010
Let's see if I can do it in two steps.

33
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,370
Let's see, if I reversed it--

34
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:54,030
well reversing doesn't really help you.

35
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,570
The bottom line is you have to,

36
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,370
before you reverse w, x, y, z--

37
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,370
I mean, to move the z all the way over to the other end,

38
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,000
no, you want to just reverse.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,090
If you reverse this, and you reverse this, and you switch,

40
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,020
I think that's the fastest possible way.

41
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,140
No matter what you do,

42
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,090
you have to move the w two steps away from the z.

43
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,020
You have to do that, right?

44
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,350
Because the w is on the opposite end from the z,

45
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,070
so you have to move the w twice.

46
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:30,000
That's going to take you at least two steps.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,050
And then you've got to switch the order.

48
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,880
That's the third step.

49
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,040
And it would be even worse if you didn't switch the order

50
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,080
and wanted to move the z.

51
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,730
The other option is you could just flip the z and the w,

52
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:55,000
and you would get w, z, y, x.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,020
And then you could switch-- no, that's going to take you--

54
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:04,030
you could switch the x and the y and you'd get w, z, x, y.

55
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,800
Now that's going to take you three or four steps,

56
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,090
so I'm pretty sure we got the right answer.

57
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:12,060
Write me a little note if I didn't.

58
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,060
Next problem.

59
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,990
The bottom line with that one, you have to realize

60
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:19,460
you have to move the w at least three away from the z,

61
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,630
and then you've got to reverse it.

62
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,050
So it's going to take you at least three steps.

63
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,000
Problem number 12.

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,050
I hope I'm right on that one.

65
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,980
How many cubicle blocks,

66
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,770
each with edges of length 4 centimeters,

67
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,040
are needed to fill a rectangular box that

68
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:41,010
has inside dimensions-- So each of my initial blocks--

69
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:46,030
I'll draw my cube as best as I can-- are 4 by 4 by 4.

70
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,460
And that is how many cubic centimeters?

71
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,070
These are centimeters, right?

72
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:53,050
So 16 times 4 equals 64 centimeters cubed,

73
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,090
or 64 cubic centimeters.

74
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:03,800
And we want to fill a box that has inside dimensions--

75
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:12,070
this is my big box, let's see-- 20 by 24 by 32.

76
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:16,050
So there's a couple of ways you could do this.

77
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,420
You don't even have to do this first step I did.

78
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,920
You could just say well, how many of these small boxes

79
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,520
are going to fit in this direction?

80
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,380
How many are in this direction,

81
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,460
and how many in this direction, and then multiply.

82
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,030
And that's actually the fast way to do it.

83
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:29,120
So instead of drawing it that way you could--

84
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,780
let me redraw that big box--

85
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,770
but instead of giving it in centimeters, let me give it in

86
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,000
how many of these boxes are going to go in this direction.

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,990
So it's going to be, these are 4 centimeters each

88
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,490
and the base is 20, so it's going to be 20 divided by 4.

89
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,000
It's going to be 5 in this direction.

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,570
It's going to be 6 in this direction, 24 divided by 4.

91
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,060
It's going to be 8 in this direction.

92
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,740
So then you can just multiply,

93
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,060
5 times 6 is 30, times 8 is 240 of the boxes.

94
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,350
The other way to do it is

95
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:00,060
you could have multiplied 20 times 24 times 32.

96
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,020
You could have said this equals 20 times 24 times 32,

97
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,000
and then divided by 64.

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,270
That would have been the other way of doing it,

99
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,060
and then it would have just required more math.

100
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,760
And hopefully that comes out to the same thing as 240,

101
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,060
and that's choice D.

102
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,730
If you ever find yourself on the SAT doing something

103
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,660
that's really hairy or taking a lot of time,

104
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,530
you're not necessarily doing it wrong,

105
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,680
but there's probably a faster way to do it.

106
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,360
Because they want you to be able to

107
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,090
do these questions in less than 30 seconds.

108
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:39,030
I think you have time to do them in a little over a minute.

109
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:45,080
Thirteen, if 0 is less than n which is less than 1,

110
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,670
which of the following gives the correct ordering of

111
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:54,050
square root of n, n, and n squared?

112
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,690
Do you know what the easiest thing to do

113
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,020
when they give you a problem like this is?

114
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,020
Just try out a number.

115
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,530
Well do you know what a good number is here,

116
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:02,480
because we're going to have to take the square root of it?

117
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,910
Let's take n equals 1/4,

118
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,000
because it's easy to take the square root of 1/4.

119
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,090
So if n is equal to 1/4, then what are these values?

120
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:14,030
Square root of n is equal to 1/2, right?

121
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,110
It actually equals plus or minus 1/2,

122
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,010
but they probably mean the positive 1/2.

123
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,050
n is 1/4, right?

124
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,030
And what's n squared?

125
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:28,060
n squared is 1/16.

126
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,800
I'm assuming that they mean the positive square root

127
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,000
when they write it like that.

128
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,040
So what's the order of these?

129
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,890
They want to do it from the smallest to the biggest,

130
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,060
so the smallest is n squared.

131
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:47,000
Then the next biggest is square root of n.

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,060
No sorry, then the next one is n.

133
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,090
And then the next one is square root of n.

134
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:56,000
And that is choice E.

135
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,490
And another way to think about it is,

136
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,990
when you have a fraction--

137
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,500
and essentially that's what they're saying,

138
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,480
that you have a fraction less than one,

139
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,970
or you have a decimal point--

140
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:06,020
it becomes bigger when you take the square root,

141
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,040
and it becomes smaller when you square it.

142
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,090
That's the realization.

143
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:13,290
So the squaring is going to be smaller than the number

144
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,090
which is smaller than the square root.

145
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:20,000
That's the underlying theme when a number is between 0 and 1

146
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,020
But if you didn't want to think too abstractly about it,

147
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,090
just try out a number that works.

148
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:34,070
Let's see, next problem, problem number 14.

149
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,030
OK, so this is going to involve some drawing.

150
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,030
Let me see if I can draw this pretty fast.

151
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:44,040
So that's my y-axis. That's my x-axis.

152
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,690
Then there's a bunch of lines. There's a, b, c.

153
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:51,080
OK, so they all intersect at 3.

154
00:07:51,080 --> 00:08:03,050
And then these are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

155
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,090
And let me draw out all the lines.

156
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:10,010
So the first line goes something like this, it goes there.

157
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:10,610
Then all the other ones--

158
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:15,030
and let's see, the next one goes to 3.

159
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:18,080
The next one goes to 4.

160
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,010
The next one goes to 5.

161
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,480
They all go to y equals 3.

162
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:28,050
And the last one goes to 6.

163
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,060
OK.

164
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,600
And they're saying in the figure above,

165
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:35,000
what is the median of the slopes of all of those lines,

166
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,070
oa, ob, oc, right?

167
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:44,000
They write A, B, C, D, E.

168
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,010
What is the median?

169
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,040
So this isn't the average.

170
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,080
Median is easier.

171
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,030
Median is just what's the middle slope, right?

172
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,060
So we could say well this-- let me just switch colors--

173
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,060
line A has the highest slope.

174
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,000
Line B is a little bit lower.

175
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,020
Line C is a little bit lower.

176
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,040
The slope is getting a little bit lower as we go out, right?

177
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,000
And you could figure that out by rise over run.

178
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,310
The rise is the same in every case,

179
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,030
and the run just gets bigger and bigger, right?

180
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,070
The change in x gets bigger and bigger.

181
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,060
So this has the highest slope.

182
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,090
This has the lowest slope.

183
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:18,040
And this has the middle slope, C.

184
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,000
Pretty easy.

185
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,680
Oh, the median of the slope.

186
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,490
So they want you to figure it out.

187
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,030
So what is the slope of 3, of this one?

188
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:35,080
So it's change in y is 3 over change in x, which is 4.

189
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,080
So it's 3/4, so that's choice C.

190
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,620
If you got this wrong, maybe by accident you took

191
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,440
the mean, or the average,

192
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,030
which would probably have wasted a lot of time as well.

193
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:48,070
I'll see you in the next video.
