1
00:00:04,162 --> 00:00:06,129
Consider the following game,

2
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:09,220
Eve instructs Bob to go into a room,

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,370
Bob finds the room empty,

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,223
except for some locks, an empty box,

5
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:16,517
and a single deck of cards.

6
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:19,478
Eve tells Bob to select a card from the deck,

7
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:23,441
and hide it as best as he can.

8
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:24,900
The rules are simple,

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,191
Bob cannot leave the room with anything,

10
00:00:27,191 --> 00:00:30,280
cards and keys all stayed in the room,

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,763
and he can put at most one card in the box,

12
00:00:34,824 --> 00:00:38,109
Eve agrees that she has never seen the locks.

13
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:42,545
He wins the game if Eve is unable to determine his card,

14
00:00:42,545 --> 00:00:44,843
So what is his best strategy?

15
00:00:44,843 --> 00:00:48,352
Well, Bob selected a card, six of diamonds,

16
00:00:48,352 --> 00:00:50,757
and threw it in the box.

17
00:00:50,757 --> 00:00:53,797
First, he considered the different types of locks.

18
00:00:53,797 --> 00:00:58,236
Maybe he should lock the card in the box with the key.

19
00:00:58,236 --> 00:01:00,534
Though she can pick locks,

20
00:01:00,534 --> 00:01:03,274
so he considers the combination lock,

21
00:01:03,274 --> 00:01:04,366
The key is on the back,

22
00:01:04,366 --> 00:01:06,900
so if he locks it and scratches it off,

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,944
it seems like the best choice.

24
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:12,081
But suddenly he realized the problem.

25
00:01:12,081 --> 00:01:13,907
The remaining cards on the table

26
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,115
leak information about his choice,

27
00:01:16,115 --> 00:01:18,282
since it's now missing from the deck.

28
00:01:18,282 --> 00:01:20,940
The locks are a decoy.

29
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,834
He shouldn't separate his card from the deck.

30
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:25,539
He returns his card to the deck.

31
00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:27,921
But can't remember the position of his card.

32
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:32,246
So he shuffles the deck to randomize it.

33
00:01:32,246 --> 00:01:34,386
Shuffling is the best lock,

34
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:37,849
because it leaves no information about his choice.

35
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:42,459
His card is now equally likely to be any card in the deck.

36
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:46,475
He can now leave the cards openly in confidence.

37
00:01:48,137 --> 00:01:49,598
Bob wins the game,

38
00:01:49,598 --> 00:01:52,821
because the best Eve can do is simply guess,

39
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:56,386
as he'd left no information about his choice,

40
00:01:56,386 --> 00:01:58,160
Most importantly,

41
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,455
even if we give Eve unlimited computational power,

42
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:04,111
she can't do any better than a guess.

43
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:07,867
This defines what we call perfect secrecy.

44
00:02:07,867 --> 00:02:13,677
On September 1st, 1945, 29 year old Claude Shannon

45
00:02:13,677 --> 00:02:17,387
published a classified paper on this idea.

46
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,690
Shannon gave the first mathematical proof

47
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:25,191
for how and why the one time pad is perfectly secret.

48
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:29,411
Shannon thinks about encryption schemes in a following way:

49
00:02:29,411 --> 00:02:33,839
Imagine Alice writes a message to Bob, 20 letters long.

50
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:38,116
This is equivalent to picking one specific page

51
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,494
from the message space.

52
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,261
The message space can be thought of as

53
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:47,550
a complete collection of all possible 20-letter messages.

54
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,170
Anything you can think of that's 20 letters long

55
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,422
is a page in this stack.

56
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,218
Next Alice applies a shared key,

57
00:02:55,218 --> 00:02:57,890
which is a list of 20 randomly generated shifts

58
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,049
between 1 and 26.

59
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:05,012
The key space is the complete collection of all possible outcomes.

60
00:03:05,012 --> 00:03:07,274
So generating a key is equivalent to

61
00:03:07,274 --> 00:03:10,822
selecting a page from the stack at random.

62
00:03:10,822 --> 00:03:13,901
When she applies the shifts to encrypt the message,

63
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:16,098
she ends up with the cipher text.

64
00:03:16,098 --> 00:03:18,992
The cipher text space represents

65
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:22,619
all possible results of an encryption.

66
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,621
When she applies the key,

67
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:28,678
it maps to a unique page in this stack.

68
00:03:28,678 --> 00:03:31,093
Notice that the size of the message space

69
00:03:31,093 --> 00:03:32,579
equals the size of the key space,

70
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,856
equals the size of the cipher text space.

71
00:03:35,856 --> 00:03:38,562
This defines what we call perfect secrecy,

72
00:03:38,562 --> 00:03:42,964
for if someone has access to a page of cipher text only,

73
00:03:42,964 --> 00:03:44,850
the only thing that they know is

74
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,311
that every message is equally likely.

75
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,981
So no amount of computational power

76
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,984
could ever help improve a blind guess.

77
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,404
Now the big problem,

78
00:03:55,404 --> 00:03:57,122
you're wondering with the one time pad

79
00:03:57,122 --> 00:04:00,067
is that we've to share these long keys in advance.

80
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:01,992
To solve this problem,

81
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:05,162
we need to relax our definition of secrecy,

82
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:11,895
by developing a definition of pseudo-randomness.
