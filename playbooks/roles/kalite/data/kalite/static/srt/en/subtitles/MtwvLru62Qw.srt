1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620
   

2
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,640
Let's think about what type of
reaction might occur if we

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,990
have this molecule
right over here.

4
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:07,600
I won't go through the
trouble of naming it.

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,590
It would take up too much
time in this video.

6
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,680
But it's dissolved
in methanol.

7
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,350
   

8
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,110
When we talk about what type of
reactions, we're going to

9
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:22,230
pick between Sn2, Sn1,
E2 and E1 reactions.

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,590
Now, maybe the first place to
start or the place I like to

11
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,800
start is to just look at
the solvent itself.

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,680
And when we're trying to decide
what type of reaction

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,630
will occur, the important thing
to think about is, is

14
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,370
the solvent protic or aprotic?

15
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:35,810
And if you look at this
solvent right

16
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,410
here, this is methanol.

17
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,420
It is protic.

18
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,150
And in case you don't remember
what protic means, it means

19
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,980
that there are protons flying
around in the solvent, that

20
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,910
they can kind of go loose and
jump around from one molecule

21
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:50,590
to another.

22
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,680
And the reason why I know that
methanol is protic is because

23
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,850
you have hydrogen
bonded to a very

24
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,070
electronegative atom in oxygen.

25
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,090
So every now and then, in one of
the methanol molecules, the

26
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:10,840
oxygen can steal hydrogen's
electron.

27
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,150
And then the hydrogen itself,
without the electron, the

28
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,990
hydrogen proton will be flying
around because it

29
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,140
doesn't have a neutron.

30
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,970
So this is a protic solvent.

31
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,460
Now, you might say, well does
anything with a hydrogen,

32
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,280
would that be protic?

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,100
And the answer is no.

34
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,810
If you have a bunch of hydrogens
bonded to just

35
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,250
carbons, that is not protic.

36
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,650
Carbon is not so electronegative
that it could

37
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,190
steal a hydrogen's electron
and have the hydrogens

38
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:32,900
floating around.

39
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,670
So a big giveaway is hydrogen
bonded to a very

40
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,390
electronegative atom
like oxygen.

41
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,780
So this is protic.

42
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,130
And when we think about protic
out of all of the reactions we

43
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:49,260
studied, that favors-- well,
even a better way to think

44
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,990
about it is it disfavors.

45
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:59,570
So it tells us that it's
unlikely to have an Sn2 or an

46
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,730
E2 reaction.

47
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:04,070
And the logic there is an Sn2
reaction needs a strong

48
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,050
nucleophile.

49
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:08,250
An E2 reaction needs
a strong base.

50
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,720
Now, if you have protons flying
around, the nucleophile

51
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,610
or the base is likely to
react with the proton.

52
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,620
It would not be likely
to react with

53
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,960
the substrate itself.

54
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,170
So a protic solution, you're
likely to have an Sn2 or E2.

55
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:31,060
What you are likely to have is
an Sn1 or an E1 reaction.

56
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,970
Both of these need the leaving
group to leave on its own, and

57
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:37,150
actually, having protons around
might help to stabilize

58
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,070
the leaving group
to some degree.

59
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:43,060
So it makes Sn2, E2 unlikely,
Sn1, E1 a little more likely.

60
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,430
So far, these are our
good candidates.

61
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,400
Now, the next thing to think
about is to just look at the

62
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,360
leaving group itself,
or see if there is

63
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,960
even a leaving group.

64
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,805
And over here, everything we see
on this molecule is either

65
00:02:54,805 --> 00:03:00,070
a carbon or a hydrogen, except
for this iodine right here.

66
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,660
   

67
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:07,320
And we know that iodide is
a good leaving group.

68
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,580
Well, a good leaving group, it
does not make it any less

69
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,350
likely that you'd
have Sn2 or E2.

70
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,880
Both of those can do well with
a good leaving group.

71
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,080
But it's a necessary requirement
for an Sn1 or an

72
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,910
E1 reaction.

73
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,450
Remember, an Sn1 and E1, in both
of them, the first step

74
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,170
is that the leaving group
leaves on its own.

75
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,180
That is the rate-determining
step.

76
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,895
So that's a requirement
for Sn1 or E1, so

77
00:03:30,895 --> 00:03:32,460
it still looks likely.

78
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,320
We haven't seen anything that
would make us think that we

79
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,550
wouldn't have an Sn1 or E1.

80
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,900
This is a good leaving group.

81
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,520
Let me write it here.

82
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:43,740
Good leaving group.

83
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,060
Now, the last thing that we can
think about right here is

84
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,330
the carbon that we might
be leaving from.

85
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,000
So far, everything is pointing
in the Sn1 and E1 direction,

86
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,200
and kind of the final thing
is when this leaving group

87
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,990
leaves, it's going to form a
carbocation from the carbon

88
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,250
that it's bonded to right now.

89
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,770
And in order for that
carbocation to be reasonably

90
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:05,010
stable, at minimum it should
be a secondary carbocation

91
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,140
bonded to at least two carbons,
but ideally, it would

92
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,430
be bonded to three carbons.

93
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,470
It would be a tertiary carbon.

94
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:16,490
Now, the carbon that the leaving
group is bonded to is

95
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,630
a tertiary carbon.

96
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:21,399
It's bonded to one, two,
three carbons.

97
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:25,110
so it is a tertiary carbon.

98
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,240
It can actually be a
stable carbocation.

99
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,820
It's a tertiary carbon,
which it once again

100
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,440
favors Sn1 and E1.

101
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,950
So all of the clues here
tell us that Sn1 and E1

102
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:35,970
are going to happen.

103
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,520
And actually, they'll
both happen.

104
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,190
So let's think about
the mechanism.

105
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,010
In the very first step, the
leaving group leaves in either

106
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,420
one of these reactions.

107
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,800
So if we look at the iodine,
it already has

108
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,080
seven valence electrons.

109
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,410
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

110
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,250
And in the first step, the
rate-determining step of the

111
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:02,440
Sn1 or E1 reaction, the iodine's
going to nab an

112
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,510
electron off the carbon.

113
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:08,060
I'll do that electron in
green right over there.

114
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:12,200
That's going to get nabbed onto
iodine to make iodide,

115
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,390
and then that carbon is going to
lose an electron and become

116
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,570
a carbocation.

117
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,790
So after that very first
step, we have something

118
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,460
that looks like this.

119
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,760
So that's our molecule.

120
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,070
Just so it's clear what we did,
this arrow I'll do all

121
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,750
the way over here, so
it's clear that

122
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,320
this is our next step.

123
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,740
And what's happened here?

124
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,730
Our tertiary carbon has
lost its electron.

125
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:38,520
So now this carbon right here
has a positive charge.

126
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,190
It's a tertiary carbocation.

127
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,610
And now the iodine has
become iodide.

128
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,430
It has left the molecule.

129
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,420
So it had its original seven
valence electrons: one, two,

130
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,200
three, four, five, six, seven.

131
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,250
It nabbed one more electron
from the carbon and now it

132
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,880
is-- I wanted to do
that in green.

133
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,080
It nabbed one more electron from
the carbon, now it is the

134
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,550
iodide anion.

135
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,510
So this step right
here is common to

136
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,940
both Sn1 and E1 reaction.

137
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,250
The leaving group
has to leave.

138
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,170
Now, after this, they
start to diverge.

139
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,520
In an Sn1, the leaving group
essentially gets substituted

140
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,620
with a weak nucleophile.

141
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,250
In an E1, a weak base strips off
one of the beta hydrogens

142
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,420
and forms an alkene.

143
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,850
So let's do them separately.

144
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,220
So over here, I'm going
to do the Sn1.

145
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,120
   

146
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,280
And on the right-hand side,
I will do the E1 reaction.

147
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,250
So let me start over here.

148
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,180
So the Sn1 is starting over
here at this step.

149
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,290
I'll just redo this
step over here.

150
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,980
So this has a positive charge.

151
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,390
That has a positive
charge here.

152
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:59,290
The iodide has left.

153
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,960
I don't have to draw all its
valence electrons anymore.

154
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,520
And what's going
to happen next?

155
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,380
We're going to get substituted
with the weak base, and the

156
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,440
weak base here is actually
the methanol.

157
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,320
The weak base here
is the methanol.

158
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,190
So let me draw some
methanol here.

159
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:17,770
   

160
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:22,810
It's got two unbonded pairs of
electrons and one of them,

161
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,000
it's a weak base.

162
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,400
It was willing to give
an electron.

163
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,460
It has a partial negative
charge over here because

164
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,280
oxygen is electronegative, but
it doesn't have a full

165
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,460
negative charge, so it's not
a strong nucleophile.

166
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,500
But it can donate an electron
to this carbocation, and

167
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,480
that's what is going
to happen.

168
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,210
It will donate an electron
to this carbocation.

169
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:48,420
And then after that happens,
it will look like this.

170
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,690
That's our original molecule.

171
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:55,100
Now this magenta electron
has been donated to the

172
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,370
carbocation.

173
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,090
The other end of it is this blue
electron right here on

174
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,080
the oxygen.

175
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,770
It is now bonded.

176
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:03,880
That is our oxygen.

177
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,570
Here's that other pair of
electrons on that oxygen, and

178
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:13,130
it is bonded to a hydrogen
and a methyl group.

179
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,930
And then the last step of this
is another weak base might be

180
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,150
able to come and nab off the
hydrogen proton right there.

181
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,230
Oh, I want to be very
clear here.

182
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,670
The oxygen was neutral.

183
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,100
The methanol here is neutral.

184
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:28,040
It is giving away an electron
to the carbocation.

185
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,750
The carbocation had a positive
charge because it had lost it

186
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,320
originally.

187
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,450
Now it gets an electron back.

188
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,990
It becomes neutral.

189
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:37,230
The methanol, on the other hand,
was neutral, gives away

190
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:42,210
an electron, so now it becomes--
it now is positive.

191
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,040
So now you might have
another methanol.

192
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,810
You might have another methanol
molecule sitting out

193
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:54,570
here someplace that might also
nab the proton off of this

194
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,520
positive ion.

195
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,090
So this one right here,
it would nab it or it

196
00:08:59,090 --> 00:08:59,860
would bond with it.

197
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,850
It would give the electron to
the hydrogen proton, really.

198
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:08,110
The hydrogen's electron gets
nabbed by the oxygen, and so

199
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,570
then that becomes neutral.

200
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:14,920
So in the final step, it'll
all look like this.

201
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,370
We have that over here.

202
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:19,530
The methanol that had originally
bonded has lost its

203
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,890
hydrogen, so it looks
like this.

204
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:27,140
We just have the oxygen
and the CH3 there.

205
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,830
It is now neutral because it
gained an electron when that

206
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,920
hydrogen proton was nabbed.

207
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,540
So if you wanted to draw it,
it has actually those two

208
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,980
extra electrons,
just like that.

209
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,100
And if you want to draw this
last methanol, it's now a

210
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,080
positive cation, so it
looks like this.

211
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:49,530
So it's OH, CH3, H, and then
it has unbonded pair right

212
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,910
there, and now this has
a positive charge.

213
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,120
So that was the Sn1 reaction.

214
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,310
Now, the other reaction that's
going to occur is the E1.

215
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,850
   

216
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:02,365
Once again, our first
step-- nope, I

217
00:10:02,365 --> 00:10:03,450
didn't want to do that.

218
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:06,780
Our first step looks
like that.

219
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,220
So that is our first step.

220
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,390
Let me get everything
straight.

221
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,550
So the leaving group had left.

222
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,580
So in each situation, the
leaving group had left.

223
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,990
Our iodide is up here.

224
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,010
   

225
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:22,510
And in an E1 reaction, you
don't get substituted.

226
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:26,120
What happens is one of the beta
carbons gets a hydrogen

227
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,320
swiped off of it
by a weak base.

228
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,410
Now, let's think about what
a beta carbon is.

229
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,250
The alpha carbon is the
carbocation carbon.

230
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,130
That's right over there.

231
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,480
That's the alpha carbon.

232
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,150
Beta carbons are one
carbon away.

233
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,750
So this is a beta carbon, this
is a beta carbon, and then

234
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,410
that is a beta carbon.

235
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,930
Now, this carbon over here is
not bonded to any hydrogens.

236
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,470
It's only bonded to
other carbons.

237
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,280
So that one cannot lose
any hydrogens.

238
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,180
And then we have to pick between
this carbon that's

239
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,030
bonded to three hydrogens and
this carbon that's actually

240
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,050
bonded to two hydrogens.

241
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,530
I didn't draw it before, but
it's implicitly there.

242
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,960
It's bonded to two hydrogens.

243
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,860
Now Zaitsev's rule tells us that
the dominating product is

244
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,390
going to be produced when the
carbon that has less hydrogens

245
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,400
loses a hydrogen.

246
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,820
So out of this, this carbon
has two hydrogens,

247
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,030
this one has three.

248
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,300
So the one that's going to lose
the hydrogen to the base,

249
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,440
or more likely to lose the
hydrogen to the base, is the

250
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,870
one that has two hydrogens, not

251
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,670
three, the fewer hydrogens.

252
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,520
So our base in this case is once
again the methanol, acted

253
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,900
as a nucleophile in the
Sn1, acted as a weak

254
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,350
nucleophile in Sn1.

255
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,700
Now it'll act as a weak base.

256
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:35,090
So we have methanol
right over here.

257
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,480
That's a hydrogen.

258
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,280
CH3 has some electrons
right over here.

259
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,330
It has a partial negative
charge.

260
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:47,440
It will give one of the
electrons to the hydrogen,

261
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,030
just to the hydrogen proton.

262
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,250
The hydrogen's not going to
take its electron with it.

263
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:57,770
That electron is then going to
be given to the carbocation to

264
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:00,750
make it neutral, and it will
form a double bond.

265
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,060
So after that happens, we
are left with something

266
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,070
that looks like this.

267
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,820
This was our original
molecule.

268
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:13,010
Now, this carbon right
here in yellow, it

269
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,090
has lost its hydrogen.

270
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,760
This hydrogen back here
is still there.

271
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,960
I could draw it if I like.

272
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,480
I don't need to.

273
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,070
It just makes the thing messy.

274
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,930
But it has now formed a double
bond with the primary carbon.

275
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,040
It has now formed
a double bond.

276
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,190
That electron that had bonded
with the hydrogen was now

277
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,820
given to the carbocation.

278
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,520
It has a double bond
with that.

279
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:36,880
And then you have your methanol
has now turned into a

280
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,710
positive ion.

281
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:43,810
It has now turned into
a positive ion: CH3.

282
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:46,390
And now it has this bond.

283
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,020
It has this bond with
the hydrogen.

284
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:52,520
I'll even make that electron
that it gave away in magenta.

285
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:58,150
And then it has that extra
lone pair of electrons.

286
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,660
So, in this circumstance, we
looked at all of the clues.

287
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,330
All of the clues were
against Sn2 and E2.

288
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,860
They favored Sn1 and E1.

289
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,080
So if you were to actually
make this, if you were to

290
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,830
actually try to see what happens
is this reaction, you

291
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:13,900
would get products of both Sn1
and E1 reactions, these

292
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,270
products and these products
over here.
