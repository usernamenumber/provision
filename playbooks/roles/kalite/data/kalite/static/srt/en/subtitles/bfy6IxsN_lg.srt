1
00:00:06,132 --> 00:00:07,598
So what are we looking at here?

2
00:00:07,613 --> 00:00:09,706
This is a sculpture by Pablo Picasso.

3
00:00:09,722 --> 00:00:11,914
It dates to 1912, called Guitar.

4
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:16,880
Made out of sheet metal that Picasso cut and crimped and folded.

5
00:00:16,895 --> 00:00:18,399
So this way is awesome.

6
00:00:18,429 --> 00:00:21,225
It's just a fascinating thing to look at it.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,155
It's something that...I mean guitar is never among daily thing.

8
00:00:23,202 --> 00:00:24,620
And that's what is fun about it.

9
00:00:24,652 --> 00:00:28,195
Even if you put a guitar on your wall, it kind of inspires you.

10
00:00:28,211 --> 00:00:30,234
I like to leave my guitar in the corner of my room,

11
00:00:30,249 --> 00:00:32,620
it makes me always wanna be more creative.

12
00:00:32,635 --> 00:00:33,837
And he takes it to another level,

13
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:35,387
he takes this idea of the guitar

14
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:38,915
and it's, it's very recognizable as a guitar.

15
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,458
And it really plays with the geometry of the guitar.

16
00:00:41,473 --> 00:00:43,807
And the things that you think would pop out are poppin in,

17
00:00:43,825 --> 00:00:45,855
the things that are poppin in are poppin out.

18
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,416
But it still fundamentally has the idea of its guitarness.

19
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:53,531
And you know the strings don't cross the sound hole

20
00:00:53,548 --> 00:00:55,578
I mean it's definitely not a functional guitar,

21
00:00:55,594 --> 00:00:58,339
but it definitely could base what the guitar is.

22
00:00:58,353 --> 00:01:01,506
So, at least esthetically I get this.

23
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:04,492
I think Picasso is applauding your interpretation.

24
00:01:04,508 --> 00:01:07,955
When you thin about sculpture, what comes to mind?

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,049
What kinds of subjects have you seen in sculpture?

26
00:01:12,064 --> 00:01:15,334
Well, classical sculpture, which is you know the Venus of the Milo.

27
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,808
And then you have the more geometric type of scupltures.

28
00:01:18,823 --> 00:01:20,902
More modern sculptures, absolutelly.

29
00:01:20,917 --> 00:01:23,287
Now, this is something that was made in 1912.

30
00:01:23,302 --> 00:01:24,372
And when it was made,

31
00:01:24,387 --> 00:01:27,404
I think that more classical kind of sculpture that you're reffering to

32
00:01:27,419 --> 00:01:29,217
is really what they was.

33
00:01:29,232 --> 00:01:31,401
There were sculptures of the human body.

34
00:01:31,431 --> 00:01:33,776
Ocassionally there might be a piece of an armour,

35
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:36,433
might be some drapery that was sculpted.

36
00:01:36,449 --> 00:01:37,710
There might be a horse.

37
00:01:37,725 --> 00:01:41,329
But sculpture was always about something that existed in nature,

38
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:44,525
something that was not menmade.

39
00:01:44,556 --> 00:01:47,873
Nobody has made the sculpture of a guitar

40
00:01:47,889 --> 00:01:50,472
because we make guitars.

41
00:01:50,503 --> 00:01:53,522
Picasso could become a luthier,

42
00:01:53,537 --> 00:01:56,224
he could just make a guitar.

43
00:01:56,254 --> 00:01:57,816
I wholly appreciate that, I mean,

44
00:01:57,831 --> 00:02:00,384
I think that this a challenging people's notion of art.

45
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,460
As you just pointed out,

46
00:02:01,476 --> 00:02:05,228
well that seems kind of intuitive to make a represenation of something that

47
00:02:05,257 --> 00:02:07,770
we already make and we can make it very well.

48
00:02:07,786 --> 00:02:09,429
And represent it prefectly.

49
00:02:09,445 --> 00:02:13,233
Here is intentionally representing the essence of the thing

50
00:02:13,248 --> 00:02:15,361
without making the thing.

51
00:02:15,392 --> 00:02:19,564
How can he create a visual vocabular that represents the thing,

52
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:23,046
well not in any way constructing that thing.

53
00:02:23,062 --> 00:02:24,736
He has to be really deliberate,

54
00:02:24,753 --> 00:02:28,856
has to make sure that that fingerboard can't actually work.

55
00:02:28,872 --> 00:02:32,103
Otherwise he's making a fingerboard, he's not making a sculpture.

56
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:33,992
No, you're exactly right.

57
00:02:34,008 --> 00:02:37,305
I would probably remove several of the guitar like cues,

58
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,778
and it would still very clearly be a guitar.

59
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:44,021
Yeah, but you know I definitely appreciate this.

60
00:02:44,037 --> 00:02:45,696
I definitely, I think get this.

61
00:02:45,711 --> 00:02:47,379
Think about what has happend in this moment.

62
00:02:47,395 --> 00:02:50,631
His understanding of art, making his coming out of the 19th century,

63
00:02:50,646 --> 00:02:54,335
when the photography had really released artists from the responsibility

64
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,187
of having to depict.

65
00:02:56,203 --> 00:02:59,395
And so now artists have moved to the second level which is,

66
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,620
let's focus on the language of depiction, as oppossed to depiction itself.

67
00:03:03,635 --> 00:03:07,048
Take a look at one of the things that makes it most clear

68
00:03:07,064 --> 00:03:08,176
that this is a guitar.

69
00:03:08,192 --> 00:03:11,342
Look at the contours of the body of the guitar.

70
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,389
S - curves on the both sides.

71
00:03:13,404 --> 00:03:15,229
Do you notice how they're not the same scale?

72
00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:16,172
Absolutelly, yes.

73
00:03:16,187 --> 00:03:19,849
Picasso does this kind of thing in a lot of drawings of this time,

74
00:03:19,864 --> 00:03:21,696
late 1911, 1912.

75
00:03:21,711 --> 00:03:25,453
Because the right side is smaller, the one historian

76
00:03:25,468 --> 00:03:29,145
has suggested that Picasso is actually representing a guitar

77
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,022
not flat against the wall but actually turns slightly in space.

78
00:03:33,038 --> 00:03:34,703
Yeah, I definitely see that.

79
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,960
If you're looking at all angles of the guitar at once.

80
00:03:36,975 --> 00:03:40,085
This sculpture is actually coming out of the series of collages

81
00:03:40,101 --> 00:03:41,439
that Picasso has been making.

82
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:43,982
It's this funny thing, when you have the idea of the guitar,

83
00:03:43,997 --> 00:03:46,072
three - dimensional real thing in the world,

84
00:03:46,087 --> 00:03:49,088
which then collapses into the realm of drawings

85
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:51,253
that represent the thing in space.

86
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:54,457
And then he literally cuts those things out

87
00:03:54,472 --> 00:03:56,885
and reconstructs this in three dimensions.

88
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,094
And in fact the very first version was made out of paper.

89
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:01,954
From three - dimensional to the two - dimensional

90
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:03,801
and then back to the three - dimensional.

91
00:04:03,816 --> 00:04:07,816
I think it's fascinating.
