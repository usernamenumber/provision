1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,960
   

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,310
Let's put all of the moral
hazard issues and all the

3
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,620
fairness issues aside.

4
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,240
And just think hard
about whether this

5
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,850
bailout could work.

6
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,070
Because frankly, if it doesn't
work, then it's definitely not

7
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,290
something that any of us
should worry about.

8
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,510
And even if it does work, then I
think you should worry about

9
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:16,860
the moral hazard issues.

10
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,190
But let's say this is Bank
A, shady Bank A.

11
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,620
And it has-- and let's see,
these are its assets on the

12
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,440
left hand side.

13
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,690
And these are its liabilities.

14
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:31,210
   

15
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:35,860
And so it has, at least on its
books, the book value of the

16
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,250
CDOs that it has
is $5 billion.

17
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,400
And what the government is
saying, is that right now,

18
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,150
Bank B has lent Bank
A this loan.

19
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,310
Bank B has given them $8 billion
that maybe has to be

20
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,720
paid back next month.

21
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,280
And the big fear is that Bank B
is going to get scared, and

22
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,500
then when this loan is due in
a month's time, that Bank B

23
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,630
won't give them a new loan
or renew the loan.

24
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,730
They're just going to want to
take the money back, because

25
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,220
they're afraid of keeping money
with these guys, when

26
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,370
you don't know what these
CDOs are worth.

27
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,350
And that's a legitimate
fear, right?

28
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,790
Because if these CDOs really are
worth $5 billion, then you

29
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:16,510
really do have $4 billion
of equity here, right?

30
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:21,560
Total assets are $12 billion
minus $8 billion of

31
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,840
liabilities means you have
$4 billion of equity.

32
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,380
Fair enough.

33
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,520
But what happens if these CDOs
are only worth $1 billion?

34
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,950
And this is worth $1 billion,
and these are worth $7

35
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,400
billion, then you only have
$8 billion in assets.

36
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,350
And $8 billion in liabilities,
and there's no equity.

37
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:36,980
Or even worse.

38
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,170
What if this these CDOs
are worth zero?

39
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,270
Then you have negative equity.

40
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,760
Then if these guys were to go
bankrupt, if they were to be

41
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:49,990
the next Lehman Brothers, then
all this Lender B would get if

42
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,730
they went bankrupt are these
CDOs worth 0 and these $7

43
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:53,940
billion of assets.

44
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,330
For every $8 they let lend to
Bank A, it'll only get $7.

45
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:01,360
So what the government is saying
is, OK, to keep Bank B

46
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,960
from pulling their money out of
Bank A, let's buy out these

47
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,840
CDOs at essentially at a price
that keeps this bank solvent.

48
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,420
Even if they really are worth
0, we're not the Fed or the

49
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,240
Treasury-- the Treasury's
the one doing it.

50
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,530
The Treasury's not going to pay
0, because if they paid 0,

51
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,690
this guy would just
go bankrupt.

52
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,560
It would be another
Lehman Brothers.

53
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,880
So the Treasury wants to
essentially, maybe pay $5

54
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,640
billion for it.

55
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:31,320
So that you take $5 billion--
buy these CDOs for $5 billion.

56
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,860
And all of a sudden this doesn't
become CDOs of $5

57
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,360
billion, this becomes cash.

58
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,370
And their argument is, if you
were to do this, no matter how

59
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,420
unfair it might be, because this
is essentially a check of

60
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,490
$5 billion, if you assume these
CDOs are worthless.

61
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,770
This is essentially a check
that's being written to the

62
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,670
equity holders and the
unsecured debt

63
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,260
holders of this bank.

64
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,300
But let's assume that-- Let's
put all that aside.

65
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,860
Let's assume that this works.

66
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:01,550
That now Bank B will say, oh
boy, I don't have to worry

67
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,590
about those CDOs anymore.

68
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,480
Those CDOs have been
turned into cash.

69
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,450
This company definitely has
positive book value, and

70
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,620
therefore, I will continue
to loan to this company.

71
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,980
But it isn't that simple.

72
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,700
Because right behind these CDOs,
there are other assets

73
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,440
on this book.

74
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,590
On most banks' books.

75
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,680
So these were the subprime
CDOs, the

76
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,570
stinkiest of the stinky.

77
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,750
Then you have other
things that are a

78
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,760
little bit less risky.

79
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,060
They're Alt-A CDOs.

80
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,970
These are loans that were given
to people who aren't

81
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,260
necessarily subprime.

82
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,880
These are people who had
decent credit scores.

83
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,260
But they still put no money
down, and they still were able

84
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,130
to essentially fabricate their
income on there loan

85
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:41,780
applications.

86
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,290
So these are the Alt-A loans.

87
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,655
Then above that-- And these
might be Alt-A CDOs.

88
00:03:46,655 --> 00:03:49,440
They've been sliced and diced,
so some tranches are more

89
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,730
risky, some tranches
are less risky.

90
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:58,110
Above that, you might have
commercial real estate CDOs.

91
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:02,830
So I'll call that commercial
real estate CDOs.

92
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,170
Then above that, you might
have commercial loans.

93
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,420
Just a regular companies.

94
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,490
   

95
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,990
Or even better, these could be
loans to private equity--

96
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,840
actually, that's even better.

97
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,560
Let's put some private equity
loans in there, because I

98
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,310
wanted to show you that this
isn't the only stinky thing on

99
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,959
the balance sheets,
these CDOs.

100
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,010
That this is just the stinkiest
of them all.

101
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,580
A good way to think about it is,
if you have a dead skunk

102
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,970
in your house, you won't
notice that the

103
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,830
milk is going bad.

104
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,030
And that is the situation.

105
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,360
These CDOs, they seem really
bad now, but you know what?

106
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,630
Six months ago, or
even a year ago.

107
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:40,430
Six months ago, these CDOs
looked a lot like-- these

108
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,190
subprime CDOs look a lot
like these Alt-A CDOs

109
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,560
are starting to look.

110
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,700
And the way these Alt-A CDOs
looked six months ago is how a

111
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,910
lot of these commercial real
estate CDOs are starting to

112
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,150
look right now.

113
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,230
So this is just the tip of
the iceberg, these CDOs.

114
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,820
So you have an issue here.

115
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,080
The government goes in.

116
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,170
It spent $700 billion.

117
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:05,360
It buys these assets that are
of questionable value.

118
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,750
And it's claiming to us that
the problem will be solved.

119
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,100
But Bank B isn't an idiot.

120
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,050
Bank B isn't an idiot.

121
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,400
They're probably more
prudent than Bank A.

122
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,640
They didn't buy these
subprime assets.

123
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,080
Subprime CDOs.

124
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,440
But I wouldn't be surprised if
Bank B probably has some of

125
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,270
these less stinky things on
their balance sheets.

126
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,800
Alt-A.

127
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,360
I mean, they definitely have
something stinky, which is

128
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,210
called a loan to A.

129
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,170
That's one of their assets.

130
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:43,710
And then they might have loans
to private equity, private

131
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,450
equity loans.

132
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:47,720
Then they might have some
commercial real estate CDOs.

133
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,390
They might have CDOs that are
backed by credit card debt.

134
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,870
The bottom line is that this
bank can look into its own

135
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,820
assets, and it can see that the
fundamental value behind

136
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,480
these assets are
deteriorating.

137
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,970
Anyone who talks to anyone in
the real economy right now

138
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,430
knows that the economy's
slowing.

139
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,990
That consumers can't spend
any more money.

140
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,310
In fact, last year consumers
had negative savings, which

141
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,950
means that they had to borrow
money to fuel their

142
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,510
consumption.

143
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,790
And the only way that you can
have consumption growth in

144
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:19,130
that type of environment is if
either salaries increased,

145
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,400
which isn't happening,
or people are able

146
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,440
to borrow more money.

147
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,990
And we already know that credit
is getting tightened.

148
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:29,520
So if you're Bank B, will the
government buying out this

149
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,430
asset, irregardless of how fair
it is, will that make you

150
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,560
confident in loaning
to Bank A?

151
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,300
Well, no, because you see in
your own balance sheet that

152
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,180
things are deteriorating.

153
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,850
And frankly, you have loans to
other people too, right?

154
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:48,860
You have loans to Bank C.

155
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,170
That's a loan to Bank E.

156
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:55,440
That's a loan to some sovereign
wealth fund.

157
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,460
And then you have your
equity here.

158
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,850
So you have a double
conundrum, right?

159
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,000
You have all of these guys.

160
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,050
These loans might come due, so
you're going to need some cash

161
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:04,930
for that in the future.

162
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,010
And you see the trend.

163
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:06,730
You're not an idiot.

164
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,520
You aren't as risk-taking as
this guy, and you see that

165
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,070
this wasn't the only stinky
thing out there.

166
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,050
That there are other assets
classes, other types of CDOs,

167
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,160
and just loans in general,
that are starting to

168
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,600
deteriorate.

169
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,370
That's starting to
deteriorate.

170
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,020
That's starting to
deteriorate.

171
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,420
That's starting to
deteriorate.

172
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,630
So maybe this credit
crunch isn't just

173
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,650
because of these CDOs.

174
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,790
Maybe it's because this banker
is actually being prudent.

175
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:34,050
Maybe this banker's actually
saying, you know what, I need

176
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:34,800
to be careful.

177
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,805
I see the left hand side of my
balance sheet deteriorating.

178
00:07:37,805 --> 00:07:41,910
I need to pull this money, just
in case, just really in

179
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,710
the best interest of
my equity holders.

180
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,410
Of my shareholders, or even
of my bond holders.

181
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:51,080
So even on this first cut, even
if there wasn't all of

182
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,320
this controversy, and even if
George Bush didn't go up, and

183
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,730
do a primetime speech telling
us that we're about to reach

184
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,970
financial armageddon, if I was a
prudent banker I would still

185
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:05,290
be wary of loaning to Bank A,
even if the government were

186
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,310
able to pull this buyout.

187
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:11,060
Now on top of that, I work in
the financial industry.

188
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,000
Bankers were prudent.

189
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,010
They see reality.

190
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,260
They see things are
deteriorating.

191
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,930
So they want to be cautious.

192
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,720
But frankly, when Bush, and
Paulson and Bernanke go up on

193
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,690
TV and say, tell the world that
you have to pass this

194
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,000
bill and if not, we're
essentially on-- they use

195
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,950
words like "preicipice." These
are the real precipice.

196
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:35,720
And they use "financial
armageddon." It's either their

197
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,350
words, or some of the
other words that

198
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,799
I've heard out there.

199
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,960
Financial armageddon.

200
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,870
And days away from
the precipice.

201
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,830
So my question is to you,
regardless of whether the

202
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,040
government buys this out, is
this type of language going to

203
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,550
instill any type of sense
of confidence in Bank B?

204
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:58,450
If I'm the chairman or CEO of
Bank B, I'm like, you know

205
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,740
what, I thought things
were bad.

206
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,710
And that's why I was trying
to, instead of charge 2

207
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,560
percent for a loan, I was
going to charge 6

208
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,520
percent for a loan.

209
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,520
But now the President of the
United States, the Treasury

210
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,080
Secretary, and the Chairman of
the Federal Reserve have

211
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,830
frankly used language that no
elected or unelected official

212
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,250
has ever used before.

213
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,050
Days away from financial
armageddon?

214
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,330
We're on the precipice?

215
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,200
Hell, I'm definitely not going
to lend right now.

216
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,790
I don't care even if
they do buy assets.

217
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,170
And then I'm going to
throw another monkey

218
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,430
wrench into the picture.

219
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:35,880
The plan calls for a reverse
auction, where the essentially

220
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,470
the Fed says, hey everybody,
I have $1 billion.

221
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,030
Who wants to sell me
their mortgages

222
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,510
for the lowest price?

223
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,600
Well, guess what?

224
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,560
The people who are willing to
sell their CDOs for the lowest

225
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,350
price are probably the most
desperate out there.

226
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,590
And if anyone participates in
those auctions and sells at a

227
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,930
discount, those are the people
that are going to be on my red

228
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,570
flag list. Those are the banks
that I'm going to be the least

229
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:02,020
likely to lend to, because I
knew that they were desperate.

230
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,570
That they were just covering up
their balance sheet for as

231
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,290
long as they could.

232
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,020
They were waiting for the
government bailout.

233
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,420
And if they're willing to take
the government bailout, those

234
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,700
are the very banks that I
don't want to lend to.

235
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,290
Anyway, I'll leave you there.

236
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,570
But I just want to give you the
point that everyone-- that

237
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,240
George Bush and then the rest of
his gang is trying to scare

238
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,320
the world and say, oh, we are
trying to save the economy.

239
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,940
They don't mention the fact that
even with their bailout,

240
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,560
regardless of how unfair it is,
we're probably going to

241
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,980
end up in the same situation.

242
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:34,360
And frankly, it might even
make the situation worse.

243
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,190
And that's something I really
want to hit home with people.

244
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:40,530
It's like when they started
banning short selling in a

245
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,010
small number of stocks.

246
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:45,620
When they said, oh you can't
short Banks A, B, and C.

247
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,970
Immediately that made everyone's
ears go up and say,

248
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:50,420
oh the government knows
something that we don't know.

249
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,600
I'm not going to deal with
Banks A, B, and C.

250
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,490
Because those are probably the
stinkiest of them all.

251
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,030
Anyway, see you in
the next video.

252
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:58,400
