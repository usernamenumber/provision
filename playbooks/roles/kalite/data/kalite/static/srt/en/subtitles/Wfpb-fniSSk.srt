1
00:00:00,121 --> 00:00:02,171
We know that if we take all of the points

2
00:00:02,171 --> 00:00:08,104
in the *X, Y plane<i>where</i>x^2 + y^2 = 1*,

3
00:00:08,104 --> 00:00:10,913
we get ourselves the unit circle.

4
00:00:10,913 --> 00:00:13,247
Let me draw the unit circle.

5
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:18,997
That's my <i>y-axis</i>; this is my <i>x-axis</i>.

6
00:00:18,997 --> 00:00:22,831
And the unit circle has the circle with the radius one.

7
00:00:22,831 --> 00:00:30,971
So that's <i>x=1</i>, that's <i>x=-1</i>, that's <i>y=1</i>, that's <i>y=-1</i>

8
00:00:30,971 --> 00:00:34,503
the unit circle looks something... let me draw it...

9
00:00:34,503 --> 00:00:35,997
something like this, I think you get the point

10
00:00:35,997 --> 00:00:39,103
Let's see if I can fill it in a little bit better.

11
00:00:39,103 --> 00:00:41,564
So you realize that it's not a dotted circle.

12
00:00:41,564 --> 00:00:43,170
There.

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,438
That's my best attempt at drawing the unit circle.

14
00:00:47,438 --> 00:00:51,081
And we also know that the traditional trig functions,

15
00:00:51,081 --> 00:00:54,080
or maybe we should call them the <i>circular</i> trig functions

16
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,504
are actually defined so that if you parameterize

17
00:00:58,504 --> 00:01:03,703
so if you were to take *x=cos t*

18
00:01:03,703 --> 00:01:07,413
and *y=sin t*

19
00:01:07,413 --> 00:01:10,372
and you pick any <i>t</i>, right over here

20
00:01:10,372 --> 00:01:13,838
and by definition it's going to sit on the unit circle

21
00:01:13,838 --> 00:01:18,438
by definition, *x^2 + y^2 = 1*

22
00:01:18,438 --> 00:01:21,556
so if you pick any <i>t</i> it's going to sit some place

23
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:22,238
on this unit circle.

24
00:01:22,238 --> 00:01:24,532
Or another way to think of it is

25
00:01:24,532 --> 00:01:27,771
if you vary <i>t</i> it's going to start tracing out this circle

26
00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:31,329
And we know that <i>t</i> corresponds to the angle

27
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:34,913
with a positive <i>x-axis</i>, in this case,

28
00:01:34,913 --> 00:01:37,246
that right over there is <i>t</i>.

29
00:01:37,246 --> 00:01:40,080
Now wouldn't it be neat if there were a similar

30
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,914
analogy for, not the unit circle, but

31
00:01:42,914 --> 00:01:45,170
something we could call the unit hyperbola?

32
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:49,581
So that's our little review of trigonometry right there;

33
00:01:49,581 --> 00:01:51,582
our traditional trigonometry, now let's think about

34
00:01:51,582 --> 00:01:53,830
the unit <i>hyperbola</i>.

35
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,771
Well, *x^2 + y^2 = 1* is a unit circle, I'll say that

36
00:01:57,771 --> 00:02:07,771
*x^2 - y^2 = 1<i>, I'm going to call this my</i>unit hyperbola*.

37
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:12,248
Or a unit rectangular hyperbola. <u>Hyperbola</u>.

38
00:02:12,248 --> 00:02:15,171
This is just a little bit of review from *Conic Sections*,

39
00:02:15,171 --> 00:02:16,970
but it would look something like this:

40
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:28,170
It would look... something... that's my <i>y-axis</i>,

41
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:33,838
this is my <i>x-axis</i>, and then we can say,

42
00:02:33,838 --> 00:02:36,771
well if <i>y</i> is 0, <i>x</i> can be ±1,

43
00:02:36,771 --> 00:02:40,246
so you can think of that as the unit part

44
00:02:40,246 --> 00:02:45,369
where it intersects the <i>x-axis</i>; that's +1, that's -1

45
00:02:45,369 --> 00:02:48,704
and it has asymptotes, <i>y=x</i> and <i>y=-x</i>

46
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:52,039
We go through the intuition on that in the

47
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:58,413
Conic Section videos, <i>y=x</i> is that dotted line,

48
00:02:58,413 --> 00:03:04,611
<i>y=-x</i> is that dotted line, right over there,

49
00:03:04,611 --> 00:03:08,079
and then this thing is going to look like this.

50
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:11,503
It's going to have a right half that does something like this,

51
00:03:11,503 --> 00:03:14,103
and does something like this, all a review of

52
00:03:14,103 --> 00:03:18,039
*Conic Sections*, it gets closer to its asymptotes.

53
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:22,039
To <i>y=x</i> or <i>y=-x</i>

54
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,663
and the same thing on the left-hand side.

55
00:03:23,663 --> 00:03:28,837
It's going to do something like that.

56
00:03:28,837 --> 00:03:33,837
Wouldn't it be neat if we could parameterize

57
00:03:33,837 --> 00:03:39,703
<i>x</i> and <i>y</i> with analogous functions so that

58
00:03:39,703 --> 00:03:42,170
we get a similar type of property?

59
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,569
And you might guess what those functions are,

60
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:46,036
but let's actually try to verify it.

61
00:03:46,036 --> 00:03:53,330
What would happen if <i>x</i> is equal to our <i>hyperbolic</i>

62
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:57,104
*cosine of t*, which is the same thing as

63
00:03:57,104 --> 00:04:05,504
*e^t + e^(-t)*, all of that over 2

64
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,504
and <i>y</i> were to be equal to

65
00:04:07,504 --> 00:04:11,580
*hyperbolic sine* of <i>t</i>, which is equal to

66
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:17,247
*e^t - e^(-t)* over 2. Wouldn't it be neat if there

67
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:21,848
were an analogy here; over here you pick any <i>t</i>

68
00:04:21,848 --> 00:04:26,247
based on our circular trig functions, you ended up

69
00:04:26,247 --> 00:04:29,413
with a point on the unit circle. Wouldn't it be amazing

70
00:04:29,413 --> 00:04:31,663
if for any point <i>t</i> you ended up with a point on our,

71
00:04:31,663 --> 00:04:34,504
what we're calling our *unit hyperbola*?

72
00:04:34,504 --> 00:04:37,503
Well, in order for that to be true, with this parameterization

73
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:40,704
*x^2 - y^2* would need to be equal to one.

74
00:04:40,704 --> 00:04:42,438
Let's see if that <i>is</i> the case!

75
00:04:42,438 --> 00:04:52,172
So *x^2 - y^2* is equal to, well let's square this business

76
00:04:52,172 --> 00:04:55,772
it's equal to <i>e^(2t)</i> plus

77
00:04:55,772 --> 00:04:58,105
two times the product of these two things

78
00:04:58,105 --> 00:05:05,313
*2e^t • e^(-t)*, this is <i>e^0</i> here which is 1.

79
00:05:05,313 --> 00:05:13,171
Plus <i>e^(-2t)</i>, <i>e^(-t)^2</i>, all of that over 4

80
00:05:13,171 --> 00:05:15,979
And then from that we will subtract <i>y^2</i>.

81
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:20,838
Minus, so the numerator's going to be

82
00:05:20,838 --> 00:05:35,730
*e^(2t) - 2e^t • e^(-t) + e^(-2t)*, all of that over 4

83
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:39,571
So, immediately, a couple of simplifications here.

84
00:05:39,571 --> 00:05:44,838
*e^t • e^(-t)*, that's just <i>e^(t-t)</i>

85
00:05:44,838 --> 00:05:48,064
which is equal to <i>e^0</i>, which is equal to 1

86
00:05:48,064 --> 00:05:51,396
This is going to be one, that's going to be one,

87
00:05:51,396 --> 00:05:54,439
so we're going to have a 2 in either of those cases

88
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:57,902
and if we were to simplify it, all of this stuff over here

89
00:05:57,902 --> 00:06:01,440
I'll do a numerator, so this is going to be equal to

90
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,372
over our [denominator] of 4

91
00:06:05,372 --> 00:06:19,146
*e^(2t) + 2 + e^(-2t) - e^(2t)*

92
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:19,646
just distributing the negative sign

93
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:26,099
Plus two, and then minus <i>e^(-2t)</i>

94
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:30,103
Well this is convenient!

95
00:06:30,103 --> 00:06:33,302
(Oh, I was writing it in black, a hard color to see)

96
00:06:33,302 --> 00:06:39,104
This cancels with this,

97
00:06:39,104 --> 00:06:42,104
This and this also add up to zero and you're left with

98
00:06:42,104 --> 00:06:43,396
two plus two over four

99
00:06:43,396 --> 00:06:47,969
which is indeed equal to one!

100
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:51,565
So this is a pretty good reason to call these two functions

101
00:06:51,657 --> 00:06:53,889
hyperbolic trig functions.

102
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:55,588
These are the circular trig functions,

103
00:06:55,588 --> 00:06:57,238
you give me a <i>t</i> on these parameterizations

104
00:06:57,238 --> 00:06:58,313
we end up on the unit circle!

105
00:06:58,313 --> 00:07:00,897
You vary <i>t</i>, you trace out the unit circle.

106
00:07:00,897 --> 00:07:04,570
Here, for any real <i>t</i>, we're going to assume we're

107
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,647
dealing with real numbers,

108
00:07:05,647 --> 00:07:08,238
for any real <i>t</i> we're going to end up on

109
00:07:08,238 --> 00:07:11,480
the unit hyperbola right over here

110
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,370
and in particular we're going to end up on the right

111
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:17,063
so it's not exactly... over here pretty much <i>any</i> of these

112
00:07:17,063 --> 00:07:18,646
points could be parameterized right here

113
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,656
over here we're going to end up

114
00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:22,572
on a point on the <i>right</i> side of the unit hyperbola.

115
00:07:22,572 --> 00:07:23,982
The reason why it's the right side

116
00:07:23,982 --> 00:07:26,171
is... you go straight to the definition of

117
00:07:26,171 --> 00:07:29,504
*cosh t*, this thing can only be positive

118
00:07:29,504 --> 00:07:32,313
This thing can only be positive.

119
00:07:32,313 --> 00:07:35,646
<i>e^t</i> can only be positive, <i>e^-t</i> can only be positive

120
00:07:35,646 --> 00:07:41,171
so this is only positive.

121
00:07:41,171 --> 00:07:44,312
But you give any <i>t</i> you will end up on this hyperbola!

122
00:07:44,312 --> 00:07:46,770
Specifically the right side, if you want points on

123
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,638
the left hand side, you'd have to take the

124
00:07:48,638 --> 00:07:55,646
*-cosh t<i>and the</i>sinh t*

125
00:07:55,646 --> 00:07:56,771
to end up right over there.

126
00:07:56,771 --> 00:08:00,238
But it's a pretty neat analogy.

127
00:08:00,238 --> 00:08:01,397
We're looking at Euler's identity and we

128
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:04,396
kind of said, "oh, let's just start playing with these things!"

129
00:08:04,396 --> 00:08:07,312
There seems to be a similarity here if we were to

130
00:08:07,312 --> 00:08:09,063
remove the <i>i</i> 's and, all of a sudden, we've discovered

131
00:08:09,063 --> 00:08:11,314
another thing! That there is this relationship

132
00:08:11,314 --> 00:08:13,838
here there is this relationship between <i>these</i> trig functions

133
00:08:13,838 --> 00:08:17,904
and the unit circle, here between our <i>newly</i> defined

134
00:08:17,904 --> 00:08:21,771
hyperbolic trig functions and the unit <u>hyperbola</u>.

135
00:08:21,771 --> 00:08:24,239
And you'd also find if you were to vary <i>t</i> it's going

136
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:26,731
to trace out... just as if you were to vary <i>t</i> here it

137
00:08:26,731 --> 00:08:29,297
traces out the unit circle... if you trace <i>t</i> here it will trace

138
00:08:29,297 --> 00:08:32,561
out the right-hand side, the right-hand side

139
00:08:32,561 --> 00:08:34,172
of the unit hyperbola.

140
00:08:34,172 --> 00:08:37,067
For this parameterization right here.
