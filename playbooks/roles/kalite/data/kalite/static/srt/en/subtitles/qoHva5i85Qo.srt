1
00:00:04,911 --> 00:00:06,863
We’re in Madrid, at the Prado,

2
00:00:06,863 --> 00:00:09,934
And we’re looking at a Velazquez, a large painting.

3
00:00:09,934 --> 00:00:12,336
This is the Vulcan Forge.
It’s been described by some

4
00:00:12,336 --> 00:00:15,146
art historians as a kind of burlesque, 
actually.

5
00:00:15,146 --> 00:00:18,187
Here’s Apollo, who we can see, the god of

6
00:00:18,187 --> 00:00:21,365
the Sun and the god of poetry
with the halo on his head on the left

7
00:00:21,365 --> 00:00:23,761
who is here telling Vulcan, 
who is forging armor -

8
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:26,157
-a suit of armor -

9
00:00:26,157 --> 00:00:28,554
and is very hard at work all day

10
00:00:28,554 --> 00:00:30,345
and Apollo is just come to tell him that

11
00:00:30,345 --> 00:00:33,820
his wife Venus has been having an affair with Mars

12
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,469
the god of war.

13
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,939
Now, look just at the attitudes of those two faces.

14
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:40,529
They forget about the rest for just a moment.

15
00:00:40,529 --> 00:00:45,844
Apollo’s back arches, his head is up.
He’s rather full of himself actually.

16
00:00:45,844 --> 00:00:49,819
As he has this very powerful message to Vulcan.

17
00:00:49,819 --> 00:00:54,267
Vulcan looks horrified and dangerous.

18
00:00:54,267 --> 00:00:58,605
He’s holding this red hot metal 
in one hand he’s got a hammer in the other

19
00:00:58,605 --> 00:01:02,306
and he looks like he’s ready to strike anything.

20
00:01:02,306 --> 00:01:04,257
And look at his body

21
00:01:04,257 --> 00:01:08,603
He’s got this beautiful torso, muscles and his ripples

22
00:01:08,603 --> 00:01:13,605
and his abdomen. But his face has that kind of Caravaggio feel of his

23
00:01:13,605 --> 00:01:15,785
He’s not ideally beautiful (-Up this world).

24
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:17,342
I mean he’s got this ideally beautiful body.

25
00:01:17,342 --> 00:01:20,716
In fact, all of the male figures have ideal bodies,

26
00:01:20,716 --> 00:01:24,349
as though Velazquez is looking at ancient Greek and Roman sculpture,

27
00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:28,221
looking at the artists of the Renaissance, maybe Michael Angelo

28
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:30,262
and also looking at the art of Caravaggio.

29
00:01:30,262 --> 00:01:31,864
But the heads are different, aren’t they?

30
00:01:31,864 --> 00:01:34,202
They are. They are not so idealized, as you pointed out.

31
00:01:34,202 --> 00:01:36,330
In fact, the heads are incredibly naturalistic,

32
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,019
even though they’re painted in a fairly loose manner.

33
00:01:39,019 --> 00:01:41,421
So, this is conflict in this painting between

34
00:01:41,421 --> 00:01:45,612
this kind of realism and down to earthness
and the figures and

35
00:01:45,612 --> 00:01:46,751
and what are they doing,

36
00:01:46,751 --> 00:01:49,283
and their gestures and the emotions that they convey.

37
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:53,483
But also the sense of their kind of standing like classical sculptures,

38
00:01:53,483 --> 00:01:55,470
their bodies look like classical sculptures.

39
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,686
But here’s the thing is that

40
00:01:56,686 --> 00:02:00,262
I don’t think the French whether Italians
would have rendered

41
00:02:00,262 --> 00:02:02,980
an important mythological subject 
with this

42
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,368
much almost with comedy involved, right? – yeah

43
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:08,361
Look at the man who is second from the right.

44
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:11,191
He looks astonished, I mean he’s really absurd.

45
00:02:11,191 --> 00:02:16,710
So, there is a kind of …human sort of sense of conflict, humor.

46
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:21,512
It seems very debasing in some way,
really not treating the classical

47
00:02:21,512 --> 00:02:23,969
with the kind of honor 
that is usually accorded.

48
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:28,033
A the same time though, it looks like an academic exercise,

49
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:31,101
because we have the three male figures in the center

50
00:02:31,101 --> 00:02:33,079
shown from three different points of view.

51
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:35,985
The one on the left, Vulcan, shown front door,

52
00:02:35,985 --> 00:02:37,664
the next one show from behind

53
00:02:37,664 --> 00:02:39,726
the third one shown in profile

54
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:42,829
and the last figure on the right shown,
for sure coming up towards us.

55
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,351
Those first three almost like if they were female figures,

56
00:02:45,351 --> 00:02:46,563
like the Three Graces.

57
00:02:46,563 --> 00:02:50,515
-Exactly! It looks very orderly and composed and balanced.

58
00:02:50,515 --> 00:02:55,627
And a little bit like a performance for maybe possible future patrons.

59
00:02:55,627 --> 00:02:58,661
I mean here’s Velázquez’s still relatively young.

60
00:02:58,661 --> 00:03:01,673
He’s made a trip to Rome with the urging of Ruben’s

61
00:03:01,673 --> 00:03:06,175
and perhaps demonstrating his skill 
as an artist who can paint the male nude.

62
00:03:06,175 --> 00:03:09,906
It certainly shows an artist who’s willing to sort of reinvent

63
00:03:09,906 --> 00:03:13,080
or push the boundaries, the ways in which stories are told.

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
