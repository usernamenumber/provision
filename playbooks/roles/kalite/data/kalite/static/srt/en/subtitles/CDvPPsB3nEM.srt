00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:08,070
PROBLEM: "The perimeter of a rectangular
fence measures 0.72 kilometers.

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,670
The length of the fenced
area is 160 meters.

3
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,550
What is its width?"

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,933
So we have a rectangular fence.

5
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:19,950
Let me draw it.

6
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,205
So that is a rectangle.

7
00:00:22,205 --> 00:00:23,880
You can imagine we're
looking from above.

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,540
This line is the top
of the fence.

9
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,546
And if you take its perimeter, the perimeter 
is the distance around the fence.

10
00:00:30,546 --> 00:00:34,254
If you take this distance plus this distance 
plus that distance plus that distance,

11
00:00:34,254 --> 00:00:37,766
it's going to be 0.72 kilometers.

12
00:00:37,766 --> 00:00:40,350
That's the total combined 
length of all of the sides.

13
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,386
Now, the length of the fenced
area is 160 meters.

14
00:00:43,386 --> 00:00:44,640
So let's call this the length.

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:52,120
So this distance right
here is 160 meters.

16
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,158
Since it's a rectangle, that
distance over there

17
00:00:54,158 --> 00:00:59,155
is also going to be 160 meters – 
and we need to figure out its width.

18
00:00:59,155 --> 00:01:03,902
They want us to figure out the width.
The width is this distance right over here –

19
00:01:03,902 --> 00:01:09,141
which is also going to be this 
distance right over there.

20
00:01:09,141 --> 00:01:10,885
Now, what is the perimeter
of the fence?

21
00:01:10,885 --> 00:01:14,810
The perimeter is the sum of
this length, plus this length,

22
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,223
plus that length, plus that length.

23
00:01:16,223 --> 00:01:22,922
So the perimeter – 
let me write it in orange –

24
00:01:22,922 --> 00:01:33,726
is going to be equal to w, 
the width, plus 160 meters,

25
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:44,650
plus the width, plus 160 meters.

26
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,803
And let's assume w is in meters.

27
00:01:46,803 --> 00:01:50,996
So that w is in meters,
So we could add it all up.

28
00:01:50,996 --> 00:01:53,706
So if you were to add all of these up, 
you would get a certain number of meters.

29
00:01:53,706 --> 00:01:57,058
So if you were to add all of these up, 
you have a w plus a w,

30
00:01:57,058 --> 00:02:07,100
so you would have 2w.
160 + 160 is 320. So that's plus 320.

31
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:12,114
And this whole thing is in meters.
We're assuming that w is in meters.

32
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,153
Now, they also told us that the perimeter
of the fence is 0.72 kilometers.

33
00:02:17,153 --> 00:02:21,240
So the perimeter – 
(Let me do it in that same orange color.)

34
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:34,537
The perimeter is also equal to 0.72 kilometers.
And we can abbreviate that with km.

35
00:02:34,537 --> 00:02:37,560
Now, if we wanted to solve an
equation, if we wanted to set

36
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,427
this thing equal to the
perimeter they gave us,

37
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:43,260
we have to make sure that 
the units are the same.

38
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,399
Here it's in meters.
Here it's in kilometers.

39
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:50,470
So let's convert this 0.72
kilometers to meters.

40
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,852
And the way to do that, 
we want the kilometers

41
00:02:52,852 --> 00:02:58,352
in the denominator, so it cancels out with the kilometers, and you want meters in the numerator.

42
00:02:58,352 --> 00:03:00,900
Now, how many meters
equal a kilometer?

43
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,720
Well, it's 1,000 meters
for every 1 kilometer.

44
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,890
1 kilometer is 1,000 meters.

45
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:10,859
Now, if you multiply these two things,
the kilometers cancel out.

46
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:13,160
You're just going to be
left with the meters.

47
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,820
And then when you multiply 0.72 times 1,000, 
you could just first say,

48
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,490
"OK, let's take 72 times 1,000."

49
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:26,048
72 times 1,000 would
be 72 with 3 0s. COUNTING: 1, 2, 3.

50
00:03:26,048 --> 00:03:28,557
And then out of the two numbers
that you're taking the product of,

51
00:03:28,557 --> 00:03:31,546
we have two numbers behind the decimal.
COUNTING: 1, 2.

52
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:35,302
So you put two numbers behind the decimal.
COUNTING: 1, 2, right over there.

53
00:03:35,302 --> 00:03:41,220
So 0.72 times 1,000 is 720.
And that makes sense.

54
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,520
0.72, it's not quite 1, 
but it's getting close to 1,

55
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,617
almost 3/4 of a whole, 
and this is almost 3/4 of 1,000.

56
00:03:49,617 --> 00:03:50,740
So it makes sense.

57
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,565
So the perimeter, this
information right here,

58
00:03:53,565 --> 00:03:58,400
0.72 kilometers, is the 
same thing as 720 meters.

59
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,910
So if you take 2 times the width
in meters, and add that

60
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:09,535
to the combined lengths -- it's
160 and 160. That's 320,

61
00:04:09,535 --> 00:04:16,019
And all of this is in meters -- 
that is going to be equal to

62
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:22,790
the total perimeter, 
which is 720 meters.

63
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,763
Now that we have the units right,
we can solve for w,

64
00:04:25,763 --> 00:04:30,370
and w will tell us this
width in meters.

65
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:35,780
So 2w + 320 is equal to 720.

66
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,790
We can subtract 320 from both
sides of this equation.

67
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,620
Remember, an equation is saying,
"That is equal to that."

68
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,120
If we want both sides to always 
be equal, whatever we do

69
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,670
to the left-hand side, we have
to do the right-hand side.

70
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:54,096
So we subtract 320
from both sides.

71
00:04:54,096 --> 00:04:56,190
The left-hand side,
that cancels out.

72
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,100
That's why we subtracted 320.

73
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:03,000
And that you just leaves you with 
2 times the width is equal to 720,

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,550
minus 320, which is 400.

75
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:11,009
Now you can divide both
sides of this by 2.

76
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:14,136
And then you're left with
w = 400/2,

77
00:05:14,136 --> 00:05:16,614
which is 200.

78
00:05:16,614 --> 00:05:18,368
And we said that w was in meters.

79
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:27,350
So the width is 200 meters.
So this is 200 meters.

80
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,610
And let's see if it makes sense.

81
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:33,680
200 + 200 is 400,
+ 320 is 720.

82
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,200
So the total perimeter is 720
meters, which is the exact

83
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,020
same thing as 0.72 kilometers.
