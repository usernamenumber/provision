1
00:00:01,667 --> 00:00:03,400
What I want to talk about in this video is

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,400
one of the darker periods in Chilean history and

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,733
depending on your point of view,

4
00:00:06,733 --> 00:00:09,800
also one of the darker periods in American history.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,600
And what I want to make clear

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,067
in this video and it really applies to every video I make on history is

7
00:00:14,067 --> 00:00:16,000
be skeptical of everything that I'm telling you.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,933
I'm going to do my best attempt to give you a

9
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:23,800
reasonably accurate series of events and draw connections when they're clear

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,333
And also make it clear where there might be connections and

11
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,933
no one is sure. But you should be skeptical

12
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:31,533
and frankly, you should be skeptical of anything anyone is telling you

13
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:34,067
I encourage you all to use this as a scaffold for

14
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:36,733
your own research, for you to look up these names

15
00:00:36,733 --> 00:00:39,267
and these events and figure out what actually happened.

16
00:00:39,267 --> 00:00:43,000
Now wth that said, let us rewind back to 1970,

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,600
when Chile was having an election for president and

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,800
they have their election and it's considered a

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,200
fairly free and fair election. One of the candidates of

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,867
that election was this gentleman over here,

21
00:00:54,867 --> 00:01:00,600
Salvador Allende, who was a known Marxist.

22
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:07,267
He has communist ideologies here and he is known to be

23
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,867
sympathetic to what has happened in Cuba,

24
00:01:09,867 --> 00:01:12,400
sympathetic to the Soviets.

25
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,267
So you can imagine in this context, America is concerned.

26
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:18,800
It's in the middle of the Cold War.

27
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,933
You have Richard Nixon, president.

28
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:24,467
You have Henry Kissinger, as his secretary of state.

29
00:01:24,467 --> 00:01:26,000
They are actively watching this election.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,333
They clearly do not want Salvador Allende to become president.

31
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:32,667
All of a sudden a major country in Latin America,

32
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:35,467
controlled by a Marxist.

33
00:01:35,467 --> 00:01:38,400
Unlucky for them, Salvador Allende actually does get more votes than everyone else.

34
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:43,733
He gets 36 percent of the votes, which is a plurality.

35
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:46,867
Just so you know what plurality means,

36
00:01:46,867 --> 00:01:49,400
it means you got more votes than anyone else,

37
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,800
but not necessarily the majority of the votes.

38
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,067
If he had gotten 51% of the votes that would be a majority.

39
00:01:55,067 --> 00:01:59,333
In this case he didn't get a majority and the standard procedure in Chile is that

40
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:04,067
if no one gets a majority it goes to Congress and Congress picks who's president.

41
00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:09,200
And the usual thing that they would do is that they would pick whoever has the largest amount of votes.

42
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,800
They normally didn't do a runoff.

43
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,133
So you can imagine Nixon and Kissinger, they're worried

44
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:18,667
so they kind of get into "let's mess with what's going on in Chile" mode

45
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:23,067
and this part is well-established, that they had this, what they called a Track 1 strategy,

46
00:02:23,067 --> 00:02:27,400
of actually trying to get the Chilean Congress to not do what they normally do

47
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,133
to not pick the guy with the largest number of votes.

48
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:34,933
So they were trying to mess there. Didn't seem like something they would be able to pull off.

49
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:42,533
The other thing that it looks like they started to kind of get involved with, through the CIA, is

50
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:53,267
they started to at least interface--it's not clear how much they actually supported--they actually started to talk to people in the military

51
00:02:53,267 --> 00:02:56,200
and see, well, how likely is a coup to happen?

52
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,333
How likely is Allende to be overthrown if he becomes president?

53
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:09,467
They were looking for people who could, I guess, keep this known Marxist from becoming president.

54
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:13,267
And the number one problem was this guy right over here.

55
00:03:13,267 --> 00:03:15,667
The number one problem was this guy right over here.

56
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:22,200
In this whole video, I would say that Rene Schneider was the only unambiguously good guy in this video.

57
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,867
He was the commander in chief of the Chilean military

58
00:03:25,867 --> 00:03:32,333
and he said, "Look, I don't care who becomes president, I don't care how much I disagree with him,

59
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:35,067
I don't care how much pressure the Americans put on me

60
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:37,467
or how much pressure the rest of the military puts on me

61
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:43,933
the role of the Chilean military is not to mess with politics."

62
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:46,900
They call him the constitutionalist.

63
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,867
The role of the Chilean military is not to overthrow people when we don't like them.

64
00:03:49,867 --> 00:03:53,333
The role of the Chilean military is only to defend Chile.

65
00:03:53,333 --> 00:04:00,467
Is only to literally do, I guess, what militarys are supposed to do, what constitutions say the military is supposed to do.

66
00:04:00,467 --> 00:04:06,067
So you can imagine that the people who wanted to overthrow Allende,

67
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:09,533
now that he's, now that it looks like he's going to come to power,

68
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:12,200
they say that this guy is not a convenient guy to have in power.

69
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,733
He doesn't like to play the way we play.

70
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:17,867
Even though there were other elements in the military that did want to do that.

71
00:04:17,867 --> 00:04:23,333
And so, and this is what is a little unclear, you have this former general in the Chilean military

72
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:29,000
who is clearly anti-Allende, and he is also anti-Schneider.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,333
Because this guy right here, Roberto Viaux, he thinks that the military should be, I guess,

74
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,400
actively overthrowing dictators.

75
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,933
So there is some contact between him and the CIA.

76
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:49,000
It seems like the CIA may have supplied some support to him and then gotten a little freaked out,

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,267
at least Kissinger might have gotten a little freaked out, that this guy seemed a little bit extreme.

78
00:04:53,267 --> 00:04:58,533
But remember, we are in this period where Allende was, he got 36% of the votes,

79
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:01,200
Congress is kind of trying to figure out what they do about it.

80
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,333
And during this period there are some people say,

81
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:09,267
"Well, look, if Rene Schneider is not going to do what's in their mind the 'right' thing

82
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:14,800
and depose the eventual Allende, then we'll have to depose Rene Schneider."

83
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,533
So you have this plot that's worked up by Roberto Viaux

84
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:23,333
to essentially kidnap Rene Schneider that would essentially depose him

85
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:26,400
from being head of the military and they could put in his place

86
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,200
someone who is more likely to have a coup, more likely

87
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:35,800
to want to overthrow Allende.

88
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,733
Unfortunately, when this guy's people try to kidnap Schneider,

89
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:43,600
Schneider he's got a gun, he sees these guys kidnapping

90
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,267
he takes out the gun and then the kidnappers shoot him, several times and he eventually dies.

91
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:53,067
So this essentially turns into, this kidnapping turns into an assassination of Rene Schneider

92
00:05:53,067 --> 00:05:58,600
and they wanted to kill him just because or remove him

93
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,533
or whatever just because he essentially wanted to do his job.

94
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:09,000
So he's the only person in this whole narrative where I'll say he was an unambiguous good guy.

95
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,400
Now what's not clear is how much involvement the Americans or the CIA had

96
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,000
in supporting this kind of assassination or this kidnapping of Schneider.

97
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It does look like they kind of knew something was going on.

98
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,533
This is a quote from Kissinger. Seems pretty well substantiated, where he told Nixon,

99
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:30,733
a few days before Scheider was assassinated,

100
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:32,200
when Nixon said, "Hey, what's going on in Chile?

101
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:39,933
Are we working on any ways through the military, are we doing anything potentially, maybe about Schneider?"

102
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:45,000
I don't know. Look that up for yourself. I don't know how much Nixon may or may not have known.

103
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Kissinger told Nixon, "This looks hopeless. I turned it off. Nothing could be worse than an abortive coup."

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,267
So this quote is interesting because it looks like they thought about it.

105
00:06:56,267 --> 00:07:00,200
I mean, "I turned it off" which implies that at one point he had it turned on.

106
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,533
So at one point they were actively thinking about working with Roberto Viaux,

107
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:10,467
maybe to kidnap Schneider, maybe to orchestrate a coup against Allende

108
00:07:10,467 --> 00:07:15,267
but they turned it off. So it's definitely not, they're not morally above doing this type of thing,

109
00:07:15,267 --> 00:07:21,067
but they decided this guy was not as competent as maybe they thought he should

110
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:22,267
and at least according to Kissinger, he's saying,

111
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:25,667
"We turned it off because nothing could be worse than an abortive coup."

112
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:29,800
And it turned out that's exactly what happened, because as soon as this guy go killed,

113
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,600
everyone was like, oh my god, you have all of these shady elements

114
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,867
who are trying to kind of overthrow democracy.

115
00:07:35,867 --> 00:07:41,733
And that actually put more pressure on Congress to say hey, we have to let Allende become president.

116
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:45,600
So in November he gets inaugurated president.

117
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,867
November, Allende becomes president.

118
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:53,933
And this is always, there is a bunch of different stories here

119
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:56,000
how much the CIA was involved.

120
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,333
The counter-argument is look, the CIA would not have wanted to assassinate Schneider

121
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:04,667
because this would have only made it, made Allende all the more popular.

122
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:09,667
They would only have wanted to remove him and put someone else there

123
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:12,600
who was more likely to have a coup against Allende later.

124
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,067
Who knows? If you believe Kissinger's words, it looks like maybe he,

125
00:08:16,067 --> 00:08:20,600
they provided some initial support to Viaux and then they backed off a little bit.

126
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:26,667
Who knows? Well regardless, by November of 1970 Salvador Allende became president.

127
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:33,867
And he starting implementing his kind of Marxist ideology and it didn't go that well.

128
00:08:33,867 --> 00:08:40,000
Chile's economy, especially if you fast forward to 1972, 1973, not doing so well.

129
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,600
He started doing price fixing. He tried to do the fairly naive approach

130
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,600
of raising salaries while keeping prices fixed, which will obviously lead to shortages.

131
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,600
So all around, he wasn't the most popular president.

132
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,533
It didn't look like his, especially his economic policies, were working out that well.

133
00:08:56,533 --> 00:09:00,200
People who are pro-Allende would say, well look, just like what the United States did to Cuba

134
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,400
they started doing in Chile.

135
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,267
As soon as they had a Marxist in charge, someone they didn't like,

136
00:09:04,267 --> 00:09:11,800
the United States started swinging its huge economic power around to kind of hurt the Chillean economy

137
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,733
so that this guy would come out of power.

138
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:16,600
I let you decide that.

139
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:22,933
You fast forward all the way to 1973. So now Allende has been in power for about three years.

140
00:09:22,933 --> 00:09:26,867
Things are not going well for him. There are strikes going on.

141
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:29,600
He tries to clamp down on the media a bit.

142
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:36,067
There is unrest. There people who definitely do not want him to be president anymore.

143
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:41,133
And the people who don't think much of the United States will say

144
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:45,733
Hey, but the United States the whole time was kind of actively undermining Allende and that's probably true.

145
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:49,000
The United States will say no, look, we were trying to keep the press free.

146
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,667
This guy was clamping down on free press.

147
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:54,867
We were trying to keep things so that there will be another election.

148
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:57,267
So that this guy won't turn into another Fidel Castro

149
00:09:57,267 --> 00:10:02,267
and essentially just turn Chile into a totalitarian, Communist regime.

150
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:08,933
Regardless of which side you take, on September 11, 1973 Allende is deposed.

151
00:10:08,933 --> 00:10:14,200
The military surrounds the presidential palace and,

152
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,867
it is said, that he commits "suicide."

153
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:22,133
And I put that in quotes because, once again, some people believe that he really did commit suicide.

154
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:24,400
Some people believe he was assassinated.

155
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,200
And some accounts say that he committed suicide with an automatic weapon.

156
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,667
Well, I guess you could commit suicide with an automatic weapon,

157
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:34,200
but it doesn't seem like the weapon of choice for many people.

158
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,667
But I'll leave that once again for you to decide.

159
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:40,333
Maybe it's not even, well, whether or not he committed suicide,

160
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,400
or whether he was killed,

161
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,200
but regardless, on September 11th he gets thrown out of power

162
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,067
and once again, it's not clear what role the CIA played.

163
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,333
They clearly were sympathetic to the people who wanted to overthrow him.

164
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:59,333
They clearly were providing indirect support throughout Allende's regime

165
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,733
to all of the people who were anti-Allende.

166
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:04,600
And you could look up, there are actually some declassified documents

167
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,200
that hint at what the level of CIA involvement might have been.

168
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:17,000
Regardless to say, Allende deposed, and this gentleman comes to power right over here.

169
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,400
Augusto Pinochet. And he comes to power and he says,

170
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,067
look, you know, this democracy thing is silly.

171
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:29,400
I am the president. I am the commander in chief.

172
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:36,467
Chile will be run by military junta. And let me write that word down.

173
00:11:36,467 --> 00:11:38,133
Chile will be run by a junta.

174
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:42,000
And a junta just means a government that's run by the military.

175
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,733
It's a military dictatorship. The military is now in charge of Chile.

176
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:50,867
We don't need people to do silly things like voting anymore.

177
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:54,867
And you can imagine Nixon didn't care so much that this guy didn't like democracy,

178
00:11:54,867 --> 00:11:59,400
but he was happy, let me see if I can put a smile on his face,

179
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,867
he was happy that at least Pinochet was not a Marxist,

180
00:12:02,867 --> 00:12:08,600
that at least we had stopped the spread of Communism in Latin America.

181
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:14,400
Unfortunately, and Nixon with that said, and this is explicit, he wanted to do everything in his power

182
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:20,067
to make Augusto Pinochet successful, especially from an economic point of view.

183
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:26,467
So Nixon does, we do, the United States does start supporting Pinochet.

184
00:12:26,467 --> 00:12:28,667
He's viewed as kind of an American friend.

185
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:35,333
Unfortunately for America and unfortunately for Chile, this guy is one of those big time tyrants in history.

186
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:39,600
So he is a tyrant. And he starts rounding up people.

187
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,600
He starts killing people. He's one of those people that anything, anyone who had a whiff of Communism,

188
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,600
or a whiff of political opposition, he would round them up

189
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,533
he would round their family up, he would torture people.

190
00:12:51,533 --> 00:12:55,600
And just to kind of put some...and this is another picture of him when he's older.

191
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,400
It's amazing how gentle some fairly evil people can look in the world.

192
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,667
So I'll put some unambiguous horns on him.

193
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:07,533
But he killed many, many people.

194
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:09,000
And many, many people disappeared.

195
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,533
And just to give an idea of what this...these are some of the people who disappeared.

196
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:19,933
And it was anyone from people who were critical of him, people who were perceived to be left-leaning, whatever it was.

197
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:24,200
And he tortured, including women and children and all the rest.

198
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:31,067
So all around bad guy. He stuck around in Chile as president until 1990, so that's 17 years.

199
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:35,600
And he really stayed in power until 1998 where he was commander in chief of the army.

200
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,600
You can imagine if the military is in control, the president isn't that important of a title,

201
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,600
commander in chief is.

202
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:49,200
So for 25 years he hung around Chile and he continued to be kind of this totalitarian guy,

203
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:55,000
although he was a big, he liked free markets, he was a capitalist in the traditional sense.

204
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,333
And the one, I guess, silver lining, if you have to throw a silver lining on Pinochet's regime

205
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:06,067
is that the Chilean economy actually did well during his regime.

206
00:14:06,067 --> 00:14:11,267
Chile is considered one of the success stories economically over that time period.

207
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,067
So I'll let you decide.

208
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:17,333
And some people would say, oh, that's because Pinochet was, he understood economics.

209
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:20,867
He didn't try to do all this price fixing stuff that Allende tried to do.

210
00:14:20,867 --> 00:14:24,000
Regardless of the fact that he was a tyrant,

211
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,667
at least people, you know, the economy was doing well.

212
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:30,600
The other side of the equation would be, well look, of course the economy did well.

213
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,867
Now you had the United States doing everything in its power,

214
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:37,800
this huge, the largest economy in the world doing everything in its power

215
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:43,400
to make sure that Chile's economy thrives while one of its buddies are in power.

216
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,067
So I'll let you decide who's right, who's wrong,

217
00:14:46,067 --> 00:14:51,200
what was the actual involvement of the CIA and Nixon and Kissinger

218
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,533
and all of this mess over here.

219
00:14:52,533 --> 99:59:59,999
But I think, needless to say, that this was a not so pleasant chapter in, I guess, world history.
