1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660
   

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,730
So you might be wondering why I
went off into permutations and

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,550
combinations in the probability
playlist, and I think you'll

4
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,560
learn in this video.

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,626
So let's say I want to figure
out the probability-- I'm going

6
00:00:11,626 --> 00:00:14,200
to flip a coin eight times
and it's a fair coin.

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,710
And I want to figure out
the probability of getting

8
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,480
exactly 3 out of 8 heads.

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,740
So I say 3/8 heads, but 3 of my
flips are going to be heads and

10
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,050
the rest are going to be tails.

11
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,720
So how do I think about that?

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,460
Well, let's go back to one
of the early definitions

13
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,910
we used for probability.

14
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,810
And that says, the probability
of anything happening is the

15
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:42,300
probability of the number of
equally probable events into

16
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,040
which what we're
stating is true.

17
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,590
So in which the number of
events-- I guess trials or

18
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:55,390
situations-- in which we
get 3 heads, and exactly 3

19
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,200
heads, we're not saying
greater than 3 heads.

20
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,770
So 4 heads won't count and 2
heads won't count, 5 heads

21
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,480
won't-- only 3 heads.

22
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:10,320
And then, over the total number
of equally probable trials--

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,476
not trials, total number of
equally possible outcomes.

24
00:01:13,476 --> 00:01:15,880
I should be using
the word outcomes.

25
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,640
So just with the word outcomes
it should be the total number

26
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,070
of outcomes in which what
we're saying happens.

27
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:26,050
So we get 3 heads over the
total possible outcomes.

28
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,705
So let's do the
bottom part first.

29
00:01:27,705 --> 00:01:31,620
   

30
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,210
What are the total possible
outcomes if I'm flipping

31
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,070
a fair coin eight times?

32
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,980
Well, the first time I flip
it I either get heads or

33
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,620
tails, so I get 2 outcomes.

34
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,230
And then when I flip it
again I get 2 more come

35
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:45,970
for the second one.

36
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,810
And then, how many
total outcomes?

37
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,790
Well, that's 2 times 2 because
I could have got 2 in the

38
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,570
first, 2 in the second flip.

39
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,560
And then essentially we
would multiply 2 times

40
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,210
the number of flips.

41
00:01:55,210 --> 00:02:00,280
So that's 5, 6, 7, 8, and
that equals 2 to the eighth.

42
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,400
So the number of outcomes is
just going to be 2 to the

43
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,860
total number of flips.

44
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,020
And hopefully that
make sense to you.

45
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,400
If not, you might want
to re-watch some of

46
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,440
the earlier videos.

47
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,280
But that's the easy part.

48
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,690
So there's 2 to the eighth
possible outcomes when you

49
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,340
flip a fair coin eight times.

50
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,060
So how many of those outcomes
are going to result

51
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,761
in exactly 3 heads?

52
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:25,200
Let's think of it this way.

53
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,980
Let's give a name to
each of our flips.

54
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,340
Let's give a name to them.

55
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,260
So let me make a little column,
we'll call these the flips.

56
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,890
This is my flips column.

57
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,020
And I could name them anything.

58
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,280
I could name them
Larry, Curly, Moe.

59
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,010
I could name them-- well, I
would need 5 more names for

60
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,840
them, but I could name them the
7 dwarfs or the 8 dwarfs really

61
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,000
because I have 8 flips.

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,860
I'll number the flips.

63
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:58,530
Flip 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

64
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,270
And I'm the god of probability.

65
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:04,260
And essentially, I need to just
pick 3 of these flips that

66
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,890
are going to result in heads.

67
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,340
So another way to think about
it is, these could be 8 people

68
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,680
and I could pick which of
these-- how many ways can I

69
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,710
pick 3 of these people
to put into the car?

70
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,760
How many ways can I pick 3 of
these people to sit in chairs.

71
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,510
And it doesn't matter the
order that I pick them in.

72
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,770
It doesn't matter if I say the
people that are going to get in

73
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,280
the car are going to
be people 1, 2, 3 3.

74
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,970
Or if I say 3, 2, and 1,
or if I say 2, 3, and 1.

75
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:35,030
Those are all the
same combination.

76
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,290
So similarly, if I'm just
picking flips and I have

77
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,070
to say, OK, 3 of these
flips are going to get

78
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,830
into the heads car.

79
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,830
Heads is like they're sitting,
they're people sitting down.

80
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,040
I don't want to
confuse you too much.

81
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,320
But essentially I'm
just going to choose 3

82
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,340
things out of the 8.

83
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,580
So I'm essentially just saying,
how many combinations can I get

84
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,810
where I pick 3 out of these 8.

85
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,800
And so that should immediately
ring a bell that we're

86
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,290
essentially saying, out of 8
things we're going to choose 3.

87
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,440
   

88
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,650
How many combinations of 3
can we pick of 8 and that we

89
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,590
went over in the last video.

90
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,500
And let's do it with
the formula first.

91
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,950
So let me write the formula up
here just so you remember it,

92
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,230
but I also want to give you the
intuition again,

93
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,510
for the formula.

94
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:28,430
So in general, we said, n
choose k, that is equal to n

95
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:37,130
factorial over k factorial
times n minus k factorial.

96
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:43,640
So in this situation that
would equal 8 factorial over

97
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,360
3 factorial times what?

98
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,510
8 minus k-- times 5 factorial.

99
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:53,790
Or another way of writing this,
this would be 8 times 7 times 6

100
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:58,880
times 5 times 4 times 3 times 2
times 1 over-- I'll just write

101
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,050
3 factorial for a second.

102
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:05,520
Then times 5 times 4
times 3 times 2 times 1.

103
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,440
And of course, that and that
cancel out and all you're

104
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:13,400
left with is 8 times 7
time 6 over 3 factorial.

105
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,000
And I did this for reason
because I want you to re-get

106
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:24,100
the intuition at least for
this part of the formula.

107
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,790
That's essentially just saying,
how many permutations can I--

108
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,210
how many ways can I pick
3 things out of 8?

109
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,420
And that's essentially saying,
well, before I pick anything

110
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,860
I could pick 1 of 8.

111
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,230
Then I have 7 left to pick
from for the second spot.

112
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,650
And then I have 6 left to
pick for the third spot.

113
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,670
And so that's essentially
the number of permutations.

114
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:47,910
But since we don't care what
order we picked them in, we

115
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,350
need to divide by the number of
ways we can rearrange 3 things,

116
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,960
and that's where the 3
factorial comes from.

117
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,460
And so hopefully I didn't
confuse you, but if I did you

118
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,560
can go back to this formula
for the binomial coefficient.

119
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,090
But it's good to
have the intuition.

120
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,910
And then once we're
at this point we can

121
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,460
just calculate this.

122
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,050
Well, what's this?

123
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,720
This is 8 times 7 times
6 over 3 factorial of

124
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,720
3 times 2 times 1.

125
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,090
So that's 6.

126
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,130
The 6 cancels out,
so it's 8 times 7.

127
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,760
So there's 8 times
7, or what is that?

128
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,060
56.

129
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,560
   

130
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,800
That's equal to 56.

131
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,140
So there's 56 different ways
to pick 3 things out of 8.

132
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:34,180
Or if I have 8 people there's
56 ways of picking 3 people to

133
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,030
sit in the car or however
you want t view it.

134
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,430
But if I have 8 flips there's
56 ways of picking 3 of

135
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,270
those flips to be heads.

136
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,480
So let's go to our original
probability problem.

137
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,180
What is the probably that
I get 3 out of 8 heads?

138
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:53,030
Well, it's the number of ways
I can pick 3 out of those 8,

139
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:58,170
so it equals 56, over the
total number of outcomes.

140
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,430
The total number of outcomes
is 2 to the eighth.

141
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:03,100
Another way I could write
that-- 56, let me unseparate.

142
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:08,670
That's 8 times 7 over
2 to the eighth.

143
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,140
8 is 2 to the third.

144
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:14,660
Let me erase some of this.

145
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,940
Not with that color.

146
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,690
Let me erase that.

147
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:23,400
Let me erase all of
this just so I space.

148
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,050
And I will switch
colors for variety.

149
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,750
Let me use the small pen.

150
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,590
OK, so I'm back.

151
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,750
All right, so 8 is the same
thing as 2 to the third times

152
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,760
7-- this is all just
mathematical simplification,

153
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,940
but it's useful-- over
2 to the eighth.

154
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,430
And so, if we just divide both
sides-- the numerator and the

155
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:46,075
denominator by 2 to the
third, this becomes 1.

156
00:07:46,075 --> 00:07:48,830
This becomes 2 to the fifth.

157
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:58,460
And so it becomes 7/32.

158
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,070
Is that right?

159
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:06,160
So if I were to pick 3 out of
8-- yep, I think that is right.

160
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,510
And so what does that
turn out to be?

161
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,442
Let me get my calculator.

162
00:08:10,442 --> 00:08:10,910
[INAUDIBLE]

163
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,260
to make careless mistakes.

164
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:13,680
Let's see.

165
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,126
My calculator seems
to have disappeared.

166
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:18,140
Let me get it back.

167
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,530
There it is.

168
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,140
OK.

169
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:32,070
7 divided by 32 is
equal to 0.21875.

170
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:37,370
Which is equal to 21.-- you
know, if I were to round

171
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,820
roughly-- 21.9% chance.

172
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,820
So there's a little bit better
than 1 in 5 chance that I get

173
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,420
exactly 3 out of the
8 flips as heads.

174
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,840
Hopefully I didn't confuse you
and now you can apply that

175
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,730
to pretty much anything.

176
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,720
You could say, well, what is
the probability of getting-- if

177
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,430
I flip a fair coin-- of getting
exactly 7 out of 8 heads?

178
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,780
Or you could say, what's
the probability of getting

179
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,470
2 out of 100 heads?

180
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,370
And you could use it the exact
same way we did this problem.

181
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,410
I'll see you in the next video.
