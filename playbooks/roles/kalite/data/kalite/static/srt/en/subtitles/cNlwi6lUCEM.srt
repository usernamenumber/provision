1
00:00:00,238 --> 00:00:05,610
We have the question: Devon is going to make 3 shelves for her father.

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,424
She has a piece of lumber that is 12 feet long.

3
00:00:09,424 --> 00:00:13,841
She wants the top shelf to be half a foot shorter than the middle shelf.middle shelf.

4
00:00:13,841 --> 00:00:15,669
So let me do this in different colors.

5
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:23,343
She wants the top shelf to be half a foot shorter than the middle shelf,

6
00:00:23,343 --> 00:00:25,707
let's just read the whole thing first,

7
00:00:25,707 --> 00:00:31,152
and the bottom shelf to be half a foot
shorter than twice the length of the top shelf.

8
00:00:31,152 --> 00:00:34,326
Let me do that in a different color. I'll do that in blue.

9
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:43,111
(Sal repeats) The bottom shelf to be half a foot shorter than twice the length of the top shelf.

10
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:49,442
How long will each shelf be if she uses the entire 12 feet of wood?

11
00:00:49,442 --> 00:00:52,504
So let's define some variables
for our different shelves,

12
00:00:52,504 --> 00:00:54,235
because that's what we
have to figure out.

13
00:00:54,235 --> 00:00:56,827
We have the top shelf,
the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf.

14
00:00:56,827 --> 00:01:08,169
So let's say that t is equal to
length of top shelf-- t for top-- of top shelf.

15
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:17,476
Let's make m equal the length
of the middle shelf.

16
00:01:17,476 --> 00:01:21,741
m for middle.

17
00:01:21,741 --> 00:01:29,991
And then let's make b equal to
the length of the bottom shelf

18
00:01:29,991 --> 00:01:33,175
b for bottom. Bottom shelf.

19
00:01:33,175 --> 00:01:36,773
So let's see what these
different statements tell us.

20
00:01:36,773 --> 00:01:39,045
So this first statement, she
says she wants the top shelf--

21
00:01:39,045 --> 00:01:40,826
and I'll do it in that same
color--

22
00:01:40,826 --> 00:01:44,245
she wants the top shelf to be 1/2 a foot shorter
than the middle shelf.

23
00:01:44,245 --> 00:01:49,430
So she wants the length of the
top shelf to be--

24
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:57,239
so this is equal to 1/2 a foot shorter
than the middle shelf.

25
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:59,300
So, if we're doing everything in
feet,

26
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:05,246
it's going to be the length of the middle
shelf in feet minus 1/2, minus 1/2 feet.

27
00:02:05,246 --> 00:02:08,414
So that's what that sentence
in orange is telling us.

28
00:02:08,414 --> 00:02:13,107
The top shelf needs to be 1/2 a
foot shorter than the length of the middle shelf.

29
00:02:13,107 --> 00:02:16,123
Now, what does the next
statement tell us?

30
00:02:16,123 --> 00:02:18,109
And the bottom shelf to be--

31
00:02:18,109 --> 00:02:21,878
so the bottom shelf needs to be equal to 1/2 a foot shorter than--

32
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:30,095
so it's 1/2 a foot shorter than twice the length
of the top shelf.

33
00:02:30,095 --> 00:02:34,563
So it's 1/2 a foot shorter
than twice the length of the top shelf.

34
00:02:34,563 --> 00:02:40,073
These are the two statements
interpreted in equal equation form.

35
00:02:40,073 --> 00:02:46,706
The top shelf's length has to be
equal to the middle shelf's length minus 1/2.

36
00:02:46,706 --> 00:02:48,206
It's 1/2 foot shorter than
the middle shelf.

37
00:02:48,206 --> 00:02:53,377
And the bottom shelf needs to
be 1/2 a foot shorter than twice the length of
the top shelf.

38
00:02:53,377 --> 00:02:55,539
And so how do we solve this?

39
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:57,904
Well, you can't just solve
it just with these two constraints,

40
00:02:57,904 --> 00:03:01,263
but they gave us more information.

41
00:03:01,263 --> 00:03:07,358
They tell us how long will each
shelf be if she uses the entire 12 feet of wood?

42
00:03:07,358 --> 00:03:11,078
So the length of all of
the shelves have to add up to 12 feet.

43
00:03:11,078 --> 00:03:12,867
She's using all of it.

44
00:03:12,867 --> 00:03:20,552
So t plus m, plus b needs
to be equal to 12 feet.

45
00:03:20,552 --> 00:03:22,947
That's the length
of each of them.

46
00:03:22,947 --> 00:03:25,067
She's using all 12
feet of the wood.

47
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:27,847
So the lengths have
to add to 12.

48
00:03:27,847 --> 00:03:29,881
So what can we do here?

49
00:03:29,881 --> 00:03:32,702
Well, we can get everything here
in terms of one variable,

50
00:03:32,702 --> 00:03:35,404
maybe we'll do it in terms of
m, and then substitute.

51
00:03:35,404 --> 00:03:37,932
So we already have
t in terms of m.

52
00:03:37,932 --> 00:03:45,700
We could, everywhere we see
a t, we could substitute

53
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,165
with m minus 1/2.

54
00:03:46,165 --> 00:03:47,749
But here we have b
in terms of t.

55
00:03:47,749 --> 00:03:50,083
So how can we put this
in terms of m?

56
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:53,022
Well, we know that t is
equal to m minus 1/2.

57
00:03:53,022 --> 00:03:57,234
So let's take, everywhere we see
a "t", let's substitute it with this thing right here.

58
00:03:57,234 --> 00:04:00,337
That is what t is equal to.

59
00:04:00,337 --> 00:04:03,172
So we can rewrite this blue
equation as, the length of the

60
00:04:03,172 --> 00:04:07,683
bottom shelf is 2 times the
length of the top shelf, t,

61
00:04:07,683 --> 00:04:16,013
but we know that t is equal
to m minus 1/2.

62
00:04:16,013 --> 00:04:18,699
And if we wanted to simplify
that a little bit,

63
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:23,230
this would be that the bottom shelf is
equal to--

64
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,831
let's distribute the 2-- 2 times m is 2m.

65
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:30,554
2 times negative 1/2 is negative 1.

66
00:04:30,554 --> 00:04:32,790
And then minus another 1/2.

67
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,935
Or, we could rewrite this as"

68
00:04:34,935 --> 00:04:40,331
b is equal to 2 times the middle shelf minus 3/2.

69
00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:41,784
Right?

70
00:04:41,784 --> 00:04:46,956
1/2 is 2/2 minus another
1/2 is negative 3/2, just like that.

71
00:04:46,956 --> 00:04:51,215
So now we have everything in
terms of m, and we can substitute back here.

72
00:04:51,215 --> 00:04:56,717
So the top shelf-- instead of
putting a t there, we could put m minus 1/2.

73
00:04:56,717 --> 00:05:03,737
So we put m minus 1/2, plus
the length of the middle shelf,

74
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:05,990
plus the length of the bottom shelf.

75
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,900
Well, we already put
that in terms of m.

76
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,262
That's what we just did.

77
00:05:12,262 --> 00:05:14,422
This is the length of the bottom
shelf in terms of m.

78
00:05:14,422 --> 00:05:18,287
So instead of writing b there,
we could write 2m minus 3/2.

79
00:05:18,287 --> 00:05:23,017
Plus 2m minus 3/2, and
that is equal to 12.

80
00:05:23,017 --> 00:05:27,787
All we did is substitute
for t.

81
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:31,384
We wrote t in terms of m, and
we wrote b in terms of m.

82
00:05:31,384 --> 00:05:35,612
Now let's combine the m terms
and the constant terms.

83
00:05:35,612 --> 00:05:39,253
So if we have one m here, we
have another m there,

84
00:05:39,253 --> 00:05:40,710
and then we have a 2m there.

85
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,319
They're all positive.

86
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:44,955
So 1 plus 1, plus 2 is 4m.

87
00:05:45,002 --> 00:05:46,734
So we have 4m.

88
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:49,462
And then what do our constant
terms tell us?

89
00:05:49,462 --> 00:05:54,924
We have a negative 1/2, and then
we have a negative 3/2.

90
00:05:54,924 --> 00:06:00,610
So negative 1/2 minus 3/2,
that is negative 4/2 or negative 2.

91
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,862
So we have 4m minus 2.

92
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,712
And, of course, we still
have that equals 12.

93
00:06:06,712 --> 00:06:10,080
Now, we want to isolate just the
m variable on one side of the equation.

94
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,691
So let's add 2 to both sides
to get rid of this 2 on the left-hand side.

95
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:18,789
So if we add 2 to both sides
of this equation, the

96
00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:29,556
left-hand side, we're just
left with 4m-- these guys cancel out-- is equal to 14.

97
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:36,697
Now, divide both sides by 4, we
get m is equal to 14 over

98
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:42,952
4, or we could call that 7/2
feet, because we're doing everything in feet.

99
00:06:42,952 --> 00:06:44,765
So we solved for m,

100
00:06:44,765 --> 00:06:50,156
but now we still have to solve for t and b.

101
00:06:50,156 --> 00:06:50,889
So let's do that.

102
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:51,907
Let's solve for t.

103
00:06:51,907 --> 00:06:53,689
t is equal to m minus 1/2.

104
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:58,956
So it's equal to-- our m is 7/2
minus 1/2,

105
00:06:58,956 --> 00:07:01,904
which is equal to 6/2, or 3 feet.

106
00:07:01,904 --> 00:07:06,285
Everything is in feet,
so that's how we know it's feet there.

107
00:07:06,285 --> 00:07:08,358
So that's the top
shelf is 3 feet.

108
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:15,002
The middle shelf is 7/2 feet,
which is the same thing as 3 and 1/2 feet.

109
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:19,665
And then the bottom shelf
is 2 times the top shelf, minus 1/2.

110
00:07:19,665 --> 00:07:22,133
So what's that going
to be equal to?

111
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:24,949
That's going to be equal to 2
times 3 feet--

112
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:33,118
that's what the length of the top shelf is--
minus 1/2, which is equal to 6 minus 1/2, or 5 and 1/2 feet.

113
00:07:33,118 --> 00:07:37,236
And we're done.

114
00:07:37,236 --> 00:07:40,440
And you can verify that these
definitely do add up to 12.

115
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:46,236
5 and 1/2 plus 3 and 1/2 is 9,
plus 3 is 12 feet, and it meets all of the other
constraints.

116
00:07:46,236 --> 00:07:50,608
The top shelf is 1/2 a foot
shorter than the middle shelf,

117
00:07:50,608 --> 00:07:55,575
and the bottom shelf is 1/2
a foot shorter than 2 times the top shelf.

118
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,187
And we are done.

119
00:07:57,187 --> 00:08:01,020
We know the lengths of
the shelves that Devon needs to make.
