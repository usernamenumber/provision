00:00:00,906 --> 00:00:05,224
Write 5.1/4 as an improper fraction

2
00:00:05,224 --> 00:00:07,779
Let me remind you an improper fraction

3
00:00:07,779 --> 00:00:11,726
is one where the numerator is gretaer than or equal

4
00:00:11,726 --> 00:00:17,624
to denominator, absolute value of numerator

5
00:00:17,624 --> 00:00:20,317
is greater than or equal to

6
00:00:20,317 --> 00:00:34,807
absolute value of denominator

7
00:00:36,711 --> 00:00:38,058
In this situation right here we have

8
00:00:38,058 --> 00:00:40,194
a mixed number where 5 is the whole number

9
00:00:40,194 --> 00:00:43,723
and 1/4 is a proper fraction as numerator

10
00:00:43,723 --> 00:00:49,621
is less than denominator

11
00:00:49,621 --> 00:00:54,219
So write as an improper fraction I will

12
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:55,380
show you the methodology

13
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:02,067
So 5.1/4, the methodology is simple

14
00:01:02,067 --> 00:01:09,126
5 is the same thing as 20/4

15
00:01:09,126 --> 00:01:13,305
So 20/4 + 1/4 = 21/4

16
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:17,624
Another way to think is 5 x 4 = 20 + 1 = 21

17
00:01:17,624 --> 00:01:21,533
So its 21/4

18
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:29,792
You take the mixed number or you take the whole part

19
00:01:29,792 --> 00:01:32,067
of the mixed number multiply it with

20
00:01:32,067 --> 00:01:35,782
the denominator & add the numerator to it.

21
00:01:35,782 --> 00:01:45,024
So let us see why it works.

22
00:01:45,024 --> 00:01:50,132
lets us see what 5.1/4 is

23
00:01:50,132 --> 00:01:56,309
We have 5 wholes, this is one whole

24
00:01:56,309 --> 00:02:05,667
let me copy it five times

25
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:14,533
So that is 2, 3, 4 & that is 5

26
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:30,867
So we have 5 wholes and then we have 1/4

27
00:02:30,867 --> 00:02:38,933
1/4th of a whole is like this

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,400
To write it as a improper fraction

29
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:54,200
Divide each of the wholes into 1/4ths

30
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:02,533
This is 4, 1/4ths, another 4,1/4ths another 4,1/4ths

31
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:11,400
this is another 4, 1/4ths. So how many

32
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:25,000
1/4ths we have it is 20 , 1/4ths in green

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,600
That is the same thing as 5

34
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:48,733
and then we can add to that 1/4ths.

35
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:59,200
Then we will get 21/4.

36
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,867
That is the conceptual way of how it works.

37
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:06,733
Multiply the whole number by the denominator

38
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:10,267
and add the numertaor to it

39
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:13,533
5.1/4 = 21/4

40
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:19,400
5.1/4 =( ( 5x4) + 1)/4
