1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,000
Problem 35.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,910
In the figure below, every angle is a right angle.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:06,610
So they're just saying that's a right angle,

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,030
that's a right angle, these are all right angles.

5
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,060
You get the idea.

6
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:16,010
What is the area, in square units, of the figure?

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,050
So the area. How can we figure this out?

8
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,280
We can divide this up into a bunch of rectangles

9
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,490
and figure out their respective areas.

10
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,480
So if we drew a rectangle right here,

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,960
that rectangle, what's its area?

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,070
It's going to be 6 times 8, which is 48.

13
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:38,010
That's that rectangle right there, is 48 square units.

14
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,370
Let's see what else we can do.

15
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,030
We can do this rectangle right here.

16
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,300
That rectangle right there is also 6 by 8,

17
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,310
so this is also going to be 48 square units right there.

18
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:52,050
And then we have-- we'll do it in another color.

19
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,020
We have this rectangle--

20
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,160
that rectangle right there is divided right there--

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,850
we have this rectangle right here, which is 3 by 4.

22
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,010
So 3 times 4 is 12 units.

23
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,080
And then you have this rectangle right here,

24
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,030
which is 3 by 4.

25
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,030
So it's also 12 square units.

26
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,010
So the whole area of the entire thing is 12 plus 48,

27
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,590
which is 60. Right?

28
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,580
2 plus 48 is 50, right, that's 60.

29
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,940
So you have 60 there, and then you have another 48,

30
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:23,010
gives you 108, plus 12, which is 120.

31
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:28,060
So the area in square units of the figure is 120.

32
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,080
Problem 36.

33
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:36,050
A rectangular field is 363 feet long and 240 feet wide.

34
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:41,030
How many acres is the field?

35
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,450
So let me draw this field.

36
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,070
I'll do it in green because we're talking about a field.

37
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:55,010
So it is 363 feet long and 240 feet wide.

38
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,370
That's the dimensions of the field.

39
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,750
So if we wanted to do it in square feet,

40
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,390
we would multiply these two numbers.

41
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,540
So how many square feet is it?

42
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,000
Well, I'll do it out here. I'll do it on the left.

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,460
So let me multiply it out.

44
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:12,090
We have 240 times 363.

45
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,000
Actually, I want to do it with a little bit more space.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,080
So we're going to do it in blue.

47
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,080
Maybe I should do it here.

48
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,010
I don't think it will confuse you.

49
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:29,050
So I have 240 times 363.

50
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,000
3 times 0 is 0.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,010
3 times 4 is 12.

52
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,030
Carry the 1.

53
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,020
3 times 2 is 6, plus 1 is 7.

54
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,020
So it's 720.

55
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,540
We can ignore that for a little bit.

56
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,720
Throw a 0 down here.

57
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,780
6 times 0 is 0.

58
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,000
6 times 4 is 24.

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,080
6 times 2 is 12, plus this 2 is 14.

60
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,050
And then we have our last row to deal with.

61
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,060
So we're going to add two 0's

62
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,710
because we're dealing with the hundreds place.

63
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,800
3 times 0 is 0.

64
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,090
3 times 4 is 12.

65
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,000
This was 4, carry the 1.

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,020
3 times 2 is 6, plus 1 is 7.

67
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,020
And now we can just add everything up.

68
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,070
0.

69
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,440
2.

70
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,010
7 plus 4 is 11.

71
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,020
Carry the 1.

72
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,010
1 plus 4 is 5.

73
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,060
5 plus 2 is 7.

74
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,020
And then we have 1 plus 7 is 8.

75
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:41,000
So the field is 87,120 square feet.

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,600
Now, they want to know how many acres is the field?

77
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,020
And they say an acre is 43,560.

78
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,010
And you see all your choices are whole numbers.

79
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,430
And you can just eyeball this, that 87,000

80
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:56,440
whatever is roughly twice 43,560. Right?

81
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,050
80,000 is roughly twice 40,000.

82
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,030
If you wanted to just hand-wave it,

83
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,630
you could just say, well, that's just choice number A,

84
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,000
or that's just 2, right?

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
This looks like 2 times that.

86
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,210
And if you wanted to verify it,

87
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,000
2 times-- let's verify it.

88
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Let me do it in a color that you can actually see.

89
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,860
So 43,560-- you wouldn't actually have to do

90
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,610
this on the test,

91
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,030
but I want to show you that our approximation works.

92
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,430
2 times 0 is 0.

93
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,030
2 times 6 is 12.

94
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,020
2 times 5 is 10, plus the 1 is 11.

95
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,000
2 times 3 is 6, plus 1 is 7.

96
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,360
2 times 4 is 8.

97
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,930
And we've got the exact number

98
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,770
which was the square footage of the field.

99
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,850
So it's 2 acres.

100
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,620
So if you do it like that, it's 2 acres.

101
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,500
1 acre and 2 acres, just like that.

102
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,090
37.

103
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,280
The object below is made of 10 rectangular prisms--

104
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,550
that just means these three-dimensional rectangular things--

105
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:55,470
each with dimensions of 5 centimeters

106
00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:00,050
by 3 centimeters by 2 centimeters.

107
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,260
What is the volume, in cubic centimeters, of the object?

108
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,180
So it's kind of this plus sign,

109
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,150
or this cross looking thing.

110
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,770
And they do this-- I mean,

111
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,930
these things are really just to throw you off.

112
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,490
So what is the volume of each of these

113
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,670
little cubes right there?

114
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,980
So its volume is 5 times 2 times 3.

115
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,750
So each cube has a volume of, what's 5 times 2?

116
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,170
Is 10, times 3 is 30.

117
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:28,030
So each has 30 cubic centimeters.

118
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,400
Do it in a darker color.

119
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,790
Each of these is 30 cubic centimeters.

120
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,060
And how many of these are there in this structure?

121
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,030
Well, we have 2 layers.

122
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:42,420
The top layer has 1 box here, that's 1, 2--

123
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:50,060
this is the second box-- 2, 3, 4, and then 5.

124
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,370
So the top layer has 5 in this plus sign.

125
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:57,900
I could draw it like this.

126
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,540
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

127
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,020
So if we have 5 in the top layer, and we have 2 layers.

128
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,060
So we have 10 of these boxes, right?

129
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,830
So 10 boxes,

130
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:11,200
or rectangular prisms if you want to call it that,

131
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:17,380
times 30 cubic centimeters per box.

132
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:23,000
The boxes cancel out, you get 10 times 30 cubic centimeters,

133
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,250
and you get 300 cubic centimeters is the volume of

134
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,170
this entire structure.

135
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,470
And that is choice D.

136
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,650
I literally think they drew these little diagonals

137
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,760
just to confuse you,

138
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,670
just to maybe make you think that

139
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,070
you have to do something with triangles.

140
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,980
But no, you just have to count the number of boxes

141
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,030
and figure out the volume of each of them.

142
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,760
We had 10 boxes,

143
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,260
each of them has a volume of 30 cubic centimeters,

144
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:49,020
so 300 cubic centimeters total.
