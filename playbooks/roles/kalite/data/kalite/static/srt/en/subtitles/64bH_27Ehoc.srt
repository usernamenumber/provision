1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,410
We know how to find the area of an equilateral triangle

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,280
What I want to do in this video is attempt to find the area of a a

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:10,580
I know I'm mispronouncing it Koch snowflake

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,200
And the way you construct one

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,930
is you start one with an equilateral triangle

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,370
And on each of the sides you split them into thirds

7
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,650
And then the middle third you put

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,600
another smaller equilateral triangle

9
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,260
And that's after one pass

10
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,420
And on the next pass you do that for all of the sides here,

11
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,850
So little one here here here here here here here

12
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,850
I think you get the general idea that's a nice pass

13
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,150
So the next pass you do it for all these sides

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,760
And what's really neat about this and

15
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,310
we showed this on the previous video is that

16
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,680
you have a figure here that has an infinite perimeter

17
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,540
but we're about to see in this video it actually has a finite area

18
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,010
Which is kinda of interesting to think about

19
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,740
So let's start with a clean equilateral triangle right over here

20
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,790
We're gonna assume that each of the sides have length S,

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,940
So, it's going to be a clean equilateral triangle each of the sides

22
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,590
I'll draw that a little bit neater, each of the sides have length S

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,280
And so, what I wanna do that is keep to track of two things

24
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,390
I wanna keep track of the sides of this triangle

25
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,640
as we are or as it as it turns into a snowflake

26
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,200
I gonna keep track of the number sides

27
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,100
and I gonna keep track of the area

28
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:15,430
after each pass of adding more smaller triangles

29
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,790
So this is gonna be our count of the area

30
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,480
Actually, let me give myself a little bit more real estate

31
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,400
because I have a feeling I might need to use it

32
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,080
So might keep this is the sides

33
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,160
I'm gonna write up here

34
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,130
and then this is our running count of the area down here

35
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,940
So right when we start,

36
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,960
We have three sides

37
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,840
And our area we are to figure out in the previous video is going to be

38
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,750
we assume that each of the sides are length S

39
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,690
is going to be square root of three square root

40
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,270
of three S squared over four

41
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,950
Fair enough that's just a simple equilateral triangle

42
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,150
Now we're going to take each of the sides divide them into thirds

43
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,940
So we're gonna take each sides divid it into thirds

44
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,500
And then, in that middle third we're going

45
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,850
to add another smaller equilateral triangle

46
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,990
So it will look like that on that side right over there

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,340
I want you to think about what we're doing each side right here

48
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,600
So before I did this, this is just one side

49
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,170
Then I split it into thirds and that middle third

50
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,060
I put I said you put two sides in there

51
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,270
I put an equilateral triangle

52
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:24,240
So one side has now turned into one two three four sides

53
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,180
So every time we do a pass

54
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,410
of the making the snowflake more intricate

55
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,220
Each side will turn into four sides

56
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,860
So you can imagine if we do this on all three sides,

57
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:39,520
we have four times three which is now 12 sides

58
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,730
So if you multiply these times four,

59
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,180
so times four this gets us to 12 sides now

60
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,140
We can count them out just

61
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,290
to make sure we're on logic this correct,

62
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,720
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

63
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,470
Eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve sides

64
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,940
And now what is the area now?

65
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,280
What's going to be the area

66
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,900
of which of all yellow equilateral triangles

67
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,930
plus the area of each of these smaller ones?

68
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,760
And what's the area of each of these smaller ones?

69
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,650
Well, first of all we have three of them

70
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,910
There's three of these each of these smaller ones

71
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,610
And then we use the formula for an equilateral triangle again

72
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,750
So it's going to be the square root of three times S squared

73
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,260
For now the length of each of these sides

74
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,880
Each these sides are equal to these smaller equilateral triangles

75
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:25,700
They aren't S anymore

76
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,890
they are S over three

77
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,710
remember this length right over here is S over three

78
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,930
so this is going to be S over three as well

79
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,040
Every pass,

80
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,760
the sides of the equilateral triangle

81
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,000
become one third of the previous pass

82
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,360
So this is not going to be S squared anymore

83
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,440
It's gonna be S over three squared

84
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:47,170
and then all of that over four

85
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,450
Then let's do another pass

86
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,200
So, I'm gonna add these triangles right over here

87
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,460
Then add these right over there

88
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,590
And this is the last pass where I actually attempt

89
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,860
to draw all of the triangles over there

90
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,730
So how many how many sides am I going to have,

91
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,580
first of all, after I do another pass?

92
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,650
Well the previous pass I have 12 sides,

93
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,980
each of those 12 sides are now going turn into four new sides

94
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,660
When I add these little orange bumps there

95
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,860
So when I multiply it times four again

96
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,710
'm gonna multiply it times four,

97
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,480
so now I'm going to have 48 sides

98
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,380
I'm gonna have 48 sides

99
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,770
And how many new triangles,

100
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,880
so what's the area what's gonna be the yellow area

101
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,280
plus the blue area plus the orange area

102
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,870
So how many new orange triangles do I have?

103
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,790
Well I'm adding a new orange triangle

104
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,190
to each of the sides for the previous pass

105
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,340
And the previous pass I have 12 sides,

106
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,860
so now I'm going to add 12 orange triangles

107
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,400
I'm going to add 12 orange triangles

108
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,610
And actually let me write that

109
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,340
or I'll just write 12 orange triangles but it's really,

110
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,240
I just multiply it times four

111
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,860
And then I'm going to have times the square root of three

112
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,230
And now this is not going to be S over three anymore

113
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,030
This is going to be s over nine

114
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,460
These have one third dimensions of these blue triangles

115
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:06,080
So this is going to be S over nine squared,

116
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,910
S over nine squared over four

117
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,660
And so, I think you might start to see the pattern building

118
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,630
if we do another pass after this one

119
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,560
Move to the right a little bit what will that look like

120
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,230
Let gonna do this in a different color that I haven't used yet

121
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,700
Let me see if haven't use this pink yet

122
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,130
So now we're going to have,

123
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,470
I'm going to have the previous number sides

124
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,400
that's my number of new triangles

125
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:32,820
48 times the square root of three times S over --

126
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,540
I'm going to, now these are gonna be one third of these

127
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:41,950
S over 27 to the second power all of that over four

128
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,950
And I'm going to keep adding an infinite number of terms of this

129
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,990
to get the area of a true Koch snowflake

130
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,530
So I'm just gonna keep doing this over and over again

131
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,490
So that trick really is is finding this infinite sum

132
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,770
and see if we get a finite number over here

133
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,470
So the first things I wanna do just to simplify,

134
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,320
Well let me just rewrite it a little bit?

135
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,770
Let me rewrite it a little bit different over here

136
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,190
So the first thing that's kind of it, that might be obvious is that

137
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,660
We can throughout the square root of three S squared over four

138
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,970
So let me just factor that out

139
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:18,570
So if we factor a square root of three S squared over four

140
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,890
from all of the terms then this term right

141
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,510
over here will become a one

142
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,750
This term right over here is going to become a three,

143
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,820
let see we factor a squared of three we factor out of four

144
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,210
and we factored out the S squared

145
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,230
We factored out all in the S squared,

146
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,350
so now it's going to have plus three times

147
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,120
one third three times one third squared

148
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,460
That's all we have left here,

149
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,690
We have the one third squared

150
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,580
and then we have this three

151
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,480
And I'm not simplifying this on purpose

152
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,060
so that we see a pattern emerge

153
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:52,360
And then this next term right over here plus

154
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,070
so this 12 is still going to be there

155
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,550
but I'm gonna write that as three times four

156
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,930
And we're gonna lose, this that we're factoring out

157
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,800
the square root of three

158
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:03,940
we're factoring out the four

159
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,950
we're factoring out the S squared

160
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,610
And so we're gonna be left with three squared

161
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,760
that's what this is down here, squared

162
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:18,320
So this is one over one third squared and then that squared

163
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,850
So that's what we're left with that orange term

164
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,360
And then we're going to the pink term

165
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:27,080
This pink term, this is 48 it is just three times four times four

166
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,720
Three times four

167
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,800
I'll write four squared here

168
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,850
cause each time we're gonna multiply times four again

169
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,350
So next is gonna be four to the third

170
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,770
Because we're really each iteration,

171
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,080
each sides turns into four sides

172
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,280
that's where that came from

173
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,460
Four squared we lose we're factoring out the squared of three

174
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:45,730
we're factoring out the four we're, factoring out the S squared

175
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,330
And all we're left is one over three to the third power squared

176
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:54,390
So, times one over three to the third power squared

177
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,200
and we'll just gonna keep going like that forever

178
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,720
Keep going like that forever

179
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,770
So, on each each step we're incrementing,

180
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,640
we're multiply by four and we're also multiplying

181
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,770
we're, I guess we say, the power of this four as incrementing

182
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,670
So it goes from there's usually fourth of the zeroth power here

183
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,730
We have a one here

184
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,190
You can kind of imagine implicitly the fourth

185
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,060
of the first power four squared and then it'll go four to the third

186
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,590
And then we have this power is also increment

187
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,600
Three to the first, three to the second, three to the third

188
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,980
We see that this power is always one more than that

189
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:28,590
And it'll be much easier to calculate this infinite

190
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,190
which is gonna turn into infinite geometric series

191
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,400
if those were actually the same power

192
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,010
So, what I wanna do is I wanna

193
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,840
increase the power four in all of those

194
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,340
But I can't just willy-nilly multiply everything by four

195
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,430
If I'm gonna multiply everything by four

196
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,150
I also need to divide everything by four

197
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,300
So, what I'm gonna do in this right over here

198
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,410
is I'm gonna multiply and divide everything by four

199
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,050
So, if we divide by four I can do that on the outside

200
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,280
So, I'm gonna multiply it one fourth times this right over here

201
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,430
And, so I'm dividing by four and here

202
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,950
I'm going to multiply this by four

203
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,920
So, I'm not going to be changing the value of the actual thing

204
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:09,880
So, this is going to be four plus three times four

205
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:15,780
plus three times four squared four to the third

206
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,440
And so what was cool about this is now

207
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,820
at the power of power and the power of this three down here

208
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:21,970
are going to be the same power

209
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,740
But it still seems a little weird because we're

210
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,160
taking this one over three squared and we're squaring it,

211
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,460
one over three to the third then we're squaring it

212
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,350
And here we just have to realize,

213
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,740
so this is always gonna be squared

214
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,410
and this is the thing that is incrementing

215
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,600
But in general,

216
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,520
if I have one over three to the end

217
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,270
and I'm squaring it

218
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,690
This is equal to one over three to the 2N power,

219
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,050
which is, so I'm just multiplying it by two, right?

220
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,170
If I'm raising something to an exponent

221
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,520
then raising that to an exponent,

222
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,920
that's just multiplying it times the or raising

223
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,540
to the or raising to the Nth times to exponent

224
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,210
And this is the exact same thing

225
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,480
as one over three squared raised to the Nth power

226
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,900
So we could actually switch these two exponents

227
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,380
in a very legitimate way

228
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,150
And then let me rewrite everything

229
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,510
'cause I do wanna do too much on this one step right over here

230
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,610
So, part right over her gives us square of three S squared

231
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,730
over 16 and then that's going to be times,I'll open

232
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,940
and close parenthesis

233
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,700
So then we have four plus,

234
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,300
then in blue,

235
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:25,770
I'll write three times four to the first power

236
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,620
And then I can write this,

237
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:31,060
I can rewrite this as one times one third

238
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,460
We could view this as one third squared

239
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,260
or we could view this, we could view this

240
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,970
as one over three to the first power square

241
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,800
or we can view this as one over three squared to the first power

242
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:41,810
And I'm gonna write it that way

243
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,100
So time one ninth to the first power

244
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:50,470
And then plus three times four squared

245
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,630
And then these we can write as times one ninth to the second power

246
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,380
And then these where we can write plus three times four to the third

247
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,970
times

248
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,200
and this is we could write

249
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,170
this is on over 27 to the second power

250
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:14,850
But we could also write this based on what we saw over here

251
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,710
Let me make this clear

252
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,770
One over three to the third to the second power

253
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:23,370
This is the same thing as one over three squared to the third power

254
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,250
That's what we showed right over here

255
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:30,750
So, this is equivalent to one ninth to the third power

256
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,360
Now we start to see the pattern

257
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,290
and starting to clean up a little bit

258
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,690
And let me just do one more step,

259
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,570
and then we'll finish this to the next video

260
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:42,680
So this is equal to square root of three S squared

261
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:49,240
over 16 times four plus four plus three times,

262
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,020
this is four ninths plus,

263
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:57,360
the next term is three times four ninths squared

264
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:06,880
And then we have plus times four over nine to the third power

265
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:09,900
And we're just gonna keep on and on and on and on

266
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,530
taking three time four ninths

267
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,360
To the successively larger and larger power

268
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,800
So, this is what we have to find the sum of

269
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,380
to find our area and we're gonna do that on the next video

270
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,630
We're gonna use some of the tools

271
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,370
we've used to find the sums of infinite geometric series

272
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,820
But we're kind of going to redo it in the next video

273
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:29,600
just so you don't have to remember that formula or that proof
