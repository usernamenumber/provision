1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,590
   

2
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,680
Let's do some problems that
deal with equations and

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,405
inequalities.

4
00:00:04,405 --> 00:00:07,300
So let's start with this
problem 2 here.

5
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,850
So it says define the variables
and translate the

6
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,430
following expressions
into inequalities.

7
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:18,990
Let's see, part a: A bus can
seat 65 passengers or fewer.

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:29,860
So in Part a, let's let x be
the number bus can seat.

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,150
So the number of people you
can sit in the bus, we're

10
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,350
going to call that x.

11
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,010
And they're saying that
the bus can fit

12
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,800
65 people or fewer.

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:47,610
So x has to be less than
or equal to 65.

14
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,740
And we put that equal there,
that less than or equal,

15
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,740
because it could be 65.

16
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,810
It doesn't say definitely
less than 65.

17
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,490
It could be 65 passengers
or fewer.

18
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,150
So that's why it's less
than or equal to.

19
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:05,770
b: the sum of two consecutive
integers is less than 54.

20
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:12,800
So if you say x is first
integer, and then x

21
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,300
plus 1 is the next.

22
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,280
They're saying the sum of these
two is less than 54.

23
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:27,520
So x plus 1 is less than 54.

24
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,330
And if you actually wanted to
figure out what x is, what the

25
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,090
first integer is, you could just
solve this inequality.

26
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:38,340
c: an amount of money is
invested at 5% annual

27
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:48,970
interest. Let x be the
amount of money.

28
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,530
It's invested at 5% annual
interest. The interest earned

29
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,310
at the end of the year is
greater than or equal to $250.

30
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,870
So what's the interest earned
at the end of the year?

31
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:02,830
It's the amount of money you
invest times your annual

32
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:07,000
interest rate, times 5% or, if
you write this as a decimal ,

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,700
it's 0.05 So 0.05 or 5% times
the amount of money invested,

34
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,030
that is going to be greater than
or equal to-- this is the

35
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:28,960
amount of interest earned --that
is going to be greater

36
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,340
than or equal to $250.

37
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,460
So that's what we did.

38
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,650
We set up the problem
into an inequality.

39
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,900
And part d.

40
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,140
   

41
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,700
You buy hamburgers at a
fast food restaurant.

42
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,280
A hamburger costs $0.49.

43
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,150
You have at most
$3.00 to spend.

44
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,410
Write an inequality
for the number of

45
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,130
hamburgers you can buy.

46
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,280
So let's change the letters.

47
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,235
Let h be equal to the number
of hamburgers.

48
00:03:00,235 --> 00:03:02,890
   

49
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,280
So the total I'm going to
spend is the number of

50
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,830
hamburgers times the amount
per hamburger, times 0.49.

51
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,430
That's the total amount I'm
going to spend, and that can

52
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,050
at most be $3.00.

53
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:23,520
So it has to be less than
or equal to $3.00.

54
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,520
So that is our inequality.

55
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,150
Let's do problem 4 here.

56
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,500
   

57
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,280
Check that the given number
is a solution to the

58
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,670
corresponding inequality.

59
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,030
All right.

60
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,100
Part a here.

61
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,840
So the inequality is 2 times
x plus 6 is less

62
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,700
than or equal to 8x.

63
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,810
And they're saying that x is
equal to 12 is a solution.

64
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,290
Let's verify that.

65
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,835
So if you put a 12 here-- do it
in a different color --if

66
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:59,450
this is a 12 and then
this would be a 12.

67
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:02,140
So you get 2 times 12 plus 6.

68
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:08,860
So this is 2 times 18 is less
than or equal to 8 times 12.

69
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,080
8 times 12 is 96.

70
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,800
2 times 18 is 36.

71
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,360
So 36 is definitely less
than or equal to 96.

72
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,050
So this x is equal to
12 is a solution.

73
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,300
Part b.

74
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,450
   

75
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:38,990
We have 1.4 times z plus 5.2
is greater than 0.4z.

76
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:42,010
   

77
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:46,550
For the solution, if z is equal
to minus 9-- negative 9

78
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,110
I should say.

79
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,995
I always say minus 9.

80
00:04:47,995 --> 00:04:50,580
The correct wording
is negative 9.

81
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,910
So let's put a negative
9 here.

82
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,590
So it's 1.4-- they're saying
that that's one of the

83
00:04:54,590 --> 00:05:01,760
solutions --times negative 9
plus 5.2 is greater than 0.4

84
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:07,930
times negative 9.

85
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,060
And I'm just going to use the
calculator on this one just

86
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,130
for the sake of time.

87
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,480
You could do that in your
head if you like.

88
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:27,940
So we have on the left-hand
side, 1.4 times negative 9.

89
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,830
That's equal to minus 12.6.

90
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:40,200
So this is minus is 12.6 plus
5.2 is equal to negative 7.4.

91
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:46,770
So this left-hand side
is negative 7.4.

92
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,990
Then they're claiming that that
is greater than-- This I

93
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,020
can do in my head.

94
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:55,790
4 times 9 is 36.

95
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,480
I'm going to have to put a
negative sign because it's a

96
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,860
positive times a negative.

97
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,930
And I have one number behind
the decimal point.

98
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:11,040
So this is saying negative 7.4
is greater than negative 3.6.

99
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,510
This isn't true.

100
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,910
If you draw a number
line right here.

101
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:20,530
So if this is 0, this
is negative 3.6,

102
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,520
this is negative 7.4.

103
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,700
It's less than negative 3.6.

104
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,820
So this is not true.

105
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,480
I'll do it in a big red color.

106
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,170
That is not true.

107
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:36,840
z is equal to negative 9 is
not a solution of this

108
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,220
inequality right there.

109
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,760
It does not satisfy
that inequality.

110
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,010
Part c.

111
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,390
   

112
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:57,220
They have minus 5/2 y plus 1/2
is less than negative 18.

113
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,640
And they're claiming y is
equal 40 is a solution.

114
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,670
Let's try that out.

115
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:05,840
So minus 5/2-- instead of y I
can write 40 just to see if it

116
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,120
works --plus 1/2 is less
than minus 18.

117
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,610
That's their claim.

118
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:15,220
So 5/2 times 40-- Divide
the numerator and

119
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:15,950
denominator by 2.

120
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,450
So 1 becomes a 20.

121
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:23,740
So it becomes minus 5 times 20
is minus 100 plus 1/2 is less

122
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,110
than minus 18.

123
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:33,580
Well, you could view this
as negative 99 and 1/2.

124
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,160
You could do that in your head
if you like, or you could view

125
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:41,090
this as 99.5-- you're adding
0.5 to minus 100 --is less

126
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:44,290
than negative 18, which
is definitely true.

127
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,630
This is more negative
than this is.

128
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,620
So this is correct.

129
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,720
And then finally part d.

130
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,785
Let me scroll down or let me
clear some space for myself.

131
00:07:58,785 --> 00:08:03,560
   

132
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,810
Part d.

133
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:09,130
   

134
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:14,000
They're saying 80 is greater
than or equal to 10

135
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,210
times 3t plus 2.

136
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,770
And they're claiming that t is
equal to 0.4 as a solution.

137
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,040
Let's try that out.

138
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:31,860
80 is greater than or equal
to 3 times 0.4 plus 2.

139
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,380
So that's saying that 80 is
greater than or equal to 10

140
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:41,210
times-- 3 times 0.4 is 1.2
--plus 2, or 80 is greater

141
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:46,540
than or equal to 10 times--
This is 3.2.

142
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:54,040
Or that 80 is greater than
or equal to 32, which is

143
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,220
absolutely right.

144
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:59,860
So d is also a valid solution.

145
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,110
Problem 5.

146
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,830
   

147
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:08,270
The cost of a Ford Focus
is 27% of the

148
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,880
price of a Lexus GS450H.

149
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:18,650
If the price of a Ford is
$15,000-- So the Ford is equal

150
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:23,150
to $15,000, what is the
price of a Lexus?

151
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:28,690
So they tell us that the Ford
is equal to 27% of the price

152
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:29,260
of the Lexus.

153
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:36,485
Is equal to 0.27, or 27%, times
the price of a Lexus.

154
00:09:36,485 --> 00:09:39,210
   

155
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,920
I could write F and L,
but I'll just write

156
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,430
out the words there.

157
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,420
So the Ford we know
is $15,000.

158
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:52,240
So we know that $15,000 is equal
to 27%, 0.27, times the

159
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,560
price of a Lexus.

160
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,030
So to figure out the price of
a Lexus we just divide both

161
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:07,170
sides by 0.27, and divide
this side by 0.27.

162
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,040
That just becomes a 1.

163
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:15,220
And so you have the price of
your Lexus is equal to $15,000

164
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,990
divided by 0.27.

165
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,020
See what we get.

166
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,270
So let me clear it.

167
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:30,370
We have 15-- 1, 2, 3, $15,000
divided by 0.27 is equal to

168
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:34,370
$55,555.55.

169
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:39,000
So we'll say $55,556
just to round up.

170
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,920
So this is equal to $55,556.

171
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,800
So you're spending a lot more on
the Lexus than you would on

172
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,120
the Ford Focus.

173
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,520
It better be a much
better car.

174
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,860
Finally, number 6.

175
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,520
On your new job you can be
paid in one of two ways.

176
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,580
All right.

177
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,130
You can either be paid--
So this is option one.

178
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,350
   

179
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,930
And let's write option 2 here.

180
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,160
   

181
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,350
You can either be paid $1,000
per month plus 6% commission

182
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,340
of total sales.

183
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:28,050
So let's let s is equal
to total sales.

184
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:32,410
So your first option you'll be
paid $1,000 per month plus 6%

185
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,230
of total sales.

186
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:39,510
So on a monthly basis you'll
be paid $1,000 plus 6% of

187
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,320
total sales.

188
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,100
So plus 6% times your
total sales.

189
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,020
That's option 1.

190
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,470
That's right there.

191
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,290
You can either be paid $1,000
per month plus 6% commission

192
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,730
of total sales.

193
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,185
And then option 2 is
$1,200 per month--

194
00:11:57,185 --> 00:12:00,420
Let me switch colors.

195
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:07,890
Option 2-- I'll do it in yellow
--paid $1,200 per month

196
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:14,135
plus 5% commission on
sales over $2,000.

197
00:12:14,135 --> 00:12:17,120
Let me scroll over
a little bit.

198
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,090
Plus 5% of sales over $2,000.

199
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:28,820
So if my sales are s, my sales
over $2,000 are going to be s

200
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:34,390
minus $2,000.

201
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,720
If my sales are, let's say
they're $3,000 in a month.

202
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,440
The sales over $2,000
are going to be

203
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,280
$3,000 minus $2,000.

204
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,610
It's going to be $1,000
over $2,000.

205
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,800
So these are our two options.

206
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:53,040
Let me highlight that
right over there.

207
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,950
And they say for what amount of
sales is the first option

208
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,040
better than the second option?

209
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,490
And assume they're always
sales over $2,000.

210
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,670
So they're essentially saying,
OK, this is always going to be

211
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:03,850
non-0 right here.

212
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,570
So we want to know the situation
where the first

213
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,210
option is better.

214
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,960
Better, probably meaning
for me, meaning that

215
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,910
I'll get more money.

216
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,970
So when is option 1 going to
be, we could either say

217
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:17,690
greater than or greater than
or equal to, option 2.

218
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,350
And then we could solve
this equation.

219
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,600
So let's see what we can do.

220
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,710
   

221
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,750
The first thing, let's subtract

222
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,300
$1,000 from both sides.

223
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,280
If you subtract $1,000 from the
left-hand side you're just

224
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:35,420
left with 0.06s is greater than
or equal to-- So subtract

225
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,120
$1,000 from the left-hand
side.

226
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,380
I'll take the $1,000
from here.

227
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:47,740
You're left with 200 plus 0.05
times s minus 2,000.

228
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,380
And then let's see, I probably
want to multiply that out.

229
00:13:51,380 --> 00:14:01,240
This is going to be 200 plus
0.05s minus-- This 0.05,

230
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,400
that's the same 5%, that's
the same thing as 1/20.

231
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:11,110
1/20 of 2,000, that's 100.

232
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:14,600
So this is minus 100.

233
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,920
That times that is 100.

234
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,830
I'm just distributing this
5% or this 0.05.

235
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,450
So that's the right-hand
side of the equation.

236
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:28,810
On the left-hand side we have
0.06, and we just simplify the

237
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:29,890
right-hand side a little bit.

238
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:35,680
We have 200 minus 100, so that
just becomes 200 minus 100, we

239
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,070
could just write as plus
100 right there.

240
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:43,790
So our equation is 0.06 is
greater than or equal to

241
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:51,540
0.05-- Sorry, this is 0.06s is
greater than or equal to-- I

242
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:58,040
don't want to lose that s over
there --0.05s plus 100.

243
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:04,640
Now let's subtract 0.05s from
both sides of the equation.

244
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:12,250
So 0.06 minus 0.05s is going to
be 0.01s is greater than or

245
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,630
equal to-- I subtracted this
from both sides, so it's not

246
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:21,020
going to be here anymore --is
greater than or equal to 100.

247
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,860
And now I just divide
both sides by 0.01.

248
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:31,120
So 0.01, 0.01.

249
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,800
That becomes a 1.

250
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,670
And then we are left with s is
to going to be greater than or

251
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:40,910
equal to-- What's 100
divided by 0.01?

252
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:45,880
This is the same thing as 100
divided by 1 over 100, which

253
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,910
is the same thing as
100 times 100.

254
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:53,220
100 times 100 is 10,000.

255
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,680
So option 1 is definitely better
for you if your total

256
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,350
sales for the month,
if s is greater

257
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,370
than or equal to $10,000.

258
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:10,250
If it's less than that you're
better with option 2.

259
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:10,266
