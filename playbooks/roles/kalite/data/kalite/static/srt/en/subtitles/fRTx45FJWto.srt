1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,470
We're on problem 24.

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:06,350
A rope 40 feet long is cut into two pieces.Let's draw that.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,640
Let's say that's where I cut them.

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,020
If one piece is 18 feet longer than the other,

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,080
what is the length in feet of the shorter piece?

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,560
So let's say this is the shorter piece.

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,580
This is the longer piece.x plus 18.

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,170
And they also tell us that both pieces combined--

9
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,210
it's a 40-foot long rope,

10
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,940
so if I add these together it should be equal to 40.

11
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,790
So x plus x,plus 18 is equal to 40.

12
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,090
x plus x is equal to 2x,plus 18 is equal to 40.

13
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,340
And then I get 2x is equal to--subtract 18 from both sides,

14
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:50,890
that's what? 22.x is equal to 11.Next problem.

15
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,990
Let me switch colors.25.

16
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,650
The Earth travels around the sun at a speed of

17
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:06,280
approximately 18.5 miles per second.

18
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,030
This approximate speed is how many miles per hour?

19
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,730
So how many seconds are there in a mile?

20
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,290
So you have 60 seconds per minute.

21
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:24,690
And then you have times 60 minutes per hour.

22
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,600
So you get 60 times 60 is 3,600.And the units work out,too.

23
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,160
Minutes in the denominator.Minutes in the numerator.

24
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:38,780
So you get 3,600 seconds per hour.So 18.5 miles per second,

25
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,050
you're going to go 3,600 times as far in an hour.

26
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:47,270
So let's multiply that times 3,600 seconds per hour.

27
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,490
And you'll get whatever this number is.

28
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,500
So let's multiply it out.18.5.

29
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,970
I'm going to multiply it times 36 and then add two 0's later.

30
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:04,170
6 times 5 is 30.6 times 8 is 48,plus 3 is 51.

31
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:11,320
6 times 1 is 6,plus 5 is 11.3 times 5 is 15.

32
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:20,160
3 times 8 is 24,plus 1 is 25.3 times 1 is 3,plus 2 is 5.

33
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,500
And so you get a 0,a 6,a 6,and a 6.

34
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,640
And then I have one number behind the decimal point.

35
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:31,600
So 18.5 times 36 is 666.

36
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,160
But I'm multiplying it not by 36 but by 3,600.

37
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,180
So 18.5 times 3,600 is going to be equal to this times 100.

38
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:45,780
So 66,600.And the units work out.Second in the denominator.

39
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,230
Second in the numerator.Miles per hour.And that's choice D.

40
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,650
And they didn't even let you approximate it,

41
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,130
because choice C is really close.

42
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,820
You really have to,as far as I can tell,

43
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:00,310
go through the multiplication.Next problem.26.

44
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,440
If the quotient a/b is positive--

45
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:08,720
that's what they're telling us--

46
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,470
which of the following must be true? So if a/b is positive,

47
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,480
that essentially tells us that a

48
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,460
and b have to have the same sign,right?

49
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,430
The only way you can get a positive number when you

50
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,210
divide two numbers is if they're both positive,

51
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:27,380
or they're both negative.If they were different signs--

52
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,180
if one was positive and one was negative,

53
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,630
or one was negative and one was positive--

54
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,790
then this would be a negative number.

55
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,430
So this tells us that they're the same sign.

56
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:41,840
So statement A,choice A,tells us a is greater than 0.

57
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,420
No,this doesn't have to be true.

58
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,190
They both could be less than 0.

59
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,990
B tells us that b is greater than 0.

60
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,160
Once again,this isn't necessarily true.

61
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,070
They both could be less than 0 and this would still be true.

62
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,750
Choice C.ab is greater than 0.Well,think about it.

63
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,060
This implies that both a and b have to have the same sign.

64
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,520
If a and b have the same sign when I multiply them,I'm

65
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,630
still going to get a number bigger than 0,right?

66
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,160
A positive times a positive is a positive.

67
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,100
A negative times a negative is a positive.

68
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,950
So it's choice C.Problem 27.

69
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:20,510
And I saw this coming,so I drew this ahead of time.

70
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,900
Actually,no I didn't.

71
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,990
Well,I thought I had drawn it ahead of time.

72
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:33,050
Let me actually open it up.I thought I had drawn it.

73
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,710
Oh,well,it must have gotten erased.

74
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,290
Well,let's just do it in real time,then.So it says,

75
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,120
the dots on the graph above indicate the

76
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,520
weights and fuel efficiency ratings for 20 cars.

77
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,000
How many of the cars weigh more than 2,500 pounds--

78
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,960
so weight is more than 2,500--

79
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,960
and also get more than 25 miles per gallon?

80
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,290
So fuel efficiency is more than 22 miles per gallon.

81
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,500
And notice,they said more than 22,not 22 miles or more.

82
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,020
And they said more than 2,500,not 2,500 pounds or more.

83
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,930
Let me just draw the part of the graph that seems relevant.

84
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,970
So if that's the weight axis--

85
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:29,260
so they have a couple at 25,26,27,28,29,30.

86
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:35,320
And then,we want to know above 22.

87
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,860
So let me actually draw all of it.So that's 25.

88
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:41,940
I'm only drawing part of the graph

89
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,220
because I don't want to go through the exercise.

90
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,020
Because I actually already did it

91
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,560
and I can't find it,all of a sudden.

92
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,630
But I don't want to stop recording this video.So 20.

93
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,210
This is 22.This is 24.

94
00:05:53,210 --> 00:06:00,640
They don't label the 22 on their drawing.This is 26.

95
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:08,700
This is 28.And so they want to know everything that

96
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,600
weighs more than 2,500 pounds.

97
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,180
So everything to the right of that.

98
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,820
Because all of these tend to be on integer numbers.

99
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,890
None of them are in between.

100
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,070
And they say,and get more than 22 miles per gallon.

101
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,040
So let me draw all of the ones that apply there.

102
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,420
So let's see,at 2,600 pounds,

103
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:34,250
there's two,at 24 and 26 miles per gallon.

104
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,770
At 2,600 there's two points right there.

105
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,650
At 2,700 there are three points.

106
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:53,030
1,2,but the other one falls on the 22 miles per gallon,

107
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,660
but we're talking about greater than that.

108
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:02,880
And then--let's see,that's 26,27--28 has one down here

109
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,580
and one up here.When I say 28,I mean 2,800 pounds.

110
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,400
I'm just trying to draw it for you.

111
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,040
And then the rest of them.

112
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,020
There's two here and there's one here.

113
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,920
But all we care about is the ones in this.

114
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,940
There's a bunch more over here.

115
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,810
I could draw them real fast,if you want me to,

116
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,240
just so you can visualize the graph.

117
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,270
So it looks something like that.

118
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,570
And then there's one more here.

119
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,420
But all we care about is this range,and there's 1,2,3,4,5.

120
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,570
Five of those.So the answer is B.

121
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:34,610
A lot of work for a fairly straightforward problem.

122
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,040
Let me get some clean space.Problem 28.

123
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,180
How many minutes does it take John to type y words

124
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:52,080
if he types at a rate of x words per minute?

125
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,030
Now,this is a fairly straightforward thing,

126
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,690
but it can get confusing.Do I divide x by y? Y by x?

127
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,280
I think a lot of times this becomes a lot simpler

128
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,140
if you just pick numbers.So if we just phrased it,

129
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,800
how long does it take him to type

130
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:14,040
100 words if he can type,I don't know,50 words per minute?

131
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,510
Now your brain would say,oh,if I can do 50 words per minute,

132
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,610
it's going to take me 2 minutes to do 100 words.

133
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:23,690
And how did you get 2 minutes? You said 100 divided by 50.

134
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,500
So if you need to type y words

135
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,020
and you can type at x words per minute,

136
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,760
the answer is y divided by x.

137
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,450
Let's see,that's not one of the choices.

138
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,150
But I think they've made a mistake,

139
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,750
because this is a simple enough problem that

140
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,300
I have conviction.

141
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,540
And if you look at the choices,choice A and choice

142
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,820
B,at least in the book I have,they wrote x/y,

143
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,280
so I think that's a typo.

144
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,400
One of those probably should have read y/x.

145
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,030
So I'm going to stick by my answer.

146
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:58,160
I think this was another mistake in the book.y/x.

147
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,040
You might want to check the answer key,just to make sure,

148
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,840
but I have no doubt in my conviction on this one.

149
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,600
Let me see,do I have time for the next one? Well,sure.

150
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:16,010
Problem 29.I'm running out of space.The square root--

151
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,800
this is just to make sure you know how to do square roots--

152
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:26,020
of 16 times 20,in order of operations,plus 8 times 32.

153
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,900
So there's a bunch of ways we could think about this,

154
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,110
but the easiest way,

155
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,680
instead of doing all of the multiplication,

156
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,420
let's see if we can factor 16 out of both of these numbers.

157
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,100
You could multiple them out

158
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,770
and try to figure out the square root,

159
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:39,790
but it'll take you a long time.

160
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:46,340
So if we rewrite this as 16 times 20 plus,what?

161
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,610
This could also be written if we took--

162
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:53,810
32 is 16 times 2,right?

163
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:02,020
So 8 times 32 is the same thing as 8 times 16 times 2,

164
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,100
which is the same thing as 16 times 16.

165
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:09,160
So we could have rewritten this as 8 times 32 is 16,times 16.

166
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,030
So if we're factoring a 16 out,

167
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,450
that's 16 times 20,plus 16.

168
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,640
If you were to just multiply this out it would be 16 times

169
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,320
20,plus 16 times 16,which is the same thing as 8 times 32.

170
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,310
And I'm doing all of this.

171
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,090
You could just do the math yourself,

172
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,290
but it takes a lot of time if you don't have a calculator.

173
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,750
Well now,you can say,well,this is the same thing as the

174
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:35,050
square root of 16 times the square root of 20 plus 16.

175
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,900
Well,this is plus or minus 4,although I don't think they're

176
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,300
going to make us worry about the negative square root.

177
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,520
So let's just say it's 4.

178
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,500
Looking at the choices--yeah,everything's positive.

179
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,710
So it's 4 times.And then,what's this? The square root of 36.

180
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:55,060
So that equals 4 times 6,which is equal to 24.

181
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,560
And that's choice B.See you in the next video.
