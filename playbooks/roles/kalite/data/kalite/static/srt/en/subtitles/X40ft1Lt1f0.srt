1
00:00:03,381 --> 00:00:06,410
Consider the following:

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:07,852
Alice and Bob have figured out how to

3
00:00:07,852 --> 00:00:10,624
transmit messages between their treehouses.

4
00:00:10,624 --> 00:00:14,448
At first, they used flames at night, and shutters during the day.

5
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:17,827
Then they used a wire, which they plucked in different ways.

6
00:00:17,832 --> 00:00:22,907
Eventually, they electrified this wire to send electrical pulses,

7
00:00:22,907 --> 00:00:26,475
and were now at work on an experimental wireless method.

8
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,413
The problem is in order to pay for their equipment,

9
00:00:33,413 --> 00:00:34,813
they needed money.

10
00:00:34,813 --> 00:00:37,109
So they decided to offer their service –

11
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:39,502
for a fee to others.

12
00:00:42,887 --> 00:00:44,518
And on the first day, Alice had three new customers

13
00:00:44,518 --> 00:00:48,223
who wanted to transmit messages to their friends

14
00:00:48,223 --> 00:00:51,273
over at Bob's treehouse.

15
00:00:51,273 --> 00:00:55,085
The first customer wanted to send a list of 10 coin flips.

16
00:00:55,085 --> 00:00:59,349
The second customer wanted to send a 6-letter word.

17
00:00:59,349 --> 00:01:03,556
And the third customer wanted to send a poker hand.

18
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,375
The question now is, "How much should she charge?"

19
00:01:12,604 --> 00:01:16,030
Well, the price of a message should depend on

20
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,850
how long it takes Alice to transmit it.

21
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,535
But how could she measure the length

22
00:01:21,535 --> 00:01:25,261
of different types of messages using a common unit?

23
00:01:25,261 --> 00:01:28,731
To find out, let's play a game.

24
00:01:28,731 --> 00:01:31,256
Imagine you are Bob now.

25
00:01:31,256 --> 00:01:34,414
And you know Alice wants to send you these messages.

26
00:01:34,414 --> 00:01:36,410
But all you can do is get the answer to

27
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:39,766
yes-or-no questions you've arranged.

28
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,572
Alice will answer by sending a sequence

29
00:01:42,572 --> 00:01:46,518
of zeros or ones using some method of variation.

30
00:01:46,518 --> 00:01:48,853
Recall that all of their methods of transmission

31
00:01:48,853 --> 00:01:51,705
involve the exchange of differences.

32
00:01:51,705 --> 00:01:55,718
So, a 1 could be represented by an open flame,

33
00:01:55,718 --> 00:02:00,614
or an open shutter, or an electrical pulse.

34
00:02:00,614 --> 00:02:02,530
No matter how they are manifested,

35
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,219
we can simply call them 'binary digits' –

36
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:10,945
because a binary digit can have only one of two values – 0 or 1.

37
00:02:10,945 --> 00:02:13,356
So, let's say 0 represents a 'no,'

38
00:02:13,356 --> 00:02:16,004
and 1 represents a 'yes.'

39
00:02:16,004 --> 00:02:18,840
Your challenge, now, is to always ask

40
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,244
the minimum number of questions

41
00:02:21,244 --> 00:02:24,492
in order to determine the exact message.

42
00:02:24,492 --> 00:02:28,190
First, let's consider the coin flips.

43
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,980
For each symbol, the sender, Alice,

44
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,169
can be thought of as selecting

45
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:35,575
one of two different symbols –

46
00:02:35,575 --> 00:02:37,903
'heads' or 'tails.'

47
00:02:37,903 --> 00:02:40,194
Now how many questions do you need to ask

48
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:43,623
to determine which she selected?

49
00:02:43,623 --> 00:02:49,120
One questions – such as, "Is it heads?" – will suffice.

50
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,243
For 10 flips, what is the minimum number of questions?

51
00:02:53,243 --> 00:02:56,558
Well, 10 flips times one question per flip

52
00:02:56,558 --> 00:02:57,946
equals 10 questions –

53
00:02:57,946 --> 00:03:03,002
or 10 binary digits to transmit this message.

54
00:03:03,002 --> 00:03:06,571
Next, let's consider the letters.

55
00:03:06,571 --> 00:03:09,137
For each symbol, the sender, Alice,

56
00:03:09,137 --> 00:03:10,462
can be thought of as selecting

57
00:03:10,462 --> 00:03:14,199
1 of 26 different symbols.

58
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:16,220
Let's start with the simplest message –

59
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,116
which is 1 letter.

60
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:20,801
How many questions are needed?

61
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:21,957
Is it A?

62
00:03:21,957 --> 00:03:23,100
Is it B?

63
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,271
Is it C?

64
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:25,100
Is it D?

65
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,566
And so on.

66
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:30,807
But that is not the minimum number of questions.

67
00:03:30,807 --> 00:03:32,901
The best you could do is ask questions

68
00:03:32,901 --> 00:03:37,060
which eliminate half of the possibilities.

69
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,115
For example the middle of the alphabet

70
00:03:39,115 --> 00:03:41,510
is between M and N.

71
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:45,506
So we could first ask, "Is it less than N?"

72
00:03:45,506 --> 00:03:48,096
If we receive a 1 – yes –

73
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,758
we cut out half of the possibilities –

74
00:03:50,758 --> 00:03:53,674
[so we have] 13 left.

75
00:03:53,674 --> 00:03:56,488
And since we can't split a letter in half,

76
00:03:56,488 --> 00:04:00,340
we divide the possible symbols into sets of 6 and 7,

77
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,129
and ask is it less than G?

78
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:05,819
We receive a 1, which is yes.

79
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:09,099
And now we are left with 6 possible letters.

80
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:11,283
And we can split them in half, and ask,

81
00:04:11,283 --> 00:04:13,754
"Is it less than D?"

82
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,908
We receive a 0, which is no –

83
00:04:15,908 --> 00:04:19,253
leaving us with three possible letters.

84
00:04:19,253 --> 00:04:22,906
And now we can pick a side and ask, "Is it D?"

85
00:04:22,906 --> 00:04:24,620
We receive a 0, which is no.

86
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,848
And finally, we are left with two possibilities.

87
00:04:28,848 --> 00:04:30,603
We ask, "Is it E?"

88
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,001
We receive a no.

89
00:04:33,001 --> 00:04:34,651
And after five questions,

90
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:38,779
we have correctly identified the symbol: F.

91
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:42,000
Realize that we will never need to ask

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,435
more than five questions.

93
00:04:44,435 --> 00:04:51,450
So the number of questions will be at least 4, and at most 5.

94
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:56,777
And in general, 2 to the power of number of questions

95
00:04:56,777 --> 00:04:59,784
equals the number of possible messages –

96
00:04:59,784 --> 00:05:02,873
which we previously defined as the 'message space.'

97
00:05:02,873 --> 00:05:05,336
So how can we calculate the exact average –

98
00:05:05,336 --> 00:05:08,245
or expected – number of questions,

99
00:05:08,245 --> 00:05:11,590
given a message space of 26?

100
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,289
We ask the reverse question.

101
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:18,240
2 to the power of something equals 26.

102
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,615
And to answer these type of questions,

103
00:05:20,615 --> 00:05:24,550
we naturally use a logarithmic function, base 2 –

104
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:30,092
because log, base 2, of 26 is the exponent

105
00:05:30,092 --> 00:05:33,743
2 needs to be raised to to give us 26.

106
00:05:33,743 --> 00:05:36,581
Which is approximately 4.7.

107
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:40,213
So on average, approximately 4.7 questions

108
00:05:40,213 --> 00:05:43,884
will be needed per letter, at minimum.

109
00:05:43,884 --> 00:05:47,746
And since she wants to transmit a word with 6 letters,

110
00:05:47,746 --> 00:05:54,180
Bob can expect to ask, at minimum, 28.2 questions –

111
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,889
Which means Alice will need to send at most 29 binary digits.

112
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:01,674
Finally, let's apply this formula

113
00:06:01,674 --> 00:06:05,744
to a new message – the poker hand.

114
00:06:05,744 --> 00:06:07,832
Well, for each symbol, the sender, Alice,

115
00:06:07,832 --> 00:06:09,342
can be thought of as selecting

116
00:06:09,342 --> 00:06:11,904
1 of 52 different symbols.

117
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,894
And in this case, the number of questions

118
00:06:13,894 --> 00:06:16,088
is the same as the number of times

119
00:06:16,088 --> 00:06:20,804
we need to split the deck and ask Alice which pile it is in –

120
00:06:20,804 --> 00:06:23,775
until we are left with one card –

121
00:06:23,775 --> 00:06:26,693
which we will find is usually 6 splits –

122
00:06:26,693 --> 00:06:29,946
or questions – and sometimes 5.

123
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,092
But we can save time and just use our equation.

124
00:06:36,092 --> 00:06:40,962
Log, base 2, of 52 is approximately 5.7,

125
00:06:40,962 --> 00:06:45,069
since 2 to the power of 5.7 is approximately 52.

126
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:46,376
So the minimum number of questions,

127
00:06:46,376 --> 00:06:49,965
on average, is 5.7 per card.

128
00:06:49,965 --> 00:06:52,038
A poker hand contains five cards.

129
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:54,549
So to transmit a poker hand requires

130
00:06:54,549 --> 00:06:58,415
28.5 questions, on average.

131
00:06:58,415 --> 00:06:59,560
We are done.

132
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,346
We now have our unit.

133
00:07:01,346 --> 00:07:03,775
It's based on the minimum number of questions

134
00:07:03,775 --> 00:07:05,556
to define the message –

135
00:07:05,556 --> 00:07:08,305
or the 'height' of the decision tree.

136
00:07:08,305 --> 00:07:10,557
And since Alice transmits this information

137
00:07:10,557 --> 00:07:13,572
as binary digits, we can shorten this [term],

138
00:07:13,572 --> 00:07:15,720
and call our unit the 'bit' –

139
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,760
instead of 'binary digit.'

140
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,588
So we have 10 coin flip require 10 bits.

141
00:07:21,588 --> 00:07:25,603
The 6-letter word requires 28.2 bits.

142
00:07:25,603 --> 00:07:29,901
and the poker hand requires 28.5 bits.

143
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:33,627
Alice, then, decides to charge one penny per bit,

144
00:07:33,627 --> 00:07:36,834
and begins collecting her fees.

145
00:07:36,834 --> 00:07:40,568
Now this idea emerged in the 1920s.

146
00:07:40,568 --> 00:07:42,555
It was one of the more abstract problems

147
00:07:42,555 --> 00:07:45,721
that communication engineers were thinking about.

148
00:07:45,721 --> 00:07:49,570
Ralph Hartley was a prolific electronics researcher,

149
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,508
who built on the ideas of Harry Nyquist –

150
00:07:52,508 --> 00:07:56,355
both of whom worked at Bell Labs after World War I.

151
00:07:56,355 --> 00:07:58,965
And in 1928, Hartley published an important paper

152
00:07:58,965 --> 00:08:03,416
titled "The Transmission of Information."

153
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,955
And in it, he defines the word 'information'

154
00:08:06,955 --> 00:08:14,514
using the symbol h – as: h = n × logarithm of s,

155
00:08:14,514 --> 00:08:17,579
where h is our information,

156
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:19,707
n is the number of symbols –

157
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:23,322
whether they're notes, letters, numbers, etc. –

158
00:08:23,322 --> 00:08:25,900
and s is the number of different symbols

159
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,355
available at each selection.

160
00:08:28,355 --> 00:08:30,065
And this can also be written as

161
00:08:30,065 --> 00:08:34,755
h = logarithm of s^n.

162
00:08:34,755 --> 00:08:36,422
And Hartley writes,

163
00:08:36,422 --> 00:08:38,315
"What we have done, then, is to take,

164
00:08:38,315 --> 00:08:41,323
as our practical measure of information,

165
00:08:41,323 --> 00:08:46,705
the logarithm of the number of possible symbol sequences.

166
00:08:46,705 --> 00:08:51,220
So, information is the logarithm of the message space.

167
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,517
However, realize that throughout this lesson,

168
00:08:54,517 --> 00:08:58,171
we have been assuming that the symbol selection is random –

169
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:00,398
a convenient simplification.

170
00:09:00,398 --> 00:09:02,541
However, we know that in reality,

171
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:05,399
most communication – such as speech –

172
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,402
isn't always random.

173
00:09:07,402 --> 00:09:11,537
It's a subtle mix of predictability and surprise.

174
00:09:11,537 --> 00:09:14,332
We do not roll dice when we write letters.

175
00:09:14,332 --> 00:09:17,988
And it is this predictability which can result in

176
00:09:17,988 --> 00:09:21,692
significant savings in the length of transmission.

177
00:09:21,692 --> 00:09:24,371
Because when we can predict things in advance,

178
00:09:24,371 --> 00:09:25,748
we shouldn't need to ask

179
00:09:25,748 --> 00:09:29,374
as many yes-or-no questions to define it.

180
00:09:29,374 --> 00:09:31,535
But how could we formally model

181
00:09:31,535 --> 00:09:33,772
this subtle difference?

182
00:09:33,772 --> 00:09:35,490
This question brings us to

183
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,921
the key insight in our story.

184
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:39,910
Can you think of what it might be?
