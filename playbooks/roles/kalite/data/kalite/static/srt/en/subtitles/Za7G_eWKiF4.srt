1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,750
   

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,190
The marching band is holding a
raffle at a football game with

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:05,340
two prizes.

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,790
After the first ticket is pulled
out and the winner

5
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,100
determined, the ticket is
taped to the prize.

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,070
The next ticket is pulled out to
determine the winner of the

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,560
second prize.

8
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,660
Are the two events
independent?

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,890
Explain.

10
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,480
Now before we even think about
this exact case, let's think

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,040
about what it means for events
to be independent.

12
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,980
It means that the outcome of one
event doesn't affect the

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,220
outcome of the other event.

14
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:35,040
Now in this situation, the first
event-- after the first

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,650
ticket is pulled out and the
winner determined-- the ticket

16
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,410
is taped to the prize.

17
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,990
Then the next ticket is pulled
out to determine the winner of

18
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:45,360
the second prize.

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,490
Now, the winner of the second
prize-- the possible winners,

20
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:53,220
the possible outcomes for the
second prize, is dependent on

21
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,890
who was pulled out for
the first prize.

22
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,300
You can imagine if there's
three tickets, let's say

23
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,510
there's tickets A, B,
and C in the bag.

24
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:12,020
And for the first prize,
they pull out ticket A.

25
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,430
That's for the first prize.

26
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,110
Now, when we think about who
could be pulled out for the

27
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:24,000
second prize, it's only going
to be tickets B or C.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,800
Now the first prize could
have gone the other way.

29
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,260
It could have been
A, B, and C.

30
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,120
The first prize could have
gone to ticket B.

31
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,120
And then the possible outcomes
for the second prize

32
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,940
would be A or C.

33
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,390
So the possible outcomes for
the second event, for the

34
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:49,500
second prize, are completely
dependent on what happened or

35
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,310
what ticket was pulled out
for the first prize.

36
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,440
So these are not independent
events.

37
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,500
The second event-- the outcomes
for it, are dependent

38
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,180
on what happened in
the first event.

39
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,450
So they are not independent.

40
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,150
   

41
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,949
The way that we could have
made them independent is,

42
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:12,330
after the first ticket was
pulled out, if they just wrote

43
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,170
down the name or something,
and then put

44
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,660
that ticket back in.

45
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,780
Instead they taped
it to the prize.

46
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,550
But if they put that ticket
back in, then the second

47
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,260
prize, it would have still had
all the tickets there.

48
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,300
It wouldn't have mattered who
was picked out in the first

49
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,980
time because their name was just
written down, but their

50
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,210
ticket was put back in.

51
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,290
And then you would have
been independent.

52
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,980
So if you had replaced the
ticket, you would have been

53
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,720
independent.

54
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,748
But since they didn't replace
the ticket, they taped it to

55
00:02:34,748 --> 00:02:38,510
the prize, these are not
independent events.

56
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:38,600
