1
00:00:00,633 --> 00:00:04,774
We now know that if we have two triangles and all of their corresponding sides

2
00:00:04,774 --> 00:00:11,800
are the same, so by side-side-side, the corresponding sides, all three of the corresponding sides have the same length,

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,253
we know that those triangles are congruent. What I want to do in this video

4
00:00:16,253 --> 00:00:20,379
is explore if there are other properties that we can find between the triangles

5
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:24,535
that can help us feel pretty good that those two triangles would be congruent.

6
00:00:24,535 --> 00:00:28,295
So side-side-side works, what about angle-angle-angle?

7
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:31,589
So let me do that over here, what about angle-angle-angle?

8
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:35,622
So what I'm saying is, let's say I have a triangle like this

9
00:00:35,622 --> 00:00:43,976
and I have a triangle like that, and if we know that this angle is congruent to that angle,

10
00:00:43,976 --> 00:00:48,793
if this angle is congruent to that angle, which means that their measures are equal.

11
00:00:48,793 --> 00:00:59,424
Or/and that angle is congruent to that angle, can we say that these are two congruent triangles?

12
00:00:59,424 --> 00:01:03,029
At first case, it looks like maybe it is, at least the way I drew it here.

13
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:07,483
But when you think about it, you can have the exact same corresponding angles

14
00:01:07,483 --> 00:01:10,471
having the same measure or being congruent.

15
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:14,632
But you can actually scale one of these triangles up and down and still have that property.

16
00:01:14,632 --> 00:01:21,932
For example, if I had this triangle right over here, it looks similar,

17
00:01:21,932 --> 00:01:25,078
and I'm using that in just the everyday language sense,

18
00:01:25,078 --> 00:01:31,423
it has the same shape as these triangles right over here, and it has the same angles

19
00:01:31,423 --> 00:01:36,117
that angle is congruent to that angle, this angle down here is congruent

20
00:01:36,117 --> 00:01:41,263
to this angle over here, and this angle over here is congruent to this angle over here.

21
00:01:41,263 --> 00:01:45,601
So all of the angles in all three of these triangles are the same. The corresponding angles

22
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:51,789
have the same measure. But clearly, clearly this triangle right over here is not the same.

23
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:56,652
It is not congruent to the other two. The sides have a very different length.

24
00:01:56,652 --> 00:02:00,352
This side is much shorter than this side right over here, this side is

25
00:02:00,352 --> 00:02:04,271
much shorter than this side over there, and this side is much shorter over here.

26
00:02:04,271 --> 00:02:10,945
So with just angle-angle-angle, you can not say that a triangle has a same size and shape.

27
00:02:10,945 --> 00:02:13,768
It does have the same shape, but not the same size.

28
00:02:13,768 --> 00:02:20,168
So this does not imply congruency. So angle-angle-angle does not

29
00:02:20,168 --> 00:02:23,620
imply congruency. What is does imply, and we haven't talked about this yet,

30
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:29,341
is that these are similar triangles. So angle-angle-angle implies similar.

31
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:32,156
Let me write it over here, it implies similar triangles.

32
00:02:32,156 --> 00:02:35,370
And similar, you probably are used to the word in just everyday language,

33
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,978
but similar has a very specific meaning in geometry.

34
00:02:38,978 --> 00:02:44,161
And similar things have the same shape but not necessarily the same size.

35
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:49,517
So anything that is congruent, because it has the same size and shape, is also similar.

36
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:56,083
But not everything that is similar is also congruent. So for example, this triangle is similar,

37
00:02:56,083 --> 00:03:00,546
all of these triangles are similar to each other, but they aren't all congruent.

38
00:03:00,546 --> 00:03:04,048
These two are congruent if their sides are the same. I didn't make that assumption, but if we

39
00:03:04,048 --> 00:03:07,207
know that their sides are the same, then we can say that they are congruent.

40
00:03:07,207 --> 00:03:11,939
But neither of these are congruent to this one right over here because this is clearly much larger.

41
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:13,933
It has the same shape, but a different size.

42
00:03:13,933 --> 00:03:17,865
So we can't have an AAA (angle-angle-angle) postulate, or an AAA axiom

43
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:24,208
to get to congruency. What about side-angle-side? Let's try this out.

44
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:29,665
Side-angle-side (SAS), so let's start out with one triangle right over here.

45
00:03:29,665 --> 00:03:34,505
Let's start off with a triangle that looks like this, I have my blue side, I have my pink side,

46
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:41,133
and I have my magenta side. And let's say that I have another triangle that has

47
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:45,661
this [triangle's] blue side, it has the same side the same length as that blue side.

48
00:03:45,661 --> 00:03:49,664
So let me draw it like that, it has the same length as that blue side,

49
00:03:49,664 --> 00:03:54,468
so that length and that length are going to be the same. It has a congruent angle

50
00:03:54,468 --> 00:04:00,328
right after that. So this angle and the next angle for this triangle are going

51
00:04:00,328 --> 00:04:07,032
to have the same measure, or they are going to be congruent. Then the next side is going to have

52
00:04:07,032 --> 00:04:12,381
the same length as this one over here. So that's going to be the same length as this over here.

53
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:14,020
So it's going to be the same length.

54
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:21,229
And we don't know, and because we only know that... two of the corresponding sides have the same length

55
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:25,855
then the angle between them, and this is important, the angle between the two corresponding sides

56
00:04:25,855 --> 00:04:32,295
are also of the same measure, we can do anything we want with this last side on this one.

57
00:04:32,295 --> 00:04:35,234
We can essentially, it's going to have to start right over here.

58
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:40,142
We can start it from this point, and we can pivot it to form any triangle we want.

59
00:04:40,142 --> 00:04:43,967
But we can see, the only way we can form a triangle is if we bring the side all the way over here

60
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:46,331
and close this right over there.

61
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:51,329
And so we can see just logically that if we have, for two triangles

62
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:55,885
they have one side, that has the length the same, the next side has the length the same

63
00:04:55,885 --> 00:05:01,338
and the angle in between them, so this angle, let me do that in the same color.

64
00:05:01,338 --> 00:05:06,301
This angle in between them, this is the angle, this A is this angle and that angle.

65
00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:13,264
It's the angle in between them. This first side is in blue, and this second side right over here is in pink.

66
00:05:13,294 --> 00:05:15,116
I know it's already written in pink.

67
00:05:15,116 --> 00:05:20,190
So we can see that if two sides are the same length, two corresponding sides are the same length

68
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:23,727
and the corresponding angle between them, they have to be congruent.

69
00:05:23,727 --> 00:05:26,234
There's no other place to put this third side.

70
00:05:26,234 --> 00:05:33,969
So SAS, and sometimes it's once again called a postulate, an axiom, or if it's proven sometimes it's called a theorem.

71
00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:38,534
This does imply that the two triangles are congruent.

72
00:05:38,534 --> 00:05:45,190
So we will give ourselves this tool in our toolkit. We had the SSS postulate, now we have the SAS postulate.

73
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,369
Two sides are equal and the angle in between them, for two triangles

74
00:05:48,369 --> 00:05:55,000
corresponding sides and angles, then we can say that it is definitely, these are congruent triangles.

75
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,879
Now what about, now I'm just going to try to go through all of the different combinations here.

76
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,254
What if I have something, what if I have angle-side-angle?

77
00:06:03,254 --> 00:06:09,157
So let me try that. So what happens if I have angle-side-angle?

78
00:06:09,157 --> 00:06:12,348
So let's go back to this one right over here.

79
00:06:12,348 --> 00:06:15,430
Actually let me just redraw a new one for each of these cases.

80
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:20,220
So angle-side-angle, so I'll draw a triangle here.

81
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:26,124
So I have this triangle, so this would be maybe the side, that would be the side.

82
00:06:26,124 --> 00:06:29,057
Let me draw the whole triangle, actually, first.

83
00:06:29,057 --> 00:06:33,768
Let me draw one side over here, and then let me draw one side over there

84
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:39,209
and that this angle right over here, I'll call it, I'll do it in orange

85
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:43,600
and this angle over here, I will do it in yellow.

86
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,530
So if I have another triangle that has one side having equal measure

87
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,284
so I'll use it as this blue side right over here.

88
00:06:51,284 --> 00:06:58,268
So it has one side that has equal measure. And the two angles on either side of that side, or either end of that side

89
00:06:58,268 --> 00:07:02,085
are the same, will this triangle necessarily be congruent?

90
00:07:02,085 --> 00:07:04,265
We're just going to try to reason it out. These aren't formal proofs.

91
00:07:04,265 --> 00:07:07,237
We're really just trying to set up, what are reasonable postulates,

92
00:07:07,237 --> 00:07:13,229
or what are reasonable assumptions we can have as we, in our toolkit as we try to prove other things.

93
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:17,565
So, that angle, let's call it that angle right over there, is going to be,

94
00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:19,500
it's going to have the same measure in this triangle.

95
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:25,705
And this angle right over here in yellow is going to have the same measure on this triangle right over here.

96
00:07:25,705 --> 00:07:29,976
So regardless, so I'm not in any way constraining the sides over here.

97
00:07:29,976 --> 00:07:33,427
So this side, this side right over here could have any length.

98
00:07:33,427 --> 00:07:37,169
It could have any length, but it has to form this angle with it.

99
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:40,653
So it could have any length and it can just go as far as it wants to go

100
00:07:40,653 --> 00:07:43,389
and in no way have we constrained what the length of that is.

101
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:46,537
Actually let me mark this off too, so this is the same as this.

102
00:07:46,537 --> 00:07:49,495
So that side can be anything, we haven't constrained it at all.

103
00:07:49,495 --> 00:07:54,368
And once again this side could be anything, we haven't constrained it at all

104
00:07:54,368 --> 00:07:58,220
but we know it has to go at this angle. So it has to go at that angle.

105
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,301
Well once again, there's only one triangle that can be formed this way.

106
00:08:01,301 --> 00:08:04,912
We can say all day that this length can be as long as we want or as short as we want,

107
00:08:04,912 --> 00:08:07,528
and this one can be as long as we want or as short as we want.

108
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,969
But the only way that they can actually touch each other and form a triangle

109
00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:16,501
and have these two angles is if, is if they are the exact same length as these,

110
00:08:16,501 --> 00:08:18,833
as these two sides right over here.

111
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:22,892
So these two, this side will actually have to be the same as that side

112
00:08:22,892 --> 00:08:24,484
and this will have to be the same as that side.

113
00:08:24,484 --> 00:08:28,281
Once again, this isn't a proof, I'd call it more of a reasoning through it

114
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:35,795
or investigation, really just to establish what are reasonable baselines or axioms or assumptions or postulates that we can have.

115
00:08:35,795 --> 00:08:41,028
So for my purposes, I think ASA does show us that two triangles,

116
00:08:41,028 --> 00:08:44,447
two triangles are congruent.

117
00:08:44,447 --> 00:08:50,595
Now let's try another one, let's try angle-angle-side. Let's try angle-angle-side.

118
00:08:50,595 --> 00:08:52,072
And you know in some geometry classes,

119
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:55,083
and maybe if you have to go through an exam quickly you might memorize,

120
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:58,010
okay side-side-side implies congruency, that's kind of logical.

121
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:01,431
And side-angle-side implies congruency, and so on and so forth.

122
00:09:01,431 --> 00:09:04,486
I'm not a fan of memorizing it. It might be good for time pressure.

123
00:09:04,486 --> 00:09:07,187
It is good to sometimes even just go through this logic.

124
00:09:07,187 --> 00:09:09,367
If you're like, wait, does angle-angle-angle work?

125
00:09:09,367 --> 00:09:11,971
Well no, I can find this case that breaks down angle-angle-angle.

126
00:09:11,971 --> 00:09:17,468
Will these work? Just try to verify for yourself, do they make logical sense why they would imply congruency?

127
00:09:17,468 --> 00:09:24,034
Now let's try angle-angle-side. Let's try angle-angle-side.

128
00:09:24,034 --> 00:09:27,654
So once again, let's say, let's have a triangle over here.

129
00:09:27,654 --> 00:09:30,957
It has some side, so this one's going to be a little bit more interesting.

130
00:09:30,957 --> 00:09:33,820
So it has some side, that's the side right over there.

131
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,718
And then it has two angles, so let me draw the other sides of this triangle.

132
00:09:38,718 --> 00:09:41,873
I'll draw one in magenta and then one in green.

133
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:45,418
And it has, there's two angles, and then the side.

134
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:49,510
So let's see, you have this angle, you have that angle right over there.

135
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,162
Actually I didn't have to put the double, since that's the first angle that I'm,

136
00:09:52,162 --> 00:09:55,018
so that angle, which we'll refer to as that first A.

137
00:09:55,018 --> 00:09:59,954
Then we have this angle, which is that second A.

138
00:09:59,954 --> 00:10:02,750
So if I know, if I know that there's another,

139
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:08,275
that there's another triangle that has one side having the same length.

140
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:11,550
Let me draw it like that, it has one side having the same length.

141
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,585
It has one angle on that side that has the same measure.

142
00:10:15,585 --> 00:10:18,224
So it has a measure like that.

143
00:10:18,224 --> 00:10:22,339
And so this, this side right over here could be of any length.

144
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:25,883
This side over here could be of any length, we aren't constraining what the length of that side is.

145
00:10:25,883 --> 00:10:32,116
But whatever the angle is on the other side of that side is going to be the same as this green angle right over here.

146
00:10:32,116 --> 00:10:36,204
So, for example, it could be like that, and then we could have the green side go like that.

147
00:10:36,204 --> 00:10:39,582
It could be like that and have the green side go like that.

148
00:10:39,582 --> 00:10:42,257
And if we have, so the only thing we're assuming

149
00:10:42,257 --> 00:10:46,489
the only thing we're assuming is that this is the same length as this

150
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:49,290
and that this angle has the same measure as that angle

151
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,587
and that this measure is the same measure as that angle.

152
00:10:51,587 --> 00:10:53,966
And this magenta line can be of any length

153
00:10:53,966 --> 00:10:57,875
and this green line can be of any length, we in no way have constrained that.

154
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:01,387
But how - can we form any triangle that is not congruent to this?

155
00:11:01,387 --> 00:11:05,615
Because the bottom line is, this green line is going to have to touch this one right over there

156
00:11:05,615 --> 00:11:09,400
and the only way it's going to touch that one right over there is if it starts,

157
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,048
is if it starts right over here. Starts right over here.

158
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:16,334
Because we're constraining this angle right over here, we're constraining that angle.

159
00:11:16,334 --> 00:11:22,149
And so it looks like angle-angle-side does indeed imply congruency.

160
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:25,992
So that does imply congruency.

161
00:11:25,992 --> 00:11:30,708
So let's just do one more, just to kind of try out all of the different situations.

162
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:34,405
What if we have, and I'm running out of a little bit of real estate right over here at the bottom.

163
00:11:34,405 --> 00:11:38,760
What if we tried out side-side-angle?

164
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:46,562
So once again, draw a triangle. It has one side there, it has another side there

165
00:11:46,562 --> 00:11:49,619
and then, I'm not gonna do those hash marks just yet.

166
00:11:49,619 --> 00:11:54,558
So one side, then another side, and then another side.

167
00:11:54,558 --> 00:11:56,856
And it, what happens if we know that there's another triangle

168
00:11:56,856 --> 00:12:00,414
that has two of the sides the same and then the angle after it?

169
00:12:00,414 --> 00:12:03,932
So for example, it would have that side, just like that

170
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:07,882
and then it has another side, but we're not constraining the angle.

171
00:12:07,882 --> 00:12:11,866
We aren't constraining, we aren't constraining this angle right over here.

172
00:12:11,866 --> 00:12:14,068
But we're constraining the length of that side.

173
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:16,752
So let me color-code it. So that blue side is that first side.

174
00:12:16,752 --> 00:12:20,822
Then we have this magenta side right over there.

175
00:12:20,822 --> 00:12:24,053
So this is going to be the same length as this right over here.

176
00:12:24,053 --> 00:12:27,216
But let me make it at a different angle to see if I can disprove it.

177
00:12:27,216 --> 00:12:30,172
So let's say it looks like that. Or actually, let me make it even

178
00:12:30,172 --> 00:12:33,460
let me make it even more interesting. Let me try to make it,

179
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:39,611
Let me try to make it like that.

180
00:12:39,611 --> 00:12:43,500
So it's a very different angle, but now it has to have the same angle out here.

181
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,411
It has to have that same angle out here, so it has to be roughly that angle.

182
00:12:47,411 --> 00:12:52,620
So actually it looks like we can draw a triangle that is not congruent that has the same,

183
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,695
two sides being the same length and then an angle that's different.

184
00:12:55,695 --> 00:13:00,153
For example, this is pretty much that. I made this angle smaller than this angle.

185
00:13:00,153 --> 00:13:05,120
These two sides are the same. This angle is the same now, but what the byproduct of that

186
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,990
is that this green side is going to be shorter on this triangle right over here.

187
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:15,903
So these aren't, you don't necessarily have congruent triangles with side-side-angle.

188
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:22,444
So this is, this is not necessarily congruent.

189
00:13:22,444 --> 00:13:26,444
Or similar, it gives us neither congruency nor similarity.
