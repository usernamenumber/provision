1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,981
Let's think about what type of reaction we might be able to get going

2
00:00:03,981 --> 00:00:10,080
if we had some methane and

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,229
some molecular chlorine.

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,270
So if we just let this be and we didn't heat it up

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,248
or put in any UV light into this reaction,

6
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,860
pretty much nothing will happen.

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,260
Both of these molecules are reasonably happy

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,100
being the way they are.

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,680
But if we were to add heat into it, if we were to start

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,200
making all the atoms and molecules vibrate more and

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,090
bump into each other more, or we were to add energy

12
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,970
in the form of UV light, what we could start doing is

13
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,140
breaking some of these chlorine-chlorine bonds.

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,650
Out of all of the bonds here, those are the weakest.

15
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,460
That would be the most susceptible to breakage.

16
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,780
So let's say we were to add some heat, what would happen?

17
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,230
So let's see.

18
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,620
Let me draw the valence electrons of

19
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,830
each of these chlorines.

20
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:58,959
This chlorine has 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 valence electrons,

21
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:00,704
and this chlorine over here has

22
00:01:00,704 --> 00:01:05,720
1,2,3,4,5,6,7 valence electrons.

23
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,520
Now, when you add heat to this
reaction, enough for these

24
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,050
guys to vibrant away from each
other, for this bond to break,

25
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,740
what's going to happen, and we
haven't drawn an arrow like

26
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,430
this just yet, but what's going
to happen is that each

27
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,590
of these chlorines, this
bond is going to break.

28
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,730
Each of these chlorines are just
going to take their part

29
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:22,510
of the bond.

30
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,530
So this guy on the
left, he's just

31
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,645
going to take his electron.

32
00:01:26,645 --> 00:01:28,900
And notice, I draw it with
this half arrow.

33
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,895
It looks like a fish hook.

34
00:01:29,895 --> 00:01:31,410
It's just half an arrowhead.

35
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,650
This means that this electron
is just going to go back to

36
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:36,480
this chlorine, and this other
magenta electron is going to

37
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:42,720
go back to the right chlorine,
so we can draw it like that.

38
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,630
If it was up to me, I would have
drawn it more like this.

39
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,610
I would have drawn it more like
this to show that that

40
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,600
electron just goes back to the
chlorine, but the convention

41
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,010
shows that you can show that
half of the bond is going back

42
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,560
to the entire atom.

43
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,530
Now, after this happens, what
will everything look like?

44
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,610
Well, we're still going to
have our methane here.

45
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,460
It hasn't really reacted.

46
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,800
So we still have our methane.

47
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,580
Let me draw it a little bit.

48
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,670
So we still have our
methane here.

49
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,090
And all that's happened is,
because we've put energy into

50
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,190
the system, we've been able
to break this bond.

51
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,390
The molecular chlorine has
broken up into two chlorine

52
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:29,750
atoms. So we have the one on the
left over here, and then

53
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,670
we have the one on the right.

54
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,940
And let me draw the left's
valence electrons.

55
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:38,510
It has one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

56
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,130
I just flipped it over so that
the lone electron is on the

57
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,810
left-hand side right here.

58
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:43,860
And then you have the
guy on the right.

59
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,290
He has one, two, three,
four, five, six,

60
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,820
seven valence electrons.

61
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,890
Now that each of these guys
have an unpaired electron,

62
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,820
they're actually very,
very, very reactive.

63
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,610
And we actually call any
molecule that has an unpaired

64
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,470
electron and is very reactive
a free radical.

65
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,810
So both of these guys now
are free radicals.

66
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,550
And actually, the whole
topic of this video is

67
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,410
free radical reactions.

68
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,920
Both of these guys are
free radicals.

69
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,860
And you've probably heard the
word free radical before.

70
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,240
In the context of nutrition,
that you don't want free

71
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,590
radicals running around.

72
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,140
And it's the exact same idea.

73
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,460
It's not necessarily chlorine
that they're talking about,

74
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,980
but they're talking about
molecules that

75
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,470
have unpaired electrons.

76
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:30,150
They'll react with some of your
cell's machinery, maybe

77
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,320
even with your DNA, maybe cause
mutations that might

78
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,730
lead to things like cancer.

79
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,930
So that's why people think you
shouldn't have free radicals

80
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:38,770
in your body.

81
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,470
But as soon as we form these
free radicals, in this step

82
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,700
right here, where we put energy
in the system to break

83
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,520
this bond, we call this
the initiation step.

84
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,110
Let me put this.

85
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,510
We used energy here.

86
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,000
This was endothermic.

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,790
We use energy.

88
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,200
This right here is the
initiation step.

89
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,350
And what we're going to see in
general with free radical

90
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,460
reactions is you need some
energy to get it started.

91
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,250
But once it gets started,
it kind of

92
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,490
starts this chain reaction.

93
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,140
And as one free radical reacts
with something else, it

94
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,470
creates another free radical,
and that keeps propagating

95
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,240
until really everything
has reacted.

96
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,420
And that's why these can be
so dangerous or so bad for

97
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,860
biological systems.

98
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,329
So I've told you that
they react a lot.

99
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,089
So how will they react now?

100
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:23,080
Well, this guy wants to form
a pair with someone else.

101
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,370
And maybe if he swipes by this
methane in just the right way,

102
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,430
with just enough energy, what
will happen is he could take

103
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,220
the hydrogen off of the carbon,
and not just the

104
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,710
proton, the entire hydrogen.

105
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,660
He will form a bond with the
hydrogen using the hydrogen's

106
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,840
electrons, so they'll
get together and

107
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,790
they'll form a bond.

108
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,900
The hydrogen will contribute
one electron.

109
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,610
Notice, I'm drawing the
half-arrow again, so the

110
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,160
hydrogen isn't giving away the
electron to someone else.

111
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,240
That would be a full arrow.

112
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,790
The hydrogen is just
contributing its electron to

113
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,050
half of a bond.

114
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:57,270
And then the carbon, the carbon
would do the same.

115
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,070
I'll do that in blue.

116
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,960
So the carbon, this valence
electron right here, could be

117
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,900
contributed to half of a bond,
and then they will bond, and

118
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,190
this bond over here
will break.

119
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:12,140
And so the carbon over here on
the left, this carbon over

120
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,050
here will take back
its electron.

121
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:16,960
So what does it look like?

122
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,990
What does everything look
like after that's done?

123
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,780
So our methane now, it's
no longer methane.

124
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,240
It is now, if you think
about it-- so

125
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,520
we have three hydrogens.

126
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,460
It took its electron back.

127
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,060
It is now a free radical.

128
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,270
It now has an unpaired
reactive electron.

129
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,506
The hydrogen and this chlorine
have bonded.

130
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,700
So let me draw the chlorine.

131
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,000
It has this electron
right over here.

132
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,375
It has the other six valence
electrons: one, two, three,

133
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,030
four, five, six.

134
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:54,630
And we have the hydrogen with
its pink electron that it's

135
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,930
contributing to the bond.

136
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,540
And so we have them
bonded now.

137
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,470
This chlorine is no longer a
free radical, although this

138
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,820
one out here is still
a free radical.

139
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,020
Let me copy and paste it.

140
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,450
So it's hanging around.

141
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,950
Copy and paste.

142
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:15,940
And now, notice we had one free
radical react, but it

143
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,410
formed another free radical.

144
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,450
That's why we call this
a propagation step.

145
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:29,920
So this right here is
a propagation step.

146
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,980
When one free radical
reacts, it created

147
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,440
another free radical.

148
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,620
Now, what's that free radical
likely to do?

149
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,310
You might be tempted to say,
hey, it's going to just react

150
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,570
with that other chlorine,
but think about it.

151
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,720
These molecules, there's a
gazillion of them in this

152
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,900
solution, so the odds that
this guy's going to react

153
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,430
exactly with that other free
radical is actually very low,

154
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,330
especially early on in the
reaction where most of the

155
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:56,720
molecules are still either
methane or molecular chlorine.

156
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,690
So this guy is much more likely
to bump into another

157
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,740
molecular chlorine than he is
to bump into one of these

158
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,290
original free radicals
that formed.

159
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:08,170
So if he bumps into another
molecular chlorine in just the

160
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:11,750
right way-- so let me draw
another molecular chlorine.

161
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,760
So that's another molecular
chlorine.

162
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,140
And each of these one, two,
three, four, five six, seven;

163
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:22,290
one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

164
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,760
There is a bond here.

165
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,715
If they bump in just the right
way, this chlorine electron

166
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:33,220
might get contributed, and this
free unpaired electron

167
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:39,760
will be contributed and then
this CH3, I guess we could

168
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,650
call it, this free radical, this
carbon free radical, or

169
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,700
this methyl free radical,
will then form a

170
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,070
bond with this chlorine.

171
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,800
What's everything going to
look like after that?

172
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,080
Well, after that happens this
is now bonded to a chlorine.

173
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,870
It's now chloromethane.

174
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,530
Let me draw it.

175
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:01,540
So it's carbon, hydrogen,
hydrogen, hydrogen.

176
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,040
Now, it's bonded
to a chlorine.

177
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,050
Let me draw the electrons
so we can keep track of

178
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:05,840
everything.

179
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,950
We have that magenta electron
right over there.

180
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,190
And then we have the chlorine
with its one, two, three,

181
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,470
four, five, six, seven
valence electrons.

182
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,080
They are now bonded.

183
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,570
This is chloromethane.

184
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:22,520
And now you have another free
radical because this guy-- and

185
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,810
I should have drawn it there.

186
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,270
This guy, that bond
was broken, so he

187
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,870
gets back his electrons.

188
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,340
So he's sitting over here.

189
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,900
He is now a free radical.

190
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,510
So this is another
propagation step.

191
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,190
And we still have that original
free radical guy

192
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,150
sitting out over here.

193
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,880
So we keep forming more
and more free

194
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,840
radicals as this happens.

195
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,870
Now, eventually we're going to
start running out of methanes

196
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,120
and we're going to start
running out of

197
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,650
the molecular chlorines.

198
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,900
So they're going to be less
likely to react and you're

199
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,840
actually going to have more
free radicals around.

200
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,470
So once the concentration of
free radicals gets high

201
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,460
enough, then you might
start to see them

202
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,930
reacting with each other.

203
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:12,040
So when the concentration of
free radicals get high enough,

204
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,480
you might see, instead of this
step happening-- this will

205
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,410
happen a long time until most
of the free radicals or most

206
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,010
of the non-free radicals
disappear.

207
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,980
But once we have a soup of
mainly free radicals, you'll

208
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,310
see things like this.

209
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:31,160
You'll see the methyl
free radical.

210
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,490
So let me draw it like this.

211
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:39,190
You'll see him maybe reacting
with another methyl free

212
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:46,830
radical, where they
both contribute an

213
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,340
electron to form a bond.

214
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:53,250
And then, once the bond forms,
you have ethane.

215
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,800
I could just write
as CH3, H3C.

216
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,200
So you might have something
like this.

217
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,260
And so this type of a step where
two free radicals kind

218
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,750
of cancel each other out, this
is a termination step because

219
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,870
it's starting to lower the
concentration of free radicals

220
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,160
in the solution, but this is
only once the concentration of

221
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,610
free radicals becomes
really high.

222
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,090
You might also see some of the
chlorines cancel out with each

223
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,810
other again, so a chlorine
free radical and another

224
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:18,840
chlorine free radical.

225
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,030
I'll only draw the unpaired
electron.

226
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:24,000
They can bond with each
other and form

227
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,440
molecular chlorine again.

228
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,510
That again is a termination
step.

229
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:32,480
Or you could see something like
the methyl free radical.

230
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,400
Just for shorthand, I'll write
it like this: H3C.

231
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,030
The methyl free radical and a
chlorine free radical might

232
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:45,050
also just straight-up react and
form chloromethane, And

233
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,200
form H3C-Cl.

234
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,780
So this will all happen once
the concentration of free

235
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,510
radicals gets really high.

236
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,590
Now, another thing that might
happen once this reaction

237
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,520
proceeds, and we have a lot of
the propagation steps, is that

238
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:03,880
you might have a situation
where you already have a

239
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:10,730
chloromethane, so it
looks like this.

240
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:13,600
You already have a
chloromethane.

241
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,830
And once you have enough of
these, it then becomes more

242
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:21,510
likely that some free radical
chlorine might be able to

243
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:25,130
react with this thing, so it
might actually add another

244
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,030
chlorine to this molecule.

245
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,440
And the way it would do it, this
chlorine over here-- I'm

246
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,300
just drawing the free
electron pairs.

247
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:36,760
It would form a bond with this
hydrogen right over there.

248
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,920
They would both contribute
their electrons.

249
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,770
And then the carbon would
take back its electron.

250
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:45,960
Notice, all of the
half-arrows.

251
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:51,830
You'd be left with-- the
hydrogen and the chlorine

252
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,000
would have bonded.

253
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,250
And now, this guy's going to
be a free radical, but he's

254
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,300
going to be a chlorinated
free radical.

255
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,560
So it's going to
look like this.

256
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:07,150
He has a free electron over
there: hydrogen, hydrogen.

257
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,180
And then he might be
able to react with

258
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:13,720
another chlorine molecule.

259
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,200
He contributes an electron.

260
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,510
Maybe this guy contributes
an electron.

261
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,550
This guy-- I don't want to
draw a full arrow-- he

262
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:24,170
contributes an electron to a
bond, and then this guy takes

263
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:28,880
his electron back and becomes
a free radical.

264
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,040
And then we're left with what?

265
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:37,950
We're left with a doubly
chlorinated methane.

266
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:41,750
So then we have Cl,
Cl, and then a

267
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,510
hydrogen and a hydrogen.

268
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,570
And this could actually
keep happening.

269
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,670
As the concentration of these
get higher, then it becomes

270
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,810
more likely that this can react
with another chlorine.

271
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,890
Of course, this chlorine
over here becomes

272
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,630
another free radical.

273
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:57,600
But the general idea here that
I wanted to show you is that

274
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,590
once a free radical reaction
starts-- the first step

275
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:04,520
requires some energy to break
this chlorine-chlorine bond,

276
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,570
but once it happens, these guys
are highly reactive, will

277
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:10,170
start reacting with other
things, and as they react with

278
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:12,630
other things, it causes more and
more free radicals, so it

279
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,290
starts this chain reaction.

280
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,940
And actually, all in all, this
required energy to occur.

281
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,520
This step right here, this
propagation step, it requires

282
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,640
a little bit of energy, but
it's almost neutral.

283
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,150
It requires energy to break
this bond, but it creates

284
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,870
energy when this
bond is formed.

285
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,130
It still requires a
little net energy.

286
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,810
And then things like this start
to become exothermic.

287
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,990
And especially once you start
getting to the termination

288
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:36,760
steps, you start releasing
a lot of energy.

289
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,060
So actually, all in all, this
reaction is actually going to

290
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:44,100
release energy, but it needed
some energy to get started.
