1
00:00:00,369 --> 00:00:04,633
multiply and simplify five times the cube root of two x squared

2
00:00:04,633 --> 00:00:08,018
times three times the cube root of four x to the fourth

3
00:00:08,018 --> 00:00:12,035
so the two things that pop out of my brain right here is that we can change

4
00:00:12,035 --> 00:00:14,936
the order a little bit cause multiplication is both commutative

5
00:00:14,936 --> 00:00:18,434
well the commutative property allows us to switch the order for multiplication

6
00:00:18,434 --> 00:00:21,969
so we can get the constant terms we can multiply the five times the three

7
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:25,853
and then the other two things that we are multiplying They are both the cube root which is the

8
00:00:25,853 --> 00:00:27,969
same thing as taking something to the one-third power

9
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:33,436
so the cube root of x. This is exactly the same thing as raising x to the one-third

10
00:00:33,436 --> 00:00:37,302
So let's do that. Let's switch the order and let's rewrite these cube roots as

11
00:00:37,302 --> 00:00:39,851
raising it to the one-third power

12
00:00:39,851 --> 00:00:45,907
so I have the five and the three so that's going to be five times three

13
00:00:45,907 --> 00:00:48,637
and then we have the cube root of

14
00:00:48,637 --> 00:00:50,369
I will do that in a new color

15
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:54,242
then we have the cube root of two x squared

16
00:00:54,242 --> 00:00:59,036
so this I can rewrite as two x squared to the one-third power

17
00:00:59,036 --> 00:01:03,642
,and then I have the cube root of four x to the fourth

18
00:01:03,642 --> 00:01:07,568
so that's the same thing as four x to the fourth to the one-third power

19
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:12,306
and now we know from our exponent properties: if we have two things that are both

20
00:01:12,368 --> 00:01:15,100
raised to the same power and then we take the product

21
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,837
we could just take the product first and then

22
00:01:16,837 --> 00:01:17,836
raise it to the power

23
00:01:17,836 --> 00:01:22,837
so if I have a to the x power times b to the x power

24
00:01:22,837 --> 00:01:26,243
This is the same thing as a times b to the x power

25
00:01:26,243 --> 00:01:29,828
So we can simplify this part of the expression right over here

26
00:01:29,828 --> 00:01:33,998
as two x squared

27
00:01:33,998 --> 00:01:37,886
time four x to the fourth to the

28
00:01:37,886 --> 00:01:43,021
one-third power and of course five times three is fifteen

29
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:46,179
and if we simplify what is in the expression right over here we

30
00:01:46,179 --> 00:01:48,687
once again it is commutative so we can swap the order and

31
00:01:48,687 --> 00:01:50,425
it is associative so we can

32
00:01:50,425 --> 00:01:54,286
swap the grouping or how we group them does not matter

33
00:01:54,286 --> 00:01:56,175
cause it is all multiplication here

34
00:01:56,175 --> 00:02:00,553
This is two times four which is six times x squared times x to the fourth

35
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:02,349
x squared times x to the fourth

36
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:04,619
is x to the sixth power

37
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:07,952
and it is all of that to the one-third power

38
00:02:07,952 --> 00:02:09,892
and then that is times

39
00:02:09,892 --> 00:02:15,353
oh sorry not six two times four is eight what am I doing?

40
00:02:15,353 --> 00:02:18,890
two times four is eight

41
00:02:18,962 --> 00:02:22,550
x squared times x to the fourth is

42
00:02:23,257 --> 00:02:25,503
x to the sixth

43
00:02:25,503 --> 00:02:28,621
I think my brain was adding the exponents and wrote the six down

44
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:31,300
of course two times four is eight not six but we add the exponents

45
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,881
they had the same base

46
00:02:32,881 --> 00:02:35,235
x squared times x to the fourth is x to the sixth

47
00:02:35,235 --> 00:02:39,237
and we are gonna raise that to the one-third power

48
00:02:39,237 --> 00:02:41,368
and then all of that is times fifteen

49
00:02:41,368 --> 00:02:44,464
and then we essentially can use this property again

50
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,111
actually not that property

51
00:02:46,111 --> 00:02:48,719
We know that this. We know if I have something

52
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,904
well actually exactly this property again

53
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,176
We have something multiplied to a power

54
00:02:53,176 --> 00:02:56,448
This is the exact same thing

55
00:02:56,463 --> 00:02:59,757
as eight to the one-third power times

56
00:02:59,757 --> 00:03:02,828
x to the sixth to the one-third power

57
00:03:02,828 --> 00:03:07,691
and then all of that is being multiplied

58
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:11,268
by fifteen and so eight to the one-third power

59
00:03:11,268 --> 00:03:13,013
this is the same thing as the cube root of eight

60
00:03:13,013 --> 00:03:16,957
you might recognize that eight is two times two times two

61
00:03:16,957 --> 00:03:19,768
so eight to the one-third power is two

62
00:03:19,768 --> 00:03:22,438
eight is two to the third so two to the third

63
00:03:22,438 --> 00:03:24,271
to the one-third is two to the first

64
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:25,854
two times two times two is eight

65
00:03:25,854 --> 00:03:28,088
and x to the sixth to the one-third

66
00:03:28,088 --> 00:03:30,352
we know from our exponent properties that is the same thing as

67
00:03:30,352 --> 00:03:33,018
x to the six times one-third power

68
00:03:33,018 --> 00:03:35,225
x to the six divided by three power

69
00:03:35,225 --> 00:03:39,891
or six divided by three is two or x squared so that is just x squared

70
00:03:39,891 --> 00:03:41,684
so we have

71
00:03:41,684 --> 00:03:43,618
fifteen times two which gives us thirty

72
00:03:43,618 --> 00:03:45,763
so that is these terms right over here

73
00:03:45,763 --> 00:03:48,434
and then you have this term right over here

74
00:03:48,434 --> 00:03:49,959
I want to do that in a different color

75
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:53,685
and then you have this term right over here

76
00:03:53,685 --> 00:03:55,517
that's not a different color! You have this term

77
00:03:55,517 --> 00:03:57,351
right over here is x squared

78
00:03:57,351 --> 00:03:59,182
and you are done

79
00:03:59,182 --> 00:04:00,850
and there is a bunch of ways you could do it

80
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,618
You might not decide to use exponent notation

81
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,023
You could say look this is a cube root

82
00:04:06,023 --> 00:04:10,085
This is a cube root I can take the cube root of the product of both of them

83
00:04:10,085 --> 00:04:11,847
so you do not have to write the one-third here

84
00:04:11,847 --> 00:04:13,618
you could just write the cube root of this whole thing over here

85
00:04:13,618 --> 00:04:16,155
and then depending on how you want to group it and all the rest

86
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:17,552
you could do this in different orders

87
00:04:17,602 --> 00:04:17,602
as long as you get the right exponent properties

88
00:04:17,602 --> 00:04:17,603
you should be getting

89
00:04:20,431 --> 00:04:24,431
you should get to this same answer
