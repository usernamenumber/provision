99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is our Switch Mode Power Supply for the DVD player.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now the Switch Mode Power Supply operates at a high frequency.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Linear power supplies operate at lower frequencies.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The key deference is that the switch mode power supplies,

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Tend to be smaller and form factor ,

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They produce more electromagnetic interference,

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the have to have a lot more filtering,

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Um, but they also operate with, uh, much more efficiency.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They can change the amount of power they supply,

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and they therefore are able to, they don't use near as much power

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
as a linear power supply, so those are the main differences there.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now if you look right here you can see this is where the power comes in from the house

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
ah there's a fuse here,

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this fuse is to protect the house.
