00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,847
If you were to ask some people why we have seasons,

2
00:00:04,847 --> 00:00:09,955
they might say that maybe it's due to how far we are from the sun

3
00:00:09,955 --> 00:00:14,035
at different points in the year, different points in Earth's orbit.

4
00:00:14,035 --> 00:00:17,878
Now what I want to do in this video is to show you why that isn't the case.

5
00:00:17,878 --> 00:00:20,006
So, the line or reasoning would go something like this:

6
00:00:20,006 --> 00:00:22,417
This is the sun, at the center of our solar system,

7
00:00:22,417 --> 00:00:24,782
and roughly the center of Earth's orbit.

8
00:00:24,782 --> 00:00:28,565
And let me draw Earth's orbit over here.

9
00:00:28,565 --> 00:00:30,915
And so the line of reasoning is there's certain points in Earth's orbit

10
00:00:30,915 --> 00:00:34,900
where we're closer to the sun(and certainly we can draw a better job than that...)

11
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,353
Let's say this is a point where we're closer to the sun

12
00:00:37,353 --> 00:00:39,498
we get a little further and we get a lot further

13
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:44,401
then we get a little bit closer, and this is the closest point.

14
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:51,052
So maybe Earth's orbit looks something like this:

15
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:56,662
So the argument would go, look, there are points in Earth's orbit where we are closer to the sun and points that we are further from the sun

16
00:00:56,662 --> 00:00:59,594
and actually, that part of the argument is true.

17
00:00:59,594 --> 00:01:01,691
Earth's orbit is not a perfect circle,

18
00:01:01,691 --> 00:01:06,289
and there are points in Earth's orbit where we are closer to or further away from the sun.

19
00:01:06,289 --> 00:01:11,816
And actually when we are closest to the sun, so Earth is right over here, there's a word for that,

20
00:01:11,816 --> 00:01:22,235
it's called "perihelion," it just means, the closest point in orbit to the sun.

21
00:01:22,235 --> 00:01:34,060
And there is a furthest point from the sun, and this is called "aphelion," (a-feel-ion, ap-helion).

22
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:40,339
So it is true that Earth's orbit is not a perfect circle around the sun, although it's pretty close, but it's not a perfect circle,

23
00:01:40,339 --> 00:01:48,372
it has a slighty elliptical shape, and because of that there are times of the years where we are closer to the sun,

24
00:01:48,372 --> 00:01:55,230
and there are times when we are furthest from the sun. And the difference is about 3%, it's not a huge difference in distance,

25
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:59,681
I've really exaggerated the difference in this diagram right over here,

26
00:01:59,681 --> 00:02:04,762
but based on this reasoning people would say, and this is the flawed part, that when we're closer to the sun

27
00:02:04,762 --> 00:02:07,743
this must be the summer.

28
00:02:07,743 --> 00:02:15,779
And when we are furthest away from the sun, this must be the winter.

29
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:23,202
And the most obvious point of evidence why this is not the case, is that it is not summer,

30
00:02:23,202 --> 00:02:26,602
when it is summer at one point on the planet, it is not summer throughout the planet at that time

31
00:02:26,602 --> 00:02:39,385
in particular when it is... (let me draw our planet) in particular, when it is summer in the northern hemisphere,

32
00:02:39,385 --> 00:02:49,732
(actually let me do summer in a more warm color) when it is summer in the northern hemisphere, so here it is summer,

33
00:02:49,732 --> 00:02:59,586
it is winter in the southern hemisphere.

34
00:02:59,586 --> 00:03:03,930
And when it is summer in the southern hemisphere, it is winter in the northern hemisphere

35
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:08,420
so the entire planet does not experience the seasons at the same time.

36
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:18,119
So that's probably (I guess you could say) the biggest point of data that we observe on our planet why this by itself can not explain the change in seasons.

37
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:33,985
And in particular, it really goes against what we experience in the northern hemisphere, because our perihelion right now is occurring in January. It is occurring during the winter, the northern hemisphere winter.

38
00:03:33,985 --> 00:03:52,252
Perihelion right now, is during the northern hemisphere winter. And when we are furthest away from the sun, this is actually the northern hemisphere's summer.

39
00:03:52,252 --> 00:03:58,352
So although it might seem like a fairly intuitive idea, hey, if we're closer to the sun, the whole planet's getting warmer, maybe that's summer,

40
00:03:58,386 --> 00:04:05,314
when we're further away the whole planet's getting a little less energy, that's winter, the evidence we see on earth goes directly against that.

41
00:04:05,314 --> 00:04:10,579
In particular, we don't have the same seasons in both the northern and southern hemispheres at the same time,

42
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:17,758
and in particular, in the northern hemisphere, when we are closest to the sun, it's actually in January, it's actually in the middle of winter.

43
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:27,011
So, I'll leave you there in this video... I've left you just saying, okay, so the closeness to the sun to the sun does not dictate what season we are in,

44
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:31,011
it's just saying, what is the reason, what we'll see in the next video, the reason is the tilt of the axis of the earth, the rotational axis of the earth.
