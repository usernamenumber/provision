1
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:08,914
We are in San Francisco and we are looking at Frida Khalo's portrait

2
00:00:08,914 --> 00:00:13,100
Frieda and Diego Rivera from 1931

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,497
So it's an early Frida Khalo

4
00:00:15,497 --> 00:00:19,946
and they were both in San Francisco so it's kind of a wonderful place to see this painting

5
00:00:19,946 --> 00:00:24,115
and they were here because Rivera was commisioned to paint the murals here

6
00:00:24,115 --> 00:00:30,918
He was already an established painter who was famous in Mexico and was invited to the united states

7
00:00:30,918 --> 00:00:37,497
He was on the verge of a major one person exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York

8
00:00:37,497 --> 00:00:41,907
And I think that was only the second solo exhibiton that the museum had held.

9
00:00:41,907 --> 00:00:43,214
That's right the first was of Matisse

10
00:00:43,214 --> 00:00:45,363
And so that's quite extraordinary company

11
00:00:45,363 --> 00:00:51,264
Andy Rockefeller was involved with the founding of the museum of modern art

12
00:00:51,264 --> 00:00:54,345
he wanted Picasso and Matisse to create a large mural in the lobby

13
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:59,456
They both declined but Rivera was the third choice which is pretty extraordinary company

14
00:00:59,456 --> 00:01:03,097
This is not Rivera this is Frida

15
00:01:03,097 --> 00:01:07,990
She looks so small and diminutive next to him and so delicate

16
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,032
I'm so struck by the way she tilts her head and looks at us

17
00:01:12,032 --> 00:01:15,282
Where he looks so stocky and looks at us straight on

18
00:01:15,282 --> 00:01:17,720
The way she's really depicted him, seeing in him

19
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,102
Offering him to us as think incredibly solid figure

20
00:01:21,102 --> 00:01:24,457
And she floats in a way that he doesn't, right.

21
00:01:24,457 --> 00:01:27,973
He's so rooted those boots are so strong

22
00:01:27,973 --> 00:01:33,841
and there is something in the way that her dress is off the floor that gives her a lightness

23
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:36,131
and also the tilt of her head

24
00:01:36,131 --> 00:01:43,474
Yes and there's curving forms in that shawl that she wears and in the necklace and headband and the frills

25
00:01:43,474 --> 00:01:49,281
of the skirt. So she's got this feminine curviness to her that seems really different

26
00:01:49,281 --> 00:01:50,637
than his blockiness

27
00:01:50,637 --> 00:01:54,297
and there is a lot of symbolism in what you are talking about, in their clothing

28
00:01:54,297 --> 00:02:00,640
So she's referencing her Mexican heritage, the folkloricness

29
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,906
it's really trying to ressurect and give a sense of her pride and of the importance of that heritage

30
00:02:05,906 --> 00:02:09,818
Within this portrait. The way that they are against this very spare background

31
00:02:09,818 --> 00:02:14,321
is coming right out of the colonial Mexican artistic tradition as well

32
00:02:14,321 --> 00:02:18,340
Diego is represented with this work shirt under a suit.

33
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,324
Which is an interesting parallel because it really shows the sense of the working class

34
00:02:22,324 --> 00:02:24,631
but also a kind of seriousness

35
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:30,338
His tradition that he is coming from of the Mexican mural painters from the 1920's

36
00:02:30,338 --> 00:02:35,157
who were trying to build and artistic tradition on the Mexican revolution

37
00:02:35,157 --> 00:02:37,582
of creating art for the people

38
00:02:37,582 --> 00:02:39,489
He's depicted as a worker

39
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:42,275
I'm also struck by their hands

40
00:02:42,275 --> 00:02:44,573
Her hand is sort of light over his

41
00:02:44,573 --> 00:02:47,774
It obviously looks to me like she's letting go, it's interesting to me that he has

42
00:02:47,774 --> 00:02:51,337
got paint brushes and the palatte and this is her painting

43
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:57,140
She almost lets got and looks at us. It feels to me like she is establishing her independance

44
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:02,607
Diego is sturdy and not moving, he has got his hand there and open for her

45
00:03:02,607 --> 00:03:06,038
Bu when she tilts her head she has got a little movement

46
00:03:06,038 --> 00:03:10,683
She's the one who lifts her hand and cocks her head and looks out at us

47
00:03:10,683 --> 00:03:14,485
And if you look at the bird on top, the bird is flying with a banner

48
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:18,542
As the museum translates that to english it reads

49
00:03:18,542 --> 00:03:24,697
Here you see me; Frida Khalo with my beloved husband Diego Rivera

50
00:03:24,697 --> 00:03:31,135
I painted portrait in this beautiful city, San Francisco for our friend

51
00:03:31,135 --> 00:03:33,898
Mr. Aver Bender who was a trustee of the museum that we stand in

52
00:03:33,898 --> 00:03:37,140
It was the month of April in the year 1931
