1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,150
We're on problem 70.

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:05,410
And they still want us to do
some sequences and series.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,440
What is the n'th term in
arithmetic series below.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,800
Which means that it just
increases by a constant amount

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,500
every term.

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,940
So let's think about
it a little bit.

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,140
The first term is 3.

8
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,250
And then we increment
it by 4 each time.

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,120
Let me write all of this.

10
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,870
3, then we go to 7, then we go
to 11, and then we go to 15,

11
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,100
then we go to 19.

12
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,800
So we go to 3 and we're
adding 4 every time.

13
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,490
So you get the sense that each
term in the sequence is going

14
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:42,480
to be 4 times the n'th term.

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,860
But that doesn't
quite work out.

16
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,890
Because I've had 4 times-- if
this is the first term, 4

17
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,720
times the first term is 1.

18
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,280
And 3 is less than 1.

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,780
And then 4 times 2 is 8.

20
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,410
And 7 is less than 8.

21
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,880
And 4 times 3 is 12.

22
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,770
But this is 1 less than 12.

23
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,810
So it seems like all these are
1 less than a multiple of 4.

24
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:05,019
So the n'th term is going
to be 4n minus 1.

25
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:06,720
And that should work out.

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,110
The third term is 4 times
3, 12, minus 1 is 11.

27
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,720
And that's the third term.

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,440
So it's 4n minus 1,
which is choice D.

29
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:19,940
Next problem.

30
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,330
Problem 71.

31
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,590
Let me copy and paste it.

32
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,320
Actually, I'll copy and
paste all of them.

33
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:38,320
All right.

34
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,190
Which expression represents f
of g of x if f of x is equal

35
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:46,220
to x squared minus 1 and g of
x is equal to x plus 3?

36
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,640
So a lot of times, these
seem daunting.

37
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,500
But when you get used to it,
these become kind of fun

38
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:58,270
problems. So f of g of x means,
in f of x , everywhere

39
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,390
you see an x you have to
replace it with g of x.

40
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:11,160
So f of g of x is equal to
g of x squared minus 1.

41
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,650
Now, all I did is if I said f of
dog, wherever I see an x, I

42
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:16,220
would replace it.

43
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,820
So f of dog would be dog
squared minus 1.

44
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,920
Whenever I see an x I just
replace it with whatever I

45
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,000
input in right there.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,600
So they want to know f of g of
x , I stick a g of x there.

47
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,680
So it's going to be g of
x squared minus 1.

48
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,070
But what's g of x?

49
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,500
Well g of x is x plus 3.

50
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:36,150
So this is going to be equal to
x plus 3 squared minus 1.

51
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:42,840
Which is equal to x squared
plus 6x plus 9 minus 1.

52
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,410
Which is equal to x squared
plus 6x plus 8.

53
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,785
Which is choice B.

54
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,630
Next question.

55
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,200
Given that f of x is equal to 3x
squared minus 4 and g of x

56
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,390
is equal to 2x minus 6,
what is g of f of 2?

57
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,495
Well here, since they gave us
an actual number, so they

58
00:03:11,495 --> 00:03:14,220
didn't leave it abstract, we
could figure out what f of 2

59
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,030
is and then pop it into g.

60
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,240
So what's f of 2?

61
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,000
Yeah, you should be able to
see that color. f of 2.

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,810
Wherever you see an x, you
replace it with 2.

63
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:31,240
So that equals 3 times
2 squared minus 4.

64
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,420
Which is equal to-- 3 times
2 squared, 2 squared is

65
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,280
4 times 3 is 12.

66
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,240
Minus 4 is equal to 8.

67
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,190
So f of 2 is equal to 8.

68
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:49,620
So g of f of 2 is
equal to g of 8.

69
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,280
And what's g of 8?

70
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,850
g of 8, everywhere you see
an x, just pop in an 8.

71
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:59,850
Is equal to 2 times 8 minus 6.

72
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,270
Is equal to 16 minus 6.

73
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,820
So this is equal to 10.

74
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,670
Choice D.

75
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:11,920
Problem 73.

76
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,630
If f of x is equal to x squared
plus 2x plus 1 and g

77
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,890
of x is equal to 3 times x plus
1 squared, which is the

78
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,990
equivalent form of f
of x plus g of x?

79
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,990
So essentially they just want us
to add these two functions.

80
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:31,390
So if we say f of x plus g of
x-- let me do that. f of x--

81
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,370
and I'll do it in another
color-- plus g of x.

82
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:36,840
Well now we just add them.

83
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,780
What's f of x? f of x is x
squared-- I'll do it down

84
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,400
here-- x squared
plus 2x plus 1.

85
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,325
That's f of x.

86
00:04:45,325 --> 00:04:49,220
Then we're going to add
g of x to that.

87
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,332
Oh, I see why it's a little--
they want us-- g of x you kind

88
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,790
of have to expand this out.

89
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,290
So g of x is 3 times
x plus 1 squared.

90
00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:01,150
Well that's 3 times x squared
plus 2x plus 1.

91
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,370
But then from here we just have
to simplify this all out.

92
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,200
And I'll do that in a
third neutral color.

93
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,810
Brown color.

94
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:17,000
x squared plus 2x plus 1 plus--
distribute the 3-- 3x

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,970
squared plus 6x plus 3.

96
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,170
And now let's see, you have an
x squared and a 3x squared.

97
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:27,400
You add those together,
you get 4x squared.

98
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,270
And I have a 2x and
I have a 6x.

99
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:33,310
Add those together,
I get plus 8x.

100
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,800
And then I have a 1
and I have a 3.

101
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,350
So plus 4.

102
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,390
4x squared plus 8x plus 4.

103
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,180
And that's choice C.

104
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,590
Next problem.

105
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,840
Next page.

106
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,460
All right, let me see.

107
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,510
What do they want
us to do here?

108
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,970
A math teacher is randomly
distributing 15 rulers with

109
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,780
centimeter labels and 10 rulers

110
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,260
without centimeter labels.

111
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,360
All right.

112
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,750
What is the probably the first
ruler she hands out will have

113
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,770
centimeter labels and the second
ruler will not have

114
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,440
centimeter labels?

115
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,030
So, OK, let's think about
the first one.

116
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,120
I'll color code it.

117
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,220
So what is the probability that
the first ruler she hands

118
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,430
out will have centimeter
labels?

119
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,320
So there's a total of
25 total rulers.

120
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,100
15 with centimeters
and 10 without.

121
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,580
At least initially, there's
a total of 25 rulers.

122
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,720
And they want to know the
probability that the first

123
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,570
ruler she hands out will
have centimeter labels.

124
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,130
So 15 have centimeters.

125
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,240
So the probability
is 15 over 25.

126
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,060
That's the probability
of the first one

127
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,310
having centimeter labels.

128
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,300
That's that one.

129
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,050
But they want to know, the first
one having centimeter

130
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:10,270
labels and the second ruler not
having-- and you can't see

131
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:14,050
that highlight color-- and the
second ruler will not have it.

132
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,410
So this is-- so we're going
to have to multiply the

133
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:21,210
probability of the first ruler
times the probability that the

134
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:27,640
second, without labels, and now
this is the key-- given

135
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,550
that the first ruler
had labels.

136
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,470
Now this might all seem really
complicated with the notation

137
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,050
but when you think of it
intuitively, it should

138
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,610
hopefully make some sense.

139
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,050
I've given away-- so the first
ruler there's a 15 out of 25

140
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:46,500
chance that I've given
a ruler with labels.

141
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,150
Now on the second ruler, since
both of these things have to

142
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,720
happen, I can assume that I've
already given away the first

143
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,590
ruler having labels.

144
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,250
So how many rulers
do I have now?

145
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,190
Well I definitely have
24 rulers left.

146
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:03,340
And now, how many of these
do not have labels?

147
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,000
Well the first ruler I gave
away had a label.

148
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,950
So I still have 10 rulers that
do not have a label.

149
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,015
If you wanted to ask a similar
question, you could say what

150
00:08:14,015 --> 00:08:16,890
is the probability that the
first two ones that I hand out

151
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:17,600
have labels?

152
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,940
That would be 15 over
25 times 14 over 24.

153
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,570
Because the labels would've
been decremented

154
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,380
after the first one.

155
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,100
Because we're assuming.

156
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,370
We have to say both of
these things happen.

157
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,960
Now we're saying, OK, we're
going to have one less ruler

158
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,750
but I haven't reduced
the number of

159
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,294
rulers without labels.

160
00:08:33,294 --> 00:08:35,510
But anyway, let's just
simplify this out.

161
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:42,300
This becomes 15 times 10
divided by 25 times 24.

162
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,700
You can do a lot of canceling
so we don't have multiply--

163
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,030
let's see, divide that
by 3, get 3.

164
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,610
Divide that by 3, get 5.

165
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,660
Divide that by 5, you get 1.

166
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,910
Divide that by 5 you get 2.

167
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,730
3 times 2 is 6.

168
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,590
So this is equal to 6 over 24.

169
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,530
Which is equal to 1/4.

170
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,313
Which is choice A.

171
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,140
Next problem.

172
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,880
Let's see.

173
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:22,710
Problem 75.

174
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,320
On a certain day the chance of
rain is 80% in San Francisco

175
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,860
and 30% in Sydney.

176
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,100
Fair enough.

177
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,990
Assume that the chance of rain
in the two cities is

178
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,000
independent.

179
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,090
What is the probably that it
will not rain in either city?

180
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:41,080
So it's going to be the
probability of not rain, not

181
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:48,800
in San Francisco, times the
probability of not in Sydney.

182
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,710
Because we have to have both of
these things happening and

183
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,430
they're independent.

184
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,710
So the probabilities will
be multiplying.

185
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,460
So what's the probability
of not

186
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,480
having rain in San Francisco?

187
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,690
They gave us the chance
of having rain as 80%.

188
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,270
So the probability of not
having rain is 20%.

189
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,160
Or, I like to stick
to the fractions.

190
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,330
20% is 1/5.

191
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,830
There's a 1/5 probability
of not having rain.

192
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:13,010
What's the probability of not
having rain in Sydney?

193
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,200
It's 30%.

194
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,100
Actually, I probably should've
stayed in decimal world.

195
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:21,660
So let's say it's 20% in San
Francisco of not having rain.

196
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:25,900
The probability of Sydney of
not having rain is 1 minus

197
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:34,140
30%, or 0.7, which is a 70%
chance of not having rain.

198
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,612
And that is equal to--
2 times 7 is 14.

199
00:10:36,612 --> 00:10:39,050
We have two numbers behind
the decimal point.

200
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,760
So there's a 14% chance
that it will not

201
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,390
rain in either city.

202
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,560
And that is choice B.

203
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,880
Next problem.

204
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,220
Well actually I'm out of time.

205
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,060
See you in the next video.
