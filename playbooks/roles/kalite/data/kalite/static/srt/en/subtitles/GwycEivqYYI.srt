00:00:00,544 --> 00:00:02,698
PROBLEM: Joelle is working on a school report

2
00:00:02,698 --> 00:00:06,163
in a word processor.

3
00:00:06,163 --> 00:00:11,102
She wants to place a figure, which is 13.09 cm wide,

4
00:00:11,102 --> 00:00:13,590
so that it appears centered on the page.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,434
The width of the page is 21.59 cm.

6
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,314
How wide a margin should she leave on the left

7
00:00:20,314 --> 00:00:22,011
so that the figure is centered?"

8
00:00:22,011 --> 00:00:24,098
So, let's visualize what's going on.

9
00:00:24,098 --> 00:00:28,175
We have a page that is 21.59 cm wide.

10
00:00:28,175 --> 00:00:34,415
So, this distance right over here is 21.59 cm.

11
00:00:34,415 --> 00:00:36,812
So this right over here, that is our page.

12
00:00:36,812 --> 00:00:38,630
Let me draw the actual page.

13
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:39,504
Let me draw that in white,

14
00:00:39,504 --> 00:00:41,480
since paper tends to be white.

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,992
So this is her page.

16
00:00:45,992 --> 00:00:49,517
It’s 21.59 cm wide.

17
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:50,298
It’s just like that .

18
00:00:50,298 --> 00:00:52,263
(That’s a bit of an unusual dimension

19
00:00:52,263 --> 00:00:53,227
for a piece of paper.

20
00:00:53,227 --> 00:00:54,441
But we'll go with it.)

21
00:00:54,441 --> 00:00:55,540
And then she wants to place a figure

22
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,982
that is 13.09 cm wide in the center of the page.

23
00:00:59,982 --> 00:01:01,839
So the figure --

24
00:01:01,839 --> 00:01:04,206
I’ll do it in magenta.

25
00:01:04,206 --> 00:01:05,799
That's not magenta --

26
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,799
The figure is 13.09 cm.

27
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,578
So let’s say that this is the figure right over here.

28
00:01:11,578 --> 00:01:14,980
So this is the figure that she wants to place

29
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,984
in the middle of the page.

30
00:01:16,984 --> 00:01:24,262
So this is 13.09 cm.

31
00:01:24,262 --> 00:01:25,631
So the question is, "How wide a margin

32
00:01:25,631 --> 00:01:27,274
should she leave on the left,

33
00:01:27,274 --> 00:01:29,255
so that the figure is centered?"

34
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,729
So they're really asking,

35
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:35,067
"What should this distance be here,

36
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:37,484
so that the figure is centered?"

37
00:01:37,484 --> 00:01:39,659
And the key thing is, if the figure is centered,

38
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,309
this distance is going to be

39
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,959
the same as this distance --

40
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,843
so that the figure is right in the middle.

41
00:01:44,843 --> 00:01:47,831
Whatever this is, it's going to be the same as this.

42
00:01:47,831 --> 00:01:49,078
So one way we could think about it --

43
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:50,150
We could say, "Okay.

44
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:57,003
Let's take 13.09 cm from 21.59 cm."

45
00:01:57,003 --> 00:02:00,936
And if we do that, then we'll know how much

46
00:02:00,936 --> 00:02:04,180
left over space this plus this combined is.

47
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,364
And then, we just want to split that space in half.

48
00:02:06,364 --> 00:02:08,435
We want half of it to go on the right side,

49
00:02:08,435 --> 00:02:10,992
and we want half of it to go on the left side.

50
00:02:10,992 --> 00:02:13,558
So let's see how much the left margin

51
00:02:13,558 --> 00:02:15,771
and the right margin combined needs to be.

52
00:02:15,771 --> 00:02:18,157
And that's just 21.59 cm –

53
00:02:18,157 --> 00:02:27,376
That's just going to be 21.59 cm minus 13.09 cm.

54
00:02:27,376 --> 00:02:29,618
And this, we get to – Let’s see.

55
00:02:29,618 --> 00:02:38,139
This is 8.50 cm – which is the combined margins –

56
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:39,925
Not just the left or not just the right.

57
00:02:39,925 --> 00:02:43,906
This – the left plus the right margin – is 8.50 cm.

58
00:02:43,906 --> 00:02:47,013
This is this distance plus this distance.

59
00:02:47,013 --> 00:02:48,313
Now, if we want to figure out

60
00:02:48,313 --> 00:02:49,749
what the left margin should be –

61
00:02:49,749 --> 00:02:50,764
if we want to center it –

62
00:02:50,764 --> 00:02:52,302
well, we just want to split this evenly

63
00:02:52,302 --> 00:02:54,456
between the left and the right margin.

64
00:02:54,456 --> 00:02:56,890
So we just want to divide this by 2.

65
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,882
So if you divide 18.50 by 2 –

66
00:03:00,882 --> 00:03:02,790
(Or multiply it by 1/2, I guess.

67
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,686
That might be a little bit more obvious. Either way.)

68
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,785
So if we multiply this by 1/2,

69
00:03:08,785 --> 00:03:14,904
we are left with half of 8.50, which is 4.25 cm.

70
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:16,387
So if we want it centered,

71
00:03:16,387 --> 00:03:19,749
then this is going to be 4.25 cm.

72
00:03:19,749 --> 00:03:23,387
And, of course, this is going to be 4.25 cm, as well.

73
00:03:23,387 --> 00:03:26,138
And you see, when you add 4.25 to 4.25,

74
00:03:26,138 --> 00:03:28,032
you get 8.50 cm.

75
00:03:28,032 --> 00:03:30,311
And when you add that to 13.09,

76
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:32,555
you get the entire width of the piece of paper.

77
00:03:32,555 --> 00:03:35,082
So how wide a margin should she leave on the left?

78
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:38,682
4.25 cm.
