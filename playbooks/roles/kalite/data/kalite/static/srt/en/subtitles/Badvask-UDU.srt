1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,680
   

2
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,970
Rewrite the expression five
times 9 minus 4-- that's in

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,130
parentheses-- using the
distributive law of

4
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,980
multiplication over
subtraction.

5
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,550
Then simplify.

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,930
So let me just rewrite it.

7
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:24,830
This is going to be 5 times
9 minus 4, just like that.

8
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,100
Now, if we want to use the
distributive property, well,

9
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:27,710
you don't have to.

10
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,880
You could just evaluate
9 minus 4 and then

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,500
multiply that times 5.

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,380
But if you want to use the
distributive property, you

13
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,560
distribute the 5.

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,090
You multiply the 5 times the 9
and the 4, so you end up with

15
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:50,175
5 times 9 minus 5 times 4.

16
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,940
   

17
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,920
Notice, we distributed the 5.

18
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,810
We multiplied it times
both the 9 and the 4.

19
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,680
In the first distributive
property video, we gave you an

20
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,370
idea of why you have to
distribute the 5, why it makes

21
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,005
sense, why you don't just
multiply it by the 9.

22
00:01:06,005 --> 00:01:09,010
And we're going to verify that
it gives us the same answer as

23
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,890
if we just evaluated the 9 minus
4 first. But anyway,

24
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:13,950
what are these things?

25
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,310
So 5 times 9, that is 45.

26
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,480
So we have 45 minus--
what's 5 times 4?

27
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,970
Well, that's 20.

28
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:30,400
45 minus 20, and that is equal
to 25, so this is using the

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,970
distributive property
right here.

30
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,980
If we didn't want to use the
distributive property, if we

31
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,780
just wanted to evaluate what's
in the parentheses first, we

32
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,300
would have gotten-- let's go in
this direction-- 5 times--

33
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,890
what's 9 minus 4?

34
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,670
   

35
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,940
9 minus 4 is 5.

36
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,810
Let me do that in a
different color.

37
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,980
5 times 9 minus 4.

38
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,010
So it's 5 times 5.

39
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,460
5 times 5 is just 25,
so we get the same

40
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,630
answer either way.

41
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:00,890
This is using the distributive
law of multiplication over

42
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,930
subtraction, usually just
referred to as the

43
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,340
distributive property.

44
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,600
This is evaluating the inside
of the parentheses first and

45
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,190
then multiplying by 5.

46
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:10,534
