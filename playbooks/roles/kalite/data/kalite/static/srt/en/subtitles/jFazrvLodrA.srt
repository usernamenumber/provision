00:00:00,933 --> 00:00:02,913
In the last video on even and odd functions,

2
00:00:02,913 --> 00:00:03,956
I talked about how

3
00:00:03,956 --> 00:00:06,387
you shouldn't get confused between

4
00:00:06,387 --> 00:00:08,601
even functions and even numbers

5
00:00:08,601 --> 00:00:10,304
and odd functions and odd numbers.

6
00:00:10,304 --> 00:00:12,934
And I said that there wasn't any obvious connection

7
00:00:12,934 --> 00:00:15,551
between the words 'even function'

8
00:00:15,551 --> 00:00:17,702
and our notion of even numbers,

9
00:00:17,702 --> 00:00:18,755
or any connection between

10
00:00:18,755 --> 00:00:20,921
odd functions and odd numbers.

11
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:22,177
And, I was wrong!

12
00:00:22,177 --> 00:00:25,133
There actually is a relatively obvious connection

13
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:28,909
and this was pointed out by the youtube user Nothias.

14
00:00:28,909 --> 00:00:29,669
And the connection,

15
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:31,558
I almost explicity did it

16
00:00:31,558 --> 00:00:32,671
in the last example.

17
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:33,933
When I showed an even function,

18
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:36,218
I showed you x^2.

19
00:00:36,218 --> 00:00:37,779
When I showed you an odd function,

20
00:00:37,779 --> 00:00:40,180
I showed you x^3.

21
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,503
When I wanted to show you another odd function,

22
00:00:42,503 --> 00:00:49,422
I showed you y = x, or f(x) = x^1.

23
00:00:49,422 --> 00:00:51,618
And so you might start to notice

24
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:53,028
what Nothias pointed out

25
00:00:53,028 --> 00:00:57,596
is that these [archetypal], or these good examples,

26
00:00:57,596 --> 00:00:58,494
or these simple examples

27
00:00:58,494 --> 00:00:59,687
of even and odd functions

28
00:00:59,687 --> 00:01:04,775
when I just have a simple 'x' raised to some power.

29
00:01:05,606 --> 00:01:07,593
Whether the power is even or odd

30
00:01:09,578 --> 00:01:10,612
is going to tell you

31
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,270
whether the function is even or odd.

32
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,400
And you want to be very careful here.

33
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,109
Not all even or odd functions

34
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,553
even have exponents in them!

35
00:01:18,553 --> 00:01:20,292
They could be trigonometric functions;

36
00:01:20,292 --> 00:01:22,475
they might be some other type of wacky function.

37
00:01:22,475 --> 00:01:24,917
You don't have to have exponents,

38
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:25,954
it's just that these exponents

39
00:01:25,954 --> 00:01:28,375
are probably where the motivation

40
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:29,267
for calling these

41
00:01:29,267 --> 00:01:31,930
even functions and odd functions came from.

42
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,353
And let me just be clear:

43
00:01:33,353 --> 00:01:35,134
it's not just also any polynomial,

44
00:01:35,134 --> 00:01:36,559
and even in the last video,

45
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:38,323
when we had x^3 + 1,

46
00:01:38,323 --> 00:01:39,343
this was neither

47
00:01:39,343 --> 00:01:40,058
even [nor] odd.

48
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,635
But if you just have the pure

49
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:43,045
x raised to some power,

50
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:44,838
then all of a sudden,

51
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:50,318
the motivations for calling [them] even and odd

52
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,665
start to make sense.

53
00:01:51,665 --> 00:01:56,915
Because if I have f(x) = x^1,

54
00:01:56,915 --> 00:01:59,019
that's the same thing as y = x.

55
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:00,813
This is odd!

56
00:02:00,813 --> 00:02:05,011
And it kind of jells with the name

57
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:06,512
because we're also raising it

58
00:02:06,512 --> 00:02:08,214
to an odd power.

59
00:02:08,214 --> 00:02:11,852
If we have f(x) = x^2,

60
00:02:11,852 --> 00:02:12,938
we saw in the previous video

61
00:02:12,938 --> 00:02:14,530
[that] this is even.

62
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,955
And it kind of jells with the idea

63
00:02:15,955 --> 00:02:18,106
that we're raising it to an even power.

64
00:02:18,106 --> 00:02:18,865
I could keep going.

65
00:02:18,865 --> 00:02:20,365
If it [were] x^3,

66
00:02:20,365 --> 00:02:21,418
that is odd.

67
00:02:21,418 --> 00:02:22,501
I could keep going.

68
00:02:25,147 --> 00:02:27,373
Let me write it this way:

69
00:02:27,373 --> 00:02:31,762
In general, if you have f(x) = x^n,

70
00:02:31,762 --> 00:02:41,595
then this is odd if 'n' is odd,

71
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:49,237
and this is an even function if 'n' is even.

72
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:50,908
And I want to make it very clear here.

73
00:02:50,908 --> 00:02:52,534
The whole point of this video

74
00:02:52,534 --> 00:02:54,591
is to clarify the motivation

75
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,470
for calling them even or odd functions.

76
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,667
Not all even functions

77
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:02,333
are going to be of this form here,

78
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,252
where it's x raised to some even power,

79
00:03:04,252 --> 00:03:06,713
and not all odd functions are going to be.

80
00:03:06,713 --> 00:03:08,569
And I also don't want you to be confused

81
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:09,593
that if I have something like

82
00:03:09,593 --> 00:03:12,626
x^3 then I have other stuff past that,

83
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,391
then you say," oh, x^3, that's an odd [function]!"

84
00:03:14,391 --> 00:03:16,327
But this is not an odd function.

85
00:03:16,327 --> 00:03:19,933
Just when it's just a pure strip-down

86
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,606
x^3 or x^1,

87
00:03:21,606 --> 00:03:23,231
can you really make that statement.

88
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:24,347
But that really is probably

89
00:03:24,347 --> 00:03:26,077
where the motivation comes

90
00:03:26,077 --> 00:03:28,571
for naming them even or odd functions.

91
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:30,274
And then the other symmetric functions,

92
00:03:30,274 --> 00:03:35,909
even if they don't involve an exponent,

93
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:37,667
maybe this is some type of trigonometric function,

94
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:39,916
you're calling it even because

95
00:03:41,962 --> 00:03:43,973
it has the same type of symmetry

96
00:03:45,912 --> 00:03:48,764
as say x^2, or x to an even power.

97
00:03:48,764 --> 00:03:49,578
So you kind of group them

98
00:03:49,578 --> 00:03:51,342
all together as even functions.

99
00:03:51,342 --> 00:03:52,270
And then all of these,

100
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,710
even though this may or may not

101
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,531
have an exponent in it,

102
00:03:54,531 --> 00:03:56,495
it has the same type of symmetries

103
00:03:56,495 --> 00:03:59,005
as x raised to an odd power.

104
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,267
So that's why call them odd functions.

105
00:04:01,267 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, thank you Nothias for pointing that out.
