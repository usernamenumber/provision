1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,904
Say stock XYZ is trading at 31 dollars.

2
00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:08,104
We have a call option on XYZ with a $35 strike price.

3
00:00:08,104 --> 00:00:10,104
It's trading at $8.

4
00:00:10,104 --> 00:00:14,970
We have a put option on XYZ with a $35 strike price,

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:15,971
they have the same strike price,

6
00:00:15,971 --> 00:00:18,970
trading at $12, and they both have the same

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,239
expiration over here,

8
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:24,511
and finally there's a bond, unrelated to XYZ.

9
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:27,703
It's going to be a risk free bond, like a treasury bill

10
00:00:27,703 --> 00:00:31,037
worth $35 at option expiration

11
00:00:31,037 --> 00:00:34,844
and you can buy it right now at $30.

12
00:00:34,844 --> 00:00:38,637
The reason you can get it for less is you're going

13
00:00:38,637 --> 00:00:41,177
to get $35 in the future at option expiration

14
00:00:41,177 --> 00:00:44,512
so you're essentially getting interest on that bond

15
00:00:44,512 --> 00:00:48,011
So with these numbers, is there a way to make

16
00:00:48,011 --> 00:00:49,437
risk-free money?

17
00:00:49,437 --> 00:00:50,843
To think about that, let's think about

18
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:53,510
the put-call parity. We learned

19
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,971
that a stock plus a put at a given strike price

20
00:00:57,971 --> 00:01:00,437
the put is a put on that stock

21
00:01:00,437 --> 00:01:03,771
is equal to, is going to have the same value

22
00:01:03,771 --> 00:01:08,344
at expiration as a call with the same strike price

23
00:01:08,344 --> 00:01:10,370
with the same underlying stock

24
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,511
plus a bond, a risk-free bond, that's going

25
00:01:14,511 --> 00:01:17,304
to be worth that strike price at the expiration

26
00:01:17,304 --> 00:01:18,928
of these two options.

27
00:01:18,928 --> 00:01:22,927
Since this is going to have the same value,

28
00:01:22,927 --> 00:01:23,771
the same payoff,

29
00:01:23,771 --> 00:01:27,177
in any circumstance, as this at expiration

30
00:01:27,177 --> 00:01:29,770
they really should be worth the same thing

31
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,437
but when you look at the numbers over here

32
00:01:31,437 --> 00:01:32,903
let's see if that works out.

33
00:01:32,903 --> 00:01:37,251
The stock is trading at $31

34
00:01:37,282 --> 00:01:43,152
The put option is trading at $12.

35
00:01:43,182 --> 00:01:46,219
On the left-hand side, right now,

36
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:51,551
it's trading at $43.

37
00:01:51,551 --> 00:01:55,171
On the right-hand side, the call option

38
00:01:55,171 --> 00:02:01,753
is trading at $8. And the bond is trading at $30.

39
00:02:01,753 --> 00:02:08,832
So this combination is trading at $38.

40
00:02:08,832 --> 00:02:11,240
So even though they have the exact same payoff

41
00:02:11,286 --> 00:02:15,961
at option expiration, the call plus the bond

42
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:18,127
is cheaper than the stock plus the put.

43
00:02:18,127 --> 00:02:20,376
So you have an aribtrage opportunity

44
00:02:20,376 --> 00:02:23,753
an opportunity to make profit from a discrepancy

45
00:02:23,753 --> 00:02:26,553
in price from two things that are essentially equal

46
00:02:26,553 --> 00:02:28,210
and what you always want to do

47
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:34,152
is buy the cheaper thing and you want to sell

48
00:02:34,152 --> 00:02:36,219
the more expensive thing. Especially when they

49
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:38,219
are the same thing, when they are going

50
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:40,485
to have the exact same payoff in the future.

51
00:02:40,485 --> 00:02:43,019
So you want to sell this.

52
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,020
So, buying is pretty straightforward.

53
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,885
What does it mean to sell this over here?

54
00:02:46,885 --> 00:02:52,845
Well, you could short the stock,

55
00:02:52,857 --> 00:02:54,472
that's essentially you're selling the stock,

56
00:02:54,472 --> 00:02:55,361
and then you would, essentially you are

57
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,971
shorting a put option. Another way to

58
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:03,038
think of it: you could write a put option.

59
00:03:03,038 --> 00:03:09,020
So you would short the stock plus write a put.

60
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,370
So what would happen there?

61
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,105
Shorting the stock, you're borrowing the stock

62
00:03:13,105 --> 00:03:17,971
and selling it. You're going to get $31

63
00:03:17,971 --> 00:03:19,855
from shorting the stock.

64
00:03:19,855 --> 00:03:22,636
And writing the put, literally means you are creating

65
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:24,904
a put option and selling it to someone else.

66
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:26,854
And so you're going to get $12 for that.

67
00:03:26,854 --> 00:03:28,970
So you're going to get your $43.

68
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,477
And you're going to buy the call and the bond.

69
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,937
You're going to spend $8 on the call

70
00:03:33,937 --> 00:03:38,589
and $30 on the bond, you're going to spend $38.

71
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:41,438
And you're going to make a profit of $5.

72
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:43,839
We're going to see in the next video: you make

73
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:46,187
this profit up front, and no matter what happens

74
00:03:46,187 --> 00:03:48,560
to the stock price going forward,

75
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,668
you're able to arrange things so everything else

76
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:55,514
cancels out and you can just keep your $5.
