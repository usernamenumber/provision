1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,270
In the last video, we showed
that if you had a line, which

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:09,020
we'll call a directrix--
we draw the directrix.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,780
That's our directrix and it has
the equation y is equal to k.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,450
And you have a point, that's
our focus, and it's the

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,510
coordinate a comma b.

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,910
-- that the locus of all points in
the xy plane that are

7
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:27,530
equidistant to this focus and
this directrix has a shape that

8
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,520
looks something-- we know that
this was a point-- that

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,480
looks something like this.

10
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,830
And the actually equation, we
actually just took an arbitrary

11
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:40,650
xy in the coordinate plane, and
we said that xy has to satisfy

12
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,900
the condition that its distance
to this focus is equal to--

13
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,460
that this distance right here
is equal to this distance here.

14
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,170
And we set that up using the
distance formula to here, and

15
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,710
then setting that equal to the
distance to the line,

16
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,670
to the directrix.

17
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,800
And then we did a bunch of
algebra and we got this

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,440
equation right here.

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,270
For all of the points in the xy
plane that satisfy the

20
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,870
conditions that its distance to
the focus is equal to the

21
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,360
distance to this line.

22
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,040
And we hopefully satisfied
ourselves that this is

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,830
in fact a parabola.

24
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,100
And although it looks a little
bit hairier than most parabolas

25
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,690
we see, I think if you look
at it closely, you'll realize

26
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:18,820
that it is indeed a parabola.

27
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,040
For example, the classic
parabola is y is

28
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,050
equal to x squared.

29
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,420
How is this the same
thing as this?

30
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,320
Well in this case, this
coefficient out here

31
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,530
is just equal to 1.

32
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:42,410
So in this case, 1 over 2 b
minus k is equal to 1, right?

33
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,160
Let me delete that little
thing there, because it

34
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,900
looks like a squared.

35
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,790
All right, the coefficient
in front of the x squared

36
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,950
term is equal to a 1.

37
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,940
What is a equal to?

38
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:57,780
Well this is the same
thing-- actually, let

39
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,760
me rewrite it that way.

40
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:05,520
I could rewrite this equation
right here as y minus 0 is

41
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,320
equal to 1 times x
minus 0 squared.

42
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,070
And now hopefully you see that
this has the same pattern as

43
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,520
this, although the y's and the
x's are just sitting

44
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,390
on different sides
of the equation.

45
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,420
So here you see that the 1/2
over b minus k, that's the

46
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,970
coefficient in front of the
x minus a squared term.

47
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,290
So that's where we got that
that has to be equal to 1.

48
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:34,470
a has to be equal to
0 in this situation.

49
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,840
This curve right here is equal
to x squared, y is equal

50
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,040
to x squared, a is 0.

51
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,650
And then b plus k over 2, this
is going to be equal to that.

52
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,235
And keep in mind, I actually
swapped the left and

53
00:02:52,235 --> 00:02:53,350
the right hand sides.

54
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,050
But this is y minus something,
this is y minus 0.

55
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,120
So this something has
to be equal to 0.

56
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,640
So you get b plus k
over 2 is equal to 0.

57
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,200
And now we should be able to
use this information to figure

58
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,660
out the actual coordinates of
the focus and the directrix of

59
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,495
what I would call the classic
parabola, y is equal

60
00:03:17,495 --> 00:03:18,540
to x squared.

61
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,500
So keep in mind what we did.

62
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,930
In the last video, we said what
is the equation of the line

63
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,740
that is equidistant between
this focus and this directrix?

64
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,010
And we got this equation,
which we said, hey,

65
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,070
that's a parabola.

66
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,530
Now we're going the
other way around.

67
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,350
We say we have a parabola, and
we're saying that this parabola

68
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:40,580
is the set of all points that's
equidistant between some

69
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,530
focus and some directrix.

70
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,240
What is that focus and
that directrix for this

71
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,410
particular parabola?

72
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,750
That's what we're trying to do.

73
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,640
And the way we did that was, we
pattern matched this formula to

74
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,800
this one, to essentially set up
these variables, which

75
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,620
essentially define a focus
and a directrix, right?

76
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:05,290
b is the y-coordinate of the
focus, k defines the horizontal

77
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,290
line of the directrix.

78
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,620
So if we can solve for b and
k, we know what the focus

79
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,390
and the directrix are.

80
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,100
And for a, although
a is pretty easy.

81
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,240
So let's do that.

82
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,500
So if we know that 1 over 2
b minus k is equal to 1--

83
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,460
let me do that over here.

84
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,190
I'm going to do it in
particular for this case right

85
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,090
here, but you don't want to do
that every time, so then we'll

86
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,760
do a more general formula that
we can just plug in next time

87
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,430
you see a new parabola.

88
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:33,320
So if we multiply both sides of
this equation by 2 b minus k,

89
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:39,340
you get 1 is equal to
2 times b minus k.

90
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:44,590
Actually I should redivide both
sides by 2, so you get 1/2

91
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:49,110
is equal to b minus k.

92
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,120
Fair enough.

93
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,420
Let's see, this equation
right here, b plus k

94
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,310
over 2 is equal to 0.

95
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,940
That means that b plus k
must be equal to 0, right?

96
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,610
This numerator has
to be equal to 0.

97
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,320
So let me write that down.

98
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,900
b plus k is equal to 0.

99
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,710
Two linear equations
of to unknowns.

100
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,590
Let's add them up.

101
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:12,520
The k's cancel out.

102
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,290
You get 2b is equal to 1/2.

103
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:21,500
Divide both sides by 2, you
get b is equal to 1/4.

104
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,180
And now what's k?

105
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,720
Well, we can just
resubstitute back.

106
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,790
Let's use this equation.

107
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:31,080
We get 0 is equal
to 1/4 plus k.

108
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,060
You can figure that out by
inspection, but you can

109
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,720
subtract 1/4 from both sides.

110
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,540
So this tells us that k
is equal to minus 1/4.

111
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,690
So let's draw this.

112
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:45,660
So if this is my coordinate
axis-- I'll do it in

113
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,010
a different color.

114
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,940
That's the x-axis,
that's the y-axis.

115
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,820
We're dealing with y is equal
to x squared, which you should

116
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,220
hopefully be reasonably
familiar with at this point.

117
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,430
It's kind of the classic
U-shaped parabola that

118
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,720
looks just like that.

119
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,350
Let me write that down.

120
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:08,580
This is y is equal to x
squared, which we could have

121
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:15,690
rewritten as y minus 0 is equal
to 1 times x minus 0 squared.

122
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,200
Same thing, that's this line.

123
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,810
It's equidistant from a focus
and a directrix, where

124
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,040
this is the focus.

125
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,330
And how do I know that the
focus is right there, instead

126
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,730
of right here or right there?

127
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,530
Well one, you could kind
of think about it.

128
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:33,480
But the other thing to realize
is, what is the vertex

129
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,080
of this parabola?

130
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,940
And I think we've gone
over that already.

131
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:40,206
But the vertex are the
coordinates given by this

132
00:06:40,206 --> 00:06:42,210
x value and this y value.

133
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:46,290
Or what x values make this
whole term 0 and make

134
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,060
this whole term 0?

135
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,140
And that's essentially 0,0.

136
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,780
So this is the vertex
of this parabola.

137
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,930
This is the vertex,
0,0 is the vertex.

138
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,560
I'll say v for vertex.

139
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,560
In an upward opening parabola,
you can view that as

140
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,190
the minimum point.

141
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,820
If it was a downward opening,
it would be the topmost

142
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,820
point, or the maximum point.

143
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,910
That's the vertex.

144
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:11,380
And we saw from when we solved
this, when we just did our

145
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:17,620
pattern matching, that the
x-coordinate of our focus is

146
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,400
equivalent to, if we just
pattern match right here, x

147
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,000
minus a squared, here you
have x minus 0 squared.

148
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,720
This is always going to
be the same as this.

149
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:34,220
So the x-coordinate of our
focus is always going to

150
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,830
be the same thing as the
x-coordinate of our vertex.

151
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:40,050
So we figured out that
a was equal to 0.

152
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:44,290
So the coordinate here is
0, and then what's b?

153
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,840
This was the coordinate 0,b.

154
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:52,410
We figured out that b is
equal to 1/4, 0, 1/4.

155
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:57,270
And then the directrix is
the line y is equal to k.

156
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,500
In this case, we figured out
k is equal to minus 1/4.

157
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,670
So our directrix is going
to be right down here.

158
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,990
Right down here, like that.

159
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,960
And it's going to be line
y is equal to minus 1/4.

160
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,960
And that first of all
looks about right.

161
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,600
And it also gels
with what we know.

162
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,130
Because this point right here,
our vertex, is equidistant,

163
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:22,390
it's 1/4 below our focus and
it's 1/4 above our directrix.

164
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,810
So at least that little
reality check holds.

165
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,900
But it's was a particular
circumstance, and you don't

166
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,270
want to have to go through this
whole situation every time you

167
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:35,910
have to figure out the focus or
the directrix of a parabola.

168
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:38,850
So let's see if we can come up
with a more general solution.

169
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,165
And actually what I'm
going to do is, I'm going

170
00:08:40,165 --> 00:08:41,700
to erase all of this.

171
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:46,650
Just because I want to reuse
that, and I haven't committed

172
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,924
that formula to heart yet.

173
00:08:48,924 --> 00:08:52,050
Let me erase all of this,
and erase all the work

174
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:52,975
we did down here.

175
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:56,990
So let's do a general form.

176
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:02,480
And actually, I've abused this
so much, let me rewrite it.

177
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,390
So I'll put the y's on the
left hand side, instead

178
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,950
of keep telling you that
I've switched them.

179
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:13,030
So this is the same thing as--
I'll do it in-- the color

180
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,650
choosing is the hard part.

181
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:17,730
I'll do it in this
light, off-white color.

182
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:27,790
So you get y minus b plus k
over 2 is equal to 1 over 2

183
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:34,510
times b minus k, times
x minus a squared.

184
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:40,000
This is the locus of all points
that are between the directrix,

185
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,520
y is equal to k-- well, they're
equidistant to the directrix,

186
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,720
y is equal to k, and
the focus a comma b.

187
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,270
So let's say that I
have a parabola.

188
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,080
And I'm going to try to
use different letters, so

189
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,210
we don't get confused.

190
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:01,240
I give you the
parabola y minus y1.

191
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:08,850
And let's say this parabola
has a vertex at x1 comma y1.

192
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,050
So this parabola I'm drawing
has a vertex right there.

193
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:16,710
So its formula will be y minus
y1 is equal to some constant,

194
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,890
let's make that a capital A.

195
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,170
This capital A is different
than that lowercase a.

196
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,380
This is what I was going to
embark on in the previous

197
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:26,260
video, and then I realized that
I was trying to load that video

198
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,240
up too much and probably
confusing you.

199
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,180
So some constant factor, some
type of scaling factor, times

200
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,780
x minus the x value
of our vertex.

201
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,930
So x1, all of that, squared.

202
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,090
So if you're given this
parabola, or if you can get a

203
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:48,140
parabola to this form, how do
you figure out the a's, the

204
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,920
b's, and the k's so you know
the coordinates of the

205
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,160
directrix and the focus?

206
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,980
So the easy thing is to figure
out a, because you just

207
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,500
do a pattern match.

208
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,480
This is going to
be equal to that.

209
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,040
So you know that a
is equal to x1.

210
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,910
So the x-coordinate of our
focus is the same as the

211
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,250
x-coordinate of our vertex.

212
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,710
You can pattern match that this
scaling factor right here is

213
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:16,870
going to be the same thing
as this 1 over 2 b minus k.

214
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,860
So let's write that down.

215
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:26,450
A is equal to 1
over 2 b minus k.

216
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:31,510
And then we have,
finally, this.

217
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,520
Let me do another color.

218
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,800
I'll do a magenta.

219
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,930
The b plus k over 2, we
have y minus that thing.

220
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,220
We have y minus y1.

221
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,840
So that's going to
be equal to y1.

222
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:48,350
So you have y1 is equal
to b plus k over 2.

223
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,520
And now we have two equations
with two unknowns.

224
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,135
Remember, this is
going to be a given.

225
00:11:52,135 --> 00:11:55,160
The A is going to be given, and
the y1 is going to be given.

226
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,400
So now we can solve for
b and k in terms of the

227
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,360
numbers that we have.

228
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,000
So let's see if we can do that.

229
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,290
So if we multiply both sides of
this equation times b minus k,

230
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:11,480
you get b minus k times
A is equal to 1/2.

231
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,220
Divide both sides by A,
you get b minus k is

232
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,260
equal to 1 over 2A.

233
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,040
And on the right hand side,
let's use this other

234
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,840
formula right here.

235
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,800
If we multiply both sides by
2-- I'll use a different

236
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:31,010
color-- you get 2 times
y1 is equal to b plus k.

237
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,470
Two equations with
two unknowns.

238
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,000
Let's take this and bring it
down here, so you get b plus

239
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,510
k is equal to 2 times y1.

240
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:46,400
And so you add them, and you
get 2b is equal to-- the k's

241
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,080
cancel out; I'm just adding
these two equations--

242
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:55,570
1 over 2A plus 2 y1.

243
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,980
Or b-- which is,
remember, what was b?

244
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,250
That was the y-coordinate of
our focus-- is equal to, divide

245
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:08,680
everything by 2, is equal
to 1 over 4A plus y1.

246
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,380
Which is interesting.

247
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:14,910
It tells us that we take the
y-coordinate of our vertex

248
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,980
and we add 1 over 4A to it.

249
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,700
Which is exactly what
happened last time, right?

250
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,210
I actually erased what
I did last time.

251
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,980
But last time, when we
had y equal x squared,

252
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,830
this value was 0.

253
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,040
The scaling factor was 1.

254
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,090
So we saw that the y-coordinate
of our focus was 1/4.

255
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,730
So this is gelling
with what we know.

256
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,710
So that's our b.

257
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:42,660
And let's see if we
can solve back for k.

258
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:47,560
So we know that--
let's do it up here.

259
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:52,580
We know that 2 y1 is equal
to b, which is 1 over

260
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:57,360
4A plus y1 plus k.

261
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,360
We can subtract y1 from both
sides, so this goes away and

262
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,090
we just have a y1 there.

263
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:06,640
Subtract 1 over 4A from both
sides and you get y1 minus

264
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,830
1 over 4A is equal to k.

265
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,670
So then we are done.

266
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,550
So this is interesting.

267
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,640
Right now these might look
a little, these little

268
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,650
hairy formulas.

269
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,870
But if we actually graph it,
I think they'll become a

270
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,720
little bit more intuitive.

271
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:29,620
So once again, we had the
parabola y minus y1 is equal to

272
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:34,200
A times x minus x1 squared.

273
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,950
And so the graph of that
parabola will look

274
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:37,740
something like this.

275
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,800
I don't know where it is
relative to the x- and y-axis.

276
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,500
It will look
something like this.

277
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,690
It'll be this U shape.

278
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:49,120
It could actually be downward
pointing, but I'll just assume

279
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,490
an upward pointing
parabola for now.

280
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,110
That's this formula.

281
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:59,490
Its vertex, right there,
its vertex is the

282
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:02,940
point x1 comma y1.

283
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,140
Right?

284
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,660
What y value makes this
expression equal 0?

285
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,430
It's y1.

286
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:07,910
What x value makes
that equal 0?

287
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,140
It's x1.

288
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,090
Now notice, what is
this directrix?

289
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:19,080
It's the line ok, y equal to
k, but it's 1/4 less than

290
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,310
this value right here.

291
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:24,410
So you literally just go down
1/4-- not just 1/4, 1/4

292
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,060
times this scaling factor.

293
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,720
So it's 1/4 A.

294
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,760
This distance is 1/4 A.

295
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,215
And then you get your
directrix, right?

296
00:15:33,215 --> 00:15:37,900
It's y1 minus 1/4 A is
equal to k. y1 minus

297
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,550
1/4 A is equal to k.

298
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,270
Or 1 over 4A.

299
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:48,900
So your directrix is
going to be right there.

300
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,600
Let me write this.

301
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,070
It's y is equal to y1,
which is just this

302
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,290
level, minus 1 over 4A.

303
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,310
But this is the intuitive part.

304
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:05,250
Just remember, you're going
1 over 4A below the vertex.

305
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:09,040
And then the focal point, the x
value of the focal point is

306
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,040
going to be x1, the same as
the x value of the vertex.

307
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,890
And then the y value is
just b, and we just go

308
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,950
1 over 4A above it.

309
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:20,420
Which makes sense because we
need to be equidistant from

310
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,060
the directrix and the focus.

311
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:26,070
So this is y1 plus 1 over 4A.

312
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:30,620
But the intuitive part is, we
just took 1 over 4A above it.

313
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,180
So in general, if I gave
you-- so just think

314
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:33,930
about this a second.

315
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:37,290
If I gave you an equation,
an arbitrary equation now.

316
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:49,100
Say, y minus 1 is equal to 2
times x minus 3 squared, we can

317
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:54,700
graph this and draw the focus
fairly-- and actually

318
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,580
it's foci, if there was
more than one focus.

319
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,540
Let's see, that's the
x-axis, that's the y-axis.

320
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,930
Where's its vertex?

321
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:05,200
The vertex is at the
point 3 comma 1.

322
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,110
So we go 1, 2, 3 comma 1.

323
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,690
So that's its vertex.

324
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,320
It's an upward opening
parabola, because this

325
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,790
is a positive number.

326
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,060
Actually, we don't even
have to know that.

327
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,210
If you just draw the focus and
the directrix, you might be

328
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,970
able to figure that out.

329
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,900
But where's the focus point?

330
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:25,960
The focal point is going to be
1 over 4A above this point.

331
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:30,740
So 1 over 4 times 2
is equal to 1/8.

332
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,340
So the focal point is
going to be really close.

333
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,340
It's going to be right up here.

334
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,210
It's going to be 1/8
above our vertex.

335
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,970
And then our directrix is
going to be 1/8 below it.

336
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,130
So it's going to
be right there.

337
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,000
The directrix is going
to look like this.

338
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,810
The directrix is going
to be there, the

339
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,160
focal point is there.

340
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,280
And then the graph of this
parabola is going to look

341
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,090
something like this.

342
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,050
So anyway, hopefully I didn't
confuse you too much.

343
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:01,580
And the whole point of doing
all of this is just to realize

344
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,600
that it's pretty easy to find
the focus and the directrix of

345
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,360
a parabola if you have its
equation in this form.

346
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,600
You just take whatever is
multiplying times the x minus

347
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,570
whatever squared term.

348
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:18,270
And you essentially divide
1 by 4 times this value.

349
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:21,355
And then you know the distance
from the vertex to the focus,

350
00:18:21,355 --> 00:18:24,210
and you know the distance from
the vertex to the directrix,

351
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,530
and you're all done.

352
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,450
