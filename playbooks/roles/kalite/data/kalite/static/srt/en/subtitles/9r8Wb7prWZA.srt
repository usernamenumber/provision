1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,100
We're on problem 70.

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:17,350
If x plus 5 is greater than 2,and x minus 3 is less than 7,

3
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,380
the value of x must be between which of the following pairs

4
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,240
of numbers? Well for this top one,

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,990
let's just subtract 5 from both sides of this equation.

6
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,150
If you subtract 5 from both sides,you get x is greater than,

7
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,430
what's 2 minus 5,x is greater than minus 3.

8
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,160
For this bottom one,

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,200
let's add four to both sides of the equation.

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,890
So x minus 3--

11
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,060
sorry,let's add 3 to both sides of this equation.

12
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:45,380
So x minus 3 plus 3,that's x,is less than,what's 7 plus 3?

13
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:49,880
10. So x is greater than minus 3--

14
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,110
I just wrote this the other way around--

15
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,320
and it's less than 10.

16
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,410
So that's A.

17
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,910
Problem 71,a gym class can be divided into 8 teams

18
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,820
with an equal number of players on each team--

19
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,610
8,that means you get an equal number--

20
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,110
or into 12 teams with an equal number on each team.

21
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:20,960
Fair enough.

22
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,770
What is the lowest possible number of students in the class?

23
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,760
So essentially it's saying,that the number of students

24
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,450
in the classes is divisible by both 8 and 12.

25
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,660
So what they want to know is,what's the smallest number

26
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,910
that's divisible by both 8 and 12.

27
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,290
That's the least common multiple of 8 and 12.

28
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,350
That might ring a bell from middle school.

29
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,070
So what's the smallest number that's divisible by 8 and 12?

30
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,460
So let's think about 8's multiples. 8 is indivisible by 12.

31
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,810
16 is indivisible by 12. What about 24?

32
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,250
Well yeah,sure,24 is divisible by 12.

33
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,580
So the least common multiple is 24,which is B.

34
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:58,030
Clearly you can divide a gym class into 3 groups of 8,

35
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:03,680
or 2 groups of 12. 72.

36
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,180
At least 2/3 of the 40 members of a committee

37
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,870
must vote in favor of a resolution for it to pass.

38
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,360
What is the greatest number of members who could vote against

39
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,290
the resolution and still have it pass?

40
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,130
So essentially they're saying,what is the least number

41
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,340
that we need to have it pass,and then 40 minus that is the

42
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,010
greatest number that could vote against it.

43
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,220
So we have to have at least 2/3 of 40.

44
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:49,740
So what's 2/3 times 40? Well that's equal to 80/3.

45
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,790
That's 3 goes into 80,let's figure it out.

46
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:59,140
3 goes into 8 2 times. 2 times 3 is 6,20.

47
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,720
3 goes into 20 6 times. 6 times 3 is 18.

48
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,340
You bring down a 2 and then a 0.

49
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,810
So it's going to just keep repeating.

50
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,520
So you have to have at least 26.6 people vote for it.

51
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,950
But clearly you can't have a 0.6 person vote for it.

52
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,330
26 people isn't going to be good enough.

53
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,090
So you need at least 27 people.

54
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,760
So if 27 are going to vote for,

55
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,950
how many going to vote against?

56
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:37,620
Well that means 40 minus 27,that means 13 against,which is E.

57
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,980
That is the greatest number.

58
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,050
Because if a larger number voted against it,

59
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:47,110
you would have less people voting for it. Problem 73.

60
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,530
In the Johnson's monthly budget,

61
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,510
the dollar amounts allocated to household expenses,food--

62
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,790
so I'll say h for household expenses,f for food--

63
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:09,230
and miscellaneous items,are in the ratio of 5:2:1--

64
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:13,310
fair enough-- respectively. If the total amount

65
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:17,580
allocated to these three categories is $1,800,

66
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,080
so $1,800 is the total,

67
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,930
what is the amount allocated to food?

68
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,510
So we could view it this way.

69
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,410
So food is going to be twice times miscellaneous,

70
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,680
and household items is going to be equal to

71
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,860
5 times the miscellaneous.

72
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:45,340
So we could say that household plus food plus miscellaneous

73
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,620
is going to be equal to $1,800 This ratio tells us that

74
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,190
food is 2 times miscellaneous,

75
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,300
household is 5 times miscellaneous.

76
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,830
So let's just substitute that in.

77
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,410
5 times miscellaneous plus 2 times miscellaneous

78
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,290
plus miscellaneous is equal to $1,800

79
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,480
Let's see,5 plus 2 is 7 plus 1 is 8.

80
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,460
8 times miscellaneous is equal to $1,800

81
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,010
So m is equal to $1,800 over 8.

82
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:16,030
Let's see,what does that turn into?

83
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:24,760
That is equal to 900 over 4,which is equal to 450 over 2.

84
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,290
That's how my brain works,I have to go in steps.

85
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:33,440
What's 450 divided by 2? That's 225. That's miscellaneous.

86
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,520
They want to know how much is allocated to food.

87
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,210
Well,food is 2 times miscellaneous.

88
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:47,030
So 2 times 225 is equal to,we're back at 450.

89
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,680
And that is choice D.

90
00:05:51,970 --> 00:06:00,500
Problem 74. There are 4 more women than men

91
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,880
on Centerville's Board of Education.

92
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,100
So 4 more women,so women is equal to men plus 4.

93
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,300
If there are 10 members on the board,how many are women?

94
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,620
So we know that men plus women is equal to 10.

95
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,590
We want to solve for women.

96
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,730
So let me solve for men here,then substitute there.

97
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,710
So you get men is equal to 10 minus the women.

98
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,660
We could substitute that back there.

99
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,850
We get women is equal to m,or the men,

100
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:38,010
which we just figured out is 10 minus the women plus 4.

101
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,780
My brain was jumping ahead. So let's add w to both sides.

102
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:51,180
So you get 2w is equal to 10 plus 4,which is equal to 14.

103
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,060
w is equal to 7.

104
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,990
There are seven women on the board,so that's D.

105
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,620
Problem 75.

106
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,230
After this video,I think I'm going to call it for a night

107
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,540
and go watch a movie or something. 75.

108
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:11,250
Leona bought a 1 year $10,000 certificate of deposit

109
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,060
that pays interest at an annual rate of 8%.

110
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:21,240
So 1 year,$10,000,and it paid a rate of 8%.

111
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,690
Compounded semi-annually,what was the total amount of

112
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,830
interest paid on the certificate at maturity?

113
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,710
So when you say compound semi-annually,

114
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:37,470
that means you collect half of the interest every half year.

115
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,890
That's something I don't know if the GMAT,

116
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,050
they should be expecting you to know that,

117
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,190
it's something you probably would learn in business school.

118
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:52,420
But anyway,so after 6 months you're going to

119
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:56,820
get 4% on the original amount.

120
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,460
So you're going to have $10,000 dollars.

121
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,600
And you're going to 4% percent of this.

122
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,030
So they're going to owe you-- compounded semi-annually,

123
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,110
what was the total amount of interest paid

124
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,140
on the certificate at maturity?

125
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:17,040
So they're going to pay you $10,000 times half of it,

126
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,390
because only six months have gone by.8% is for the full year.

127
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,720
So for half the year,you're going to get times 4%.

128
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:30,250
So let's see,$10,000 times 4%,what is that?

129
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:36,260
$10,000 times 0.04.

130
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:41,470
Let's look at it this way,4 times $10,000 is $40,000.

131
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:45,730
We have two numbers behind the decimal place,so it's $400.

132
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,540
So they're going to pay you $400.

133
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:58,680
So then you can view it essentially, they owe you $10,400.

134
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,050
That's essentially how much they borrowed.

135
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,280
Because they're not going to give it to you just then.

136
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,780
You're going to get all your money back at the end.

137
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:06,790
So at the end,they're going to have to pay you another 4%.

138
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,820
But this time,it's not going to be off of the $10,000.

139
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:18,780
It's going to be off of the $10,400. So $10,400 times 0.04.

140
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:24,020
4 times 0 is 0. 4 times 0 is 0. 4 times 4 is 16.

141
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,390
4 times 0 is 0 plus 1 is 1. 4 times 1 is 4.

142
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,100
Then we have two numbers behind the decimal point.

143
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,980
So now they're going to pay you $416,the second payment.

144
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,710
What was the total amount of interest?

145
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:46,080
So it's going to be $416 plus $400,which is $816,

146
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,960
which is choice C.

147
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,120
I'm a little surprised that they expect you to know

148
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,310
what compounding semi-annually means.

149
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,880
But since it's there,I guess you should know it.

150
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,920
When it compound semi-annually,

151
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,170
it means that each semi-annual point in time,

152
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,800
you divide the annual interest rate by 2,

153
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,420
and you get that much.

154
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,240
But then the next interest you get is off of,

155
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,540
not just the initial amount,

156
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,120
but the initial amount plus the previous interest,

157
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,240
because they haven't paid you yet.

158
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,460
But anyway,I hope you don't find that too confusing.

159
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,010
You might want to look it up on the internet.

160
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,320
You could also compound monthly,or daily,or continuously.

161
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,070
I actually have a couple of videos on the Khan Academy.

162
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,980
But anyway,I'm all out of time,

163
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,500
so I'll see you in the next video.
