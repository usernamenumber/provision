1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,480
   

2
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,290
Let's say we've got the
function, f of x is equal

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,780
to the natural log of x
to the fourth plus 27.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,060
And all we want to do is take
its first and second

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:15,200
derivatives, and use as much of
our techniques as we have at

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,320
our disposal to attempt
to graph it without a

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,210
graphing calculator.

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,560
If we have time, I'll take out
the graphing calculator and

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,810
see if our answer matches up.

10
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,300
So a good place to start
is to take the first

11
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,420
derivative of this.

12
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,040
So let me do that over here.

13
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,670
So the derivative of f.

14
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,870
Well, you take the derivative
of the inside, so take the

15
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,900
derivative of that right there,
which is 4x to the third, and

16
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,960
then multiply it times the
derivative of the outside,

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,400
with respect to the inside.

18
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,940
So the derivative of the
natural log of x is 1over x.

19
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,580
So the derivative of this whole
thing with respect to this

20
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:56,040
inside expression is going
to be, so times 1 over x

21
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,220
to the fourth plus 27.

22
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,660
If you found that confusing,
you might want to rewatch

23
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,460
the chain rule videos.

24
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,290
But that's the first
derivative of our function.

25
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:10,670
I could rewrite this, this is
equal to 4x to the third over

26
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,850
x to the fourth, plus 27.

27
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,400
Or I could write it as 4x to
the third times x to the

28
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,000
fourth, plus 27 to
the negative 1.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,130
All three of these
expressions are equivalent.

30
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,950
I'm just the writing, I
multiplied it out, or I could

31
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,670
write this as a negative
exponent, or I could write

32
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,870
this as a fraction, with
this in the denominator.

33
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:30,740
They're all the equivalent.

34
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,620
So that's our first derivative.

35
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,060
Let's do our second derivative.

36
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,990
Our second derivative,
this looks like it'll get

37
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,470
a little bit hairier.

38
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,220
So our second derivative is
the derivative of this.

39
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,590
So it's equal to, we can now
use the product rule, is the

40
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:48,760
derivative of this first
expression, times the

41
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,590
second expression.

42
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,260
So the derivative of this first
expression, 3 times 4is 12.

43
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:58,450
12x squared, right, we just
decrement the 3 by 1, times the

44
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:06,280
second expression, times x to
the fourth plus 27 to the minus

45
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:12,380
1, and then to that, we want to
add just the first expression,

46
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,900
not its derivative, so just 4x
to the third, times

47
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,305
the derivative of the
second expression.

48
00:02:17,305 --> 00:02:19,380
And the derivative of the
second expression, we could

49
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,940
take the derivative of the
inside, which is just 4x to the

50
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:28,690
third, the derivative of 27 is
just 0, so times 4x to the

51
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,670
third, times the derivative
of this whole thing with

52
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,790
respect to the inside.

53
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,650
So times, so you take this
exponent, put out front, so

54
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:44,290
times minus 1, times this whole
thing, x to the fourth plus

55
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:49,930
27 to the, we decrement this
by one more, so minus two.

56
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,420
So let's see if I can simplify
this expression a little bit.

57
00:02:53,420 --> 00:03:00,590
So this is equal to, so this
right here is equal to 12x

58
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:07,400
squared over this thing, x to
the fourth plus 27, and then,

59
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,220
let's see, if we multiply we're
going to have a minus here, so

60
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:14,400
it's a minus, you multiply
these two guys, 4 times 4is 16,

61
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,660
16x to the third times x to the
third is x to the sixth,

62
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,380
over this thing squared.

63
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:26,620
Over x to the fourth
plus 27 squared.

64
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,600
That's just another way to
rewrite that expression

65
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,380
right there, right?

66
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,810
To the minus 2, you just put in
the denominator and make it

67
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,150
into a positive 2 in
the denominator.

68
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,610
Same thing.

69
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,860
Now, if you've seen these
problems in the past, we

70
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,480
always want to set these
things equal to 0.

71
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,090
We want to solve
for x equals 0.

72
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,750
So it'll be useful to have this
expressed as just one fraction,

73
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,460
instead of the difference or
the sum of two fractions.

74
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,880
So what we can do, is we could
have a common denominator.

75
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,170
So we could multiply both the
numerator and denominator of

76
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,830
this expression by x to the
fourth plus 27, and

77
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,290
what do we get?

78
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,830
So this is equal to, so if we
multiply this first expression,

79
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:06,730
times x to the fourth plus 27,
we get 12x squared, times

80
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,290
x to the fourth, plus 27.

81
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,340
And then in the denominator,
you have x to the

82
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,830
fourth plus 27 squared.

83
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,220
All I did, I multiplied this
numerator and this denominator

84
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,610
by x to the the fourth plus 27.

85
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,610
I didn't change it.

86
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,600
And then we have
that second term.

87
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:30,310
Minus 16 x to the sixth over x
to the fourth plus 27 squared.

88
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,020
The whole reason why did that?

89
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,740
Now I have a common
denominator, now I can

90
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,250
just add the numerators.

91
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:40,230
So this is going to be
equal to, let's see.

92
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:44,360
The denominator, we know what
the denominator is, it is x to

93
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,410
the fourth plus 27 squared.

94
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,330
That's our denominator.

95
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,480
And then we can
multiply this out.

96
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,580
This is 12x squared
times x to the fourth.

97
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:59,040
That's 12x to the sixth,
plus 27 times 12.

98
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,150
I don't even feel like
multiplying 27 times 12,so

99
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,060
I'll just write that out.

100
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:09,300
So plus 27 times 12x squared, I
just multiplied the 12x squared

101
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,570
times the 27, and then minus
16x to the sixth minus

102
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:17,430
16x to the sixth.

103
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,000
And this simplifies to,
let's see if I can simplify

104
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,240
this even further.

105
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,050
7x to the sixth here,
x to the sixth here.

106
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,720
So this is equal to,
do this in pink.

107
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,220
This is equal to the 27 times
12x squared, I don't feel like

108
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,970
figuring that out right now,
times 12x squared, and then you

109
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,140
have minus 16x to the sixth
and plus 12x to the sixth.

110
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,600
So you add those two,
you get minus 4.

111
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:48,900
12 minus 15is minus 4, x to the
sixth, all of that over x to

112
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:57,160
the fourth plus 27
plus 27 squared.

113
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,000
And that is our
second derivative.

114
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,190
Now, we've done all of the
derivatives, and this was

115
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,800
actually a pretty
hairy problem.

116
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,860
And now we can solve for when
the first and the second

117
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,305
derivatives equal 0, and we'll
have our candidate, well, we'll

118
00:06:10,305 --> 00:06:12,810
know our critical points, and
then we'll have our candidate

119
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,780
inflection points, and
see if we can make any

120
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,630
headway from there.

121
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,940
So first, let's see where our
first derivative is equal to 0,

122
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,240
and get our critical points.

123
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,680
Or at least maybe, also
maybe, where it's undefined.

124
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,330
So this is equal to 0.

125
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,520
If we want to set, if the only
place that this can equal to 0

126
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,740
is if this numerator
is equal to 0.

127
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,490
This denominator, actually, if
we are assuming we're dealing

128
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,490
with real numbers, this term
right here is always going to

129
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,130
be greater than or equal to 0
for any value of x, because

130
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,490
it's an even exponent.

131
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,790
So this thing can never equals
0, right, because you're

132
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,410
adding 27 to something
that's non-negative.

133
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,540
So this will never equal
0, so this will also

134
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,850
never be undefined.

135
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,890
So there's no undefined
critical points here, but

136
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:58,550
we could set the numerator
equal to 0 pretty easily.

137
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:02,060
If we wanted to set this equal
to 0, we just say 4x to the

138
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,900
third is equal to 0, and we
know what x-value will make

139
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,280
that equal to 0, x has
to be equal to 0.

140
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,230
4 times something to the
third is equal to 0, that

141
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,760
something has to be 0.

142
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,770
x to the third has to
be 0, x has to be 0.

143
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:19,590
So we can write, f prime
of 0 is equal to 0.

144
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,350
So 0 is a critical point.

145
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,970
0 is a critical point.

146
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,940
   

147
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,190
The slope at 0 is 0.

148
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,060
We don't know if it's a
maximum or a minimum, or

149
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,380
an inflection point yet.

150
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,530
   

151
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:37,785
We'll explore it a
little bit more.

152
00:07:37,785 --> 00:07:39,310
And actually, just so
we get the coordinate,

153
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,380
what's the coordinate?

154
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:45,150
The coordinate x is 0, and then
y is the natural log-- if x is

155
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:49,620
0, this just turns out, it's
the a natural log of 27.

156
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,880
Let me figure out what that is,
I'll get the calculator out.

157
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,740
I said I wouldn't use a
graphing calculator, but I can

158
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,910
use a regular calculator.

159
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:59,870
So27, if I were to take the
natural log of that, for

160
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,420
our purposes let's
just call it 3.3.

161
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,760
We're just trying to get the
general shape of the graph.

162
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,190
So 3.3.

163
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,710
   

164
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:11,050
Well, we could just say
2.9 and it kept going.

165
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,020
So this is a critical
point right here.

166
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,210
The slope is 0 here.

167
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:20,260
Slope is equal to 0
at x is equal to 0.

168
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,110
So this is one thing
we want to block off.

169
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,930
And let's see if we can
find any candidate

170
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,170
inflection points.

171
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,910
And remember, candidate
inflection points are where the

172
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,510
second derivative equals 0.

173
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,040
Now if the second derivative
equals 0, that doesn't tell

174
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,790
us that those are definitely
inflection points.

175
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,910
Let me make this very clear.

176
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:39,520
If, let me do it
in a new color.

177
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:52,160
If x is inflection, then the
second derivative at x is

178
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,090
going to be equal to 0.

179
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:58,910
Because you're having
a change concavity.

180
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:02,830
You have a change in the slope,
goes from either increasing

181
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,340
to decreasing or from
decreasing to increasing.

182
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:09,350
But if the derivative is equal
to 0, the second derivative is

183
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,900
equal to 0, you cannot assume
that is an inflection point.

184
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,390
So what we're going to do is,
we're going to find all of the

185
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:19,140
point at which this is true,
and then see if we actually do

186
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,230
have a sign change in the
second derivative of that

187
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,280
point, and only if you have a
sign change, then you can say

188
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,550
it's an inflection point.

189
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,170
So let's see if we can do that.

190
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,220
So just because a second
derivative is 0, that by

191
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,550
itself does not tell you
it's an inflection point.

192
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:36,210
It has to have a second
derivative of 0, and when you

193
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:40,190
go above or below that x, the
second derivative has to

194
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,500
actually change signs.

195
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,140
Only then.

196
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:54,170
So we can say, if f prime
changes signs around x,

197
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,890
then we can say that
x is an inflection.

198
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:00,226
   

199
00:10:00,226 --> 00:10:03,070
And if it's changing signs
around x, then it's definitely

200
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:06,470
going to be 0 right at x, but
you have to actually see that

201
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,350
if it's negative before x, has
to be positive after x,or if

202
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,737
it's positive before x, has
to be negative after x.

203
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:13,270
So let's test that out.

204
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,610
So the first thing we
need to do is find

205
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:16,490
these candidate points.

206
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,430
Remember, the candidate
points are where the second

207
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,160
derivative is equal to 0.

208
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,570
We're going to find those
points, and then see if this

209
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,670
is true, that the sign
actually changes.

210
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:29,750
We want to find where this
thing over here is equal to 0.

211
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,450
And once again, for this to
be equal to 0, the numerator

212
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,390
has to be equal to 0.

213
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:36,200
This denominator can never be
equal to 0 if we're dealing

214
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,570
with real numbers, which I
think is a fair assumption.

215
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:43,450
So let's see where this our
numerator can be equal to 0

216
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,650
for the second derivative.

217
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,610
So let's set the numerator
of the second derivative.

218
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:54,900
27 times 12x squared minus 4x
to the sixth is equal to 0.

219
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,210
Remember, that's just
the numerator of our

220
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,250
second derivative.

221
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,360
Any x that makes the
numerator 0 is making

222
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,580
the second derivative 0.

223
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:06,500
So let's factor
out a 4x squared.

224
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,060
So 4x squared.

225
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:14,140
Now we'll have 27 times, if we
factor 4 out of the 12, we'll

226
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,900
just get a 3, and we factored
out the x squared, minus, we

227
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,120
factored out the 4, we factored
out an x squared, so we have x

228
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,580
to the fourth is equal to 0.

229
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:29,480
So the x's that will make this
equal to 0 will satisfy either,

230
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:35,180
I'll switch colors, either 4x
squared is equal to 0, or, now

231
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,060
27 times 3, I can do
that in my head.

232
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,170
That's 81.

233
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:43,060
20 times 3 is 60, 7 times
3 is 21, 60 plus 21is 81.

234
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:48,920
Or 81 minus x to the
fourth is equal to 0.

235
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,410
Any x that satisfies either
of these will make this

236
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,700
entire expression equal 0.

237
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,180
Because if this thing is
0, the whole thing is

238
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:54,755
going to be equal to 0.

239
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,750
If this thing is 0, the
whole thing is going

240
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,445
to be equal to 0.

241
00:11:57,445 --> 00:11:59,640
Let me be clear, this
is 81 right there.

242
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,760
So let's solve this.

243
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:07,460
This is going to be 0 when
x is equal to 0, itself.

244
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,560
This is going to be equal
to 0 when x, let's see.

245
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,590
If we add x to the fourth to
both sides, you get x to

246
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:15,060
the fourth is equal to 81.

247
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,070
If we take the square root of
both sides of this, you get x

248
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:23,090
squared is equal to 9, or so
you get x is plus or minus 3.

249
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:29,590
x is equal to plus
or minus three.

250
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,640
So these are our candidate
inflection points, x is equal

251
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,770
to 0, x is equal to plus 3,
or x is equal to minus 3.

252
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,150
So what we have to do now, is
to see whether the second

253
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:42,360
derivative changes signs around
these points in order to be

254
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,710
able to label them
inflection points.

255
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:49,130
So what happens when x
is slightly below 0?

256
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:52,290
So let's take the situation,
let's do all the scenarios.

257
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,720
What happens when x
is slightly below 0?

258
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,620
Not all of them, necessarily,
but if x is like 0.1.

259
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,490
What is the second derivative
going to be doing?

260
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:07,230
If x is 0.1, or if x is minus
0.1, this term right here is

261
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:12,080
going to be positive, and
then this is going to be 81

262
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,990
minus 0.1 to the fourth.

263
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,890
So that's going to be a
very small number, right?

264
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:19,520
So it's going to be some
positive number times 81

265
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,530
minus a small number.

266
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,300
So it's going to be
a positive number.

267
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,930
So when x is less than 0, or
just slightly less than 0, our

268
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:31,740
second derivative is positive.

269
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,520
Now what happens when
x is slightly larger?

270
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,320
When I write this notation, I
want to be careful, I mean,

271
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,960
really, just right below 0.

272
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,030
Now when x is right
above 0, what happens?

273
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:47,040
Let's say x was 0.01,
or 0.1, positive 0.1.

274
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,180
Well, it's going to
be the same thing.

275
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,830
Because in both cases,
we're squaring, and

276
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:50,760
we're taking the fourth.

277
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,850
So you're kind of losing
your sign information.

278
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:57,290
So if x is 0.1, this thing
is going to be a small

279
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,470
positive number.

280
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,850
You're going to be subtracting
a very small positive number

281
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:05,060
from 81, but 81 minus a small
number is still going

282
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:05,920
to be positive.

283
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,810
So you're going to positive
times a positive, so your

284
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,530
second derivative is still
going to be greater than 0.

285
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,430
So something interesting here.

286
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:20,940
f at your second derivative is
0 when x is equal to 0, but it

287
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,980
is a not an inflection point.

288
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:29,230
Because notice, the concavity
did not change around 0.

289
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:32,810
Our second derivative is
positive as we approach 0 from

290
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:36,290
the left, and it's positive as
we approach 0 from the right.

291
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:41,340
So in general, at 0, we're
always, as we're near 0 from

292
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,040
either direction, we're going
to be concave upwards.

293
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,820
So the fact that 0 is a
critical point, and that we're

294
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,600
always concave upward, as we
approach 0 from either side,

295
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,690
this tells us that this
is a minimum point.

296
00:14:55,690 --> 00:15:00,760
   

297
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,600
Because we're concave
upwards all around 0.

298
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,160
So 0 is not an
inflection point.

299
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,490
Let's see if positive
and negative 3 are

300
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,270
inflection points.

301
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:14,520
And if you study this
equation, let me write

302
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,480
our-- and actually, I
just want to be clear.

303
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,050
I've just been using
the numerator of the

304
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,270
second derivative.

305
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,880
The whole second derivative is
this thing right here, but I've

306
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,800
been ignoring the denominator
because the denominator

307
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,340
is always positive.

308
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,140
So if we're trying to
understand whether things are

309
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,980
positive or negative, we just
really have to determine

310
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,000
whether the numerator is
positive or negative.

311
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,430
Because this expression right
there is always positive.

312
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:38,930
It's something to
the second power.

313
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:43,200
So let's test whether we have a
change in concavity around x is

314
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,610
equal to positive
or negative 3.

315
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,450
So remember, the numerator of
our, let me just rewrite our

316
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,850
second derivative, just so
you see it here. f

317
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,180
prime prime of x.

318
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,170
The numerator is this
thing right here.

319
00:15:54,170 --> 00:16:00,330
It's 4x squared times 81
minus x to the fourth.

320
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:03,050
and the denominator
was up here, x to the

321
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,430
fourth plus 27 squared.

322
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:10,540
   

323
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,120
That was our second derivative.

324
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,270
Let's see if this changes signs
around positive or negative 3.

325
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:19,940
And actually, we should get the
same answer, because regardless

326
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,440
of whether we put positive
or negative 3 here.

327
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,360
you lose all your sign
information because you're

328
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,835
taking it to the fourth
power, you're taking it

329
00:16:25,835 --> 00:16:26,630
to the second power.

330
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,850
And obviously, anything to the
fourth power is always going to

331
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,990
be positive, anything to the
second power is always

332
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,710
going to be negative.

333
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:35,170
So when we do our test, if it's
true for positive 3, it's

334
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,950
probably going to be true
for negative 3 as well.

335
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,540
But let's just try it out.

336
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:44,960
So when x is just a little bit
less than positive 3, what's

337
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,820
the sign of f prime prime of x?

338
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:51,970
So it's going to be 4 times
9, or it's going to be 4

339
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,880
times a positive number.

340
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,930
It might be like 2.999,
but this is still

341
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,420
going to be positive.

342
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:01,540
So this is going to be positive
when x is approaching 3, and

343
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:05,360
then this is going to be, well,
if x is 3, this is 0, so x is

344
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,420
a little bit less than 3.

345
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:11,390
If x is a little bit less than
3, if it's like 2.9999, this

346
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:14,120
number is going to be less
than 81, so this is also

347
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,460
going to be positive.

348
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,860
And of course, the denominator
is always positive.

349
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:21,490
So as x is less than 3, is
approaching from the left,

350
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,760
we are concave upwards.

351
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,650
This thing's going
to be a positive.

352
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,610
Then f prime prime
is greater than 0.

353
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:31,380
We are upwards,
concave upwards.

354
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,230
When x is just larger than
3, what's going to happen?

355
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,820
Well, this first term is
still going to be positive.

356
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,220
But if x is just larger than 3,
x to the fourth is going to be

357
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,720
just larger than 81, and so
this second term is going to be

358
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,130
negative in that situation.

359
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,676
   

360
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:51,150
Let me do it ina new color.

361
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,910
It's going to be negative
when x is larger than 3.

362
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,360
Because this is going
to be larger than 81.

363
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,230
So if this is negative and this
is positive, then the whole

364
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,980
thing is going to be negative,
because this denominator is

365
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,440
still going to be positive.

366
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,251
So then f prime prime is going
to be less than 0, so we're

367
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:09,290
going to be concave downwards.

368
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,700
One last one.

369
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:16,280
What happens when x is just
a greater than minus 3?

370
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,470
So just being greater
than minus 3, that's

371
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:22,940
like minus 2.99999.

372
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,280
So when you take minus 2.99
square it, you're going to get

373
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,760
a positive number, so this
is going to be positive.

374
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,010
And if you take minus 2.99 to
the fourth, that's going to be

375
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,640
a little bit less
than 81, right?

376
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,130
Because 2.99 to the fourth is a
little bit less than 81, so

377
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,030
this is still going
to be positive.

378
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:39,920
So you have a positive times a
positive divided by a positive,

379
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,120
so you're going to be concave
upwards, because your second

380
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,090
derivative is going to
be greater than 0.

381
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,740
Concave upwards.

382
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:52,000
And then finally, when x is
just, just less than negative

383
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,100
3, remember, when I write this
down, I don't mean for all x's

384
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,770
larger than negative 3,or all
x's smaller than negative 3.

385
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,130
There's actually no, well, I
can't think of the notation

386
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:04,910
that would say just, as we just
approach three in this case,

387
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:09,120
from the left, but what happens
if we just go to minus 3.11?

388
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,570
Or 3.01, I guess is a
better one, or 3.1?

389
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:15,040
Well, this term right here
is going to be positive.

390
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,320
But if we take minus 3.1 to the
fourth, that's going to be

391
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,760
larger than positive 81, right?

392
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,080
The sign will become positive,
it'll be larger than 81, so

393
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,210
this'll become negative.

394
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,540
So in that case as well, we'll
have a positive times a

395
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:32,410
negative divided by a positive,
so then our second derivative

396
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,100
is going to be negative.

397
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,830
And so we're going
to be downwards.

398
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:38,340
   

399
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:42,060
So I think we're ready to plot.
so first of all, is x plus or

400
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,120
minus 3 inflection points?

401
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,870
Sure!

402
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:47,800
As we approach x is equal to 3
from the left, we are concave

403
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,810
upwards, and then as we cross
3, the second derivative is 0.

404
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,550
The second derivative's
0, I lost it up here.

405
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:57,880
The second derivative is 0.

406
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,590
And then, as we go to the
right of 3, we become

407
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,400
concave downwards.

408
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,050
So we got our sign change
in the second derivative.

409
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,000
So x is equal to 3.

410
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,610
So 3 is definitely an
inflection point, and the

411
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,390
same argument could be
made for negative 3.

412
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,770
We switch signs as we cross 3.

413
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:17,620
So these definitely are
inflection points.

414
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,920
Just so we get the exact
coordinates, let's figure out

415
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,050
what f of 3 is, or f of
positive and negative 3.

416
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,840
And then we're ready to graph.

417
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,110
So first of all, we know that
f, we know that the point 0,

418
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:34,880
3.29, that this was a minimum.

419
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,870
Because 0 was a critical
point, the slope is 0 there,

420
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:41,000
and because it's concave
upwards all around 0.

421
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,230
So 0 is definitely not
an inflection point.

422
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:46,970
And then we know that the
points positive 3 and minus 3

423
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:50,210
are inflection points, and in
order to figure out their

424
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:53,110
y-coordinates, we can
just evaluate them.

425
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,950
So they're actually going to
have the same y-coordinates,

426
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,680
because if you put a minus3 or
positive 3 and take it to the

427
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,010
fourth power, you're going
to get the same thing.

428
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,090
Let's figure out what they are.

429
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,770
So if we take 3 to the fourth
power, that's what, 81.

430
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:09,990
81 plus 27 is equal to 108,
and then we want to take

431
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,160
the natural log of it.

432
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,730
   

433
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:17,130
Let's just say 4.7, just
to get a rough idea.

434
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,780
That's4.7.

435
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,920
And that's true of whether we
do positive or negative 3,

436
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,300
because we took to
the fourth power.

437
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:27,720
So it's 4.7, 4.7.

438
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,240
These are both
inflection points.

439
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,570
And we should be
ready to graph it!

440
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:35,250
Let's graph it.

441
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:35,790
All right.

442
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:42,090
Let me draw my axis,
just like that.

443
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:46,840
And this is my y-axis, this
is my x-axis, this is y.

444
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,740
You can even call it the f
of x axis, if you like.

445
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,820
This is x.

446
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,750
And so the point 0, 3.29.

447
00:21:53,750 --> 00:22:01,210
Let's say this is 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, to the point 0, 3.29.

448
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:05,290
That's 0, 1, 2, 3, a little bit
above 3, it's right there.

449
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,950
That's the minimum point.

450
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,550
And then we're concave.

451
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:12,230
The slope is 0 right there, we
figured that out, because the

452
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,360
first derivative was 0 there.

453
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,950
So it's a critical
point, and it's concave

454
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:15,710
upwards around there.

455
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:19,510
So that told us we arepoint at
a minimum point, right there.

456
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,430
And then at positive 3.

457
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:24,400
So 1, 2, 3.

458
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,950
At positive 3, 4.7.

459
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:30,890
So 4.7 will look
something like that.

460
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,660
We have an inflection point.

461
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,700
Before that, we're concave
upwards, and then after that

462
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,460
we're concave downwards.

463
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,600
So it looks something
like this.

464
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,520
So we're concave upwards
up with up to that point.

465
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,820
Maybe, actually, you should,
let me ignore that yellow

466
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,550
thing I drew before.

467
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,550
Let me get rid of that.

468
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,930
Let me draw it like 1, 2, 3.

469
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:59,040
3, 4.7 looks like that, and
minus 3, 4.7, 1, 2, 3,

470
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,290
4.7 looks like that.

471
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:07,200
So we know at 0, we are slope
of 0 and we're concave upwards,

472
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,140
so we look like this.

473
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,320
We're concave upwards,
until x is equal to 3.

474
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,690
And at x is equal to 3, we
become concave downwards, and

475
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:22,300
we go, let me try my best to
draw it well, and we

476
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,800
go off like that.

477
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,170
And then we're concave upwards
around 0, until we get, we're

478
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:32,290
concave upwards as long as x is
greater than minus 3, and

479
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,440
then at minus 3 we become
concave downwards again.

480
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,620
Maybe I should do
it in that color.

481
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:40,010
This concave downwards right
here, that's this, right here.

482
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,720
That's that, right there.

483
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,340
And this concave downwards,
right here-- sorry, I meant

484
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,440
to do it in the red color--
this concave downwards right

485
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,440
here, is this, right there.

486
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,490
And then the concave upwards
around 0 is right there.

487
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:57,080
You could even imagine, this
concave upwards that we

488
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,660
measured, that's this, concave
upwards, and then this

489
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,580
concave upwards is that.

490
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,700
And then around 0,
we're always upwards.

491
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,340
So this is my sense of what the
graph will look like and maybe

492
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,050
it'll just you know it turns
into well you could think about

493
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:13,420
what it does is x approaches
positive or negative infinity,

494
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,230
some of the terms, well,
I won't go into that.

495
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:18,430
But let's test whether we've
grafted correctly using

496
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,570
a graphing calculator.

497
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:25,150
So let me get out my TI-85,
trusty TI-85, and let's

498
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,480
graph this sucker.

499
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,290
All right, press graph.

500
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:38,830
y equals the natural log of
x to the fourth plus 27.

501
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,660
All right, I want to
hit that graph there.

502
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,650
So I do second, graph.

503
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,760
And let's cross our fingers.

504
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,380
It looks pretty good!

505
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,770
It looks almost exactly
like what we drew.

506
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:53,680
So I think our I think our
mathematics was correct.

507
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,650
This was actually
very satisfying.

508
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:59,060
So hopefully you appreciate the
usefulness of inflection

509
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,810
points, and second derivative,
and first derivative, in

510
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:06,860
graphing some of
these functions.

511
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,333
