00:00:00,606 --> 00:00:06,739
PROBLEM: "At Hogwarts, there are four houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin.

2
00:00:06,739 --> 00:00:11,556
The bar chart below shows the number of 
house points that each house received today.

3
00:00:11,556 --> 00:00:14,739
How many house points did Hufflepuff receive?"

4
00:00:14,739 --> 00:00:19,269
So if we look at this bar chart, we can
assume that this column right over here

5
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:23,136
is Hufflepuff, because it's the 
only one that starts with an H.

6
00:00:23,136 --> 00:00:26,969
This (G) would be Gryffindor, this (R) is 
Ravenclaw, and this (S) must Slytherin.

7
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:33,873
And so, if we look at Hufflepuff's bar, 
it looks like they have 3 points scored today.

8
00:00:33,873 --> 00:00:38,475
So let's put 3 points.
Alright. Let's try one more.

9
00:00:38,475 --> 00:00:42,057
So here, they're saying, "How many 
house points did Slytherin receive?"

10
00:00:42,057 --> 00:00:49,232
So, this is going to be Slytherin,
and it looks like they received 4 points.
