[MUSIC]

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,120
What I want to do in this
video is try to give a

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,330
reasonable understanding of the
different players involved

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,500
that issue and process
your credit cards.

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,296
So let's start off with
the processors.

6
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,180
Sometimes you could say that the
network or the processors

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,000
are the people that maintain the
credit card networks and

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,950
the examples of those are Visa,
MasterCard, American

9
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,170
Express, Discover.

10
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,540
And what they do is they
essentially maintain networks

11
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,240
of IT and policies
that connect a

12
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,300
bunch of banks together.

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,750
But for just the sake of this
video, we'll do a very

14
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:55,150
simple-- so let's say that this
is network one, maybe

15
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,140
that's Visa.

16
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,840
Maybe this right here is network
two, this right here

17
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,090
could be MasterCard.

18
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,300
And right now the networks are
just circles, but you'll see

19
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,730
that they're networks as I build
out this explanation.

20
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,000
Now let's say that I'm
some bank out there.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,190
Let me call myself Bank A.

22
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,170
And I decided, you know what?

23
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,710
It would be good for my business
for me to issue a

24
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,500
credit card.

25
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,880
I could extend credit to my
customers, they'll pay me

26
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,790
interest, maybe I'll make some
fees off of that and it'll be

27
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,470
a good business for my bank.

28
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,360
So I go up to, let's say, Visa
and I say, hey, can I be a

29
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,500
member of your network?

30
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,320
Visa has some policies and if
you're, I guess, a legitimate

31
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,640
bank and you agree to all those
policies, you'll become

32
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,460
a member of that network.

33
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,540
So I've joined that network, and
I'm of course not the only

34
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,730
person on that network, there's
tons of other banks on

35
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,080
that network.

36
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,190
So that could be Bank B, this
could be Bank C, this could be

37
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,620
Bank D and, of course, each of
these are networks, so they

38
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,330
all have their own member
banks on them.

39
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:04,680
That's MasterCard's network
right there.

40
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,979
And so in this situation, let's
say I'm a customer of

41
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,650
Bank A, and they say, do you
want a credit card and I say

42
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,070
sure, that'll be convenient.

43
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,600
I don't like carrying
cash in my pocket.

44
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,680
So give me a credit card.

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,720
And they'll issue a credit
card that looks

46
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,970
something like this.

47
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,410
I think we've all seen credit
cards, it will say Bank A

48
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,020
really big up at the top.

49
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,820
I'll have a credit card number
that's unique to me.

50
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:38,130
My name will be there, some type
of maybe expiration date,

51
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,030
and then here in the bottom
right corner, they're going to

52
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,720
say what network
I'm a part of.

53
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,540
In this case, it
would be Visa.

54
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,400
A credit card issuer over here
would say MasterCard or if it

55
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,480
was American Express, they'd put
American Express here and

56
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,590
maybe there's some type
of a hologram.

57
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,930
So great, I have a
credit card here.

58
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,650
I think we all have a general
sense, I could use it and then

59
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,140
I'll build a balance.

60
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,010
And then in the future I could
pay off that balance to this

61
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,120
bank or I could carry a balance
and they'll charge me

62
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,320
interest, which is usually
reasonably high interest, so I

63
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,190
want to pay it off
fairly quickly.

64
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,980
But how does this actually
work in the

65
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,810
context of a network?

66
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,720
So let's say I go to the local
grocery store, let me draw

67
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,310
that in orange.

68
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,670
So let's say I go to some
grocery store over here, I'll

69
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,670
say G for grocery.

70
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,570
And I buy a $100 worth of
groceries and I want to pay

71
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,870
with my newly-issued
credit card.

72
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:33,710
Let me write this down, this
is the issuing bank.

73
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,840
I go to the grocery store and
I say, hey, I'd like to pay

74
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,290
with a credit card.

75
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,940
The grocery store, if they
accept credit cards, they need

76
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,770
to have some relationship with
another bank some place on

77
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:47,400
this Visa network in order for
them to accept a Visa card.

78
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,270
So let's say that they have a
relationship with Bank B over

79
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,835
here, this would be the merchant
bank or we could say

80
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:58,060
the retailer's bank or, it's
often in credit card lingo

81
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,000
called the acquiring bank
or the acquirer.

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,240
You might wonder why they
called it the acquirer.

83
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,220
It's called the acquirer because
this is the player

84
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,310
that goes out and goes to each
of the merchants and says hey,

85
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,570
right now you only accept cash
or you'll only accept American

86
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:14,430
Express, wouldn't be great if
you also accepted Visa or

87
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,400
MasterCard?

88
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,839
That way you'll have more appeal
to more customers and,

89
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,519
you know, it'll be more
convenient for customers, and

90
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,400
every time a transaction happens
we'll just take a

91
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,650
little bit of a cut of
that transaction.

92
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,550
And so they go out and acquire
different retailers.

93
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:33,220
This was the grocer, maybe Bank
B goes off and acquires

94
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,900
the shoemaker.

95
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,790
Maybe he goes and he gets the
tailor on the network.

96
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,660
These are all different
retailers who will now all of

97
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:46,610
a sudden accept Visa because
their bank, their merchant

98
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,630
bank, is a member of
the Visa network.

99
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,810
Likewise, it could have been
a member of the MasterCard

100
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:51,680
network, it doesn't matter.

101
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,910
This is the processor and
this is their network.

102
00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:00,080
Now, this guy would, in this
context, he would accept Visa.

103
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,800
So I would give them my Visa
card and the first process is

104
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,050
called authorization.

105
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,730
And that's literally to check
whether I'm good for the

106
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,470
money, whether this card is
valid to buy $100 worth of

107
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,110
say, groceries.

108
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,640
So when I swipe the card or
when the grocer swipes the

109
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,300
card, it's going to send a
message from that little unit,

110
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,300
from that point of sale unit,
to the acquiring bank.

111
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,510
That's going to be forwarded to
Visa, then visa will say,

112
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,810
oh, that's Bank A's card, and
it'll give the number to Bank

113
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,760
A on their own proprietary
network.

114
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,940
Then Bank A will look into their
database, and say, oh

115
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,250
yeah, Sal has got $1,000
of credit.

116
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,180
He hasn't used any of it,
he is good for it.

117
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,890
I authorize that transaction.

118
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:49,330
That message goes back through
the network to Bank B and so

119
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,350
then we get authorized.

120
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,850
And then the transaction goes
forward and eventually, you

121
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:58,020
know, as you could imagine,
you can't just authorize a

122
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:02,680
transaction and then I walk
away with the groceries.

123
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,920
At some point this guy here
expects to get his money back

124
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,990
for giving me the groceries.

125
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,320
He expects to get $100 back.

126
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,450
And that $100 is going
to come from Bank A.

127
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,160
But they're not going to get
a complete $100, because

128
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,080
obviously each of
these players,

129
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,840
they're providing a service.

130
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,210
This guy, he's plugged
into the network and

131
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,460
he's offering credit.

132
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,800
The network operator or the
processor is offering their

133
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,940
network, and there's other
services they might provide

134
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,700
for security mechanisms. If they
say, hey, Sal lives in

135
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,720
Chicago, but all of a sudden
he's buying $100 worth of

136
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:52,300
groceries in Salzburg or some
place that would seem

137
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,850
unlikely, then it might send
some type of warning trigger.

138
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,830
Some people might have their
own security mechanisms.

139
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,940
But they're all providing
a service.

140
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,320
This guy is going out there,
he might be providing the

141
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,990
actual point of sale terminals,
the actual network.

142
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,160
So they're all going to get a
little bit of a cut of things.

143
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:17,990
And so out of the $100 worth of
groceries, there will be a

144
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:22,970
2%-- and it's not always 2%,
that's a round number, but it

145
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:26,910
also is a ballpark not
completely outlandish relative

146
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,790
to what tends to be the case.

147
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:34,520
So of that $100 that this guy, I
guess, could have gotten for

148
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:42,890
his groceries, he has to pay
a 2%, or in this case, $2--

149
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:56,860
that's 2% of $100-- he's got to
pay a $2 discount rate to

150
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,155
his acquiring bank.

151
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,260
And you might say, gee, the
acquirer, that's great.

152
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,490
They got $2, they got 2%
of all of these guys'

153
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,620
transactions, but of course
they're going to have to share

154
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,290
it with these other
people up here.

155
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,580
And actually the bulk of
it ends up with Bank A.

156
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:20,290
So of this $2-- and I'm doing it
in roundabout numbers-- so

157
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:24,410
now we're going to split up
the $2, Bank A is going to

158
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,570
get, let's just say, $1.70.

159
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,050
And these aren't that far off
from what the real numbers

160
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,380
might be, and they change and
they depend on the banks and

161
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,799
the network and all of that and
the networks might change

162
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,570
their rates.

163
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:39,350
$1.70 goes to Bank A.

164
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:42,890
So the issuing bank, besides
now that I have a credit

165
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,910
balance, it'll be able to charge
interest on it, it also

166
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:48,210
got $1.70 for that
transaction.

167
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:51,860
That $1.70 of the $2, this is
called an interchange fee.

168
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,340
And it generally gets set by
the individual networks,

169
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,940
although the networks don't
share in that interchange fee.

170
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,020
The just say our standard
interchange fee is x percent

171
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,530
of transactions plus, I don't
know, $0.10 and that's what

172
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,500
Bank B is going to
pay to Bank A.

173
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,760
So it's essentially Bank A's cut
of the discount rate, of

174
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,840
the $2 this guy is charging.

175
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,670
That guy.

176
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,820
And then the network, they make
their money in several

177
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,900
ways but, in general, they
make money off of every

178
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,870
transaction as well.

179
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,400
So in this situation, they make
roughly about 1/1000 of

180
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,940
the transaction or 0.1%.

181
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:35,010
So in this example, $0.10 of
this discount rate that this

182
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:44,570
guy charged would go to the
processor or the network.

183
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:47,470
So every time you transact,
the processor gets a small

184
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,950
fraction of your actual purchase
and then this guy

185
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:54,220
will be left with-- well,
let's see: $1.70, $0.10,

186
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,180
$1.80, we're coming from $2,
this guy is going to be left

187
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,470
with $0.20.

188
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,680
So when the whole transaction
gets settled, which

189
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,500
essentially means everyone
gets the money

190
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,800
they need to get.

191
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,660
This bank is going to send
Visa's settlement bank $100

192
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,830
minus the $1.70 that it gets
to keep as part of its

193
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,060
interchange fee.

194
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:22,110
So it's going to send Visa, what
is that, $98.30 to Visa.

195
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,710
Visa will keep $0.10 of it,
send it to the acquirer.

196
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:31,760
So the acquirer is going
to get $98.20.

197
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,580
And then the acquirer is going
to keep $0.20 for himself and

198
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,780
give the retailer $98.

199
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,850
So my numbers aren't exact,
but I want to give you the

200
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,970
general idea of how
all this works.

201
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:46,320
So in order for this retailer to
be able to use all of this

202
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,070
infrastructure out there, he
essentially had to pay 2% of

203
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,110
the actual transaction.

204
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,760
That's always not going to be
2%, but it gives you a nice

205
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,400
round figure.

206
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,320
So this guy benefits because he
gets access to a network,

207
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,350
it's convenient for the
customers, this guy obviously

208
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,820
is getting some type of fee.

209
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,870
The more retailers he signs on
or the more retailers he

210
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,700
acquires, the more cuts
of transactions

211
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,560
he's going to make.

212
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,640
Visa makes a small cut on many,
many, many, many, many

213
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,150
transactions, so that's where
they make their money and they

214
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,630
obviously have to use some of
that money to support all of

215
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,300
this infrastructure.

216
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,000
And then Bank A is going to
make that interchange fee,

217
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,960
which was the bulk of really
that discount rate, that

218
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,830
retailer discount rate, not
related at all to the federal

219
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,150
funds discount rates.

220
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,800
And then, of course, they
extended credit to me, so that

221
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,820
$100 might not be paid
immediately.

222
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,810
They might be able charge me
15% to 20%, an annualized

223
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:40,530
percentage rate interest, on
that money until I pay it off.

224
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,050
And of course I have some type
of minimum balance to pay.

225
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,270
So hopefully that explains
things a little bit.

226
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:51,020
I'll see you in the
next video [MUSIC]
