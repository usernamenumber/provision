1
00:00:00,311 --> 00:00:02,827
Given all the data that we`ve explored in the last video

2
00:00:02,827 --> 00:00:06,915
and that we have over here, the very high debt to GDP burden that Greece has and

3
00:00:06,915 --> 00:00:09,977
the very weak economy, it`s already in a deep recession.

4
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:12,665
It`s especially apparent when you look at its unemployment rate.

5
00:00:12,665 --> 00:00:18,064
This is the period October 2010 to March 2012, unemployment rate was already high

6
00:00:18,064 --> 00:00:22,678
in 2010 and it`s just been going through the roof, it`s already in the low 20%

7
00:00:22,678 --> 00:00:28,427
which is a huge number and even that is understating how bad things are on the ground in Greece

8
00:00:28,427 --> 00:00:31,514
because the unemployment is disproportionately affecting the young

9
00:00:31,514 --> 00:00:33,633
so if you looked at the unemployment rate for people in their 20`s

10
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:39,100
it would be much much much higher than even this already unbelievably high unemployment rate.

11
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,669
And we've already explored that the bond markets are expressing that, by asing for higher and higher

12
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:48,363
interest rates from Greece - these are the long term interest rates in Greece.

13
00:00:48,363 --> 00:00:53,783
And so the possible outcomes that we're talking about here --

14
00:00:53,783 --> 00:00:56,324
So this is Greece -

15
00:00:56,324 --> 00:00:58,427
--the possible outcomes for Greece--

16
00:00:58,427 --> 00:01:01,479
The only way that they are able to stay in the Eurozone

17
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:05,466
is if someone essentially writes them a huge check, that takes care of a good bit of their debt.

18
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:15,659
So one option is that they get bailed out. They get bailed out by the rest of Europe.

19
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,607
And Germany is a major actor here, because they are the largest economy of Europe.

20
00:01:19,607 --> 00:01:23,810
But with the bailout, people are saying: "Hey, look, if we are going to write you a

21
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:28,567
big check, you've got to cut some of your excesses, you've got to cut some of your mismanagement."

22
00:01:28,567 --> 00:01:35,181
So the bailout packages are all tied to some form of austerity.

23
00:01:35,181 --> 00:01:41,109
Now, we've already talked about why austerity is definitely not politically popular in Greece

24
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:43,768
but why it's also - it might just be a scary thing to do.

25
00:01:43,768 --> 00:01:47,214
Because you already have an ultra weak economy,

26
00:01:47,214 --> 00:01:49,833
you already have the unemployment rate going through the roof,

27
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:52,844
what happens if you get even more austere from where you are now,

28
00:01:52,844 --> 00:01:56,826
if you do a drastic cut to government spending from where you are now,

29
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:59,728
this could go to who knows where, to a large degree

30
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:04,560
this rise of unemployment is due to the last few rounds of bailouts and austerity

31
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,519
and so that's why the Greek people are getting very suspect of this austerity.

32
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:12,168
But if that doesn't happen, and we've talked about this in the last video,

33
00:02:12,168 --> 00:02:16,442
if that doesn't happen, the only viable option for Greece

34
00:02:16,442 --> 00:02:19,710
is to go off the Euro.

35
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,276
So, leave the Eurozone.

36
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:30,866
The Eurozone is the subset of European union countries that use the Euro as their currency.

37
00:02:30,866 --> 00:02:34,624
And we've already talked about this, it would not be a painless process.

38
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:41,684
They would leave the Eurozone, the new currency would be the new Greek drachma

39
00:02:41,684 --> 00:02:45,932
and with this it would be probably hugely devalued relative to the Euro

40
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:47,856
so you would have savings wiped out,

41
00:02:47,856 --> 00:02:52,792
maybe not fully wiped out, but savings devalued for Greek savers,

42
00:02:52,792 --> 00:02:58,228
and they know that already, that's why, because this outcome is looking more and more likely,

43
00:02:58,228 --> 00:03:01,915
there is essentially a run on banks in Greece right now.

44
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:05,695
People are going, withdrawing their Euros, so they can stuff them in their mattresses,

45
00:03:05,695 --> 00:03:08,307
so they won't be converted in devalued drachmas.

46
00:03:08,307 --> 00:03:11,854
But this is having the effect of really weak [..?..]

47
00:03:11,854 --> 00:03:14,097
potentially breaking down the banking system.

48
00:03:14,097 --> 00:03:21,057
So you could have bank failures.

49
00:03:21,057 --> 00:03:25,158
And the whole strategy of leaving the Eurozone,

50
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:26,800
leaving the Euro and going to the drachma,

51
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,366
would be to inflate away your liabilities,

52
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:33,599
would be literally to inflate away your debt obligations and your entitlement obligations,

53
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,726
but that inflation, and this has definitively happened in the past with countries in this situation,

54
00:03:37,726 --> 00:03:43,255
could very easily turn to hyper inflation.

55
00:03:43,255 --> 00:03:46,527
And so whether you look at austerity in this reality, where you get bailed out,

56
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:49,107
or you look at this reality over here,

57
00:03:49,107 --> 00:03:54,375
in either situation, in the medium term, the economy can really fall apart,

58
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:57,947
it's really not clear how, outside of maybe extra generous bailout,

59
00:03:57,947 --> 00:04:01,679
how that can be avoided.

60
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:03,695
And so in that situation, the economy falls apart.

61
00:04:03,695 --> 00:04:11,283
And when economy falls apart, in a big way,

62
00:04:11,283 --> 00:04:16,762
and you have major unemployment, it is a scary thing,

63
00:04:16,762 --> 00:04:18,330
it can lead to social unrest.

64
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:22,531
And I'm not talking about 8%, 9% or 10% of uneployment rate like we have in US,

65
00:04:22,531 --> 00:04:26,068
we are talking about 20%, 30%, 40% unemployment rate, even higher

66
00:04:26,068 --> 00:04:29,314
in the folks that are likely to be unrestful socially,

67
00:04:29,314 --> 00:04:32,797
which is the young people, so this could lead to social unrest,

68
00:04:32,797 --> 00:04:41,130
and even radicalization, when people start worrying about whether they get

69
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,408
food on the table and they don't have a job,

70
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:48,196
they might start supporting people who have more radical views.

71
00:04:48,196 --> 00:04:52,059
So just that by itself, is very, very scary proposition.

72
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:56,024
The history of Europe tells us that even if relatively small countries in Europe

73
00:04:56,024 --> 00:05:01,134
fall apart in this way, it could have repercussions in the rest of Europe.

74
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,241
This is how the World War I and World War II got started.

75
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:13,183
Just that reason alone is reason enough for people to think very seriously about bailing Greece out.

76
00:05:13,183 --> 00:05:15,901
And it doesn't come without moral consequences,

77
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:18,977
the counter-argument is - if we bailed them out

78
00:05:18,977 --> 00:05:29,812
doesn't this reward mismanagement and overspending?

79
00:05:29,812 --> 00:05:35,530
And even a little bit of shady accounting on their national economic statistics.

80
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,833
So, there's a very good reason, if you are a German tax payer,

81
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:41,167
then you are very suspicious of these bailouts.

82
00:05:41,167 --> 00:05:42,684
Why we are keep running the cheques to the Greeks

83
00:05:42,684 --> 00:05:44,701
if they are not willing to take some pain?

84
00:05:44,701 --> 00:05:46,746
Now the Greek side of it, they say "Look, we've already taken amount of pain,

85
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:50,646
we are already kind of on the brink, possibly across the brink,

86
00:05:50,646 --> 00:05:54,999
if you force even more pain on us,

87
00:05:54,999 --> 00:05:57,910
then we are going to be in really, our society

88
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,795
is at the risk of falling apart. So, we are in a desperate situation.

89
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:05,965
This is not a time to kind of force a moral point on us."

90
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:08,633
So that by itself is a reason why people are worried

91
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:10,666
but then there is even a bigger reason

92
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,199
that Greece might not be the only,

93
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,369
it's only the first, maybe the worst, of the situations

94
00:06:15,369 --> 00:06:22,988
but if Greece falls apart, and especially if the Eurozone - or, I should say, the European Union or Europe - is not able to bail out Greece

95
00:06:22,988 --> 00:06:26,281
that's an implicit signal to the rest of world

96
00:06:26,281 --> 00:06:30,401
that Europe is not able to essentially bail out its countries.

97
00:06:30,401 --> 00:06:34,675
So, you see on this chart right over here,

98
00:06:34,675 --> 00:06:37,200
Greece is not alone, it is definitely the worst,

99
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,658
but right behind it, you have Portugal.

100
00:06:39,658 --> 00:06:42,683
And its debt, you have long-term debt with interest rates

101
00:06:42,683 --> 00:06:45,379
looks like around the 12 or 13% range.

102
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:51,477
Portugal has a 93% debt to GDP ratio and already has very high unemployment rate.

103
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:54,462
If Greece is allowed to leave Eurozone and does not get bailed out,

104
00:06:54,462 --> 00:06:57,326
investors are going to start wondering

105
00:06:57,326 --> 00:07:00,706
"Well, hey, maybe Portugal is not going to get bailed out".

106
00:07:00,706 --> 00:07:03,431
This going to make people expect more interest from Portugal

107
00:07:03,431 --> 00:07:05,433
in order to lend them money, and they need money

108
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:09,004
in order to continue operating in the way they are operating,

109
00:07:09,004 --> 00:07:11,763
but every increase in a percentage point, right over here,

110
00:07:11,763 --> 00:07:16,106
is going to really eat into Portuguese GDP and kind of force them down its debt spiral.

111
00:07:16,106 --> 00:07:18,197
Their debt as percentage of their GDP is almost 100%

112
00:07:18,197 --> 00:07:20,753
if they have to pay an extra one percent on that,

113
00:07:20,753 --> 00:07:24,482
that 1% is going to eat into their GDP

114
00:07:24,482 --> 00:07:28,165
and it is going to force Portugal, the economy to slow down even more

115
00:07:28,165 --> 00:07:29,908
and make it even more and more onerous

116
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:34,328
and they would just kind of go in the same direction as Greece.

117
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:38,645
And once again, Portugal is not alone, Italy has a very high debt to GDP,

118
00:07:38,645 --> 00:07:40,840
Ireland - very high debt to GDP ratio,

119
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,801
Spain has a very high unemployment rate.

120
00:07:43,801 --> 00:07:46,724
So, the fear here - and I guess there are two major fears -

121
00:07:46,724 --> 00:07:51,316
one is that Greece by itself can become a point of instability in Europe,

122
00:07:51,316 --> 00:07:53,420
but the second fear, if this thing isn't solved,

123
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:57,278
that this could cause a kind of contagion or a chain reaction through Europe,

124
00:07:57,278 --> 00:08:02,291
that people start getting freaked out, they start wanting to not lend to these countries,

125
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,196
that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy,

126
00:08:04,196 --> 00:08:08,067
they might also have to leave the Eurozone.
