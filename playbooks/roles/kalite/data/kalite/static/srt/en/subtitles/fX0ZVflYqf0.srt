1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,780
   

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,700
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,500
So we're on problem number 5.

4
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,880
In the schedule above,
each session is to be

5
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,130
an hour and a half.

6
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:11,510
   

7
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,285
Each break is to be 1/4 hour.

8
00:00:13,285 --> 00:00:18,130
   

9
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,830
And lunch is to be
1 hour long.

10
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,410
   

11
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:31,170
If Session IV is to end at 4:30
PM, at what time should

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,980
Session I begin?

13
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,340
So there's actually
two ways to do it.

14
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,730
When I just glanced at this, I
said, well, I'll just fill in

15
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:37,210
this chart.

16
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,740
And actually, I'm going to do
that as well, just to show you

17
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,500
that they get the same answer.

18
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,660
But there is a faster way
to do this problem.

19
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,920
Essentially, what they're saying
is the day ends at

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,660
4:30, right?

21
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,620
Because 4:30 is the last thing
that happens in the day.

22
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,130
And then they're saying, what
time should Session I begin?

23
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,280
So they're essentially
saying, what time

24
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,020
should the day begin?

25
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,470
So if we can just figure out
how many hours are in this

26
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,980
day, and then take that many
hours from 4:30 PM, we would

27
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,580
get our answer for when Session
1 should begin.

28
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,870
So how many hours
are in the day?

29
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,200
Well, there's one, two,
three, four sessions.

30
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:18,090
4 sessions times an hour
and a half each.

31
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,800
Well, 4 times 1 and 1/2,
that's 6 hours.

32
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,680
You can multiply the fractions
if you don't believe me.

33
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,230
6 hours.

34
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,250
There's 1 lunch.

35
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,120
1 lunch is 1 hour.

36
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,370
And then how many breaks
are there?

37
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,280
There's 2 breaks.

38
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,510
So there's 2 breaks times 1/4.

39
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,260
So that equals 1/2.

40
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,043
So if we were to add up the
hours for the sessions, the

41
00:01:45,043 --> 00:01:49,710
lunch and the breaks, we would
get 7 and 1/2 hours.

42
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,880
And so then you just have to
figure out, well, what is 7

43
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,430
and 1/2 hours before 4:30 PM?

44
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,060
Sometimes people get
uncomfortable subtracting time

45
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,070
past noon, because it
gets a little weird.

46
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,780
So the way I think about
it, break it up.

47
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:09,160
Well, if I go 4 and 1/2 hours
ago, if I go from 4:30 and I

48
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,490
go minus 4 and 1/2 hours, then
I get to noon, right?

49
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,515
And so we already took
out 4 and 1/2 hours.

50
00:02:15,515 --> 00:02:18,460
And we want to take out 7 and
1/2, so we have 3 hours left

51
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,700
to take out.

52
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,160
So 12-- you take out 3
hours, well, that's

53
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,590
easy, that's 9:00 AM.

54
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,670
And so that would
be our answer.

55
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,320
That's the fast way to do it.

56
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,770
Actually, it might not be the
fast way, because you'd have

57
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,650
to think about all of these
things, and you're not sure if

58
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,010
you subtracted right.

59
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,800
The other option is
just fill it in.

60
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:43,240
This session ends at 4:30, so
it has to begin at 4:00.

61
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,000
Or no, sorry, it has to
begin at 3:00, right?

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,900
Hour and a half.

63
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,000
So that means this break would
have to end at 3 o'clock, and

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,220
begin at 2:45.

65
00:02:53,220 --> 00:03:01,510
This would have had to end at
2:45, and begin at 1:15.

66
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:06,590
This would have to end at
1:15, begin at 12:15.

67
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:11,040
End at 12:15, if you go an hour
and a half before 12:15,

68
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,760
2 hours would be 10:15,
so it would be 10:45.

69
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:22,210
This ends at 10:45, and so it's
a 15-minute break, so it

70
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,590
would have to start at 10:30.

71
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,200
And then if this ends at 10:30,
and you subtract an

72
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,660
hour and a half from that, you
get to 9:00 AM, which is our

73
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,980
answer either way.

74
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,560
So the second way, filling it
out, actually isn't that bad.

75
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,820
If that immediately is what
comes to you, it still didn't

76
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,580
take too much time.

77
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,460
You could have done it
that way as well.

78
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,710
Move on to the next problem.

79
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:44,730
   

80
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,110
Number 6.

81
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,360
I will change colors.

82
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,240
   

83
00:03:50,240 --> 00:04:05,070
If 2x minus 5, x plus 1, and 3x
minus 8 are all integers,

84
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,600
and x plus 1 is the median
of these integers.

85
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,035
So this is the median.

86
00:04:09,035 --> 00:04:10,510
Now, what does median mean?

87
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,130
Median just means the middle
number, right?

88
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:20,240
If I have a bunch of numbers--
if I have 1, 3, 7, 8, 9.

89
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,050
The middle number here,
it's not the average.

90
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,410
It's just what number-- half
the numbers are larger, and

91
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,570
half the numbers are smaller.

92
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,660
So in this example, the middle
number would be 7.

93
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,280
So that's all median means.

94
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,480
So it's telling us that x plus
1 is the median number.

95
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,050
They say, which of the
following could

96
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:33,895
be a value for x?

97
00:04:33,895 --> 00:04:36,070
And they give a bunch
of choices.

98
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,930
In this type of situation, I
just try them out, because

99
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,810
these are pretty straightforward
equations.

100
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,150
They're giving us pretty
clean numbers.

101
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,700
Let's just try it out.

102
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,710
Choice A.

103
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:52,770
So 2x minus 5 is 2
times 5 minus 5.

104
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:53,950
That's 10 minus 5.

105
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,542
That equals 5.

106
00:04:56,542 --> 00:05:01,410
x plus 1 is 5 plus 1,
which equals 6.

107
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,320
And this is the x plus 1 term,
so it should be our median.

108
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,430
And then 3 times 5 minus 8.

109
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:11,350
3 times 5 minus 8, well,
that's 15 minus

110
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,420
8 is equal to 7.

111
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,650
Well, we lucked out.

112
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,310
Looks like the x plus 1
term was the median.

113
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,720
And that's probably a good
indication that they wanted us

114
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,200
to try out the numbers, because
they actually gave the

115
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,840
first choice as being the
one that worked out.

116
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,310
So the choice is A.

117
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,978
Move on.

118
00:05:30,978 --> 00:05:35,472
I'll try a different method
of deleting things.

119
00:05:35,472 --> 00:05:36,280
Look at that.

120
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,550
That was pretty neat.

121
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,695
So now we're on number 7.

122
00:05:41,695 --> 00:05:45,610
   

123
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:49,330
An exhibitor is selling
decorative wreaths at an arts

124
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,270
and craft show.

125
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,430
Useless sentence.

126
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,620
The net profit p in dollars from
the sales of the wreath

127
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,020
is given by-- now, this is a
useful piece of information.

128
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:14,640
p of n is equal to 0.75n minus
50, where n is the number of

129
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,070
wreaths sold.

130
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,380
How many wreaths must the
exhibitor sell in order to

131
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:24,330
earn a net profit of $100?

132
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,570
Well, we want this thing
to equal $100, right?

133
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:30,500
So we just set it
equal to 100.

134
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:37,710
100 is equal to 0.75n
minus 50.

135
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,270
Add 50 to both sides.

136
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:44,350
150 is equal to 0.75n.

137
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:49,910
And I like to write-- I like
to deal with fractions.

138
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,620
I don't not like decimals,
but fractions are easier.

139
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,720
This is the same
thing as 3/4 n.

140
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,880
0.75 is the same thing as 3/4.

141
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,200
So now we just multiply both
sides times-- something was

142
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,210
ringing in my computer, but
anyway-- multiply both sides

143
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,500
times the inverse of this
coefficient, so times 4/3.

144
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:13,100
   

145
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,420
This of course cancels, so we
just have n left on the

146
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,580
right-hand side.

147
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,010
And on this side,
4/3 times 150/1.

148
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,025
The 150 cancels out
with the 3.

149
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:25,300
   

150
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,330
This becomes 1.

151
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,040
So 4 times 50 is 200.

152
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,440
You just have a 1 in
the denominator.

153
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,560
Is equal to n.

154
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,570
There you go.

155
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:38,830
The exhibitor has to sell 200
wreaths, which is choice E.

156
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,740
Next problem, number 8, which
I will do in yellow.

157
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,470
   

158
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:55,675
If x squared plus y squared is
equal to 73, and xy is equal

159
00:07:55,675 --> 00:08:01,170
to 24, what is x
plus y squared?

160
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:05,420
   

161
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,320
What happens when you multiply
x plus y squared?

162
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,570
x plus y squared is the
same thing as x plus y

163
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,490
times x plus y.

164
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,470
And this might be second nature
to you after taking a

165
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,090
lot of algebra, but I'll
just multiply it out

166
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:22,380
just to show you.

167
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,482
x times x is x squared.

168
00:08:24,482 --> 00:08:28,300
x times y is xy.

169
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,690
y times x is xy.

170
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:35,020
And then y times
y is y squared.

171
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:41,539
So it equals x squared plus
2xy plus y squared.

172
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:42,419
Well, that's interesting.

173
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:50,130
We know that these two terms
combined, that's x squared

174
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,540
plus y squared.

175
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,650
So we know that that
equals 73.

176
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,740
I know I'm running out of--
let me write it up here.

177
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:02,390
So x squared plus 2xy
6 plus y squared.

178
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,760
So these two terms are 73.

179
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,760
So we have 73 plus-- and we
can cancel those two out.

180
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,120
And then we have 2xy.

181
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,000
Well, we know xy
is equal to 24.

182
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,480
So it's 2 times 24.

183
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,390
So it's 73 plus 48.

184
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,410
And then, let's see.

185
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:29,970
7-- I think this is going
to be what, 121?

186
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,490
If my math is not-- let's see.

187
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,200
7, so it's 110, plus
another 11.

188
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:36,820
Right.

189
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,400
121.

190
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,150
That's all there was.

191
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,350
You just really have to expand
out x plus y squared, and then

192
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,430
you say, oh, well, they kind of
give you what the component

193
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,080
terms, what the values are,
and then we're done.

194
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,940
I'll see you in the
next video.

195
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,300
