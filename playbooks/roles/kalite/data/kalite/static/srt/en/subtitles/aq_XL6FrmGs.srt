Identify all sets of parallel and perpendicular lines in the image below.

2
00:00:06,177 --> 00:00:13,267
So let's start with the parallel lines and, just as a reminder, two lines are parallel

3
00:00:13,267 --> 00:00:17,200
if they're in the same plane, and all of these lines are clearly in the same plane.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:22,825
They are in the plane of the screen your viewing right now.

5
00:00:22,825 --> 00:00:24,267
But they are two lines that never intersect.

6
00:00:24,267 --> 00:00:29,200
And one way to verify: because it sometimes looks like two lines will intersect,

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,267
but you can't just always assume just based on how it looks.

8
00:00:31,267 --> 00:00:34,667
You really have to some information given to you in the diagram or the problem

9
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:39,333
that tells you that they are definitely parallel, that they're definitely never going to intersect.

10
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:45,743
And one of those pieces of information that they give right over here is that they show Line ST and Line

11
00:00:45,743 --> 00:00:53,667
UV: they both intersect line CD at the exact same angle, at this angle right here.

12
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:57,733
And, in particular, it is at a right angle.

13
00:00:57,733 --> 00:01:00,333
And if you have two lines that intersect a third line at the same angle, at the same angle.

14
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:04,267
so that these are actually corresponding angles. And they are the same.

15
00:01:04,267 --> 00:01:08,000
If you have two of these corresponding angles and they are the same then these two lines are parallel.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,533
So Line ST is parallel to Line UV, and you can write it like this:

17
00:01:12,533 --> 00:01:20,333
So Line ST- you put the arrows on each end of that top bar to say that this a line and not just a line

18
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:27,667
segment. Line ST is parallel (two lines) to Line UV.

19
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:33,344
And I think that is the only set of parallel lines in this diagram. Yup.

20
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:37,333
Now let's think about perpendicular lines.

21
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:44,600
Perpendicular lines are lines that intersect at a 90 degree angle.

22
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:54,428
So for example Line ST is perpendicular to Line CD.

23
00:01:54,428 --> 00:01:57,400
And we know that they intersect at a right angle or a 90 degree angle

24
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,333
because they gave us this little box here which literally means that the measure

25
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:05,000
of this angle is 90 degrees. By the exact same argument, Line UV

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,872
is perpendicular to CD.

27
00:02:07,872 --> 00:02:17,137
UV (make sure I specify these as lines) is perpendicular to CD.

28
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:22,338
And so UV, ST they're perpendicular to CD. And then after that,

29
00:02:22,338 --> 00:02:27,267
the only other information where they definitely tell us that two lines are intersecting at right angles

30
00:02:27,267 --> 00:02:38,600
are Line AB and WX. So Line AB is definitely perpendicular to Line WX.

31
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,533
Line WX. And, I think we are done.

32
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:49,200
And one thing to think about AB and CD, well they don't even intersect,

33
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,600
so we can't make a comment about them being perpendicular, but they are definitely not parallel

34
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,733
You can even imagine that it looks like they are about to intersect.

35
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:59,333
And they give us no information that they intersect at the same lines, at the same angle.

36
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:04,000
So, if somehow they told us that this was a right angle, even though it doesn't look anything like a

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,757
right angle, then we would have to suspend our judgement based on how it actually looks

38
00:03:07,757 --> 00:03:11,936
and say, huh I guess maybe those things are perpendicular.

39
00:03:11,936 --> 00:03:16,667
And maybe these two things are parallel. They didn't actually tell us

40
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:18,600
that, and that would actually be bizarre because

41
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,501
these lines are so not parallel. And this would actually end up being parallel to other things if that

42
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:28,200
was done. But, it's a good thing that wasn't because that would look very strange.

43
00:03:28,200 --> 99:59:59,999
Based on the information they gave us, these are the parallel and perpendicular lines.
