1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800
   

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,530
A photo finishing store charges
customers a rate of

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,970
$0.29 per photo to
print pictures.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,140
For new customers, the
store offers a

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:15,740
one-time discount of $3.

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,850
Write a function representing
the amount that a new customer

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:23,020
would have to pay to have x
number of photos printed.

8
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,590
So x is the number of
photos printed.

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,190
So just a regular customer would
have to pay the number

10
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,040
of photos times $0.29 a photo.

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,290
So if we just said, let y be
the amount that a customer

12
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:39,580
would have to pay, a regular
customer would have to pay x

13
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,640
times $0.29 per photo.

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,750
So we'd write 0.29-- we could
put the dollar sign there if

15
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,490
you want-- or 0.29-- we're
assuming everything is

16
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,590
dollars-- x.

17
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,080
That's how much a regular
customer would have to pay.

18
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,525
But they're asking us a first
time, a new customer.

19
00:00:56,525 --> 00:00:58,830
And they say that the new
customer gets a one-time

20
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,520
discount of $3.

21
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:06,040
So a new customer will
pay this minus $3.

22
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,260
So this right here is pretty
much a simplified version of a

23
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,020
function that would describe
what a new customer would pay.

24
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,400
If you wanted to get fancy,
this is a little bit

25
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,850
inaccurate when the customer
ordered less than 10 photos

26
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,540
because, let's say the customer
orders 10 photos.

27
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:30,300
Then x is going to be 10 times
$0.29 is $2.90 minus 3 is

28
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,790
negative $0.10.

29
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,960
The customer is not going to
pay negative $0.10, which

30
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,760
would be like the store paying
them $0.10 for them to print

31
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,390
10 photos, the customer's not
going to pay anything.

32
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,110
So what we could do if we wanted
to make this a little

33
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:57,740
bit fancier, we could say that a
new customer would pay-- and

34
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:10,110
then we can say that's y, so y
is equal to 0.29x minus 3 if x

35
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,420
is greater than 10, if the
guy or the gal orders

36
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,160
more than 10 photos.

37
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,100
It's 0 otherwise.

38
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,810
   

39
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:22,880
Then they don't pay anything.

40
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,760
If it's less than 10 photos,
they pay nothing.

41
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,090
It's not like the store's going
to pay them, because if

42
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,640
you're less than 10, or 10 or
less, actually, then this is

43
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,750
going to become negative and
we don't want a situation

44
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,260
where it's negative.

45
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,340
So they're either going to pay
nothing, but if they get more

46
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,600
than 10 photos, then they're
going to pay based on this

47
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,800
function right there.

48
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,200
