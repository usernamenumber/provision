1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,867
Let's say you think very highly of company ABCD,

2
00:00:03,867 --> 00:00:06,548
and you're convinced that the stock price will go up

3
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:11,000
from its current trading price of $50 per share.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,267
You could do two things:

5
00:00:15,267 --> 00:00:18,576
you could either just buy the stock for $50

6
00:00:18,576 --> 00:00:20,333
and hope that the price goes up,

7
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:22,407
or — and I made this price up —

8
00:00:22,407 --> 00:00:24,149
you could go to an options exchange and,

9
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,867
for the price of $5,

10
00:00:25,867 --> 00:00:30,133
you could buy the option to buy this stock

11
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:32,740
over the next month. It expires in one month.

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,067
Usually it'll be a specific date,

13
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:34,644
but I'm just saying,

14
00:00:34,644 --> 00:00:37,152
one month from the date you buy the option,

15
00:00:37,152 --> 00:00:39,467
and it gives you the option to buy the stock

16
00:00:39,467 --> 00:00:41,908
for $60 a share.

17
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:44,667
And the type of option I've just described is called

18
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:46,068
an American option.

19
00:00:46,068 --> 00:00:49,157
And it can be compared to a European option.

20
00:00:49,157 --> 00:00:52,933
An American option allows you to exercise the option

21
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:55,496
— to actually buy the stock — any time

22
00:00:55,496 --> 00:00:57,067
from the time you have the option

23
00:00:57,067 --> 00:00:58,733
until the expiration.

24
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:01,867
On a European option, you only have the option,

25
00:01:01,867 --> 00:01:04,933
you can only exercise it on the expiration.

26
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:07,825
But we'll just focus on the American.

27
00:01:07,825 --> 00:01:09,333
Now let's think about the different outcomes

28
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:11,333
depending on what the stock does.

29
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:14,165
So let's say the stock actually does do what you think it does.

30
00:01:14,165 --> 00:01:16,600
Let's say it goes up and then it goes down.

31
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,467
Let's say that you're really good at calling stock price tops.

32
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:23,867
And then right over here, let's take the two scenarios.

33
00:01:23,867 --> 00:01:26,467
Let's take the scenario where you bought the stock

34
00:01:26,467 --> 00:01:27,818
and then you sell the stock.

35
00:01:27,818 --> 00:01:29,867
So you bought at $50, and then over here

36
00:01:29,867 --> 00:01:32,267
right at the top, you're just a perfect market caller,

37
00:01:32,267 --> 00:01:35,533
you're able to sell the stock at $80.

38
00:01:35,533 --> 00:01:38,867
So let's just think about the different profit scenarios.

39
00:01:38,867 --> 00:01:42,733
So here we have an end price of $80 per share.

40
00:01:42,733 --> 00:01:46,400
If you had bought the stock for $50 and now sold it at $80,

41
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,667
you will have a profit of $30.

42
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:54,067
Now let's think about if, instead of buying the stock,

43
00:01:54,067 --> 00:01:57,133
you bought the option today.

44
00:01:57,133 --> 00:01:58,491
So if you bought the option,

45
00:01:58,491 --> 00:02:00,581
same thing, when the stock goes up to here,

46
00:02:00,581 --> 00:02:02,600
you'll say, "Oh, I think that's the top for the stock,

47
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,333
let me exercise my option.

48
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,067
So I'm going to exercise my option

49
00:02:07,067 --> 00:02:10,533
which gives me the right to buy the stock at $60 a share."

50
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:12,563
So you're going to buy it at $60 a share,

51
00:02:12,563 --> 00:02:13,667
right over here,

52
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:16,467
and you can immediately sell it for $80 a share.

53
00:02:16,467 --> 00:02:20,000
So you could make $20 on that transaction,

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,067
but, of course, you paid $5 for the option itself.

55
00:02:23,067 --> 00:02:26,800
So you make $20 on the difference between $80 and $60,

56
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,933
but you had to pay $5.

57
00:02:27,933 --> 00:02:32,067
So you have a $15 profit.

58
00:02:32,067 --> 00:02:33,333
So there it says, hey, look,

59
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,867
maybe I was better off buying the stock!

60
00:02:35,867 --> 00:02:36,733
And even there I'd say, look,

61
00:02:36,733 --> 00:02:41,333
to buy the stock you had to put $50 of capital at risk.

62
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:44,815
To buy the option, you only had to put $5 of capital at risk.

63
00:02:44,815 --> 00:02:47,333
And to see that, imagine the negative scenario,

64
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,832
where instead of the stock doing that,

65
00:02:48,832 --> 00:02:53,600
let's say the stock just completely plummets after you buy.

66
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,867
And it goes all the way down to $20.

67
00:02:55,867 --> 00:02:57,400
Now in the situation with the stock,

68
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,600
let's say right over there you've just had enough.

69
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,800
You say, "I just want to sell the stock."

70
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,467
So this is an end price of $20.

71
00:03:05,467 --> 00:03:08,244
In that situation, you bought for $50, sell for $20,

72
00:03:08,244 --> 00:03:10,867
you will lose $30.

73
00:03:10,867 --> 00:03:14,267
But in the option scenario, this entire time that it was plummeting,

74
00:03:14,267 --> 00:03:17,067
you'll say, "I just won't exercise the option."

75
00:03:17,067 --> 00:03:18,933
The option is "out of the money."

76
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:21,200
It makes no sense for me to exercise it.

77
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,067
So you just won't exercise the option.

78
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:26,600
So you'll only lose the price that you paid for the option.

79
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,533
You'll only lose your $5.
