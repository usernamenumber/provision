1
00:00:00,559 --> 00:00:05,149
as we exit nineteen seventeen and enter
into nineteen eighteen reading into the

2
00:00:05,149 --> 00:00:08,769
final stages of world war one

3
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:11,169
and let's just give ourselves a little
bit of a review a little bit of

4
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:14,799
background a little bit of context the
war start off as a two-front war for the

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,570
central powers you have the western
front

6
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,369
you have the western front

7
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:22,169
right over here and you had the huge

8
00:00:22,169 --> 00:00:24,759
you had the huge eastern front

9
00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:26,069
right over here

10
00:00:26,069 --> 00:00:27,880
by nineteen seventeen

11
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,410
the major conflict on the eastern front
especially with russia which was a major

12
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,489
power there had come to an end

13
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:36,780
your february revolution in russia

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,309
bizarre had to abdicate the throne

15
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:43,899
you had a provisional government then in
november of nineteen seventeen the

16
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:46,510
bolsheviks have approved a takeover

17
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,420
they have no interest in prosecuting
world war one because they have their

18
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,289
own civil war to worry about

19
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:55,440
so they said they they sign an armistice
with central powers

20
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,390
by the end of nineteen seventeen and
then when we get into nineteen eighteen

21
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,860
oldest so by the time we get into
nineteen

22
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,060
eighteen they're ready to sign a treaty

23
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,360
in march

24
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,760
in march the russian signed

25
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,870
the treaty of breeze through twelve isc

26
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,550
let told fiske

27
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:19,850
with scenes over all of this territory
to the germans and takes the russians

28
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,510
out of world war one

29
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,500
so i might have gone into detail on
other videos but huge amount of

30
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,990
territory in a matured very informally
video i gave a rough sense of

31
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,790
of what where that territory was

32
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,980
and the treaty itself its main
significance to the tree in last

33
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,440
as you might already know the simple
powers lost world war one so that treaty

34
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,600
was leader of nullified

35
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,790
became importance of that really is what
it took me russia out of the war it

36
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:49,750
allowed to the central powers especially
germany to focus on the western front

37
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:53,770
but the other element of it is by giving
so much territory to the germans the

38
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:54,859
germans couldn't just

39
00:01:54,859 --> 00:01:56,949
you know leave that territory as is

40
00:01:56,949 --> 00:02:00,049
if they wanted any claims do they have
to devote some of their troops

41
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:00,869
to too

42
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:04,020
occupied lease or at least attempt
occupy some of it

43
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,600
so even though it was a huge opportunity
in the germans did were able to after

44
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,200
that read or even before the treaty they
start were after the armistice direct

45
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,150
start they were able to start bringing

46
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:17,200
many more of the eastern front troops
over to the western front

47
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,840
they didn't bring over as many as they
could have because they left some to

48
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,349
attempt to occupy

49
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:24,739
some of the territory that had been
gained

50
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:26,769
on the eastern front

51
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:30,749
but have you things from a german
perspective at this point march nineteen

52
00:02:30,749 --> 00:02:33,039
eighteen you're going to be feeling
pretty good

53
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,040
you know you're you're holding your own
it to a front war

54
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,450
now will end and you thought at at one
point that russia was a major threat

55
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,509
there

56
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:43,979
that threat is gone you can now focus on
a one front war maybe should be you

57
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:48,769
should be able to to kind of moon put
the decisive blow against the allies now

58
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,790
and that is how the germans felt

59
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,529
but they were worried about a couple
things

60
00:02:53,529 --> 00:02:57,159
they were worried about to debate the
british industrial capacity of the

61
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:59,979
allied industrial capacity that was

62
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:03,669
that that was stronger than the central
powers and so that the british could

63
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:04,790
produce more

64
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:08,110
tanks and more guns and more weapons
owes a race against that

65
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,080
and there is also a race against
significant american and to remember and

66
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,610
april nineteen seventeen woodrow wilson

67
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:19,309
uh... gives a speech to congress they
declare war on the central powers

68
00:03:19,309 --> 00:03:20,170
and so

69
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,970
the germans one of my get this thing
over with before the americans have a

70
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,709
chance to send insignificant number a
fresh troops

71
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:31,209
so in march nineteen eighteen not you
know i would give the treaty of bristol

72
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:33,190
toh disc you also have the beginning

73
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:38,679
of german germany's attempted to deal
that decisive blow to the allies

74
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:41,079
and it's known as the spring offensive

75
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:43,579
so you have the spring

76
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:45,809
whispering

77
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:46,819
offensive

78
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:50,290
and that the goal of the spring ascends
offensive was too

79
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,329
was a sense you try to end the war for
the germans

80
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:57,799
and the and the goal was to separate the
british from the french forces the

81
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:02,049
british for the most part were control
of the line right over here north of the

82
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:05,059
summer her all the french word control
south of it

83
00:04:05,059 --> 00:04:08,549
so spring offensive as was the first
phases of the spring offensive in march

84
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:09,710
nineteen eighteen

85
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,169
focused on this area

86
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:16,049
overhear at first it was actually very
successful they were able to make huge

87
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:17,860
territorial gains

88
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,969
drive through the lines drive the allied
powers back

89
00:04:21,969 --> 00:04:25,419
now the problem was is that it wasn't
too a real big strategic gain the

90
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:28,709
germans were just hoping it would be
such a demoralize or that it would throw

91
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:30,210
at least maybe the french

92
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:33,250
out of the war that maybe they could
take care of the british her or whatever

93
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,259
else

94
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:37,009
but that didn't happen all the suddenly
found themselves with ease

95
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:38,710
huge territorial gains

96
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:43,220
in very short amount of time to have to
supply themselves aideed and and they

97
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,180
didn't really quite and it spread their
their troops then

98
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:51,090
and so it frankly just let let the
opportunity arise for the allies in

99
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:51,959
august

100
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,590
to lead a counter-offensive

101
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:58,660
counteroffensive by the allies is
referred to as a hundred days offensive

102
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,599
that began in august when roughly into
november so a hundred days

103
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:04,019
hundred

104
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:06,339
days offensive

105
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:10,400
during which the allies between august
of empyrean bottle push

106
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,229
the germans not only baka beyond what
they had captured during the spring

107
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,949
offensive but all the way well back of

108
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,500
on the front that wasn't

109
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,560
kind of the stalemate line for most of
world war one

110
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,419
and it was during this hundred days
offensive that the most objective

111
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,780
observers it was clear

112
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,900
the allies would win this war

113
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,500
and it was clear to several of the
central powers are those allied with the

114
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,399
central powers as we go into september

115
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,090
as we go into september of nineteen
eighteen

116
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,219
bulgaria

117
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:43,069
drops itself out of the war

118
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:48,060
just remind ourselves where what we're
talking about so you have a bulgaria

119
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,169
right over here

120
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:51,949
bulgaria right over here

121
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:56,639
it's signs an armistice with the allies

122
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,270
you have armistice lazo peace symbol for
armistice

123
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:03,660
that uh... armistice is just the
fighting has stopped you are you you

124
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,710
still in theory could be a state of war
so maybe i shouldn't do

125
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,489
the peace involves fret armistice

126
00:06:09,489 --> 00:06:11,219
armistice

127
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:14,309
armistice

128
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:15,319
bulgaria

129
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:18,629
and this is really starting to tighten
the noose around the remaining central

130
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,860
powers because this

131
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:26,419
this allowed at the allies to gain
control of serbia and of greece

132
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:31,200
which is senseless tied pack removes the
last four suppose for

133
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,059
austria hungary and the german empire
there's already a blockade

134
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:38,249
the kind of the harsh bridge blockade
that we've already talked about up in

135
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:41,939
the north sea and so the last source of
food was from the south but now with the

136
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:43,009
bulgaria

137
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:46,099
uh... signing an armistice unseating
over territory

138
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:50,680
now the the stranglehold was was was
really was really really coming into

139
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,099
effect

140
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:55,499
now back home or remember at this point
it's its tourist

141
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:57,370
reasonably cleared even by this point

142
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,389
even clear to the german people

143
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:02,520
that the war is pretty much done for and
they're just waiting for their leaders

144
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,819
to to make it official

145
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:06,089
the that

146
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:11,130
so several of the leaders of the german
maybe you want to do this last-ditch

147
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:15,850
what could easily be considered suicidal
offensive against the british navy and

148
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:19,389
as they're planning it and and the the
sailors catch wind of it they mean the

149
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:23,240
the the revolving say hey look the war
is over we're not gonna die

150
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,639
uh... before feudal in a futile attempt
to this kind of

151
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,399
for pride or whatever else

152
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,960
and so you have a naval mutiny begins

153
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,409
naval

154
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:33,259
uni

155
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:36,669
and eventually the spreads to the
mainland and leads to revolt soon

156
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:37,949
revolutions

157
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:39,490
so revolution

158
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:40,809
in germany

159

160
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:43,290
germany

161
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,809
and this culminates in november

162
00:07:45,809 --> 00:07:50,589
in november november ninth th famous
date in history november ninth nineteen

163

and remember nineteen nineteen eighteen

169
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,349
germany is declared a republic

170
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:13,099
so germany

171
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:17,519
no longer no longer uh... no longer has
a as a king or an empire emperor

172
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:19,399
incharge germany

173
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:24,309
become the republic and a little bit
before this november third

174
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:27,309
the writing was already on the right the
writing was already clear to the

175
00:08:27,309 --> 00:08:29,580
austrians about david in nineteen
seventeen

176
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,729
and uh... tended to make some peace
overtures thinking that they were pretty

177
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:33,800
much done for

178
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,740
but by november third nineteen eighteen

179
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,490
the austrians also cited armistice

180
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,650
armistice

181
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:44,290
armistice

182
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,490
the on streams

183
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:51,910
with the austrians and with the dayton
kaiser wilhelm the second fleeing to the

184
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,320
netherlands germany becoming republic

185
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,959
this sets up the armistice finally

186
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,370
with germany on november eleventh and
this is one of the most famous

187
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:06,710
famous dates in history known for a long
time the u<u>s</u> is armistice day

188
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:12,200
it's was november eleventh nineteen
eighteen as actually eleven a<u>m</u>

189
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,290
eleven a m so you might remember the
famous the eleventh hour of the eleventh

190
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:16,999
day

191
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:18,910
of the eleventh month

192
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:22,880
war or world war one of the fighting in
world war one

193
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,290
was over with the allies victorious in
the central powers losing it

194
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:31,809
and the terms of what would happen for
those that lost in those that one would

195
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:33,029
be dictated

196
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:34,879
by the treaty over time

197
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:36,390
if treaty of versailles

198
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:40,560
in nineteen nineteen the terms of which
were finally finalized about six months

199
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,390
later

200
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,980
so this is june

201
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,720
you have the treaty

202
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,740
treaty of

203
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,390
treaty of

204
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,890
treaty of riverside which incidentally
this is like one of those little

205
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:55,509
footnotes in history the americans did
not actually ratified

206
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:58,509
mainly because it had the league of
nations in it which was this you know

207
00:09:58,509 --> 00:09:59,270
which was nice

208
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,920
project of woodrow wilson

209
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,330
but the american people and the american
congress was not a fan of this whole

210
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,590
view no trans national government a
league of nations things

211
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,880
so that the united states

212
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,859
did not ratified the treaty of
versailles i've been a fact

213
00:10:11,859 --> 00:10:15,899
on armistice day november eleventh
eleven a<u>m</u> the war was over treaties

214
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:18,290
universe i dictated the terms

215
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,730
many would argue overly harsh terms

216
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,100
of the treaty versailles

217
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,920
and we're done with world war one
