1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,844
In this video, I want to talk a little bit about acceleration.

2
00:00:03,844 --> 00:00:06,711
Acceleration.

3
00:00:06,711 --> 00:00:09,497
And this is probably an idea that you are somewhat familiar with

4
00:00:09,497 --> 00:00:12,469
or at least you've heard the term used here or there.

5
00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:18,181
Acceleration is just the change in velocity over time.

6
00:00:18,181 --> 00:00:25,844
Change in velocity over time.

7
00:00:25,844 --> 00:00:30,727
Probably one of the most typical examples of acceleration, if you are at all interested in cars

8
00:00:30,727 --> 00:00:34,482
is that many times they will give you acceleration numbers

9
00:00:34,482 --> 00:00:36,107
especially for sport cars.

10
00:00:36,107 --> 00:00:40,844
Actually all cars, if you look up in consumer reports or wherever they give stats on different cars

11
00:00:40,844 --> 00:00:45,598
they'll tell you something like, I don't know, like a Porsche -

12
00:00:45,598 --> 00:00:48,573
and I'm going to make up these numbers right over here.

13
00:00:48,573 --> 00:00:53,290
So let's say we have a Porsche 911. Porsche 911.

14
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:57,237
They'll say that a Porsche 911 -they'll literally measure it with a stopwatch -

15
00:00:57,237 --> 00:01:01,892
can go 0 to 60 miles per hour -

16
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:04,517
and these aren't the exact numbers, although I think it's probably pretty close.

17
00:01:04,517 --> 00:01:08,794
0 to 60 miles per hour in, let's say, three seconds.

18
00:01:10,631 --> 00:01:13,108
In three seconds.

19
00:01:13,385 --> 00:01:16,467
So although officially what they are giving you right here are speeds

20
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:19,133
cause they are only giving you magnitude and no direction,

21
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:22,520
you can assume that it's in the same direction.

22
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,308
And you can say 0 mph to the East to 60 mph to the East in 3 seconds,

23
00:01:27,308 --> 00:01:30,397
so what was the acceleration here?

24
00:01:30,397 --> 00:01:33,071
So I just told you the definition of acceleration -

25
00:01:33,071 --> 00:01:35,360
it's the change in velocity over time!

26
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,326
So the acceleration, and once again, acceleration is a vector quantity.

27
00:01:39,326 --> 00:01:43,287
You want to know not only how much is velocity changing over time,

28
00:01:43,287 --> 00:01:45,283
you also care about the direction!

29
00:01:45,283 --> 00:01:48,933
It also makes sense because the velocity itself is a vector quantity.

30
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:51,061
Needs magnitude AND direction.

31
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:52,708
So the acceleration here,

32
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:57,208
and we are just going to assume that we are going to the right,

33
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:59,560
0 mph and 60 mph to the right.

34
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:05,323
So what is... It's going to be change in velocity - let me just write it down with different notation,

35
00:02:05,323 --> 00:02:08,200
just so you can familiarise yourself if you see it in a textbook this way.

36
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:16,886
So change in velocity. This delta symbol right here just means 'change in'.

37
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:21,646
Change in velocity over time. Over time.

38
00:02:21,646 --> 00:02:24,397
And it's really, as I've mentioned in previous videos,

39
00:02:24,397 --> 00:02:30,210
time, it's really change in time, but we can just write time here.

40
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,036
This 3 seconds is really change in time.

41
00:02:32,036 --> 00:02:35,997
It might have been, you know, if you looked at your second hand,

42
00:02:35,997 --> 00:02:39,707
it might have been 5 seconds when it started and it might have been 8 seconds

43
00:02:39,707 --> 00:02:41,263
when it stopped, so it took a total of 3 seconds.

44
00:02:41,263 --> 00:02:46,230
So time - it's really a change in seconds. But we'll just go with time right here,

45
00:02:46,338 --> 00:02:47,921
Or we'll go with 't'.

46
00:02:47,921 --> 00:02:50,196
So what's our change in velocity?

47
00:02:50,196 --> 00:02:53,556
So our final velocity is 60 mph.

48
00:02:53,556 --> 00:02:55,865
Our final velocity is 60 mph.

49
00:02:55,865 --> 00:02:58,819
And our original velocity was 0 mph,

50
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:01,714
so it's 60 minus 0 mph.

51
00:03:04,176 --> 00:03:06,581
And then what is our time?

52
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:08,731
What is our time over here?

53
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:10,974
Well, our time is, or we could even say

54
00:03:10,974 --> 00:03:12,631
our change in time,

55
00:03:12,631 --> 00:03:15,038
our change in time is 3 seconds.

56
00:03:15,808 --> 00:03:17,674
3 seconds.

57
00:03:18,028 --> 00:03:22,907
So this gives us 20 mph per second.

58
00:03:22,907 --> 00:03:24,515
Let me write this down.

59
00:03:24,515 --> 00:03:27,102
So this becomes... This top part is 60.

60
00:03:27,102 --> 00:03:29,363
60 divided by 3 is 20.

61
00:03:29,363 --> 00:03:32,226
So we get 20... but then the units are a little bit strange.

62
00:03:32,226 --> 00:03:35,291
We have miles... Instead of writing mph

63
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:39,582
I'm going to write miles per hour.

64
00:03:40,474 --> 00:03:43,186
That's the same thing as mph.

65
00:03:43,186 --> 00:03:46,513
And then we also, in the denominator, right over here,

66
00:03:46,513 --> 00:03:49,421
we also, right over here in the denominator

67
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:51,713
have seconds.

68
00:03:51,713 --> 00:03:53,729
Which is a little bit strange.

69
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:57,411
And, as you'll see, the units for acceleration do seem a little strange.

70
00:03:57,411 --> 00:04:00,169
But if we think it through, it actually might make a bit of sense.

71
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:02,959
So miles per hour, and then we can either put seconds,

72
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,945
like this, or we can write per second.

73
00:04:06,945 --> 00:04:08,461
And let's just think about what this is saying,

74
00:04:08,461 --> 00:04:11,659
and then we can get it all into seconds, or hours, whatever you like.

75
00:04:11,675 --> 00:04:15,569
This is saying that every second, this Porsche 911

76
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:19,109
can increase its velocity by 20 mph.

77
00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:23,036
So its acceleration is 20 miles per hour per second.

78
00:04:23,036 --> 00:04:25,732
And actually we should include a direction, cause we're talking about vector quantities.

79
00:04:26,619 --> 00:04:29,567
So this is to the east.

80
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,744
And this is east right over here.

81
00:04:32,744 --> 00:04:35,562
Just so we make sure that we're dealing with vectors.

82
00:04:35,562 --> 00:04:37,268
You're giving it a direction. Due east.

83
00:04:37,268 --> 00:04:41,641
So every second, it can increase its velocity by 20 mph.

84
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:44,477
So hopefully, the way I'm saying it makes a little bit of sense.

85
00:04:44,477 --> 00:04:46,498
20 miles per hour per second.

86
00:04:46,498 --> 00:04:48,687
That's exactly what this is talking about.

87
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:51,979
Now, we can also write it like this, this is the same thing

88
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:56,811
as 20 miles per hour...

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,360
Cause if you take something and divide it by second,

90
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,254
that's the same thing as multiplying it by 1 over second.

91
00:05:04,254 --> 00:05:08,338
So that's miles per hour seconds.

92
00:05:08,338 --> 00:05:12,082
And although this is correct, to me this makes a little less intuitive sense.

93
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:15,098
This one literally says that every second

94
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:17,271
it's increasing in velocity by 20 miles per hour.

95
00:05:17,271 --> 00:05:21,037
20 miles per hour increase in velocity per second.

96
00:05:21,037 --> 00:05:22,834
So that kind of makes sense to me.

97
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:25,200
Here it's saying 20 miles per hour seconds.

98
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,471
So once again, it's not as intuitive.

99
00:05:28,471 --> 00:05:30,966
But we can make this so it's all in one unit of time.

100
00:05:30,966 --> 00:05:33,056
Althought you don't really have to.

101
00:05:33,056 --> 00:05:35,879
You can change this so you can get rid of

102
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:37,880
maybe the hours in the denominator.

103
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,520
And the best way to get rid of an hour in the denominator

104
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,287
is by multiplying it by something that has hours in the numerator.

105
00:05:43,287 --> 00:05:49,275
So hour, and seconds. And here...

106
00:05:49,275 --> 00:05:54,233
The smaller units are seconds, so it's 3600 seconds for every 1 hour.

107
00:05:54,325 --> 00:05:56,795
Or, one hour is equal to 3600 seconds.

108
00:05:56,887 --> 00:06:01,141
Or, 1/3600 of an hour per second.

109
00:06:01,141 --> 00:06:05,825
All of those are legitime ways to interpret this thing in magenta right over here.

110
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:07,479
And then you multiply.

111
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:09,129
Do a little dimensional analysis.

112
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:12,253
Hour cancels with hour, and then you have...

113
00:06:12,253 --> 00:06:14,621
This will be equal to...

114
00:06:14,621 --> 00:06:18,621
This will be equal to 20/3600.

115
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:21,200
20/3600.

116
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,969
Miles per seconds times seconds.

117
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:28,069
Or we could say, miles... Let me write it this way.

118
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:31,769
Miles per seconds times seconds.

119
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,561
Or you could say, miles per second...

120
00:06:34,592 --> 00:06:36,769
I want to do that in another colour.

121
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:39,361
Miles per second squared.

122
00:06:39,757 --> 00:06:44,204
Miles per seconds... Miles per second squared.

123
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:45,882
And we can simplify this a little bit.

124
00:06:45,882 --> 00:06:48,825
Divide the denominator and numerator by ten.

125
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,545
You get 2 over 360.

126
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:57,849
Or you could get.. This is the same thing as 1 over... 1 over 180.

127
00:06:57,849 --> 00:07:04,271
Miles per second squared. Per second squared.

128
00:07:04,271 --> 00:07:06,276
I'll just abbreviate like that.

129
00:07:06,276 --> 00:07:08,405
And once again, this doesn't make...

130
00:07:08,405 --> 00:07:10,521
1 180th of a mile. How much is that?

131
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:11,871
You might want to convert it to feet,

132
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,315
but the whole point here is,

133
00:07:13,315 --> 00:07:14,748
I just wanted to show you that

134
00:07:14,748 --> 00:07:16,446
well, one, how do you calculate acceleration,

135
00:07:16,446 --> 00:07:18,548
and give you a little bit of sense what it means.

136
00:07:18,548 --> 00:07:20,738
And once again, what you have here,

137
00:07:20,738 --> 00:07:22,954
when you have seconds squared in the bottom of the units,

138
00:07:22,954 --> 00:07:26,600
it doesn't make a ton sense, but we could rewrite it like this up here.

139
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:36,067
This is 180... or 1 / 180 miles per second...

140
00:07:36,067 --> 00:07:40,655
and then we divide by seconds again: per second.

141
00:07:40,655 --> 00:07:44,208
Or maybe I can write it like this; per second.

142
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,585
Where this whole thing is the numerator.

143
00:07:46,585 --> 00:07:49,884
So this makes a little bit more sense from an acceleration point of view.

144
00:07:49,884 --> 00:07:52,673
One over 180 miles per second...

145
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:55,523
Every second this Porsche 911 is going

146
00:07:55,523 --> 00:08:01,631
to go 1 /180 of a mile per second faster.

147
00:08:01,631 --> 00:08:04,790
And actually it's probably more intuitive to stick to the miles per hour,

148
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,529
cause that's something that we have a little bit more sense on.

149
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,387
And another way to visualize it.

150
00:08:09,387 --> 00:08:10,734
Another way to visualize it.

151
00:08:10,734 --> 00:08:13,446
If you were driving that Porsche, and

152
00:08:13,446 --> 00:08:16,225
you were looking at the speedometer of that Porsche,

153
00:08:16,225 --> 00:08:17,856
and if the acceleration was constant,

154
00:08:17,856 --> 00:08:20,344
it's actually not going to be completely constant,

155
00:08:20,344 --> 00:08:22,128
and if you looked at this speedometer...

156
00:08:22,128 --> 00:08:23,271
Let me draw it,

157
00:08:23,271 --> 00:08:30,328
so this would be 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60.

158
00:08:30,328 --> 00:08:32,748
This is probably not what the speedometer for a Porsche looks like,

159
00:08:32,748 --> 00:08:35,386
this is probably more analogous to a small

160
00:08:35,386 --> 00:08:38,594
four cylinder car's speedometer, I suspect

161
00:08:38,594 --> 00:08:40,305
the Porsche's speedometer goes much beyond

162
00:08:40,305 --> 00:08:42,782
60 mph, but you would see, for something

163
00:08:42,782 --> 00:08:46,136
accelerating this fast, is right when you're starting,

164
00:08:46,136 --> 00:08:48,364
the speedometer would be right there.

165
00:08:48,364 --> 00:08:51,462
And then every second, it would be 20 mph faster.

166
00:08:51,462 --> 00:08:54,758
So after a second, the speedometer would have moved this far.

167
00:08:54,758 --> 00:08:57,837
After another second, the speedometer would have moved this far.

168
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:01,400
And then after another second, the speedometer would have moved that far.

169
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,246
And the entire time you would have kind of been pasted to the back of your seat.
