1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,347
Newton's first law tells us that an object at rest will stay at rest

2
00:00:04,347 --> 00:00:08,666
and an object with a constant velocity will keep having that constant velocity

3
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:12,482
unless it's affected by some type of net force

4
00:00:12,482 --> 00:00:18,953
or you actually could say an object with constant velocity will stay having a constant velocity

5
00:00:18,953 --> 00:00:20,819
unless it's affected by net force

6
00:00:20,819 --> 00:00:24,867
because really this takes into consideration the situation where an object is at rest

7
00:00:24,867 --> 00:00:28,305
you could just have a situation where the constant velocity is zero

8
00:00:28,305 --> 00:00:32,417
So Newton's first law, you're gonna have your constant velocity it could be zero,

9
00:00:32,417 --> 00:00:36,973
it's going to stay being that constant velocity unless it's affected, unless there's some net force

10
00:00:36,973 --> 00:00:40,452
that acts on it, so that leads to the natural question:

11
00:00:40,452 --> 00:00:46,463
How does a net force affect the constant velocity? or how does it affect the state of an object?

12
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:49,587
And that's what Newton's second law gives us.

13
00:00:49,587 --> 00:00:59,438
So Newton's second law of motion.

14
00:00:59,438 --> 00:01:04,599
And this one is maybe the most famous, they're all kind of famous

15
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:09,098
actually, I won't pick favorites here, but this one gives us the famous formula

16
00:01:09,098 --> 00:01:14,698
Force is equal to Mass times Acceleration

17
00:01:14,698 --> 00:01:19,659
And acceleration is a vector quantity and force is a vector quantity

18
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:22,300
and what it tells us, because we're saying okay, if you apply force

19
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,302
it might change that constant velocity

20
00:01:24,302 --> 00:01:26,357
but how does it change that constant velocity?

21
00:01:26,357 --> 00:01:30,318
We'll say I have a brick right here, and it is floating in space

22
00:01:30,318 --> 00:01:35,918
Newton's second law tells us, and it's pretty nice for us that the laws of the universe,

23
00:01:35,918 --> 00:01:38,367
or at least in the classical sense, before Einstein showed up,

24
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:41,386
the laws of the universe actually dealt with pretty simple mathematics

25
00:01:41,386 --> 00:01:49,518
what it tells us is if you apply a net force on this side of the object

26
00:01:49,518 --> 00:01:52,952
and we talk about net force because if you apply two forces that cancel out,

27
00:01:52,952 --> 00:01:58,335
and have zero net force, then the object <i>won't</i> change it's constant velocity

28
00:01:58,335 --> 00:02:01,302
if you have a net force applied to one side of this object,

29
00:02:01,302 --> 00:02:08,006
then you're going to have a net acceleration going in the same direction

30
00:02:08,006 --> 00:02:12,350
and what Newton's second law of motion tells us is that acceleration

31
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:17,553
is proportional to the force applied, or the force applied is proportional to that acceleration

32
00:02:17,553 --> 00:02:22,851
and the constant of proportionality or to figure out what you have to multiply

33
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:27,384
the acceleration by to get the force, or what you have to divide the force by to get the acceleration

34
00:02:27,384 --> 00:02:34,375
is called mass, that is an object's mass.

35
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:38,930
and I'll make a whole video on this, you should not confuse mass with weight

36
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,483
and I'll make a whole video on the difference between mass and weight

37
00:02:42,483 --> 00:02:47,830
mass is a measure of how much stuff there is, now that we'll see in the future

38
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:51,861
there are other things that we don't normally consider "stuff" that does start to have mass

39
00:02:51,861 --> 00:02:56,579
but for our classical or at least a first year physics course, you can really just imagine how much

40
00:02:56,579 --> 00:03:03,130
"stuff" there is. Weight, as we'll see in a future video, is how much that stuff is being pulled down

41
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:09,080
by the force of gravity, so weight is a force, mass is telling you how much stuff there is.

42
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,431
And this is really neat that this formula is so simple, because, maybe we could have lived in a universe

43
00:03:14,431 --> 00:03:22,829
where force is equal to mass squared times the square root of acceleration

44
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:25,809
which would have made all of our math much more complicated

45
00:03:25,809 --> 00:03:28,696
but it's nice, it's just this constant proportionality over here

46
00:03:28,696 --> 00:03:31,312
it's just this nice simple expression

47
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:35,795
and just to get our feet wet a little bit with the computations involved

48
00:03:35,795 --> 00:03:41,628
in force, mass, and acceleration, let's say that I have a force

49
00:03:41,628 --> 00:03:47,010
and the unit of force is a appropriately called the Newton.

50
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:56,470
So let's say I have a force of 10 Newtons, and just to be clear, a newton is the same thing

51
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:02,311
this is the same thing as 10 kilogram meters per second squared

52
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:06,308
and that's good that a Newton's the same thing as kilogram meters per second squared, because

53
00:04:06,308 --> 00:04:09,558
that's exactly what you get on this side of the formula

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let's say I have a force of 10 Newtons

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and is acting on a mass

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let's say that the mass is 2 kilograms,

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I wanna know the acceleration.

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
... I wanna know the acceleration.

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and once again in this video, these are vector quantities

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If I have a positive value here, we're going to make the assumption that

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we are going to the right.

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if I had a negative value, then it would be going to the left.

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So implicitly, I'm giving you not only the magnitude of the force,

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but I'm also giving you the direction.

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm saying it is "to the right", because it is positive.

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So what would be the acceleration?

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We just use F=m*a.

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You have, on the left hand side, 10 N,

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I could write 10 N here or I could write 10 kg m/s^2, and that

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is going to be equal to the mass, which is 2 kg,

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
times the acceleration.

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then to solve for the acceleration,

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you just divide both sides by 2kg.

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's divide by 2 kg, let's divide the right...

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or let me do it this way...

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let's divide the right by 2 kg

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that cancels out,

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the 10 and the 2, 10 divide by 2, is...

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
lemme just... 10 divide by 2 is 5, and you have

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
kg cancelling with kg,

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
your left hand side, you get 5 m/s^2

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that's equal to your acceleration.

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, just for fun, what happens if I double that force?

84
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well then I have... 20 N,

85
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Oh well, I'll actually work it out

86
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I have 20 kg m/s^2

87
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is equal to ... I need to color code this...

88
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
2 kg times the acceleration,

89
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
divide both sides by 2kg,

90
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
divide both sides by 2kg,

91
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and what do we get? Cancels out,

92
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
20 divided by 2, is 10, kg cancel with kg,

93
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so we have the acceleration, in this situation,

94
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is is 10 m/s^2... is equal to the acceleration.

95
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, when we double the force, we went from 10 N to 20 N

96
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the acceleration doubled. It went from 5 m/s^2

97
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and to 10 m/s^2. So we see that they are

98
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
directly proportional, and the mass is that

99
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
how proportional they are. So you could imagine, what happens if

100
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we doubled the mass. If we doubled the mass, and

101
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let's say in this situation, it was 20 N, then we won't be dividing

102
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
by 2 kg anymore, we would be dividing by 4 kg.

103
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so then we would have 20 divided by 4, which would be 5 m/s^2

104
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if you make the mass larger, if you doubled

105
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it, your acceleration would be half as much.

106
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So the larger the mass you have, the more force you need to accelerate it.
