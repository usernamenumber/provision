1
00:00:00,219 --> 00:00:06,067
What I want to do in this video is talk about plate tectonics

2
00:00:06,067 --> 00:00:08,404
You have probably heard the words before,

3
00:00:08,404 --> 00:00:14,076
and you might be somewhat familiar with what it discusses.

4
00:00:14,076 --> 00:00:19,150
It's really just the idea that the surface of the earth

5
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,336
is made up of a bunch of these rigid plates,

6
00:00:22,336 --> 00:00:25,474
so it's broken up into a bunch rigid plates,

7
00:00:25,474 --> 00:00:29,010
and this rigid plates move relative to each other

8
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,642
and take everything that's on them for a ride

9
00:00:32,642 --> 00:00:37,003
and the things that are on them include the continents.

10
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:40,135
so the theory is talking about the movement of these plates.

11
00:00:40,135 --> 00:00:45,404
Over here I have a picture I got off of Wikipedia of the actual plates.

12
00:00:45,404 --> 00:00:47,737
And over here you have the Pacific Plate,

13
00:00:47,737 --> 00:00:51,737
you have the Nazca Plate, the South Amearican Plate,

14
00:00:51,737 --> 00:00:53,803
I can keep going on, we even have the Antarctic Plate,

15
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:57,886
obviously when you do a projection onto two dimensions of a surface of a sphere

16
00:00:57,886 --> 00:01:02,142
the stuff on the bottom and the top look much bigger than they actually are, Antartica isn't this big

17
00:01:02,142 --> 00:01:06,866
relitive to say North America or South America, we just had to streach it out to fill up the rectangle.

18
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:09,405
but that's the Antarctic Plate, North American Plate,

19
00:01:09,405 --> 00:01:12,809
and you can see that they're actually moving relative to each other,

20
00:01:12,809 --> 00:01:16,000
that's what these arrows are depicting.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,003
You can see right over here the Nazca Plate and the Pacific Plate

22
00:01:20,003 --> 00:01:23,071
are moving away from each other, new land is formed here,

23
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:25,012
we'll talk more about that in other videos.

24
00:01:25,012 --> 00:01:27,886
You see right over here, in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean,

25
00:01:27,886 --> 00:01:31,743
the African Plate and the South American Plate meet each other

26
00:01:31,743 --> 00:01:33,472
and they're moving away from each other,

27
00:01:33,472 --> 00:01:36,557
which means that more new land, more plate material,

28
00:01:36,557 --> 00:01:40,669
I quess you could say, is somehow being created right here,

29
00:01:40,669 --> 00:01:42,142
we'll be talk about that in future videos,

30
00:01:42,142 --> 00:01:45,808
and pushing these two plates apart.

31
00:01:45,808 --> 00:01:49,944
Now, before we go into the evidence for plate tectonics,

32
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:53,270
where we'll say some of the more details about how plates are created

33
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,071
and some theories as to why the plates might move,

34
00:01:57,071 --> 00:01:59,404
but I want to get to a little bit of the terminology

35
00:01:59,404 --> 00:02:01,803
of plate tectonics out of the way.

36
00:02:01,803 --> 00:02:04,404
Because sometimes people call them crustal plates,

37
00:02:04,404 --> 00:02:06,898
and that's not exactly right.

38
00:02:06,898 --> 00:02:10,918
I want to show you the difference, two different ways

39
00:02:10,918 --> 00:02:13,409
of classifying the different layers of the Earth

40
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:15,560
and to think about how they might rely to each other.

41
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,336
So what you traditionally see, and actually I made a video

42
00:02:18,336 --> 00:02:19,896
that goes into a lot more detail of this,

43
00:02:19,896 --> 00:02:24,473
is a breakdown of the chemical layers of the Earth.

44
00:02:24,473 --> 00:02:26,667
When I talk about chemical layers, I'm talking about

45
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:29,480
what are the constituents of the different layers.

46
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,137
So when you talk within this term,

47
00:02:31,137 --> 00:02:33,738
the tough most layer, which is the thinnest layer,

48
00:02:33,738 --> 00:02:37,675
is the crust.

49
00:02:37,675 --> 00:02:42,739
Then below that is the mantle.

50
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:47,404
Actually, let me show you the whole Earth where I can draw the scale.

51
00:02:47,404 --> 00:02:50,451
So far we have drawn the crust,

52
00:02:50,451 --> 00:02:54,161
the crust is the outer, the thinnest outer layer of the Earth,

53
00:02:54,161 --> 00:02:57,009
you can imagine the blue line itself is the crust.

54
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:59,873
Then below that you have the mantel,

55
00:02:59,873 --> 00:03:06,058
so everything between the blue and orange line is the mantle,

56
00:03:06,181 --> 00:03:09,067
let me label the crust.

57
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:10,532
The crust you can literally view

58
00:03:10,532 --> 00:03:12,733
as the actuall blue pixels over here.

59
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:16,477
And then inside of the mantle you have the core.

60
00:03:16,477 --> 00:03:18,669
And when you do this very high-level division,

61
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:21,199
these are chemical divisions.

62
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:24,539
This is saying that the crust is made up of different types of elements.

63
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:29,308
Its make-up is different than the stuff that's in the mantle

64
00:03:29,308 --> 00:03:31,336
which is made up of different things

65
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,136
than what's inside of the core.

66
00:03:34,136 --> 00:03:37,812
It's not describing the mechanical properties of it.

67
00:03:37,812 --> 00:03:40,404
When I talk about mechanical properties, I'm talking about ...

68
00:03:40,404 --> 00:03:46,932
so mechanical properties

69
00:03:46,932 --> 00:03:53,142
are whether something is solid and rigid.

70
00:03:53,142 --> 00:03:55,670
Or maybe it's so hot-melted,

71
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,554
it's kind of a magma or plastic solid.

72
00:03:58,554 --> 00:04:04,003
So this would be the most brittle stuff if it gets formed up,

73
00:04:04,003 --> 00:04:08,006
if rock starts to melt a little bit, then you have something like a magma

74
00:04:08,006 --> 00:04:11,405
or you can view it as like a deformable or plastic solid.

75
00:04:11,405 --> 00:04:13,475
When I'm talking about plastic

76
00:04:13,475 --> 00:04:18,308
I'm not talking about the stuff that the case of your cell phone is made up,

77
00:04:18,308 --> 00:04:21,310
I'm talking about it's deformable, this rock is deformable

78
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,895
because it's so hot and it's somewhat melted

79
00:04:23,895 --> 00:04:27,333
it kind of behaves like a fluid.

80
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,070
It actually does behave like a fluid, but it's much more viscous,

81
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,936
it's much thicker and slower-moving than what we would

82
00:04:32,936 --> 00:04:35,078
normally associate with a fluid like water.

83
00:04:35,078 --> 00:04:40,270
So this is a viscous fluid.

84
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,944
And then the most fluid would of course be

85
00:04:42,944 --> 00:04:45,724
the liquid state.

86
00:04:45,724 --> 00:04:48,000
This is what we mean when we talk about mechanical properties.

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,721
When you look at this division over here,

88
00:04:50,721 --> 00:04:54,200
the crust is solid,

89
00:04:54,216 --> 00:04:58,403
the mantle actually has some parts of it that are solid,

90
00:04:58,403 --> 00:05:01,210
so the uppermost part of the mantle is solid,

91
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:06,601
then below that, the rest of the mantle is in this magma,

92
00:05:06,601 --> 00:05:11,144
this deformable, somewhat fluid state,

93
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,555
and depending on what depth you go into the mantle

94
00:05:13,555 --> 00:05:15,543
there are different levels of fluidity,

95
00:05:15,543 --> 00:05:19,892
and then the core, the outer layer of the core is liquid

96
00:05:19,892 --> 00:05:21,602
because the temperature is so high,

97
00:05:21,602 --> 00:05:24,474
the inner core is made up of the same things

98
00:05:24,474 --> 00:05:27,199
and the temperature is even higher

99
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,670
but also the pressure is so high, so it's actually solid.

100
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,275
So that's why the mantle, crust and core differentiation

101
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:34,345
doesn't tell you about mechanical stuff,

102
00:05:34,345 --> 00:05:36,404
whether it's solid, whether it's magma

103
00:05:36,404 --> 00:05:38,607
whether it's really liquid.

104
00:05:38,607 --> 00:05:40,391
It literally tells you what the make-up is.

105
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:43,556
Now to think about the make-up, and this is important plate tectonics,

106
00:05:43,556 --> 00:05:47,071
so we talk about these plates, we're not talking about just the crust,

107
00:05:47,071 --> 00:05:49,212
we're talking about the outer rigid layer.

108
00:05:49,212 --> 00:05:52,406
Let me just zoom it a little bit,

109
00:05:52,406 --> 00:05:56,895
let's say we're zoomed in right over there.

110
00:05:56,895 --> 00:05:59,872
So now we have the crust zoomed in,

111
00:05:59,872 --> 00:06:01,555
this right over here is the crust.

112
00:06:01,555 --> 00:06:06,812
And then everything below here, we're actually talking about the upper mantle.

113
00:06:06,812 --> 00:06:10,140
We haven't gone too deep in the mantle right here,

114
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:17,647
so that's what we call the upper mantle.

115
00:06:17,647 --> 00:06:20,404
Right below the crust the mantle is cool enough

116
00:06:20,404 --> 00:06:23,601
that it is also in real solid form.

117
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:29,807
So this right here is solid mantle.

118
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:34,343
And when we talk about the plates, we're actually talking about the outer solid layer,

119
00:06:34,343 --> 00:06:40,000
that includes both the crust and the solid part of the mantle.

120
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,863
We call that the lithosphere.

121
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,975
When people talk about plate tectonics,

122
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:50,070
they shouldn't say crustal plates.

123
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:56,178
They should call these lithospheric plates.

124
00:06:56,178 --> 00:07:02,647
Below the lithosphere you have the least viscous part of the mantle

125
00:07:02,647 --> 00:07:07,556
because the temperature is high enough for the rock to melt,

126
00:07:07,556 --> 00:07:13,477
but the pressure isn't so big as in the lower part of the mantle

127
00:07:13,477 --> 00:07:17,666
that the fluid can actually kind of move past each other.

128
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:20,277
Although it's still pretty viscous, it's still a magma.

129
00:07:20,277 --> 00:07:23,742
So this is still kind of in its magma state,

130
00:07:23,742 --> 00:07:26,308
and this fluid part of the mantle

131
00:07:26,308 --> 00:07:28,404
we can't quite call it liquid yet,

132
00:07:28,404 --> 00:07:31,669
but over large periods of time it does have fliud properties.

133
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:35,540
This that essetnially the lithisphere is kind of riding on top of

134
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:41,147
we call this the asthenosphere.

135
00:07:41,147 --> 00:07:43,611
So when we talk about the lithosphere and asthenosphere

136
00:07:43,611 --> 00:07:45,611
we're really talking about machanical layers.

137
00:07:45,611 --> 00:07:47,737
The outer layer, the solid layer is the lithosphere,

138
00:07:47,737 --> 00:07:50,473
the more fluid layer right below that is the asthenosphere.

139
00:07:50,473 --> 00:07:52,558
When we talk about the crust, mantle and core

140
00:07:52,558 --> 00:07:55,003
we're talking about chemical properties,

141
00:07:55,003 --> 00:07:59,000
what are the things actually made up of.
