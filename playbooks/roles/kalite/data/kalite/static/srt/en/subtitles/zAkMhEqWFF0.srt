1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
   

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,770
I think we know enough about
shorting now that we can start

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,390
thinking about whether it's a
good or bad thing to have in

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:08,290
financial markets.

5
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,040
And what I've done here is
I've drawn a hypothetical

6
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,310
stock chart for a company.

7
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,790
This time right here.

8
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,980
This is the price
of the company.

9
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,860
And let's just say that this is
a chart in a universe that

10
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,810
doesn't have short
sellers in it.

11
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,920
So this is all-- here a lot of
people are buying the stock,

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,140
then over here some people,
maybe they get freaked out or

13
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,510
whatever, they start selling.

14
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,780
And then more people buy.

15
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,880
So demands a little higher
than supply, so

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,290
the price goes up.

17
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,940
And that just generally
drives the volatility.

18
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,140
Now in a short selling world,
what would happen?

19
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,980
Let's let's think about two
scenarios, a short seller who

20
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,290
makes money, and a short
seller who loses money.

21
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,400
So a short seller
making money.

22
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,890
What would a short seller making
money have to do if

23
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:54,900
this is the stock chart.

24
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,960
Obviously, they don't see the
stock chart beyond the day

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,170
that they're actually making
the trade, but in order to

26
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,820
make money they'll actually--
they'll have to short at the

27
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:03,670
local peaks.

28
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,209
And they would have to
cover their shorts

29
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:05,940
at the local minimum.

30
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,260
So a good short seller-- or
you can even say a perfect

31
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,940
short seller would maybe short
here-- let me make it a

32
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,100
different color so you can see
where he's acting-- would

33
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,970
short here and then
cover there.

34
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,310
And he would make that much
money on that move.

35
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,190
And then he would wait a little
bit, wait for the stock

36
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,880
to get expensive again
in his mind.

37
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,820
And he would short here, and
then he would cover here.

38
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,010
This would kind of be--
obviously it's very unlikely

39
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,905
that someone could so well pick
tops and bottoms. But

40
00:01:33,905 --> 00:01:36,640
let's say they're just really
good at their analysis and

41
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,900
figuring out market psychology
and things like that.

42
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,120
And they would just
keep doing it.

43
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,210
They would short here
and cover here.

44
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,450
What would that actually
do to the stock?

45
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,170
The green line was a
reality where you

46
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,740
had no short sellers.

47
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,700
Now if all of a sudden you
allowed short selling, and

48
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,940
they had these guys come into
the market who know how to

49
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,360
make money shorting.

50
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,780
He's shorting up here.

51
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,990
So what would shorting do?

52
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,390
Shorting is you're borrowing
the stock and selling it.

53
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,360
So he's creating extra supply
for the stock, right?

54
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,760
So what he would be doing at
this point, by shorting, is he

55
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,870
would actually be lowering
the price at this point.

56
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,940
So let me draw the curve.

57
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,690
So if there's a bunch of short
sellers acting in this range,

58
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,360
it would actually
lower the peak.

59
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,620
Because you have a bunch--
you have some

60
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,250
more aggregate sellers.

61
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,520
So the price wouldn't
go as high.

62
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,200
And then on the other hand,
these short sellers have to

63
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,860
cover right here, right?

64
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,670
They're going to cover
their position.

65
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:34,200
So at the low point you have
more aggregate buyers covering

66
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,420
a short position, is just you're
buying the stock to pay

67
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,460
it back, because you borrowed
it earlier.

68
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,330
So here you would have more
aggregate buyers.

69
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,450
And then at this point, once
again you have more aggregate

70
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,680
sellers, so the price
won't go as high.

71
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,490
You have more aggregate buyers
here, because the short

72
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,790
sellers need to cover, so the
price won't go as low.

73
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,630
And so forth and so on.

74
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:01,020
And the bottom line is, a short
seller who's making

75
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,480
money on the stock market, so
they're shorting the stock at

76
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,850
peaks and covering the stock
at troughs, is actually

77
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,840
reducing the volatility
of the stock.

78
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,900
And that's good for everybody.

79
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,300
That's good for the company's
management.

80
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,050
That's good for the actual
shareholders of the company.

81
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,780
And obviously it's good for the
short sellers because they

82
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,950
are actually making money.

83
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,830
And this is actually true for
anyone making money in the

84
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:23,390
stock market.

85
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,570
That they're reducing
volatility.

86
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,620
What is a long-- just a regular
investor-- or I guess

87
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,440
you could call them a trader
since they're buying and

88
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,700
selling-- a regular trader would
make money by buying

89
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,640
here and selling here.

90
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,190
   

91
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:42,570
So really a regular trader
is not any different.

92
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,670
A regular long trader is no
different than a short seller,

93
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,870
it's just the order in which
they're buying or selling.

94
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,750
But anyone making money is
buying at low points and

95
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,070
selling at high points.

96
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,820
And anyone doing that is
helping to reduce the

97
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,170
volatility in the stock.

98
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:59,130
And even if you're a long term
buy and hold player, you would

99
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:05,470
rather sit and hold a stock--
you would rather be a holder

100
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:09,460
of a stock that does this,
than a holder of a

101
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:14,710
stock that does this.

102
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:17,899
Now there are a lot of players
both on-- you could call them

103
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:20,070
traders because they're buying
and selling on a regular

104
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:25,450
basis-- that aren't kind
of doing this.

105
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:29,210
Maybe they're piling on the
shorts at a low point and

106
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,490
they're causing the stock
to go down even more.

107
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,980
And then, when the stock starts
to move up they get

108
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,160
scared and they buy it, and
it causes the stock to

109
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,350
move up even more.

110
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,180
And it increases the volatility
of the stock.

111
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,020
But these guys are being
penalized because they're

112
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,020
losing money.

113
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,630
The people who sell at low
points and then buy at high

114
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,590
points, and increase
the volatility,

115
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,600
they're getting killed.

116
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,020
They're falling every day.

117
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,350
So it's not like you
have to create some

118
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,420
penalty for those guys.

119
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,980
Their penalty is that
they're just bad

120
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,710
traders, they're bad investors.

121
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,570
And they're just going
to lose their shirts.

122
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,430
So if you're assuming that none
of these traders in any

123
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:06,400
way manipulating the markets
or spreading false rumors.

124
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,790
Anyone making money on a stock,
as long as they're not

125
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,700
manipulating it, on either the
short or the long side, is

126
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,290
actually a net asset
for the stock.

127
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,540
That they're actually reducing
the volatility

128
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,970
of the stock price.

129
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,160
I guess another thing to think
about and this is just from

130
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,490
a-- it's good.

131
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,500
They're reducing the volatility,
so from that point

132
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,270
sorting doesn't seem too
bad, for me, or in

133
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,820
general to the market.

134
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,150
But another way to think about
it is, kind of where are all

135
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,490
the incentives in the markets?

136
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,530
Who has an incentive to be
positive on a stock?

137
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,710
And who has an incentive to
be a negative on a stock?

138
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:40,960
Or to scrutinize a stocks?

139
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:48,640
   

140
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,950
Well, the biggest, I guess
cheerleaders, for a stock, and

141
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,800
it depends on their degree of
kind of credibility or ethics,

142
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,300
would be the company's
management, right?

143
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:08,180
These are people-- it would
be company's management.

144
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,520
These are people who obviously
run the company, but they have

145
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,890
the best transparency into the
financials of a company, and

146
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,190
they tend to be shareholders
of the company or get

147
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,160
compensated based on
how the stock does.

148
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,190
So these guys have every
incentive to be positive.

149
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:25,000
And, as we've seen multiple
examples of, whether you're

150
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,450
talking about the investment
banks, or Enron, or Accenture,

151
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:32,470
they'll often kind of hide the
truth when things get bad.

152
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:37,410
So these guys are definitely big
time positive on stocks.

153
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,300
Then, let's see, who are the
other players or the

154
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,950
influencers on financial
markets?

155
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,130
Well, a big one is the
financial press.

156
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,740
And I'll write it out here so we
can have a discussion about

157
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,340
whether they are pumpers of
stock or whether they tend to

158
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,120
be more-- whether they tend
to scrutinize things

159
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,480
a little bit more.

160
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,350
An important thing to think
about with the financial

161
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,130
press, and next time you watch
CNBC-- and I don't want to

162
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:03,600
just pick on them-- is how
do they make money?

163
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,560
Do they make money by
finding things that

164
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,820
are wrong with companies?

165
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,260
Do they make money by
making you money?

166
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,950
No, they make money
by selling ads.

167
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:17,160
   

168
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,640
And then the next question,
obviously, is who are they

169
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,000
selling ads to?

170
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,600
Are they selling ads for mops?

171
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,430
Are they selling ads
for bicycles?

172
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:29,485
No, they're selling ads to
financial services companies.

173
00:07:29,485 --> 00:07:35,220
   

174
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,180
So people who want to manage
your wealth, stock brokers,

175
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,890
mutual fund companies, anyone
who can advertise.

176
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,210
And this is key, too, because--
I don't know, you're

177
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,700
probably not aware of it but
hedge funds can't advertise,

178
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:51,080
so they're not consumers of the
financial-- or they're not

179
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,500
customers of the financial
press.

180
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,180
The only people who are
customers of the financial

181
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,510
press are money managers,
financial planners, and things

182
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:05,600
like that-- brokers,
mutual funds.

183
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,320
And all of these guys benefit
when stock markets go up.

184
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:15,530
Obviously mutual fund managers
will-- they tend to be long

185
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,850
only, so they only want
things to go up.

186
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,530
Stock brokers-- you might say,
oh you know, a stock broker

187
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,790
can advise you to go long or
short and they just care about

188
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,870
how many transactions
you make.

189
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:28,110
But in general, more and more
people put money into the

190
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,160
stock market in rising
markets.

191
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,590
In a market like you're seeing
right now over the last year,

192
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:36,010
people are pulling out-- you
could say oh, maybe people

193
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,789
aren't doing more transactions,
but the general

194
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,190
net effect is, people
are pulling

195
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,240
money out of the markets.

196
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,100
So when they're pulling money
out of the markets, brokers

197
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,220
are getting less transactions,
they're managing less money.

198
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,340
And that's also true of
the money managers.

199
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:52,010
And there's also just another
ancillary side effect, is when

200
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:55,760
markets go down and people
become less excited about the

201
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,220
stock market, people stop
watching CNBC and CNNfn.

202
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:06,200
And so even those few ads that
are for mops and for bicycles

203
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,940
and for cars will get
fewer viewers.

204
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,120
So in general the financial
press, at least in my opinion,

205
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,600
is squarely in this camp.

206
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,680
   

207
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,700
And then we can talk more, you
know, sell side analysts.

208
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,910
You've probably heard the term
sell side and buy side.

209
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,170
But sell side analysts are the
analysts that work for the

210
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,780
major brokerages and investment
banks, who publish

211
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,280
those reports that you see in
those ratings, a buy rating on

212
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,680
IBM, or whatever.

213
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,860
And the reason why they call
them sell side analysts is

214
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,150
because they work for the people
who are essentially, on

215
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:44,720
some level, selling-- you could
either view them as they

216
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,460
often offer securities, or they
offer financial services

217
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,860
to, often the companies
themselves, or to potential

218
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,210
acquirers of the companies.

219
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:58,070
Or they're selling their
services-- I mean, usually--

220
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,150
they're brokerage services, so
they're trying to get people

221
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:04,980
to transact, they're actually
brokers on some level.

222
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,800
But clearly these guys, their
incentive, since their

223
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,790
customer tends to be the
management of companies, is to

224
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,840
be very, very, very positive.

225
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,670
And you should say oh, there
are other people who, their

226
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,950
whole job is to scrutinize
these people.

227
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,930
Like, the government.

228
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,470
But if you think about it once
again, the government likes a

229
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,580
rising stock market.

230
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,130
It takes-- when people's 401k's
are rising, the economy

231
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,450
does better, the government
doesn't have to worry as much

232
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:34,250
about other types of social
benefits, and unemployment,

233
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,450
and things like that.

234
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:39,770
So in general, and if you want
to be more, I guess, if you

235
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,000
want to be more critical of the
government, you could also

236
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,210
say that they are, to some
degree, very close to the

237
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:48,550
management of these firms and
to financial companies.

238
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:52,170
And to some degree, these guys
have significant clout in

239
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,940
terms of lobbyists-- and, well
actually, I would even say the

240
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,180
bankers, too.

241
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,490
They have significant clout in
terms of lobbying, and just

242
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,940
access to government,
generally.

243
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,330
And government drives the
regulators, so these guys are

244
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,490
also on the positive camp.

245
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,120
And then finally you have
the ratings agencies.

246
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,680
And the ratings agencies mainly

247
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,870
operate in the debt world.

248
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,400
And we'll talk more
about that.

249
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,050
But, if you can scrutinize a
company on the debt level, and

250
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,250
you say oh wow, this company
really isn't that good,

251
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,050
they're not going to be
able pay off its debt.

252
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,100
That kills the stock.

253
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,940
But once again you have to
realize that the rating

254
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,640
agencies are also paid by the
bankers, so the rating

255
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,770
agencies are also-- have the
incentive to kind of not see

256
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,270
things when things are bad.

257
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,860
So out of everyone in the
financial services, or the

258
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,170
financial world, that we've
talked about right now, they

259
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,670
all benefit when stocks
continue to go up.

260
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:42,350
Even when they go up beyond what
they really should go up.

261
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,340
And even if they all kind of
know that things are a little

262
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,350
bit too expensive.

263
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,040
Or this management team might
be a little shady, or they

264
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,530
might be covering
up something.

265
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,060
None of these people
really have an

266
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,980
incentive to expose it.

267
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,310
And the only people who do
are the short sellers.

268
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:59,870
These are the only people who
really have, arguably the

269
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,040
sophistication and the time and
the monetary incentive to

270
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,450
really look and scrutinize
what management is doing.

271
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:10,960
To really look in the books
and kind of put a puzzle

272
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,565
together, or put a bunch of
pieces together to come to the

273
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:16,900
conclusion, wait, the numbers
that management is spouting

274
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,960
really don't add up.

275
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,250
And because of x, y and z,
this company really is

276
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,480
overvalued.

277
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,090
So to a large degree they are
kind of on society's side in

278
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:32,670
preventing management from kind
of being overly bullish.

279
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,800
And I don't want to sound like
someone who just broadly is

280
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,760
defending short sellers.

281
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,400
There is a class of short
sellers that I think would be

282
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,600
bad, and that's the people who
are spreading false rumors,

283
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,140
and being market manipulators.

284
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,200
So there's just the
general market

285
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:55,380
manipulation, or rumor mongering.

286
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,000
And that definitely is bad, and
to some degree, if you can

287
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,370
show someone is doing that,
there should be some type of

288
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,600
penalty for doing it.

289
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,380
But even there, and just it in
my experience participating in

290
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,990
public markets, if I had to
pick-- if I had to pick

291
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:14,200
between the left side of that
chart, between this side of

292
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,890
this charge and this side of
this chart-- and if I had to

293
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:20,290
say who does spread
false information

294
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,760
when it does get spread?

295
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,410
I think often times management
is a little bit more guilty of

296
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,730
it than the short sellers.

297
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,130
In fact there's very few times
that I've seen where the short

298
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,670
sellers are-- there's some
negative thesis on the stock

299
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:36,630
and where it really comes out
to be completely untrue.

300
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,660
Although, there are examples,
and those short sellers, I

301
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,380
don't think are really in the
mainstream Anyway, I don't

302
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,330
want to meander too much.

303
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,460
I realize that this video
has already gotten long.

304
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,200
But I thought it's a nice,
useful discussion to maybe

305
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,280
think a little bit about whether
short selling really

306
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:54,230
is all that bad, even if you
are a long investor.

307
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,333
