1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,560
The home stretch, we're on problem 18.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,550
And this diagram actually looks like something that

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,040
this little tool I'm using is well-suited to draw.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,180
Let me try-- I'll draw the one in the back first,

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:16,040
so I can do different colors and everything.

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:21,130
So I'll do the one in the back in yellow,

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,000
and it looks something like this.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,010
Goes like this, then it switches over like that.

9
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,530
And then I'll draw the next one, this orange color,

10
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,210
and it looks something--

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,020
no, I'll do it in a more drastic color.

12
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,260
So it does something like this.

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,180
It goes like this, crosses over, dips down,

14
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,070
then it goes over again.

15
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:48,340
And then finally, this last one,

16
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,050
and it looks something like this.

17
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:55,050
Crosses over and it goes like that, very pretty.

18
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,090
Now let me switch to a smaller-- OK.

19
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,000
Why don't we do white, I never write in white.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,090
In the figure above--so they say this is the start.

21
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,430
And this is step 1.

22
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,670
This is step 2.

23
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,060
OK, what is this?

24
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,060
In the figure above, three wires are braided.

25
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,300
That is, by starting in the order A, B, C--

26
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:30,330
OK, so this is A, B, C-- and then the order changes to B

27
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,760
right, because the yellow line is B-- A, C.

28
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:37,670
And then we get B, C, A. Right?

29
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,450
There's just the order of the strings, left to right.

30
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,030
Or the braids, or the wires.

31
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,050
OK.

32
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,950
That is start with the order A, B, C,

33
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,560
the outer left wire is brought over wire B, right?

34
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,910
This is brought over wire B,

35
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,360
to the middle position forming the order shown in step 1.

36
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,940
Than the outer right wire C, this one,

37
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,790
is brought to the new middle position shown in step 2

38
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,270
and so on.

39
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,600
Alternately bringing each new left and each new right

40
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,070
wire to the middle.

41
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:08,730
At what numbered step does the braid first

42
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:13,000
repeat the original order A, B, C?

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,890
So what you do is,

44
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,290
you first bring the left over the middle,

45
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,560
then you bring the right over the middle,

46
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,760
then you bring the left over the middle,

47
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,030
then you bring the right over the middle.

48
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,740
So at step 3, what do we have to do?

49
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,070
So step 1 we brought the left over the middle.

50
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,380
So we went from A, B, C.

51
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,070
You essentially switch the left and the middle.

52
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,030
And then step 2, you switch the right and the middle.

53
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:39,040
So step 3, we switch B and C again.

54
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,270
Because we're back on the left-hand side.

55
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,090
So you get C, B, A.

56
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,830
And then step 4,

57
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,060
you're going to switch to the right-hand side.

58
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,010
Step 3 we switched these two.

59
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,040
Now step 4, we're going to switch these two.

60
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,090
So you get C, A, B.

61
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:02,000
Then in step 5, we're back switched on this side.

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,010
So then you get A, C, B.

63
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,110
And then step 6,

64
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,780
you're going to switch to the right-hand side again.

65
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,360
So you get A, B, C.

66
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,200
So by step 6, we repeat.

67
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,080
So that's choice D.

68
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,320
The hard part here, as far as I'm concerned,

69
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,000
is just understanding the problem and their diagram.

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,070
And then just seeing the pattern that

71
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,190
you're just switching the letters.

72
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:23,040
First you switch the left and the middle letter.

73
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,070
Then you switch the right and the middle letter.

74
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,400
Then you switch the left and the middle letter.

75
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,560
Then you switch the right and the middle letter.

76
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,080
Until you get back to A, B, C.

77
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,750
Next problem.

78
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,680
White I don't think is colorful enough.

79
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,060
Let me do magenta.

80
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,040
19.

81
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,030
In a set of 11 different numbers-- they're different-

82
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,990
which of the following cannot affect the

83
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,010
value of the median?

84
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,030
So it's a set of 11 different numbers,

85
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:56,020
they're different, so let's say it's 1 through 11.

86
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,030
That's 11 different numbers.

87
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,360
And in this case, what's the median?

88
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,560
Well we have 5 on this side, 5--

89
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,360
the median is this, this is the middle number, right?

90
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,000
6 is the middle number.

91
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,830
Doubling each number--

92
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,330
well, if you double every number,

93
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:17,260
the median's going to become 12, so that's not right.

94
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,240
Increasing each number by 10-- once again,

95
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,520
if you increase all of these numbers by 10,

96
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,320
this number's going to be 16,

97
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,030
so you would've changed the median.

98
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:30,000
Increasing the smallest number only.

99
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,460
Well, what if you increase the smallest number to,

100
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,040
I don't know, 12?

101
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,490
So then this 12 would go all the way on the other side

102
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,060
right?

103
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,200
And then the median would move to 7

104
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,970
because you would have to have 5 below the median

105
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,040
and 5 above the median.

106
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,890
So you can increase that smallest number.

107
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,990
But if you increase it by a large enough amount,

108
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,690
it kind of goes into the greater than the median column

109
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,570
and then the median would have to shift to the right.

110
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,990
Try it out, write out the list from 2 to 12,

111
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,040
and then the median becomes 7.

112
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,000
OK, so we know that choice B is not right.

113
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,120
Choice C, increasing-- oh no, that was choice C--

114
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,700
choice D, decreasing the largest number only--

115
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,430
well, the same argument can apply.

116
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,540
We could take the 11 and decrease it down to,

117
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,060
I don't know, decrease it to 0.

118
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,890
You decrease it to 0, then that'll--

119
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,310
and you could list them all out, 0 through 10--

120
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,800
and then the median number will shift to 5,

121
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,220
so that will change it.

122
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,030
E, increasing the largest number only.

123
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:29,670
I can tell you

124
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,170
that's the answer from deductive reasoning,

125
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:35,650
but if we just take this 11 and we make it one billion

126
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,570
does that change the fact that they're five numbers

127
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,880
larger than 6 and five numbers less than 6?

128
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,390
Ignore the 0.

129
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,050
Five numbers less than 6?

130
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,030
No.

131
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,010
I can make it into a trillion.

132
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,480
I can change it to any number,

133
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,400
but the fact remains that I have the same amount

134
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,030
of numbers larger than 6 as I do below 6.

135
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:57,560
So choice E cannot affect the value of the median.

136
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,010
E.

137
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,030
Next problem.

138
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,030
OK, something for me to draw.

139
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,050
Let's see, they have a 1/4 circle,

140
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,960
so I'll just draw a big circle,

141
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,050
and I'll just focus on a 1/4 of it.

142
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,080
Close enough.

143
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,070
That looks like a 1/4 of a circle.

144
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:30,060
They say that-- oh, and there's a rectangle there too

145
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,050
fascinating.

146
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,470
So this rectangle in this 1/4 circle,

147
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,090
so this rectangle could look like this.

148
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:41,060
I know theirs looks taller, but I think this will do.

149
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,360
And then I think I'm almost done.

150
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,050
I think I'm there, I think I can.

151
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,930
And then they shade in some stuff,

152
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,090
so if they shaded it, I will shade it.

153
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:54,020
A suitably tasteful color.

154
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:00,050
OK, so I have shaded what they have shaded.

155
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,020
And now, what are they saying?

156
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:15,070
They're saying that this is R, C, T, B, S, A.

157
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:20,000
And then they tell us that is a 90 degree angle.

158
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,130
And then they tell us that this distance,

159
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,190
from here to here, from all the way to the top--

160
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:29,060
so it's essentially the radius of the circle-- is 6.

161
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,000
The radius of the circle is 6.

162
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,110
In the figure above,

163
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:38,330
arc SBT is 1/4 of a circle with center R and radius 6

164
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,030
Fair enough.

165
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:45,390
If the length plus the width of rectangle ABCR is 8--

166
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:49,770
so the length plus the width, so ABCR.

167
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,010
So this is the width, this is the length.

168
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:57,030
So L plus W is equal to 8.

169
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:01,020
What is the perimeter of the shaded region?

170
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,090
Fascinating.

171
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,040
Let's do it step by step.

172
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,790
First we can just figure out

173
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,030
what this part of the perimeter is.

174
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,040
And that's the easiest part, right?

175
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,030
Because what's the perimeter of the whole circle?

176
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,040
Well, it's the circumference of the whole circle.

177
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,010
Circumference is equal to 2 pi r.

178
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,020
This is the whole circle we're talking about.

179
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,250
So that's equal to 2 pi times 6,

180
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,000
so that's equal to 12 pi.

181
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,370
This is the circumference of the whole circle,

182
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,990
so the circumference of this arc, of this piece,

183
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,900
is going to be 1/4 of that,

184
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,060
because it's 1/4 of the whole circle.

185
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,080
So it's 1/4 of 12 pi, so that's 3 pi.

186
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,460
Now, what we need to be able to figure out is L and W

187
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,350
because if we can figure out L and W,

188
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:47,360
we can figure out everything else about this circle.

189
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:47,950
And actually,

190
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,200
I'm going to continue this problem in the next video,

191
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,340
because I think it might get a little involved,

192
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,680
and I don't want you to get too confused.

193
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,010
I'll see you in the next video.
