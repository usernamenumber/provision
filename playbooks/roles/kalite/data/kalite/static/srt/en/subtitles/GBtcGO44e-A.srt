1
00:00:00,467 --> 00:00:03,509
I want to show you a way that,
at least, I find more useful to

2
00:00:04,428 --> 00:00:05,346
subtract numbers in my head.

3
00:00:05,346 --> 00:00:07,916
And I do it this way-- it's
not necessarily faster on

4
00:00:07,931 --> 00:00:10,668
paper, but it allows you to
remember what you're doing.

5
00:00:10,668 --> 00:00:12,724
Because if you start borrowing
and stuff it becomes very hard

6
00:00:12,724 --> 00:00:14,603
to remember what's
actually going on.

7
00:00:14,603 --> 00:00:16,417
So let's try out a
couple of problems.

8
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:27,343
Let's have nine thousand four hundred fifty-six minus seven thousand five hundred eighty-nine.

9
00:00:27,343 --> 00:00:29,686
So the way I do
this in my head.

10
00:00:29,686 --> 00:00:35,092
I say that nine thousand four hundred fifty-six minus
seven thousand five hundred eighty-nine-- you have to

11
00:00:35,092 --> 00:00:36,545
remember the two numbers.

12
00:00:36,545 --> 00:00:40,874
So the first thing I do is
I say, well, what's nine thousand four hundred fifty-six

13
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:44,109
minus just seven thousand?

14
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:48,134
That's pretty easy because I
just take nine thousand minus seven thousand.

15
00:00:48,134 --> 00:00:51,575
So what I can do is I'll
cross out this and I'll

16
00:00:51,575 --> 00:00:53,652
subtract seven thousand from it.

17
00:00:53,652 --> 00:00:58,094
And I'm going to get two thousand four hundred fifty six.

18
00:00:58,094 --> 00:01:05,414
So in my head I tell myself
that nine thousand four hundred fifty-six minus seven thousand five hundred eighty-nine is the

19
00:01:05,414 --> 00:01:08,667
same thing as-- if I just
subtract out the seven thousand--

20
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:12,966
as two thousand four hundred fifty-six minus five hundred eighty-nine.

21
00:01:12,982 --> 00:01:15,178
I took the seven thousand out
of the picture.

22
00:01:15,178 --> 00:01:18,958
I essentially subtracted it
from both of these numbers.

23
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:25,386
Now, if I want to do two thousand four hundred fifty-six
minus five hundred eighty-nine what I do is I

24
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:28,818
subtract five hundred from both
of these numbers.

25
00:01:28,818 --> 00:01:31,288
So if I subtract five hundred from
this bottom number,

26
00:01:31,288 --> 00:01:33,163
this five will go away.

27
00:01:33,163 --> 00:01:36,312
And if I subtract five hundred from this
top number, what happens?

28
00:01:36,312 --> 00:01:39,538
What's two thousand four hundred fifty-six minus five hundred?

29
00:01:39,538 --> 00:01:41,146
Or an easier way to
think about it?

30
00:01:41,146 --> 00:01:42,947
What's twenty-four minus five?

31
00:01:42,947 --> 00:01:43,836
Well, that's nineteen.

32
00:01:43,836 --> 00:01:49,033
So it's going to be one thousand nine hundred fifty-six.

33
00:01:49,033 --> 00:01:50,791
Let me scroll up a little bit.

34
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,213
So it's one thousand nine hundred fifty six.

35
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:57,510
So my original problem has now
been reduced to one thousand nine hundred fifty-six minus eighty-nine.

36
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:01,692
Now I can subtract eighty from both
that number and that number.

37
00:02:01,692 --> 00:02:04,741
So if I subtract eighty from this
bottom number the eight disappears.

38
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:07,102
Eighty-nine minus eighty is just nine.

39
00:02:07,102 --> 00:02:09,412
And I subtract eighty from this top
number, I can just think of,

40
00:02:09,412 --> 00:02:12,385
well, what's one hundred ninety-five minus eight?

41
00:02:12,385 --> 00:02:15,157
Well, one hundred ninety-five minus eight, let's see.

42
00:02:15,157 --> 00:02:17,909
Fifteen minus eight is seventeen.

43
00:02:17,924 --> 00:02:25,138
So one hundred ninety-five minus eight is going
to be one hundred eighty-seven and then you

44
00:02:25,138 --> 00:02:26,656
still have the six there.

45
00:02:26,656 --> 00:02:31,910
So essentially I said,
one thousand nine hundred fifty-six minus eighty is one thousand eight hundred seventy-six.

46
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,995
And now my problem has been
reduced to one thousand eight hundred seventy-six minus nine.

47
00:02:35,995 --> 00:02:37,450
And then we can do
that in our head.

48
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,679
What's seventy-six minus nine?

49
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:40,363
That's what?

50
00:02:40,363 --> 00:02:41,660
Sixty-seven.

51
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:47,789
So our final answer is one thousand eight hundred sixty-seven.

52
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:50,946
And as you can see this isn't
necessarily faster than the way

53
00:02:50,961 --> 00:02:52,500
we've done it in other videos.

54
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,999
But the reason why I like it
is that at any stage, I just

55
00:02:54,999 --> 00:02:56,465
have to remember two numbers.

56
00:02:56,465 --> 00:02:58,845
I have to remember my
new top number and my

57
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,067
new bottom number.

58
00:03:00,067 --> 00:03:03,466
My new bottom number is always
just some of the leftover

59
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:05,159
digits of the original
bottom number.

60
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:07,917
So that's how I like to
do things in my head.

61
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:10,452
Now, just to make sure that we
got the right answer and maybe

62
00:03:10,452 --> 00:03:13,239
to compare and contrast
a little bit.

63
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:15,190
Let's do it the
traditional way.

64
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:24,907
Nine thousand four hundred fifty-six minus seven thousand five hundred eighty-nine.

65
00:03:24,907 --> 00:03:28,467
So the standard way of doing
it, I like to do all my

66
00:03:28,467 --> 00:03:31,313
borrowing before I do any of my
subtraction so that I can stay

67
00:03:31,313 --> 00:03:34,913
in my borrowing mode, or you
can think of it as regrouping.

68
00:03:34,928 --> 00:03:37,793
So I look at all of my numbers
on top and see, are they all

69
00:03:37,793 --> 00:03:39,331
larger than the numbers
on the bottom?

70
00:03:39,331 --> 00:03:40,717
And I start here at the right.

71
00:03:40,717 --> 00:03:43,583
Six is definitely not larger
than nine, so I have to borrow.

72
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:46,627
So I'll borrow ten or I'll
borrow one from the tens place,

73
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:48,134
which ends up being ten.

74
00:03:48,134 --> 00:03:52,998
So the six becomes a sixteen and
then the five becomes a four.

75
00:03:52,998 --> 00:03:54,269
Then I go to the tens place.

76
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:57,840
Four needs to be larger than
eight, so let me borrow one

77
00:03:57,856 --> 00:03:59,570
from the hundreds place.

78
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,123
So then that four becomes a fourteen
or fourteen tens because

79
00:04:03,123 --> 00:04:04,408
we're in the tens place.

80
00:04:04,408 --> 00:04:07,168
And then this four becomes a three.

81
00:04:07,168 --> 00:04:09,897
Now these two columns or places
look good, but right here I

82
00:04:09,897 --> 00:04:12,201
have a three, which is
less than a five.

83
00:04:12,201 --> 00:04:14,396
Not cool, so I have
to borrow again.

84
00:04:14,396 --> 00:04:18,825
That three becomes a thirteen and
then that nine becomes an eight.

85
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:21,628
And now I'm ready to subtract.

86
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:24,499
So you get sixteen minus nine is seven.

87
00:04:24,499 --> 00:04:27,334
Fourteen minus eight is six.

88
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:29,445
Thirteen minus five is eight.

89
00:04:29,445 --> 00:04:31,087
Eight minus seven is one.

90
00:04:31,087 --> 00:04:33,907
And lucky for us, we
got the right answer.

91
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:34,684
I want to make it very clear.

92
00:04:34,684 --> 00:04:36,534
There's no better
way to do this.

93
00:04:36,534 --> 00:04:39,678
This way is actually kind of
longer and it takes up more

94
00:04:39,678 --> 00:04:43,123
space on your paper than this
way was, but this for me,

95
00:04:43,123 --> 00:04:44,586
is very hard to remember.

96
00:04:44,586 --> 00:04:47,480
It's very hard for me to keep
track of what I borrowed and

97
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,038
what the other number
is and et cetera.

98
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:52,049
But here, at any point
in time, I just have to

99
00:04:52,049 --> 00:04:53,715
remember two numbers.

100
00:04:53,715 --> 00:04:56,645
And the two numbers get
simpler every step that I

101
00:04:56,645 --> 00:04:58,655
go through this process.

102
00:04:58,655 --> 00:05:00,048
So this is why I think
that this is a little

103
00:05:00,048 --> 00:05:01,437
bit easier in my head.

104
00:05:01,437 --> 00:05:03,860
But this might be, depending on
the context, easier on paper.

105
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,587
But at least here you didn't
have to borrow or regroup.

106
00:05:06,587 --> 00:05:21,118
Well, hopefully you find
that a little bit useful.
