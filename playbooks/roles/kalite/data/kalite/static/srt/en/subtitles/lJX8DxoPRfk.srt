1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,830
In the last video, I touched on
the idea of a sigma bond.

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,830
And that was a bond-- well, let
me draw two nucleuses and

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,630
let me just draw one
of the orbitals.

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:12,330
Let's say this is an sp3
hybridized orbital, and that's

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,219
on this atom and this is kind of
this big lobe right there.

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,730
And then this guy has an sp3
hybridized orbital as well.

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,740
That's the small lobe,
and then that's the

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,330
big lobe like that.

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,080
A sigma bond is one where
there's an overlap kind of in

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,960
the direction in which the
lobes are pointed.

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,520
And you might say, well, how can
there be any other type of

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,830
bond than that?

13
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,000
Well, the other type of bond,
so this right here-- let me

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,760
make this clear.

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,070
This right here is
a sigma bond.

16
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,600
And you say, well, what other
kind of bond could there be

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,650
where my two orbitals overlap
kind of in the direction that

18
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:51,490
they're pointing?

19
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,010
And the other type of bond you
could have, you can imagine if

20
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,510
you have two p orbitals.

21
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:59,300
So let me draw the nucleus of
two atoms, and I'll just draw

22
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,390
one of each of their
p orbitals.

23
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,410
So let's say that that's the
nucleus and I'll just draw

24
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:05,170
their p orbitals.

25
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,140
So a p orbital is just
that dumbbell shape.

26
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,980
Let me draw them a little
bit closer together.

27
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,452
So a p orbital is that
dumbbell shape.

28
00:01:15,452 --> 00:01:19,375
So let me draw this guy's--
one of his p orbitals.

29
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:21,430
I want to draw it a little bit
bigger than that, and you'll

30
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,320
see why a second.

31
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,665
So one of his p orbitals
right there.

32
00:01:25,665 --> 00:01:28,210
It comes out like that.

33
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,140
And then this guy over here also
has a p orbital that is

34
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,050
parallel to this p orbital,
so it goes like that.

35
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,740
Let me draw that other one
a little bit straighter.

36
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:48,090
It goes-- I want it to overlap
more, so it goes like that.

37
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,330
I think you get the idea.

38
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,500
So here, our two p orbitals are
parallel to each other.

39
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,400
This, you can imagine, these are
sp3 hybridized orbitals.

40
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,430
They're pointing
at each other.

41
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,590
Here, they're parallel.

42
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,620
p orbitals are parallel to each
other, and you see that

43
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:06,010
they overlap on this kind of
top lobe here and in this

44
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,580
bottom lobe here.

45
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:12,210
And this is a pi bond.

46
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,100
Let me make this clear.

47
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,880
And this is one pi bond.

48
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,060
So you could call it a pi,
literally, with the Greek

49
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,140
letter pi: pi bond.

50
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,720
Sometimes you'll see this
just written as pi bond.

51
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,540
And it's called a pi bond
because it's the Greek letter

52
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,910
for essentially p, and we're
dealing with p orbitals

53
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,600
overlapping.

54
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,170
Now sigma bonds, which are
what form when you have a

55
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,267
single bond, these are stronger
than pi bonds; pi

56
00:02:40,267 --> 00:02:43,530
bonds come into play once you
start forming double or triple

57
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,440
bonds on top of a sigma bond.

58
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,050
To kind of get a better
visualization of how that

59
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,600
might work, let's think
about ethene.

60
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,680
So it's molecular structure
looks like this.

61
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,560
So you have C double-bonded to
C, and then each of those guys

62
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,810
have two hydrogens.

63
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:10,200
So let me draw what it would
look like, or our best visual,

64
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,960
or our best ability to kind
of conceptualize what the

65
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,395
orbitals around the carbon
might look like.

66
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:25,340
So first I'll draw the sp2
hybridized orbitals.

67
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,850
So let me just make it very
clear what's going on here.

68
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:35,730
So when we were dealing with
methane, which is literally

69
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:41,200
just a carbon bonded to four
hydrogens, and if I actually

70
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,900
wanted to draw it in a way that
it kind of looks a little

71
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,810
three-dimensional with a
tetrahedral structure, it

72
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:46,640
might look like this.

73
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,450
This hydrogen is pointing
out a little bit.

74
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,360
This hydrogen is kind of in
the plane of the page, and

75
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,100
then maybe that hydrogen is
behind it, and then you have

76
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,880
one hydrogen popping up.

77
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,440
That's methane.

78
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,170
And we saw that these were all
sp3 hybridized orbitals around

79
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,110
the carbon, and then they each
formed sigma bonds with each

80
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,860
of the hydrogens.

81
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,550
We saw that in the last video.

82
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,470
And when we drew its electron
configuration, in order for

83
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,780
this to happen, carbon's
electron configuration when

84
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,899
bonding in methane needed
to look like this.

85
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:20,540
It needed to look like 1s2.

86
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:27,050
And then instead of having 2s2
and then 2p2, what you

87
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,430
essentially have is-- let me
try it this way, actually,

88
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,370
even better.

89
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,180
Let me write this better.

90
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:37,350
In 1s, you had two electrons,
and then instead of two s's,

91
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,770
you had two electrons and on
each of the p's, you had one,

92
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:48,010
the s's and the p's all got
mixed up and you had a 2sp3

93
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:52,480
hybridized orbital, another
2sp3 hybridized orbital,

94
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,650
another 2sp3 hybridized
orbital, and then

95
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,970
another one, sp3.

96
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,810
Normally, when carbon's sitting
by itself, you would

97
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:03,600
expect a 2s here, and then
you'd have a 2p in the

98
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,480
x-direction, a 2p in the
y-direction, and then a 2p in

99
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,200
the z-direction.

100
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,910
But we saw in the last video,
they all get mixed up and they

101
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:14,610
all have a 25% s-character,
and a 75% p-character when

102
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,080
carbon bonds in methane and the
electrons kind of separate

103
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,700
out in that situation.

104
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:26,050
When you're dealing with the
carbons in ethene, remember,

105
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,560
eth- is for two carbons and
ene-, because we're dealing

106
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,320
with an alkene.

107
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,240
We have a double bond here.

108
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,400
In this situation, the
carbon's electron

109
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,050
configuration when they
bond in ethene

110
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,580
looks more like this.

111
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:43,530
So you have your 1s, and
the 1s orbital is

112
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,870
still completely full.

113
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,520
It has two electrons in it.

114
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:53,250
But then in your 2 shell, I'll
just write-- let me do this in

115
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,910
a different color.

116
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:00,570
So in our 2 shell, I'll show you
what I mean in a second.

117
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,990
I'm not writing the s or p's so
far on purpose, but we're

118
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,350
going to have four electrons
just like we had before.

119
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,600
We're still forming
four bonds.

120
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,270
We're going to have these
four unpaired electrons.

121
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,290
We're still forming one, two,
three, four bonds with each of

122
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,470
the carbons, so they're going
to be separated out.

123
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,130
But in this situation, instead
of all of them being a

124
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:24,490
mixture, kind of one part s,
three parts p, the s mixes

125
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,380
with two of the p orbitals.

126
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:33,210
So what you have is
2sp2 orbital.

127
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:36,660
So you can imagine that the s
orbital mixes with two of the

128
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,200
p orbitals.

129
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,260
So now it's one part
s, two parts p.

130
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:43,540
And then one of the p orbitals
kind of stays by itself.

131
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,860
And we need this p orbital to
stay by itself because it is

132
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,800
going to be what's responsible
for the pi bond.

133
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,210
And we're going to see that
the pi bond does something

134
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,020
very interesting to
the molecule.

135
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,910
It kind of makes it unrotatable

136
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,640
around a bond axis.

137
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,960
And you'll see what I
mean in a second.

138
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,000
So let me see if I can, in three
dimensions, draw each of

139
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,250
these carbons.

140
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,270
So you have-- let me do
it a different color.

141
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,530
You have this carbon
right there.

142
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,880
So let's say that's
the nucleus.

143
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,690
I'll put a C there so you
know which carbon

144
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:16,680
we're dealing with.

145
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,280
And then I'll draw-- you could
assume that the 1s orbital,

146
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,210
it's really small right
around the carbon.

147
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,930
And then you have these
hybridized orbitals, The 2ps2

148
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,430
orbitals, and they're all going
to be planar, kind of

149
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,990
forming a triangle, or I guess
maybe a peace sign on some

150
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,160
level, but I'll try to draw it
in three dimensions here.

151
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,480
So you have one, this is kind
of coming out a little bit.

152
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,250
Then you have one that's
going in a little bit.

153
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,140
And then you have-- and they
have another lobe a little bit

154
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,580
on the other side, but I'm
not going to draw them.

155
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,500
It'll complicate it.

156
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,520
They still have characteristics
of p, so

157
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,040
they'll have two lobes, but one
is bigger than the other.

158
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,580
And then you have one that's
maybe going in this side.

159
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,820
So you can imagine that this is
kind of a Mercedes sign if

160
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,480
you drew a circle around
it, on its side.

161
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,870
So that's this carbon
right here.

162
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,090
And, of course, it has
its hydrogens.

163
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:09,000
So you have this
hydrogen there.

164
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,410
And so this hydrogen might
be sitting right here.

165
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:16,830
It just has one electron
in its 1s orbital.

166
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,270
You have this hydrogen
up here.

167
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:22,260
It's sitting right over there.

168
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,760
And now let's draw
this carbon.

169
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,840
This carbon will be sitting--
I'm drawing it

170
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,880
pretty close together.

171
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,330
This carbon will be sitting
right there.

172
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:37,679
He has his 1s orbital.

173
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,610
They have the exact same
electron configuration.

174
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:43,419
He has his 1s orbital right
around him, and then he has

175
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:44,890
the exact same configuration.

176
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,290
Either of these guys, we've so
far only-- or in this first

177
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,860
guy, I've only drawn
these first three.

178
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,140
I haven't drawn this
unhybridized p orbital yet.

179
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,730
So I'll do that in a second.

180
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,570
But let me draw his bonds.

181
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:00,140
So first of all, he has this,
or you could imagine, that

182
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,490
bond right there, which would
be an sp2 hybridized bond.

183
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,410
Let me do that in
the same color.

184
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,210
So he has this bond right here,
which would be an sp2

185
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:14,310
hybridized bond,
just like that.

186
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,250
And notice, this is
a sigma bond.

187
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,480
They overlap in kind of the
direction that they're

188
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,070
pointing in.

189
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,520
That's the best I could
think about it.

190
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,210
And then he's got these two
hydrogens, so one-- he's got

191
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:31,200
this guy in the back, and then
there's one in the front.

192
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,990
I'll draw it a little bigger so
it's kind of pointing out

193
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,690
at us, right?

194
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:39,470
And then we have this hydrogen
is sitting right over here.

195
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,170
And these are also sigma bonds,
just to be very clear

196
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:42,950
about things.

197
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:46,330
This is an s orbital overlapping
with an sp2

198
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,430
orbital, but they're kind of
overlapping in the direction

199
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,270
that they're pointed, or kind of
along the direction of each

200
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:55,830
other, of the two atoms. This
is a sigma bond, sigma bond,

201
00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:01,140
and then we have this hydrogen
in the back, which is also

202
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,220
going to form a sigma bond.

203
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,230
So everything I've drawn
so far is a sigma

204
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,430
bond, so that, that.

205
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:10,930
Maybe I don't want to make this
picture too-- so I can

206
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,400
just put sigma bond there, sigma
bond there, sigma bond

207
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,870
there, sigma, sigma.

208
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:23,540
So far I've drawn this bond,
this bond, this bond, this

209
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,600
bond, and this bond, all
of those sigma bonds.

210
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,060
So, what happens to this
last p orbital for

211
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,650
each of these guys?

212
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:34,590
Well, that's going to be kind
of sticking out of the plane

213
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,770
of the Mercedes sign, is the
best way I can describe it.

214
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,330
And let me see if I can do
that in a color that I

215
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,040
haven't done yet.

216
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,070
Oh, maybe this purple color.

217
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,480
So you can imagine
a pure p orbital.

218
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,190
So a pure p orbital, I'm going
to need to draw it even bigger

219
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,560
than that, actually.

220
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,400
A pure p orbital, it normally
wouldn't be that big relative

221
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,490
to things, but I have to
make them overlap.

222
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:03,030
So it's a pure p orbital that's
kind of going in, maybe

223
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,960
you can imagine, the z-axis,
that the other orbitals are

224
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,230
kind of a Mercedes sign
in the x, y plane.

225
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,610
And now you have the z-axis
going straight up and down,

226
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,530
and those bottom two have
to overlap so let

227
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:13,990
me draw them bigger.

228
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,330
So it looks like that and
it looks like that.

229
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,470
And they're going straight
up and down.

230
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,510
And notice, they are
now overlapping.

231
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:29,670
So this bond right here
is this bond.

232
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,730
I could've drawn them in either
way, but it's that

233
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:32,710
second bond.

234
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,600
And so what's happening
now to the structure?

235
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,310
So let me make it very clear.

236
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:41,440
This right here, that is a pi
bond, and this right here is

237
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,980
also-- it's the same pi bond.

238
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,300
It's this guy right here.

239
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,860
It's the second bond
in the double bond.

240
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,680
But what's happening here?

241
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,410
Well, first of all, by itself it
would be a weaker bond, but

242
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:56,940
because we already have a sigma
bond that's making these

243
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,100
molecules come closer together,
this pi bond will

244
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,290
make them come even
closer together.

245
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:04,010
So this distance right here is
closer than if we were to just

246
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,270
have a single sigma
bond there.

247
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,380
Now, on top of that, the really
interesting thing is,

248
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,400
if we just had a sigma bond
here, both of these molecules

249
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,300
could kind of rotate around
the bond axis.

250
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:19,050
They would be able to rotate
around the bond axis if you

251
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,910
just had one sigma bond there.

252
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:24,120
But since we have these pi bonds
that are parallel to

253
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,260
each other and they're kind of
overlapping and they're kind

254
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,000
of locked in to that
configuration, you can no

255
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,720
longer rotate.

256
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,980
If one of these molecules
rotates, the other one's going

257
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,610
to rotate with it because
these two

258
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,020
guys are locked together.

259
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,590
So what this pi bond does in the
situation is it makes this

260
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:42,360
carbon-carbon double bond-- it
means that the double bonds

261
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,060
are going to be rigid, that you
can't have one molecule

262
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,500
kind of flipping, swapping these
two hydrogens, without

263
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,340
the other one having
to flip with it.

264
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,800
So you wouldn't be able to kind
of swap configurations of

265
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,620
the hydrogens relative
to the other side.

266
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,530
That's what it causes.

267
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,380
So, hopefully, that gives you
a good understanding of the

268
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,340
difference between sigma
and pi bond.

269
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:06,990
And if you're curious, when
you're dealing with-- just to

270
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:11,430
kind of make it clear, if we
were dealing with ethyne, this

271
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:14,180
is an example of ethene, but
ethyne looks like this.

272
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,670
You have a triple bond.

273
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,340
And so you have each side
pointing to one hydrogen.

274
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:24,140
In this case, one of these, so
the first bonds, you can

275
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,420
imagine, so these bonds
are all sigma bonds.

276
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,660
They're actually
sp hybridized.

277
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,870
Your 2s orbital only mixes with
one of the p's, so these

278
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:47,290
are sp hybrid orbitals forming
sigma bonds, so all of these

279
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,170
right here.

280
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:52,310
And then both of these-- let me
do this in different color.

281
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,360
Both of these are pi bonds.

282
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,150
And if you had to imagine it,
could imagine another pi bond

283
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,820
kind of coming out of the page
and another one here coming

284
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,540
out of the page and into the
page, out and into the page,

285
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,270
and they, too, are overlapping,
and you just have

286
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,660
one hydrogen pointing out
in each direction.

287
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,320
Maybe I'll make another
video on that.

288
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,960
So, hopefully, you--
