1
00:00:00,846 --> 00:00:02,648
Now you got your chance to

2
00:00:02,648 --> 00:00:03,813
use this scale

3
00:00:03,813 --> 00:00:05,407
to figure out how much something weighs.

4
00:00:05,407 --> 00:00:08,561
So we're asked "how much Old Spice Man weigh?"

5
00:00:08,561 --> 00:00:11,632
We have Old Spice Man, this little guy here

6
00:00:11,632 --> 00:00:13,139
plus you have three blocks

7
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:14,721
so on the left hand side you have

8
00:00:14,721 --> 00:00:16,316
Old Spice Man plus three blocks.

9
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:17,581
And you see that the scale is balanced

10
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:19,253
so on the right hand side you have eight blocks.

11
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:23,516
So Old Spice Man plus three is equal to eight blocks.

12
00:00:23,516 --> 00:00:25,473
And you can see what happens when we do something

13
00:00:25,473 --> 00:00:27,141
to one side of the scale or another.

14
00:00:27,141 --> 00:00:29,987
If we were to take a block from the right hand side

15
00:00:29,987 --> 00:00:31,727
all of the sudden the right hand side

16
00:00:31,727 --> 00:00:33,728
becomes lighter and it tilts up

17
00:00:33,728 --> 00:00:35,382
And our scale is no longer balanced

18
00:00:35,382 --> 00:00:38,116
so we can no longer say that the left and the right

19
00:00:38,116 --> 00:00:41,455
side is equal and there is an explanation of it below here.

20
00:00:41,455 --> 00:00:45,049
So what we wanna do is add or remove blocks

21
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:48,249
So essentially we're left with Old Spice Man but the

22
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:50,639
scale is balanced so whatever is on the right hand side

23
00:00:50,639 --> 00:00:53,252
is how much he weighs in blocks.

24
00:00:53,252 --> 00:00:54,636
So let's see if we can do that.

25
00:00:54,636 --> 00:00:58,139
So let me add that block back that's were we started

26
00:00:58,139 --> 00:01:01,114
from. So let's see, I wanna get rid of these three.

27
00:01:01,114 --> 00:01:03,780
So if I take one away from the left hand side

28
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,125
Well I can't just do it there because

29
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:06,519
all of the sudden the left hand side is too light

30
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:08,386
so I am going to have to take one away from the

31
00:01:08,386 --> 00:01:10,270
right hand side as well.

32
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,550
And let me do it again!

33
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,456
Take one away from the left hand side

34
00:01:13,456 --> 00:01:16,145
and take one from the right hand side as well.

35
00:01:16,145 --> 00:01:17,200
And I'm getting close,

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,805
one from the left hand side

37
00:01:18,805 --> 00:01:20,326
now one from the right hand side

38
00:01:20,326 --> 00:01:21,797
and it is balanced.

39
00:01:21,797 --> 99:59:59,999
Old Spice Man is equal to five blocks
