1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760
   

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,780
Let's say I have a set of
linearly independent vectors,

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:16,460
V1, V2, all the way to Vk,
that are a basis for V.

4
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,880
We've seen this many
times before.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,450
That's nice.

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,570
It's a basis, but we've learned
over the last few

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,900
videos it would be even
better to have an

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:30,280
orthonormal basis for V.

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,950
   

10
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,500
What we're going to address in
this video is, is there some

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,090
way that we can construct an
orthonormal basis for V, given

12
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,700
that we already have this basis,
which I'm assuming

13
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,630
isn't orthonormal.

14
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,700
It'll work whether or not
it's orthonormal.

15
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,690
It'll just generate another
orthonormal basis.

16
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,680
But can we somehow, just given
any basis, generate an

17
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,320
orthonormal basis for V, and
then be able to benefit from

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,820
all of the properties of having
an orthonormal basis?

19
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:02,330
Let's see if we can make
some headway here.

20
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,000
Let's think about it
for simple cases.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,080
Let's say that I have a
one-dimensional subspace.

22
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,540
Let's call that V1, for it's
a one-dimensional subspace.

23
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:20,870
I'm going to say it's the span
of just this vector V1.

24
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:26,210
Now, or you could say the vector
V1 is the basis for the

25
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:27,770
subspace V1.

26
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,290
If I had this simple case, how
can I ensure that this is

27
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,030
orthonormal?

28
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,266
What I could do is I could
define some vector,

29
00:01:36,266 --> 00:01:37,790
let's call it U1.

30
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:42,560
   

31
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,850
Obviously, this is orthogonal
to all of the other guys.

32
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,360
There aren't any other
guys here.

33
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,600
[INAUDIBLE]

34
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,520
vectors there, but there aren't
any other members of

35
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,270
this set, so it's orthogonal
to everything else because

36
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,660
there isn't anything else.

37
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,470
And then to make its length
equal one, you can take this

38
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,120
vector and divide it
by its length.

39
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:07,810
So if we define some vector U1
to be equal to V1 divided by

40
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:14,330
the length of V1, then
the length of U1

41
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,050
is going to be what?

42
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:22,500
It's going to be the length
of V1 over the

43
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,340
length of V1 like this.

44
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,360
This is just a constant
right here.

45
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,570
This is going to be 1 over
the length of V1.

46
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:34,090
That could be 5, times length
of V1, which is

47
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,070
just equal to 1.

48
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,890
This one will have
a length of 1.

49
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:45,200
So just like that, if we have
the set of just U1, we could

50
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:57,740
say that just the set of U1 is
an orthonormal basis for V1,

51
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,430
for the subspace V1.

52
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,690
Now, that was trivially easy.

53
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,110
If k happens to be
1, we're done.

54
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,440
That was super easy.

55
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,040
We just have to divide
by our length.

56
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,990
You have to just essentially
just normalize this vector,

57
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,060
and you have an orthonormal
basis because there's nothing

58
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,700
else to be orthogonal with.

59
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,570
Well let's complicated the
issue a little bit.

60
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,200
Let's say we go to
two dimensions.

61
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,900
Let's say we have
a subspace V2.

62
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,520
That's the span of, let's
say it's the first

63
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,190
two of these vectors.

64
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:34,810
It's the span of V1
and the vector V2.

65
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:40,580
Now, we know that V1, V1 can
easily be represented as-- or,

66
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,020
V1 is a linear combination
of U1.

67
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,800
How do I know that?

68
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,800
Well, I can just multiply
both sides of this times

69
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,030
the length of V1.

70
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:54,240
We have U1 times the length
of V1 is equal to V1.

71
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,440
So we could say this
is the same thing.

72
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:04,320
This is equivalent to saying the
span of the vector U1 and

73
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,780
the vector V2, where U1 is the
vector we got up here.

74
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,670
How can I say this?

75
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,160
Because anything that can be a
linear combination of these

76
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,560
guys can be a linear combination
of those guys.

77
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,230
Because where ever you had a
V1, you can replace the V1

78
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:20,269
with the linear combination
of U1 that gives you V1.

79
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:22,430
So you just multiply U1 times
that scalar and you get it.

80
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,140
I think you get the point.

81
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,470
But how can we ensure that this
is an orthonormal set?

82
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,110
What do we do?

83
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,100
Let's graph it.

84
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,740
This is going to be
a plane in Rn.

85
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,320
So let's just make our
chalkboard here, or our video

86
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,430
board here, the plane.

87
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,950
So we have U1, which
is a unit vector.

88
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,150
It has length 1.

89
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,400
So that is U1.

90
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,950
   

91
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,000
V1 and V2 are linearly
independent, that's by

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,120
definition of a basis.

93
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,250
So you can't represent V2 as
a linear multiple or linear

94
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,300
combination of V1.

95
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,600
Likewise, you can't represent V2
as a linear combination of

96
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,750
U1 because U1 is a linear
combination of U1.

97
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,130
So, V1 is not going to be on
the line spanned by U1.

98
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,390
So I could actually draw that.

99
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,980
The line spanned by U1
is just like this.

100
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,290
This is the line
spanned by U1.

101
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:13,350
Let me draw it a little
bit better than that.

102
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,330
I don't want to make
it too dark.

103
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,500
So this is the line.

104
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,570
I'll do one last try.

105
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,725
The line spanned by U1
looks like this.

106
00:05:22,725 --> 00:05:24,730
It looks like that,
it's just a line.

107
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:29,610
And that is the subspace
V1, right?

108
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,590
With the span of U1.

109
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:35,390
So this is equal to
the span of U1.

110
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:38,480
All we did is normalize V1
right there to get to U1.

111
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,280
So the span of V1 is the
same span of U1.

112
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,960
That is this subspace.

113
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,040
That's this line in Rn.

114
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,070
We have vector V2,
which is linearly

115
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,120
independent from V1 and U1.

116
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,960
V2 would look, let's just
say something like that.

117
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,800
V2.

118
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,130
Now, what we want to do is
replace V2 with another vector

119
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,550
that is definitely orthogonal
to this, and will still be

120
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:07,570
able to construct V2 with some
combination of this and our

121
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,840
new vector.

122
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,780
Well, the most obvious vector
would be some vector that is

123
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:17,540
orthogonal to V1.

124
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,820
So it's orthogonal, so it's
a member of the orthogonal

125
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,070
complement of V1.

126
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:26,560
   

127
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,200
If you look at it just visually
here, if I add some

128
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,740
member of V1 to that member of
the orthogonal complement of

129
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,210
V1, I'm going to get V2.

130
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,125
In fact, we've seen that
multiple times.

131
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:40,420
   

132
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,540
We know that any vector in
Rn, let's say V2, can be

133
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,880
represented as a sum
of two vectors.

134
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:58,740
I'll call them x and y, where x
is a member of V1 and y is a

135
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,510
member of the orthogonal
complement of V1.

136
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,700
We've seen that multiple
times.

137
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,890
Now what was this thing
by definition?

138
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:08,890
We're looking for this thing.

139
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,950
This is the x.

140
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,590
And this is the y.

141
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:18,230
We're looking for the y, because
if we can find this

142
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:23,060
vector y, then if we replace
V with that vector y, we'll

143
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,120
still be able to generate
V because you can take a

144
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,035
multiple of U and add
it to y and get V.

145
00:07:28,035 --> 00:07:31,160
And so anything that you were
able to generate with V2

146
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,280
before, you can now generate
with our U1, multiples of

147
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,520
that, plus multiples
of our new vector.

148
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,570
So, we're trying to solve, we're
trying to figure out

149
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:42,030
what this vector y
is right there.

150
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,150
So how do we do it?

151
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,790
Well, it's going to be V2
minus this vector x.

152
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,450
Right?

153
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,450
What is this vector
x, by definition?

154
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:55,790
This vector x is, by definition,
the projection of

155
00:07:55,790 --> 00:08:01,550
V2 onto the subspace V1.

156
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:05,550
So, the vector that we're trying
to find, the vector y,

157
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:09,400
and if we find it, and that we
can replace V2 with y, the

158
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:16,340
vector y, is just equal to
V2-- let me write it this

159
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:23,590
way-- minus the projection
of V2 onto V1.

160
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,550
That's what y is.

161
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,050
Remember, if we can replace V2--
the reason why the span

162
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:38,950
of U1, V2 is the same thing as
the span of U1-- let me call

163
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,309
this y2 here.

164
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:41,890
I'm going to just call that
y2, because we're probably

165
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,230
going to have to use
y's in the future.

166
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,610
You want y2.

167
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,520
So the reason why this span is
the same thing as the span of

168
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:56,250
U1 and y2 is because I can
generate V2 with a linear

169
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,460
combination of U1
and y2, right?

170
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,980
I can scale up U1 and then add
y2 and I'll get to V2.

171
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,370
So anything that I could have
generated with V2 I can get

172
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,930
with a linear combination
of these guys.

173
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,590
That's why these
are equivalent.

174
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,300
And what's neat about this now
is that these guys are

175
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,690
orthogonal complements-- or
these guys are orthogonal

176
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,130
relative to each other, right?

177
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:17,500
By definition, y was a member of
the orthogonal complements.

178
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,450
If you dot these two guys,
you're going to get 0.

179
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,000
How can we actually
solve for it?

180
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,930
Well, this is useful as
well because V1 has

181
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,590
an orthonormal basis.

182
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:38,130
   

183
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,890
And we saw, I think it was two
or three videos ago, the neat

184
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,930
thing about orthonormal bases
is, it's very easy to

185
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,420
determine the projection
onto those bases.

186
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:52,600
It's essentially, let me write
it over here, the projection

187
00:09:52,600 --> 00:10:00,610
of the vector V2 onto the
subspace V1 is equal to V2--

188
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:07,680
let me write it this way-- V2
dotted with the subspaces V1's

189
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:14,350
first basis vector, which
is the vector U1, right?

190
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,700
That's its first basis vector.

191
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:21,070
We're dealing with an
orthonormal basis-- times U1.

192
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:25,150
And then if we had more basis
vectors, we would say plus V2

193
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:28,320
dotted with our next basis
vector, times that basis

194
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,930
vector, and so on
and so forth.

195
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,580
But V1 only has one
basis vector.

196
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,770
It only has the basis vector
U1 right here.

197
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:35,570
Right?

198
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,270
It is only spanned by that.

199
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:43,410
So, we can rewrite this thing
right here. ys, this vector

200
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,330
right here that I'm going to
replace V2 with, is equal to

201
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:55,080
V2 minus the projection of V2
onto the subspace V1, on to

202
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,230
that line, which is just this.

203
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:04,830
V2 dot U1 times the vector U1.

204
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,910
And just like that, we've
solved for y.

205
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:11,690
So we have a basis for V2, where
this guy and this guy

206
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,710
are orthogonal.

207
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,870
This guy is the unit vector.

208
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,120
He's been normalized,
but this guy hasn't

209
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,660
been normalized yet.

210
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:24,410
So to normalize it, let's just
define some other vector as U2

211
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,100
and do the same thing.

212
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,060
Let's just normalize it.

213
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,650
So U2 is equal to y2, divided
by the length of y2.

214
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:35,050
   

215
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:38,000
Now, we can say that the
subspace V2 is equal to the

216
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,330
span of U1 and, instead of y2,
I'll put U2 there, because I

217
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:49,990
can generate y2 by just
scaling up U2.

218
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:53,130
What's neat about this now is,
I have two unit vectors, or

219
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,380
two normalized vectors, and
they're orthogonal with

220
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,460
respect to each and they span
what V1 and V2 spanned

221
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,590
originally.

222
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,280
Now,

223
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,930
we need to keep going.

224
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:06,100
What about if we want to go
to V3 here, what do we do?

225
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,730
Well, we do the same idea.

226
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,490
So let's define the
subspace V3.

227
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,430
This is going to be a
three-dimensional subspace.

228
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,340
Once we get beyond V3, it
becomes a little hard to

229
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,720
visualize, but I think you're
going to see the

230
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,240
pattern after this step.

231
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:29,920
If we define V3 as equal to the
span of these guys, U1,

232
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,420
U2, and then, in our
original basis, V3.

233
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,980
I didn't write it there but
there's a V3 there.

234
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,150
So in our original
non-orthonormal

235
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,980
basis, we have V3.

236
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,110
What is this going
to look like?

237
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,870
Or how can we turn this into
an orthonormal basis?

238
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:53,060
So, if you visualize all of
these, so the span of U1 and

239
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:57,460
U2, our subspace V2 is just
going to be a plane.

240
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,720
It's going to be
a plane in R3.

241
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,950
It's going to look like
that right there.

242
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,430
And so, our new span is going
to be everything in that

243
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:10,370
plane, all linear combinations
of things in that plane, plus

244
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:14,010
linear combinations of our
vector V3, which is linearly

245
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,930
independent from these guys
because it was linearly

246
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:19,220
independent from the stuff we
used to construct these guys.

247
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,605
So V3 is going to pop
out of this plane.

248
00:13:21,605 --> 00:13:23,170
It can't be represented
by the linear

249
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,610
combination of those guys.

250
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,650
So let's say V3 pops out of
the plane, like that.

251
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:33,730
Now, we want another vector that
can represent everything

252
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,760
of this span, but it is
orthogonal to these dudes

253
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,920
right here.

254
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,190
Or another way to think
about it, it's

255
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,320
orthogonal to the plane.

256
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,990
So we want another vector that
is orthogonal to the plane.

257
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:51,460
So let's call that vector y3,
y sub 3, not y to the third

258
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,340
power, y sub 3.

259
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:59,420
And if we figure out our y sub
three, we can replace V3 with

260
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,570
it because V3 can be represented
as a linear

261
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,250
combination of U1 and U2.

262
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:03,890
Right?

263
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:06,850
That's going to be a linear
combination of U1, U2 is going

264
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:10,810
to be some vector in
this plane plus y3.

265
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:13,460
I can represent this guy with
this green vector plus this

266
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:13,910
vector right here.

267
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:17,370
So if we replace him with y3, we
can still get to V3 and we

268
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,600
can still get to all the linear
combinations that V3

269
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,020
can help construct.

270
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,040
So what is this y3?

271
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,160
Well, by the same exact logic,
this green vector right here

272
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:37,110
is the projection of my vector
V3 onto the subspace V2 and

273
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:44,300
your vector y3 is just equal
to the vector V3 minus the

274
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:51,360
projection of V3 onto V2.

275
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,370
So, what is that going to be?

276
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:56,950
Well, the projection-- I'll
write it here-- the projection

277
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:03,560
onto the subspace V2 of V3, of
the vector V3 is going to be

278
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,380
equal to-- we're going
to use the same exact

279
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,310
logic we did before.

280
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,140
We saw this two or
three videos ago.

281
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:13,170
Because V2 is defined with an
orthonormal basis, we can say

282
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:19,260
that the projection of V3 onto
that subspace is V3, dot our

283
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:25,460
first basis vector, dot U1,
times our first basis vector,

284
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:32,550
plus V3 dot our second basis
vector, our second orthonormal

285
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:36,090
basis vector, times our second
orthonormal basis vector.

286
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:36,770
It's that easy.

287
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,440
That's one of the neat things
about having an

288
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,680
orthonormal basis was.

289
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,200
This is an orthonormal basis.

290
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,870
So we can define the projection
in this way.

291
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:47,570
So y is just going to be V3
minus this business right

292
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,460
here, and I'll just write out.

293
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:59,910
So y3 is going to be V3 minus
the projection of V3 onto V2.

294
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:04,690
So minus that business
right there.

295
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:08,700
Let me copy it, and then
let me paste it.

296
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,770
And then you get y3.

297
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,105
And y3 is nice.

298
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:16,310
So if we replace this with y3,
which we can because we can

299
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,970
now get V3 as a linear
combination of

300
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,520
these guys and y3.

301
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,870
That's nice because all of these
guys are orthogonal with

302
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:28,500
respect to each other, but y3
does not have length 1 yet.

303
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,630
It hasn't been normalized.

304
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,950
So we can just replace y3 with
another unit vector.

305
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:38,950
We'll just say, U3 is equal to
y3 divided by the length of

306
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,450
y3, whatever that might be.

307
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,880
But if we have what y3 is, we
can figure out its length and

308
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,080
divide by that.

309
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:50,550
And then if you put-- so this
is equal to the span of U1,

310
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:54,700
U2, and U3.

311
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:59,300
So U3 might be a scaled-down
version of y3.

312
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,860
We're talking about linear
combinations when we talk

313
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,070
about span, so you can scale
them up and add it to the

314
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:03,480
projection.

315
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,589
You're still going to get V3.

316
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:07,190
And now, these are all
normalized vectors.

317
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:11,720
And so you would not have an
orthonormal basis for the

318
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,119
subspace V3.

319
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,589
I think you get the
pattern now.

320
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:15,935
You can keep doing this.

321
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:18,520
   

322
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:23,950
You can define V4, when I
defined the problem I just

323
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:27,030
said that we're dealing with
a k dimensional subspace.

324
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:27,930
We go up to Vk.

325
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,580
But you just keep going until
you go up to your k.

326
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,570
If k was 3, we'd be done.

327
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:38,650
If k is 4, you say you define a
subspace V4 is equal to the

328
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:47,290
span of U1, U2, U3, and then
throw our non-orthonormal

329
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,700
vector, V4, into the mix.

330
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:59,180
And so you can replace V4 with
y4 is equal V4 minus the

331
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,080
projection.

332
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,370
It becomes a little
hard to visualize.

333
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,720
You're not projecting on to
a three-dimensional space.

334
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:10,280
The projection of V4 onto
our subspace V3.

335
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,120
It's completely analogous
to this.

336
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,370
It's just V3 is now a
three-dimensional

337
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:15,190
space, not a plane.

338
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:15,690
You're [? finding ?]

339
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:16,700
this projection onto this.

340
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:21,300
This is definitely going to be
orthogonal to everything else,

341
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,090
to our subspace V3.

342
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:31,560
And you can construct V4 with y4
because V4, by definition,

343
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:36,120
is equal to-- we can just
rearrange this-- y4 plus the

344
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:40,480
projection of V4 onto V3.

345
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,275
So you can construct V4 with y4
and some linear combination

346
00:18:44,275 --> 00:18:45,140
of these guys.

347
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,860
So I can replace this guy
with y4 and then I

348
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,920
would normalize y4.

349
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,145
I would divide it by its
length and I'd get U4.

350
00:18:51,145 --> 00:18:54,660
And I just keep doing that
until I get up to k.

351
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,290
If I do V5, I do the process
over and over and over again.

352
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:05,060
And this process of creating an
orthonormal basis is called

353
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:12,275
the Gram-Schmidt Process.

354
00:19:12,275 --> 00:19:14,760
And it might seem a little
abstract, the way I did it

355
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,480
here, but in the next video
I'm actually going to find

356
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,820
orthonormal bases
for subspaces.

357
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,640
You'll see it's not too bad
when you have to deal with

358
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,110
real numbers.

359
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,428
