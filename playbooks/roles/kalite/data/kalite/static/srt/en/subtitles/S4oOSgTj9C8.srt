1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760
   

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,360
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,290
We're doing part b and part
of problem number two.

4
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,660
And it says, use a trapezoidal
sum with 3 subintervals to

5
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,390
estimate the average number
of people waiting in line

6
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,030
during the first 4 hours.

7
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,840
And so I just took the data
they gave, graphed it.

8
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,560
I did that in the last video.

9
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,880
And so, use trapezoidal sum
with 3 subintervals to estimate

10
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,140
the average number of people--
that sounds very complicated.

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,470
Like boy, I don't-- that
sounds-- yeah, you know, I

12
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,260
didn't learn trapezoidal
sums, or however you

13
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:27,910
want to think about it.

14
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:28,770
It could be very confusing.

15
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,350
And frankly, I haven't taken
calculus in 20 years.

16
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,720
But you really just have to
think about what they're

17
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,370
saying, and it's
not that daunting.

18
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,300
So what's the average
value of a function?

19
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,180
And you learned
this in calculus.

20
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,660
You might not remember it.

21
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,640
   

22
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:50,020
So let's say the average value
of f is equal to essentially--

23
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,860
let's say, between 2 points, b
and a-- it's the difference

24
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,230
between the 2 points divided by
the area under the

25
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,780
curve of f of x.

26
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:01,840
From a to b.

27
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,190
Right?

28
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,470
That's, I think they call
that the second fundamental

29
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:05,300
theorem of calculus.

30
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,180
Or corollary to the fundamental
theorem of calculus, whatever.

31
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,140
But it makes sense.

32
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:09,700
Right?

33
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,790
The average value of a function
is equal to the area under the

34
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:16,210
curve divided by, you
could kind of say, the

35
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,350
base of the figure.

36
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,260
Right?

37
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,820
Because another way to think
about it, if you just took the

38
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,930
average value of the function--
so if the function was, say,

39
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,310
this, and you just multiplied
that average value times the

40
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,660
base, you would get the
same area as the integral.

41
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,550
That's another way to view it.

42
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,460
You could rewrite
this as b minus a.

43
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,540
The base times the average
value is the same thing as

44
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,655
the area under the curve.

45
00:01:43,655 --> 00:01:47,010
   

46
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,490
So that's another
way to view it.

47
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,670
So let's just apply that here.

48
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,670
Let's use the trapezoidal sum
to figure out the area under

49
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,840
this curve, or an estimate of
the area under l of t, and then

50
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,750
we can divide by b minus a.

51
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,810
Or in that case,
b is 4, a is 0.

52
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,880
And we'll have the average
value of-- over the first 4

53
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,500
hours-- of the people in line.

54
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,760
So let's do that.

55
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,350
Let me erase it.

56
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,530
We're actually not going
to use an interval.

57
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,120
We're going to use a
trapezoidal sum to

58
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,030
estimate the integral.

59
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,610
So it says, 3 intervals.

60
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,390
It says a trapezoidal sum
with 3 subintervals.

61
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:26,570
Well, I see, there's 3 very
natural subintervals here.

62
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,560
And let me draw them.

63
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,030
So this is one.

64
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,750
Actually let me-- I'll
draw the dotted lines.

65
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,370
This is one subinterval.

66
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,600
This is another subinterval.

67
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,160
And there we have it.

68
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,130
We have three trapezoids.

69
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:45,860
We have this one, we
have this one, and we

70
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,300
have this trapezoid.

71
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,150
So we essentially just have
to figure out the area of

72
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,230
each of these trapezoids.

73
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,430
Let me see if I can draw that
a little bit-- I drew them

74
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,080
in different colors, just so
you can see the trapezoids.

75
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,660
So this trapezoid goes goes
from-- oh, I don't know

76
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,560
if I'm doing this right.

77
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,550
Let's see.

78
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,220
I'll use a line tool.

79
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:09,565
So 1 trapezoid here, and
another trapezoid there.

80
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:11,690
And then another
trapezoid there.

81
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,480
And I just need to figure out
the areas of each of these

82
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,160
trapezoids, and that's my
estimate of the area under the

83
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,860
curve of l of t, from 0 to 4.

84
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,480
And then I just divide
it by 4, and I'm done.

85
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,870
Part b.

86
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,170
So what's the area of
this first trapezoid?

87
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,110
Well, what do you do to find
an area of a trapezoid?

88
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,900
It's the base.

89
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,520
So this area of the trapezoid
right here, this first

90
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,980
one, is the base.

91
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,240
Which is just 1.

92
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,380
1 times the average
of the two heights.

93
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:39,690
Right?

94
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,830
So it's the average.

95
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,470
Right here it's 120,
and this is 156.

96
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:49,570
So what's the average
of 120 and 156?

97
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:52,230
Well, the average of 120
and 156-- let's see.

98
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:59,810
We get 276 divided by 2 is 138.

99
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,380
So it's 1 times 138
or it's just 138.

100
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,870
That's the area of
that trapezoid.

101
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,090
What's the area of this
trapezoid right here?

102
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,430
This bigger one?

103
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,320
Well, its base is 2, right?

104
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,750
1, 2.

105
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,450
Its base is 2.

106
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,060
And what's the average value?

107
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,470
Well, it's going to
be the average value

108
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,670
between 156 and 176.

109
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,230
Or the average value between
this height and this height.

110
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,210
That's an easier one, right?

111
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,456
166 is right in between
those two, and we

112
00:04:26,456 --> 00:04:27,050
don't have to do much.

113
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,650
So it's 2 times 166.

114
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,110
Sorry, 166, not 1.66.

115
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:39,130
And finally, what's the average
value of this trap-- or what's

116
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,240
the area in this trapezoid?

117
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,260
Well, the base is 1, right?

118
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,180
It's going from 3 to 4.

119
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,930
1 times the average value.

120
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,380
So 176 and 126.

121
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,520
So that is 1/2
times-- what's 176?

122
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,430
Let me use a calculator, just
so I don't make any mistakes.

123
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,180
Trusty TI-85 emulator.

124
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,130
Let's see.

125
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:08,880
176 plus 126.

126
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,980
Enter.

127
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,710
Divided by 2, is equal to 151.

128
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,090
So this area right here
is 1 times 151, or 151.

129
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,550
So what's the total area?

130
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,530
It's just going to be the
sum of these 3 trapezoids.

131
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,340
So it's the sum of
those 3 trapezoids.

132
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:39,880
So it's going to be 138
plus 2 times 166 plus 151.

133
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,050
So that's the total area
under those trapezoids.

134
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,400
But then they ask us,
well, what's the average

135
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,480
value of the function?

136
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,690
Well, the average value is just
the area divided by the base.

137
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,020
The base is 4, right?

138
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,900
From noon to 4:00 p.m.

139
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,520
or from time equals
0 to time equals 4.

140
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,610
So we just divide
this value by 4.

141
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:05,670
So divided by 4, we get 155.25.

142
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,125
So they say, use a trapezoidal
sum with 3 subintervals to

143
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,550
estimate the average number of
people waiting in line during

144
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,060
the first 4 hours that the
tickets were on sale.

145
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,110
So the answer to
part b is 155.25.

146
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,940
They don't tell us to round it
or anything, so I'm assuming

147
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,620
that's, you know, if we're
saying the average number of

148
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,720
people, I guess we can
have a fraction there.

149
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,375
So that's reasonable.

150
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,890
   

151
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:26,630
Let's see, what part are we?

152
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,270
We're on part c.

153
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,970
OK.

154
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,300
So part c.

155
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,940
I think that's going to
use this graph, too.

156
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,240
So let me erase at
least this top part.

157
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,960
   

158
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,230
The top part I can erase.

159
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,280
I can erase this,
I can erase that.

160
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,370
I want to erase all the
unnecessary things.

161
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:54,550
Let me see if I can-- let's
see, I can erase all of that.

162
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,770
Just want to make it
as neat as possible.

163
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,820
I think this graph is going
to come in useful in part

164
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:01,470
c, by just glancing at it.

165
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:01,810
OK.

166
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,760
That's good enough, I think.

167
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,510
OK, let's do part c.

168
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:09,680
Let me copy and paste it.

169
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,410
   

170
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,070
Part c.

171
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:18,670
   

172
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,050
OK, copied it.

173
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,005
Edit, paste.

174
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:23,770
   

175
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,600
OK.

176
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,940
For t is greater than 0,
is less than 9, right?

177
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,840
What is the fewest number
of times at which l prime

178
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,340
of t must be equal to 0?

179
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,020
Give a reason for your answer.

180
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:39,180
So l prime of t, that's
the derivative of this.

181
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,780
When I connected these dots,
I just kind of wanted to

182
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,640
get a shape of the curve.

183
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,430
But it's really a curve.

184
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,090
It's not like this sharp
edged line, right?

185
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:46,880
And how do we know
it's a curve?

186
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,370
Because it's differentiable.

187
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,360
It's continuous.

188
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,620
It's actually twice
differentiable.

189
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,800
Which tells us the
derivative is continuous.

190
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,070
So the real graph of this is
going to look something--

191
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,630
you know, let me do it in
a bold color like magenta.

192
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,390
You know, it might look
something like this.

193
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:03,990
I don't know, a curve and
then it maxes out at

194
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,880
some point, comes down.

195
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,530
Then it comes up like this.

196
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,750
And then it, maybe it
maxes out, and it

197
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,190
comes down like that.

198
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,480
It'll be a curve, right?

199
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,190
Anyway, they say, what is the
fewest number of times that l

200
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,940
prime of t must be equal to 0?

201
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:25,100
Well, what happens when l
prime of t is equal to 0?

202
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,560
That means that we are at
a local minima or a local

203
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,470
maxima, or sometimes
an inflection point.

204
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,170
But we don't know
that for sure.

205
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:38,610
But at minima and maxima point,
we know for sure that l

206
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,400
prime of t is equal to 0.

207
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,630
And so we can just eyeball it.

208
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,870
We could look at this graph and
we could say, well, you know,

209
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,280
there has to be a minima point
someplace in this range.

210
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:47,550
Right?

211
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,280
Between here and here.

212
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,620
So, you know, the way I
drew it, it looks like

213
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,980
the slope is 0 there.

214
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,740
And between here and here, it
looks like the slope is also

215
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,420
going to have to bottom
out at some point.

216
00:08:59,420 --> 00:08:59,930
Like there.

217
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,380
And then there's a maximum
point right-- someplace in

218
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,590
this range, and it's
going to max out.

219
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:07,410
So when I just eyeball it, I
say, well, I have 2 maximum

220
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,040
points, and one minima point,
so the slope is going to equal

221
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,750
0 at at least 3 points, right?

222
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,520
But they tell us, give us
a reason for your answer.

223
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,210
Give us a reason.

224
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:21,950
And my reason-- and actually,
you could use Rolle's Theorem

225
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:26,090
or the mean value theorem, but
the simplest reason is that

226
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:31,210
here we have 3 sign changes
in the average velocity.

227
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,820
Or the average, not the
average velocity, the

228
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,290
rate-- the l of t.

229
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,300
We're not doing velocity
in this problem.

230
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,770
So from here-- let me
use a thicker line.

231
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,390
Use yellow.

232
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,680
So from here to here,
we have a sign change.

233
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,890
From here to here, we
have a sign change.

234
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,400
And from here to here, we
could have a sign change.

235
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,040
So what I would write down at
the AP exam, is, I was like,

236
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,300
well, the function is twice
differentiable, which means

237
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,360
its derivative is continuous.

238
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,620
So let me write down
the important points.

239
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,975
So derivative is continuous.

240
00:10:01,975 --> 00:10:06,460
   

241
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:10,380
And we have 3 sign changes
in the derivative, right?

242
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:14,080
The derivative is positive over
this interval, or at least

243
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,480
its average is positive,
then it goes negative.

244
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,130
So at some point, since the
derivative is continuous-- it

245
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:21,930
doesn't jump around-- it had
to be positive someplace

246
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:22,760
in this range.

247
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,690
And you can be more formal
when you write it.

248
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,140
It had to be negative
someplace in this range.

249
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,160
So there had to be a sign
change, and so it had

250
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,680
to pass through 0.

251
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,160
And that same argument could
be used between here and

252
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,030
here, and here and here.

253
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,490
And that's my answer.

254
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:40,260
And I will continue part d in
the next video, because I'm

255
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,570
already over 10 minutes.
