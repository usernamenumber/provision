1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490
   

2
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:06,170
Let's say I've got some set
A of the vectors a1, a2,

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,109
all the way to an.

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:12,620
And I know for a fact that
it's a basis for

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,990
the subspace V.

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,400
What I want to show you in this
video is that if this guy

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:25,210
has n elements right here, that
any set that spans V has

8
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,210
to have at least n elements,
[typing]

9
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:43,070
   

10
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,160
or n members, or cardinality
of n.

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,020
There's all different ways
of saying you had n

12
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,270
vectors in this set.

13
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,700
   

14
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,920
I'm saying that every set that
spans V must have at least n

15
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,340
elements, if the sum basis
set has n elements for V.

16
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,959
Let's see if we can kind of run
with the set that has less

17
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,820
than n elements and see if we
reach any contradictions.

18
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:13,155
So let's say that I have sum set
B here and it's equal to

19
00:01:13,155 --> 00:01:18,330
the vectors b1, b2,
all the way to bm.

20
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,420
And m is less than n, so I have
sum set of vectors here

21
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:27,060
that have fewer elements
than my set A.

22
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,180
So you come to me one day and
say, look I found you this set

23
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,390
of vectors right here.

24
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,140
And not only does it have
fewer elements than A,

25
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,500
but it spans V.

26
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,460
I look at you very suspiciously
because I always

27
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,440
thought that this green
statement was true.

28
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,860
So we start a little bit of
a thought experiment.

29
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,970
And I say OK, you claim
that your set spans

30
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,900
V, so let's do something.

31
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,500
Let me define a new set.

32
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,080
Let me call this new set B1
prime, and you'll see why I'm

33
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,430
doing this kind of
strange notation.

34
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:03,230
What's essentially going to be
is a set B plus my vector a1.

35
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:07,070
So it's a1, and then I have
all of my elements of B.

36
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:12,350
So be b1, b2, all
the way to bm.

37
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:15,390
Now I think you and I could both
agree that this set is

38
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,530
linearly dependent.

39
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,240
How do I know that?

40
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,240
Linear dependence means that at
least one of the elements

41
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,100
of the set can be represented
as a linear

42
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,720
combination of the others.

43
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,610
Well, we know that a1 is one of
the basis vectors for V for

44
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:31,800
this definition of a basis.

45
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,510
But all the basis vectors
are members of V.

46
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:41,520
   

47
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,970
If this set is a basis for V,
then this means that this set

48
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,360
spans V, or that every member
of V can be represented as a

49
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,990
linear combination
of these guys.

50
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,980
Or in other ways every
linear combination of

51
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,710
these guys is in V.

52
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,600
And one of the linear
combinations of these guys is

53
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:01,280
you just set the coefficient
on a1 to be 1, and the

54
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,240
coefficients on everyone
else to be 0.

55
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,610
So obviously a1 is
also in the set.

56
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:12,110
So if a1 is in V, and all
of these guys span V, by

57
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,680
definition if these guys span
V some linear combination of

58
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,390
these guys can be used to
construct any member of V.

59
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,910
So you can take some linear
combination of these guys to

60
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,010
construct a1.

61
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:29,590
So you could say a1 is equal to
d1, where the d's are the

62
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:37,950
constants, d1 b1 plus d2 b2, all
the way to dm bm, and at

63
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,080
least one of these have
to be non-zero.

64
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,010
We know that a is a
non-zero vector.

65
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,800
If it was a 0 vector, this
couldn't be a basis because it

66
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,570
wouldn't be linearly
independent, because you can

67
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:51,210
always represent a 0 vector
as really just 0

68
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,270
times any other vector.

69
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,830
So this won't be a 0 vector.

70
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,390
So at least one of these
are non-zero.

71
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:01,130
So let's just say, for the sake
of argument, that dj --

72
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,550
so the coefficient on
bj is non-zero.

73
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:08,610
So dj does not equal 0.

74
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,910
So we could actually solve
for that term.

75
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:16,959
So over here someplace you have
the term dj bj, plus a

76
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,010
bunch of other stuff.

77
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,110
We can solve for this term if we
subtract it from both sides

78
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:25,070
of the equation, and then divide
both sides by minus dj,

79
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:29,360
and put this minus a1 on the
other side, what do we get?

80
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,960
I know that was a lot of
operations, but that's just

81
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,750
straight up algebra.

82
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,470
I think you can say that we
could rewrite this right here.

83
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,720
We can solve for bj.

84
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:41,360
   

85
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,470
That should be equal to minus
1 over its coefficient.

86
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:51,620
And, if we subtract the a1 from
both sides and then plus

87
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:57,640
all of these guys, plus d1 b1
plus all the way -- you're

88
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,300
going to have a little
bit of a gap here.

89
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,080
I'll just draw it like that.

90
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,370
It's very unconventional
notation where this guy sat.

91
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,090
All the way to dm bm.

92
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:10,160
I'm doing this all of this to
show you that, by definition,

93
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,240
you can write a1 as a
linear combination

94
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,050
of these other guys.

95
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,400
But you can just rearrange
things.

96
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,160
You can rearrange it so that you
can write one of the other

97
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,180
guys as a linear combination
of the rest of the

98
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,910
other guys and a1.

99
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,490
   

100
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,330
This guy's now redundant.

101
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,780
I don't need this guy any longer
to continue to span V.

102
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,860
Clearly this set
still spans V.

103
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,270
I added an extra vector here.

104
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:41,390
But I can remove this guy right
here from my set b1

105
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,980
prime and still span V.

106
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,080
And how do I know that?

107
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,410
Because I can achieve him.

108
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,220
By removing him, I don't
lose anything.

109
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,550
Because if I needed this vector
to create some other

110
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,310
vector, I can construct him with
a linear combination of

111
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:59,180
the rest of the b's,
plus my a1.

112
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,680
So let's get rid of him,
and call that set v1.

113
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,270
And actually, just for the sake
of notation, let me just

114
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,600
change his name.

115
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,840
This is little unconventional.

116
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,350
You won't see it done like
this in any textbook.

117
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,470
But I think it's a little bit
easier, instead of having to

118
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,420
keep talking about these little
guys that are embedded

119
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,250
someplace in the middle
of the stream.

120
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:24,380
I mean these names, b1, b2, bn,
they're arbitrary names.

121
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,690
Let me swap the labels.

122
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,860
Let me just say that bj is equal
to b1, and that b1 is

123
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,660
equal to bj.

124
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,230
I'm just swapping their names.

125
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,590
I took that guy, I
renamed him b1.

126
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:40,120
I renamed b1, bj, so that
I could swap them.

127
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,610
So I'm essentially just going
to remove b1 one from the

128
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,210
vector just to make my
notation easier.

129
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,490
You could just keep saying I'll
remove this bj from the

130
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,980
middle, but it becomes
very confusing then.

131
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:53,150
So let me call my new set after
removing the bj that

132
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:58,880
I've renamed as b1, let me just
call that straight up B1.

133
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:06,470
So my straight set B1 is equal
to a1, and then remember I

134
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,100
removed the bj and I renamed
that as b1, and then I

135
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,380
renamed b1 as bj.

136
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,840
So now my set looks like
this -- let me go

137
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,900
to the other color.

138
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,130
b2 -- and for all we know
bj might have been

139
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,830
b1, we don't know.

140
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,930
There are probably multiple of
these that are non-zero, so we

141
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,480
could pick any of those
to be our bj.

142
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,150
But anyway, we took our
bj renamed it b1,

143
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,590
and removed the b1.

144
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:36,130
So now out set looks like this:
b3 all the way to bm.

145
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:39,320
   

146
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:44,100
This set still spans V.

147
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,230
And we know that because the
guy we removed can be

148
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:50,270
constructed with any linear
combination of these guys.

149
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,130
So we haven't lost our ability
to construct all of the

150
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,480
vectors in V.

151
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,730
Now let me create
another vector.

152
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:59,420
   

153
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,160
We'll do a new color.

154
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,430
Let's say I have the
vector B2 prime.

155
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,110
And what I'm going to do here
is now I'm going to take

156
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,700
another element from
our basis of V.

157
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,560
I'll take the second element;
I'll take a2.

158
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,820
I'll take a2 and throw
it on this guy.

159
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:23,970
So now we have the set B2 prime
is equal to -- I'm going

160
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,220
to add a2 to this guy.

161
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:31,090
So you have a1, a2, and then you
have all the rest of these

162
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:36,360
guys, b2, b3 all the way bm.

163
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,169
Of course this still spans V,
I just added something here.

164
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:41,460
But this is definitely
linearly dependent.

165
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,240
Remember I didn't say in the
beginning whether this was

166
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,710
linear dependent or not.

167
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,700
It may or may not be.

168
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,650
But when you add this other
vector that's in V, you

169
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,490
definitely know that you're
linear dependent, because

170
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,730
these guys can construct
that guy.

171
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:56,380
Similarly we know that this
vector B1 spans V.

172
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:01,550
So when we add this new element
here, we know that it

173
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,950
can be written as a linear
combination of the other one.

174
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,940
So we know that this right here
is linearly dependent.

175
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:12,770
And we could say that a2 is
equal to some constant times

176
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:28,260
c1 times a1 plus c2 b2 plus c3
b3, all the way to cm bm.

177
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,240
Now what I'm going to claim is
that at least one of these

178
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,610
coefficients is non-zero.

179
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:37,160
So at least one of the ci's
does not equal to 0.

180
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,800
And I'll make the further claim
that there's at least

181
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,170
one that's outside
of this one.

182
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:46,440
   

183
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,670
That at least one of the
coefficients on these B terms

184
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,230
has to be non-zero.

185
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,350
And the way you can think about
is, what if all of these

186
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,750
guys were 0?

187
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,070
If all of these guys were 0,
then that means that a2 is a

188
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,490
linear combination of a1.

189
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,640
All of these guys would cancel
out, and you'd have a2 is

190
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,440
equal to some non-zero
constant times a1.

191
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,440
We know that's not the case
because these two guys come

192
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,630
from the same linearly
independent set.

193
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:17,150
They both come from that
spanning basis.

194
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,180
The fact that they are a basis
-- the word spanning basis, I

195
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,600
shouldn't say it like that,
because it's redundant.

196
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,710
A basis is a spanning set that
is linearly independent.

197
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,140
If they're linearly independent
we know that a2

198
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,240
cannot be represented as some
linear combination of the rest

199
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,310
of these guys.

200
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:37,710
So we know that one of the
coefficients on the B terms

201
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,780
has to be non-zero.

202
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:46,170
And let's just say that you're
going to have a cj bj, this is

203
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,930
a different one than
we had before.

204
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:51,760
And we know that this guy, at
least one of them has to be

205
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,760
non-zero, because if all of
these guys were non-zero, then

206
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,910
you wouldn't be able to say
that this vector and that

207
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,780
vector are linearly independent,
because they

208
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,900
would be scalar multiples
of each other.

209
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,050
So we're going to do
the same exercise.

210
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:12,600
This guy right here, cj bj,
obviously this coefficient is

211
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,920
non-zero so we can
solve for our bj.

212
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:20,500
Once again we can say that bj is
equal minus 1 over cj times

213
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:28,070
minus a2 plus c1 a1, all
the way to cm bm.

214
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,860
So we have some bj here that can
be represented as a linear

215
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,420
combination of the rest of the
people, including our new a2.

216
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,250
And so, just like we did before,
let's remove him.

217
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,640
Let's take him out of the set.

218
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,290
And before I take him
out of the set, I'm

219
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,230
going to rename him.

220
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:46,750
Just solely for the purpose of
notational simplicity, I'm

221
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:51,770
just going to rename our bj, b2,
and our b2 is equal to bj.

222
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,600
So I'm just rearranging
the names.

223
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,380
And I'm going to
remove our b2.

224
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,700
Or I'm going to remove
what I now call b2.

225
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,260
It was whatever was out here
that could be represented as a

226
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,340
linear combination of
everything else,

227
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,590
including our new a2.

228
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,290
   

229
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:14,000
When I remove one of those
terms right here, and I

230
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,250
renamed it B2.

231
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,210
   

232
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:25,670
And now it's equal to a1
a2, and now I have the

233
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,030
leftovers of my b's.

234
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:33,290
So I have b3, b4, all
the way to bm.

235
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:36,780
Notice I still have exactly
m elements, and

236
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,410
this still spans V.

237
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:43,870
It spans V because the element
that I took out of it can be

238
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,650
represented as a linear
combination of these guys.

239
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,780
So if I ever want to construct
anything that need that, I can

240
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,750
construct that vector with some

241
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,610
combination of these guys.

242
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,780
So it wasn't necessary.

243
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,460
It still spans V.

244
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,300
So this process I'm doing, I
can just keep repeating it.

245
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,700
I can add an a3.

246
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,600
I can define B3 prime.

247
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,960
I can just add a3 to this
set right here, a2 a3.

248
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:17,350
And then I have my b3, b4,
all the way to bm.

249
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:21,050
And I'll say this is linearly
dependent because

250
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,830
this guy spans V.

251
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:25,130
So everything but this
guy spans V.

252
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,750
So obviously you can construct
this guy with a linear

253
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,460
combination of the
rest of them.

254
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:37,610
So you could say a3 is equal to
sum a1 plus sum a2 plus c3

255
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:41,670
b3, all the way to cm bm.

256
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,310
And we know that at least one
of the coefficients on the B

257
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:48,190
terms has to be non-zero.

258
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,040
Because if all of those were
0, then you would be saying

259
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,060
that a3 could be a linear
combination of the A terms.

260
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,640
And we know that a3 can't be
a representative linear

261
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,570
combination of the A terms,
because all these a terms come

262
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,900
from a linearly independent
set.

263
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,430
So you do the same operation.

264
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:12,430
Let's say that cj is non-zero.

265
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,550
Then you could solve
for that bj.

266
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,650
And then I do that little
renaming thing I do, where I

267
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:21,220
rename the bj b3, and rename b3
bj, and then I remove b3.

268
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,100
   

269
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:31,840
And I get the set B3 is
equal to a1, a2, a3.

270
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,750
And I have b4 all
the way to bm.

271
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,200
And this still spans V.

272
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,640
And I keep doing it.

273
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,500
So what's going to happen
eventually?

274
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,210
What's going to happen if I keep
doing this process over

275
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:48,600
and over and over again?

276
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,460
Eventually I'll essentially
replace all of the bm's.

277
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,730
Or I'll replace all of the n
terms, so eventually I'll have

278
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,580
a set that looks like this.

279
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:02,470
I'll have a set that looks Bm,
where I will have replaced

280
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,150
each of these guys with an a.

281
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:07,060
   

282
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:12,480
So I have a1, a2, a3,
all the way to am.

283
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,330
You can always do this by
definition if you started with

284
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,850
that initial set B that
is a spanning set.

285
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,345
And once you do this process
you'll get the same result

286
00:15:20,345 --> 00:15:24,090
that this also spans V.

287
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,440
Now let me let me write this.

288
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,890
This is the result we got by
starting off with a spanning

289
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:34,490
set B that has m elements,
where we said that m

290
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,190
is less than n.

291
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,530
So we always have enough a
elements to do this, because

292
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,260
we have more a elements
than there were b

293
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,450
elements to begin with.

294
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,370
And we get result that
this spans V.

295
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:51,840
But we already said that the
set A which is equal to a1,

296
00:15:51,840 --> 00:16:00,430
a2, all the way to am, and then
am plus 1, I don't know

297
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,580
how many more terms there are
between m and n, but then you

298
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,610
go all the way to an.

299
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:07,000
Remember we said that
n is greater than m.

300
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,610
Or when we defined B, we said
that m is less than n.

301
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,990
Same thing, that this
was a smaller set.

302
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:16,380
Now we're saying that this spans
V, but at the same time

303
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,990
we said this was a basis.

304
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,880
This is just our starting
fact, that this

305
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,410
is a basis for V.

306
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:28,900
Basis means two things: it means
it spans V and it means

307
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,910
it's linearly independent.

308
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:35,430
Now we just got this result by
assuming that we had some set

309
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,100
B that's smaller than this
set here that spans V.

310
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,420
We were able to construct this
by saying that a1 through am

311
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,350
also spans V.

312
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:48,250
The result we got is
that this spans V.

313
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:53,440
But if this subset of A spans
V, then A becomes linearly

314
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:53,900
independent.

315
00:16:53,900 --> 00:17:00,260
Because if this subset spans V,
that means that an can be

316
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:05,240
represented as some linear
combination of these guys.

317
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,560
So that implies that you're
linearly dependent, which is a

318
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,300
contradiction with our original
statement that set A

319
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,839
is a basis for V, because
that means it's linearly

320
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,869
independent.

321
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:18,810
If you're able to do this, then
this means that there was

322
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:22,390
some smaller spanning set, you
get the result that A has to

323
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,589
be linearly dependant, even
though we said it was linearly

324
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:25,700
independent.

325
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,860
So we now know, we get our
contradiction, we say that

326
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,580
there cannot be [typing]

327
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:43,480
   

328
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:59,640
a spanning set B that has
fewer elements than A.

329
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:05,010
And this is a pretty neat
outcome, because now, if I

330
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:12,160
come up to you and say I
found some set X spans

331
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,960
the subspace V again.

332
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,550
Then you know that X
has five elements.

333
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:26,870
You now know that no set that
spans the subspace V can have

334
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,560
fewer than five elements.

335
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:36,230
Even better, if I told you that
X is a basis for V, and I

336
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:42,370
told you it has five elements,
and Y is a basis for V.

337
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:43,620
[typing]

338
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:58,130
   

339
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:01,320
You know that Y also has to have
exactly five elements.

340
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,460
   

341
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,310
How do I know that?

342
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:13,450
Well, if Y is a basis, then that
means that it spans V.

343
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,000
And we know it can't
have anything

344
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,310
less than five elements.

345
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,450
We just proved that.

346
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,380
One way we know that Y has to
have greater than or equal to

347
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,730
five elements.

348
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:30,430
But on the other hand we know if
Y is a basis for V and X is

349
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,590
a basis, X also spans V.

350
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:35,360
So we know that X has to have
fewer elements than Y.

351
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,395
So we know that [typing]

352
00:19:37,395 --> 00:19:40,060
   

353
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:49,010
Y's elements have to be greater
than X's elements,

354
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:52,170
because any spanning set has to
have more elements, or at

355
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:58,170
least as many elements, as a
basis set, X's elements.

356
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:03,570
And then since X is a spanning
set, X's elements have to be

357
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,310
greater than or equal
to Y's elements,

358
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,560
because why is a basis.

359
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:11,650
   

360
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:15,530
But if this guy's elements are
less than this guy's elements,

361
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:19,250
but it's also greater than or
equal to, we know that the

362
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:23,190
number of elements that X has--
X's elements, or the

363
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,180
cardinality or the number of
elements in it --is equal to

364
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,430
Y's elements.

365
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:30,200
   

366
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:39,190
And so now that we know that any
basis for a vector space--

367
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,610
Let me just go back
to our set A.

368
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:45,080
A is equal to a1 a2,
all the way to an.

369
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:51,040
We can now say that any basis
for some vector, for some

370
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,700
subspace V, they all have the
same number of elements.

371
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,770
And so we can define a
new term called the

372
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:03,510
dimension of V.

373
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:07,270
Sometimes it's written just as
dimension of V, is equal to

374
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:10,530
the number of elements,
sometimes called the

375
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:17,670
cardinality, of any
basis of V.

376
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,880
And I went through great pains
in this video to show that any

377
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,740
basis of V all has the same
number of elements, so this is

378
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,870
well-defined.

379
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,120
You can't have one basis that
has five elements and

380
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:26,900
one that has six.

381
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,920
By definition they would either
both have to have five,

382
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,520
or they both would
have to have six.

383
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,550
And so we can define
our dimensionality.

384
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,421
