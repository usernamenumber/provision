1
00:00:02,239 --> 00:00:06,509
I wanna figure out how blood gets from my heart, which I'm going to draw here,

2
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:13,201
all the way to my toe, and I'm going to draw my foot over here and show you which toe I'm talking about.

3
00:00:13,201 --> 00:00:15,933
Let's say this toe right here.

4
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:24,037
Now, to start the journey, it's gonna have to out of the left ventricle and into the largest artery of the body.

5
00:00:24,037 --> 00:00:31,602
This is going to be the aorta, and the aorta is very, very wide across, and that's why I say it's a large artery.

6
00:00:31,602 --> 00:00:35,905
And, from the aorta, I'm actually not drawing all the branches of the aorta,

7
00:00:35,905 --> 00:00:44,876
but from the aorta, it's going to go down into my belly, and it's going to branch towards my left leg and my right leg.

8
00:00:44,876 --> 00:00:48,407
So, let's say we follow just the left leg,

9
00:00:48,407 --> 00:00:50,742
so this artery over here on the top,

10
00:00:50,742 --> 00:00:56,504
it's gonna get a little bit smaller, and maybe I would call this a medium-sized artery by this point.

11
00:00:56,504 --> 00:01:00,037
Ah, this is actually now getting down towards my ankle.

12
00:01:00,037 --> 00:01:04,004
Let's say we've gone quite a distance down to my ankle,

13
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:09,369
and then, you know there are, of course, little branches, and let's just follow the branch that goes towards my foot,

14
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:10,500
which is this top one.

15
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,232
Let's say this one goes towards my foot,

16
00:01:12,232 --> 00:01:15,200
and this is going to be now an even smaller artery.

17
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,109
Let's call it small artery.

18
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:19,235
Small artery.

19
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:21,956
From there,

20
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:25,836
we're actually going to get into what we call arterioles.

21
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,803
So it's going to get even tinier, right? It's going to branch.

22
00:01:28,803 --> 00:01:34,703
Now, these are very, very tiny branches coming off of my small artery, and let's follow this one right here,

23
00:01:34,703 --> 00:01:37,036
and this one is my arteriole.

24
00:01:37,036 --> 00:01:38,470
Arteriole.

25
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:42,290
So, these are all the different branches I have to go through,

26
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:46,475
and finally, I'm going to get into tiny little branches,

27
00:01:46,475 --> 00:01:51,136
I'm going to have to draw them very, very skinny just to convince you that we're getting smaller and smaller.

28
00:01:51,136 --> 00:01:53,285
Let me draw three of them.

29
00:01:53,285 --> 00:01:56,970
Nah, let's draw four, just for fun. Ah, four of them,

30
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:05,636
and this is actually gonna now get towards my little toe cells, so let me draw some toe cells in here to convince you that I actually have gotten there.

31
00:02:05,636 --> 00:02:10,969
Let's say one, two over here, and maybe one over here, and these are my toe cells.

32
00:02:10,969 --> 00:02:12,451
Toe cells.

33
00:02:12,451 --> 00:02:16,617
And after the toe cells have kind of taken out whatever they need.

34
00:02:16,617 --> 00:02:19,803
Maybe they need glucose, or maybe they need some oxygen.

35
00:02:19,803 --> 00:02:21,070
Whatever they have taken out,

36
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:24,470
they are also gonna put in their wastes,

37
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,619
so they have, of course, some carbon dioxide waste that we need to drag back.

38
00:02:28,619 --> 00:02:33,536
This is now going to dump into what we call a venule.

39
00:02:33,536 --> 00:02:34,781
A venule,

40
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:38,970
and this venule is gonna basically then feed into many, many other venules.

41
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,446
Maybe there's a venule down here coming in, and maybe a venule up here coming in.

42
00:02:43,446 --> 00:02:45,100
Maybe from the second toe,

43
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,869
and it's gonna basically all kind of gather together,

44
00:02:47,869 --> 00:02:50,797
and again, to a giant, giant set of veins.

45
00:02:50,797 --> 00:02:54,469
You know, maybe veins are dumping in here now, maybe another vein dumping in here,

46
00:02:54,469 --> 00:03:02,031
and these veins are all going to dump into an enormous vein that we call the inferior vena cava.

47
00:03:02,031 --> 00:03:03,036
I'll write that right here.

48
00:03:03,036 --> 00:03:05,776
Inferior vena cava,

49
00:03:05,776 --> 00:03:12,308
and this is the large vein that brings back all the blood from the bottom half of the body.

50
00:03:12,308 --> 00:03:16,036
There's also another one over here called the superior vena cava,

51
00:03:16,036 --> 00:03:19,868
and this is bringing back blood from the arms and head.

52
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:26,868
So these two veins, the superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava, are dragging the blood back to the heart,

53
00:03:26,868 --> 00:03:30,636
and, generally speaking, these are all considered, of course, veins.

54
00:03:30,636 --> 00:03:34,005
Let's back up now and start with the large and medium arteries.

55
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:39,137
These guys together are sometimes referred to as elastic arteries.

56
00:03:39,137 --> 00:03:40,797
Elastic arteries,

57
00:03:40,797 --> 00:03:42,804
and the reason they're called elastic arteries,

58
00:03:42,804 --> 00:03:50,470
one of the, one of the good reasons why they're called that is that they have a protein in the walls of the blood vessel called elastin.

59
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,119
They have a lot of this elastin protein,

60
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:56,737
and, if you think about the word elastin or elastic,

61
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,947
you know, obviously similar words,

62
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,369
you might think of something like a rubber band or a balloon,

63
00:04:02,369 --> 00:04:04,469
and that's probably the easiest way to think about it.

64
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:08,470
If you have a blood vessel, one of these large arteries for example,

65
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:16,837
and let's say blood is under a lot of pressure, right, because the heart is squeezing out a lot of high pressure blood.

66
00:04:16,837 --> 00:04:21,669
This artery is literally going to balloon out, and if you actually looked at it from the outside,

67
00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:24,069
it would look like a little sausage.

68
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:26,941
Something like this, where it's puffed out.

69
00:04:26,941 --> 00:04:33,529
So what's happened there between the first and second picture is that the pressure energy,

70
00:04:33,529 --> 00:04:38,869
so the heart is squeezing out a lot of pressurized blood, and of course, there's energy in that blood, right?

71
00:04:38,869 --> 00:04:44,469
That pressure energy has been converted over into elastic energy.

72
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:49,511
It's actually converting energy. We don't really always think about it that way, but that's exactly what's happening,

73
00:04:49,511 --> 00:04:52,694
and when you convert from pressure energy to elastic energy,

74
00:04:52,694 --> 00:04:57,203
what you are really then doing is you're balancing out those high pressures.

75
00:04:57,532 --> 00:05:00,887
So you're balancing out high pressures.

76
00:05:00,964 --> 00:05:02,411
High pressures,

77
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:10,661
and this is actually very important because the blood that's coming into our arteries is under, let's not forget, high pressure.

78
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:14,631
So the arteriole system, we know, is a high pressure system.

79
00:05:14,631 --> 00:05:20,734
So this makes perfect sense that the first few arteries, those large arteries and even those medium-sized arteries

80
00:05:20,734 --> 00:05:23,662
are going to be able to deal with the pressure really well.

81
00:05:23,662 --> 00:05:26,327
Now let me draw a little line here just to keep it straight.

82
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:33,994
The small artery and the arteriole, these two, these are actually sometimes called the muscular arteries.

83
00:05:33,994 --> 00:05:35,428
Muscular arteries,

84
00:05:35,428 --> 00:05:41,994
and the reason, again, if you just want to look at the wall of the artery, you'll get the answer.

85
00:05:41,994 --> 00:05:45,496
The wall of the artery is actually very muscular.

86
00:05:45,496 --> 00:05:47,806
In fact, specifically, it's smooth muscle.

87
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:54,196
So not that kind of muscle you have in your heart or in your bicep, but this is smooth muscle

88
00:05:54,196 --> 00:05:57,357
that's in the wall of the artery, and there's lots of it.

89
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:03,626
So again, if you have a little blood vessel like this, if you imagine tons and tons of smooth muscle on the outside,

90
00:06:03,626 --> 00:06:05,028
so let's draw it like this.

91
00:06:05,028 --> 00:06:07,161
Little bands of smooth muscle.

92
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:11,290
If those bands decide that they want to contract down, if they want to squeeze down,

93
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:16,626
you're going to get something that looks like a little straw because those muscles are now tight.

94
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,623
They are tightly wound, right?

95
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:23,657
So you're going to create like a little straw, and this process is called vasoconstriction.

96
00:06:23,657 --> 00:06:29,395
Vaso- just means blood vessel, and constriction is, kinda, tightening down.

97
00:06:29,395 --> 00:06:36,559
So vasoconstriction, tightening down of the blood vessel, and what that does is it increases resistance, right?

98
00:06:36,559 --> 00:06:41,470
Just like if you're trying to blow through a tiny, tiny little straw, there's a lot of resistance.

99
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:51,393
Well, it's the same idea here, and actually a lot of that resistance and change in the constriction, or vasoconstriction, is happening at the arteriole level.

100
00:06:51,393 --> 00:06:53,972
So that's why they're very special, and I want you to remember them.

101
00:06:53,972 --> 00:06:56,662
From there, blood is going to go through the capillaries.

102
00:06:56,662 --> 00:06:59,061
I didn't actually label them the first time, but let me just write that here.

103
00:06:59,061 --> 00:07:01,090
Sometimes, they call them capillary beds.

104
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,153
I'll write that out,

105
00:07:03,153 --> 00:07:07,834
and then it's going to go and get collected in the venules and eventually into the veins,

106
00:07:07,834 --> 00:07:10,027
and the important thing about the veins,

107
00:07:10,027 --> 00:07:14,765
I'm going to stop right here and just talk about it very briefly, is that they have these little valves,

108
00:07:14,765 --> 00:07:18,761
and these valves make sure that the blood continues to flow in one direction.

109
00:07:18,761 --> 00:07:22,475
So one important thing here is the valves,

110
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:26,725
and remember the other important thing is that they are able to deal with large volumes.

111
00:07:26,725 --> 00:07:30,994
So unlike the arteriole side, where it's all about large pressure,

112
00:07:30,994 --> 00:07:34,826
down here with the vein side, we have to think about large volumes.

113
00:07:34,826 --> 00:07:38,826
Remember, about two-thirds of your blood at any point in time is sitting in some vein or venule somewhere.
