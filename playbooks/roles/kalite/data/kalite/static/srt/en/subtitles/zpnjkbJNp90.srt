1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,990
   

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:07,670
We're on problem 154.

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,550
An empty pool being filled with
water at a constant rate

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:15,026
takes 8 hours to fill to
3/5 of its capacity.

5
00:00:15,026 --> 00:00:22,380
So you could say you can fill
3/5 of a pool every 8 hours,

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,000
which is just another way of
saying that you can fill,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,610
let's see, 3/5 divided by 8 is
3 over-- what's 5 times 8?

8
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,792
3/40 pools per hour.

9
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,990
I have a feeling that they're
just going to ask us something

10
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,140
along just the rate
of the fill.

11
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,160
So then they say, how much
more time will it take to

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,690
finish filling the pool?

13
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,200
Oh, well, this actually is
a little bit easier.

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:53,170
So if it takes 8 hours to fill
the pool to 3/5 of capacity,

15
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,860
how many hours will it take to
finish filling the pool?

16
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,360
So how many hours will it take
to fill it essentially what?

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,170
What's left?

18
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,475
2/5, right?

19
00:01:02,475 --> 00:01:03,900
To fill it 2/5 more.

20
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,690
   

21
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:12,130
So this is going to be the same
thing as 8/3 is equal to

22
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,870
x/2, And you could do that by
dividing both sides of this

23
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,270
equation by 5, right?

24
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,400
And you get a 5 in the
denominator in both places,

25
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,100
which cancels out.

26
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:28,440
And this is easy, 8/3 as x/2 so
you have 16 is equal to 3x.

27
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:34,380
And then you get x is equal
to 5 1/3 hours.

28
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,510
That's 5 hours and 20 minutes,
because a third of an hour is

29
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,680
20 minutes.

30
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,350
And that is choice B.

31
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,240
   

32
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,220
Problem 155.

33
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:54,220
A positive number x is
multiplied by 2 and this

34
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,980
product is then divided by 3.

35
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,470
And they told us
x was positive.

36
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,460
If the positive square root
of the result of these two

37
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:12,380
operations equals x, what
is the value of x?

38
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,180
Let's solve this.

39
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,520
Let's square both sides of this,
so we get 2x/3 is equal

40
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,060
to x squared.

41
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:25,170
And then multiply both sides by
3, you get 2x is equal to

42
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,550
3x squared.

43
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,950
And they tell us that
x is positive.

44
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,750
   

45
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,920
Well, first of all, that tells
us that x does not equal 0.

46
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,760
They tell us that x
is greater than 0.

47
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,290
So let's see, let's divide
both sides of

48
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,770
this equation by x.

49
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,410
Well, there's a couple of ways
we could think about it.

50
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,200
Maybe the easiest way-- yeah,
let's just divide both sides

51
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,960
of this equation by x, and we
can do that because we know

52
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,430
that x cannot equal 0 and you
get 2 is equal to 3x.

53
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:59,480
And then divide both sides by 3,
you get x is equal to 2/3,

54
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,820
and that's choice D.

55
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,160
I was thinking about saying,
oh, well, let's subtract 2x

56
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,840
from both sides.

57
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,310
You get 3x squared minus
2x is equal to 0.

58
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:12,540
You could factor out an x, and
then you get 3x minus 2 times

59
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,140
x is equal to 0.

60
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,050
And that would tell you that
either 3x minus 2 is equal to

61
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,070
0, which would give you that
answer, or x is equal to 0.

62
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,260
but?

63
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,630
X can't equal 0, because they
told us that x is positive.

64
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,930
But anyway, it gets you
the same answer, 2/3.

65
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,960
Next question.

66
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,030
Problem 156.

67
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:42,760
A tank contains 10,000 gallons
of a solution that is 5%

68
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,400
sodium chloride by volume.

69
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,200
   

70
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,960
What is that?

71
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,530
NaCl?

72
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,770
This isn't chemistry.

73
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:56,940
Let's see, 2,500 gallons of
water evaporate from the tank.

74
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,410
   

75
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,770
The remaining solution will be
approximately what percent

76
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,010
sodium chloride?

77
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,345
So they're essentially saying,
well, if water evaporates, the

78
00:04:08,345 --> 00:04:11,650
salt in the solution doesn't
go away, right?

79
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,800
The salt doesn't evaporate
with the water.

80
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:22,110
So if we're 5% sodium chloride,
what's 5% of 10,000?

81
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:33,580
5% of 100 is 5, 5% of 1,000 is
50, 5% of 10,000 is 500.

82
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,560
I guess you could
say there's 500

83
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,810
gallons of sodium chloride.

84
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:42,950
   

85
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:47,290
If we lose 2,500 gallons of the
water, now the percentage

86
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:50,435
of sodium chloride is still
500, but it's going

87
00:04:50,435 --> 00:04:52,180
to be 500 over what?

88
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,970
We don't have 10,00 gallons
of water anymore.

89
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:57,000
We have 10,000 gallons of water
minus 2,500 gallons of

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,270
water, so we have 7,500
gallons of water.

91
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:08,120
Let's see, that's equal to 5/75,
which is equal to 1/15,

92
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,380
and what is that as
a percentage?

93
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,630
   

94
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,550
15 goes into 100 6 times?

95
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,060
It's not 7.

96
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,440
Yeah, 6 times.

97
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,380
6 times 5 is 30.

98
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,620
6 times 1 is 6 plus 90.

99
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,500
And then I have a
10, so it keeps

100
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,410
going on, 0.0666 repeating.

101
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:33,060
So it's 6 and 2/3 percentages,
or 6 point-- well, let's see,

102
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,660
they have choice-- yeah,
choice D looks right.

103
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,490
6.67% if you round this.

104
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,930
It just keeps repeating
with 6.

105
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,035
So that is choice D.

106
00:05:41,035 --> 00:05:44,690
   

107
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,360
Problem 157.

108
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:59,160
If x plus 5y is equal to 16 and
x is equal to minus 3y,

109
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,340
then what does y equal?

110
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,830
So let's just substitute
this over here.

111
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:08,950
So we get minus 3y plus
5y is equal to 16.

112
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,980
Add those together, you get
2y is equal to 16, or

113
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,470
y is equal to 8.

114
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:18,610
And that is choice E.

115
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:23,720
Problem 158.

116
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,580
A committee is composed of w
women and m men, so w and m.

117
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,510
If 3 women and 2 men are added
to the committee and if one

118
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,450
person is selected at random
from the enlarged committee,

119
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,790
then the probability that a
woman is selected can be

120
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,960
represented as?

121
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,910
OK, the probability of a woman
being selected is essentially

122
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:48,000
the fraction of the population
that are women.

123
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,840
So how many women are there?

124
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,900
There's going to be
w plus 3 women.

125
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,400
And what's the total
population?

126
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,320
There's w plus 3 women, and
then there's m plus 2 men.

127
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,250
   

128
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,720
So this is the probability we
select a woman, and then we

129
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,930
can just simplify this a bit.

130
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:15,750
That equals w plus 3 over
w plus m plus 5.

131
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,710
And that is choice E.

132
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:27,020
Problem 159.

133
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:37,360
If the product of the integers
w, x, y, and z is 70.

134
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:44,630
So let me just write that, w,
x, y, z is equal to 770.

135
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:50,550
And if 1 is less than w, which
is less than x, which is less

136
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:59,410
than y, which is less than z,
what is the value of w plus z?

137
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,620
Ok, this is interesting.

138
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,270
So they're telling us that
these are integers.

139
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:09,230
We have four integers, and
they're all greater than 1.

140
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,120
Let's see if we can do a prime
factorization of 770, because

141
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,770
I have a feeling that that is
what it's going to come down

142
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,380
to, if we just look at
the factors of 770.

143
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,940
So let's see, that's
equal to 7.

144
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:27,050
7 times 11 is 77.

145
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,320
7 times 11 times 10, right?

146
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,710
7 times 11 times 10 is 770.

147
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:33,179
110.

148
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:38,184
And then 10 is-- so that's equal
to 7 times 11 times--

149
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,010
let's see, what's 10?

150
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:45,450
10 we can rewrite
it as 2 times 5.

151
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,540
So that's its prime
factorization.

152
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,300
And lo and behold, we have
exactly four numbers, and

153
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:50,920
let's put them in order.

154
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,430
So that equals 2 times
5 times 7 times 11.

155
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:00,980
And so this is what w, x, y,
and z have to be because

156
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,810
they're different numbers.

157
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,520
They're all greater than 1,
and they're all integers.

158
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:09,330
So let's see, they want to know
w plus z, so w plus z is

159
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,340
2 plus 11 is 13, and
that's choice B.

160
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,610
   

161
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,680
And looks like we have time
even for another one.

162
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,910
Let's do this one.

163
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:25,690
The figure above shows
a circular flowerbed.

164
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,160
Let me see if I can draw it.

165
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,430
So that's the outside and then
they drew the inside.

166
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:42,324
So if I do it like-- oh,
I didn't do a good job.

167
00:09:42,324 --> 00:09:44,230
Let me see if I can
draw the inside,

168
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,770
maybe if I put it there.

169
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:50,960
   

170
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,270
It's not showing up
the way I want to.

171
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,700
Let me move it around
a little bit.

172
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,400
Let me just erase it and try
to draw it one more time.

173
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,180
   

174
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,350
Well, I think you
get the idea.

175
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:10,620
And they tell us that the
distance from the center to

176
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,315
here is 8 feet.

177
00:10:13,315 --> 00:10:16,070
The figure above shows a
circular flowerbed with it's

178
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,230
center at 0 and surrounded
by a circular path

179
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,590
that is 5 feet wide.

180
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,662
So this is 5.

181
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,030
That is 3 feet wide.

182
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:22,840
I'm having trouble reading.

183
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,920
3 feet wide.

184
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,700
What is the area of the
path in square feet?

185
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,570
So it's essentially the area of
this outside circle minus

186
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,260
the area of this
inside circle.

187
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,800
That would be the area
of this path.

188
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,700
So what's the area of
the outside circle?

189
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,310
Well, the area of the outside
circle, you go 8 to get to

190
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,470
this edge, then you
have 3 more.

191
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:49,130
So its radius is 8 plus 3 is 11,
so the area of the outside

192
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,750
is equal to pi times
11 squared.

193
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,145
And what's the area
of the inside?

194
00:10:53,145 --> 00:10:56,910
The area of the inside is equal
to pi times the inside

195
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:00,080
radius times 64 squared.

196
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,400
So the area of our path is
going to be area of the

197
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,590
outside minus the area of
the inside, which is

198
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,500
equal to 121 pi.

199
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,710
That's 11 squared times pi
minus-- oh, sorry, it's 8

200
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,620
squared, which is 64.

201
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,810
I should have written
8 squared there, so

202
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,420
that's minus 64 pi.

203
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,350
And that is equal to--
what's 121 minus 64?

204
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:31,990
121 minus 64 is-- let's see,
we have 21 plus 36, that's

205
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:38,040
equal to 57 pi, and
that is choice D.

206
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,880
See you in the next video.

207
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,400
