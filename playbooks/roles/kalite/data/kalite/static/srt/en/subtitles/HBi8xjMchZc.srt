1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
   

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,070
In the video on solubility, I
draw little pictures of sodium

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,910
and chloride ions when sodium
chloride dissolves or

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,500
disassociates into water.

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,860
This is sodium and
this is chloride.

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,950
And my simple brain, when I
looked at it, I said, OK, how

7
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,110
should I draw these things?

8
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,270
I said, well, they're in the
same period, and sodium is a

9
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,190
Group 1 element.

10
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:27,890
It's an alkali metal, while
chlorine is a halogen, so

11
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,690
chlorine's going to have a
smaller atomic radius.

12
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,220
And the logic there, just to
review from the atomic table

13
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,070
trends, is that both of their
valence electrons are in the

14
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,050
third shell.

15
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,140
Sodium only has 11 protons
pulling in the center.

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,280
It has 11 in the center, and it
has only one electron out

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,955
there in its valence shell.

18
00:00:44,955 --> 00:00:47,590
So the attraction isn't as
strong as the case of

19
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:53,060
chlorine, which has 17 protons
in the center.

20
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:59,090
Although it has more valence
electrons-- it has 7 of them--

21
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,660
these protons are going
to have a stronger

22
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:02,640
attraction on them.

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,700
So if you just look at the trend
in the periodic table,

24
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,920
you'd expect the sodium neutral
atom to be bigger than

25
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,240
the chlorine neutral atom.

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,010
Because this guy has more
protons pulling everything in.

27
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,490
And that's how I drew the
ions in that video.

28
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,420
I said, oh, when I disassociate
in water, I'll

29
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,770
have a big sodium ion and
a smaller chlorine

30
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,080
ion, which is incorrect.

31
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,460
Because think about-- and this
was pointed out to me by one

32
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,660
of the viewers, and they're
correct, and I should have

33
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,630
realized it.

34
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,450
What happens when you
ionize these things?

35
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,800
This guy will lose an
electron, right?

36
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,620
He gives the electron
to this guy.

37
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,530
So his electron configuration
is actually going to look a

38
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,400
lot more like neon.

39
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,600
He now will have no electrons
in that third shell, in the

40
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,160
third energy state.

41
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,810
So now he's going to have an
atomic radius that's actually

42
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,990
much more similar to
neon here, right?

43
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,560
Because he's going to have
filled up the second shelf.

44
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,200
So actually, the sodium ion,
this is completely incorrect.

45
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,330
The sodium ion is going to have
an atomic radius not that

46
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,440
different than neon.

47
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,080
Actually, it will be even a
little smaller than neon

48
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,789
because it has the same electron
configuration, but it

49
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:12,360
has one more proton.

50
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,740
So the sodium ion is actually
going to be smaller.

51
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,930
Because it gets rid of the
electron in that third shell,

52
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:24,600
and the chlorine cation, gained
an electron, so it has

53
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,490
completely completed
its third shell.

54
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,010
So here you have where
the chlorine ion

55
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,710
is going to be bigger.

56
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,220
So in that solubility video, I
should've actually switched

57
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,830
the places between the
sodium and the

58
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,600
chlorine, at least in size-wise.

59
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,880
And, of course, I showed how
they disassociate in water,

60
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,340
and this would be attracted to
the oxygen end of the water,

61
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,580
and you have the hydrogen
end and all that.

62
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,970
But you can watch the solubility
video for that.

63
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,260
It doesn't change the real
takeaway from the video.

64
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,970
But I think this is a really
interesting point that it

65
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,380
brings up, that when you ionize
these neutral atoms, it

66
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,340
can significantly change,
especially significantly

67
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,440
change their relative
atomic sizes.

68
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,930
Anyway, hopefully, you found
that interesting.

69
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:03,404
