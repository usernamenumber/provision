1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,820
   

2
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,570
We learned in the last several
videos, that if I had a linear

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,400
differential equation with
constant coefficients in a

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,570
homogeneous one, that had the
form A times the second

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:18,520
derivative plus B times the
first derivative plus C

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,750
times-- you could say the
function, or the 0

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,910
derivative-- equal to 0.

8
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,240
If that's our differential
equation that the

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:33,380
characteristic equation of that
is Ar squared plus Br

10
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,910
plus C is equal to 0.

11
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,930
And if the roots of this
characteristic equation are

12
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,550
real-- let's say we have
two real roots.

13
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:41,540
Let me write that down.

14
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,710
So the real scenario where the
two solutions are going to be

15
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,450
r1 and r2, where these
are real numbers.

16
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,710
Then the general solution of
this differential equation--

17
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,730
and watch the previous videos if
you don't remember this or

18
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,100
if you don't feel like it's
suitably proven to you-- the

19
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,650
general solution is y is equal
to some constant times e to

20
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:12,570
the first root x plus some other
constant times e to the

21
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,620
second root times x.

22
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,570
And we did that in the
last several videos.

23
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,200
We even did some examples.

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,840
Now my question to you is, what
if the characteristic

25
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,110
equation does not
have real roots,

26
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,980
what if they are complex?

27
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,090
And just a little bit
of review, what

28
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:27,980
do I mean by that?

29
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,380
Well, if I wanted to figure out
the roots of this and if I

30
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,130
was lazy, and I just want to do
it without having to think,

31
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,640
can I factor it, I would just
immediately use the quadratic

32
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,050
equation, because that
always works.

33
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:45,140
I would say, well the roots of
my characteristic equation are

34
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:53,770
negative B plus or minus
the square root of B

35
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,195
squared minus 4AC.

36
00:01:56,195 --> 00:02:00,850
   

37
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:05,820
All of that over 2A.

38
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,090
So what do I mean by
non-real roots?

39
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:11,460
Well, if this expression right
here-- if this B squared minus

40
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,300
4AC-- if that's a negative
number, then I'm going to have

41
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,340
to take the square root
of a negative number.

42
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,140
So it will actually be an
imaginary number, and so this

43
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,450
whole term will actually
become complex.

44
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,930
We'll have a real part and
an imaginary part.

45
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,270
And actually, the two roots are
going to be conjugates of

46
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,070
each other, right?

47
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,260
We could rewrite this in the
real and imaginary parts.

48
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,350
We could rewrite this as the
roots are going to be equal to

49
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:44,490
minus B over 2A, plus or minus
the square root of B squared

50
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:50,360
minus 4AC over 2A.

51
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,410
And if B squared minus 4AC is
less than 0, this is going to

52
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,670
be an imaginary number.

53
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:59,190
So in that case, let's just
think about what the roots

54
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,980
look like generally and then
we'll actually do some

55
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,770
problems. So let me
go back up here.

56
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,810
So then the roots aren't
going to be two real

57
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,610
numbers like that.

58
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,670
The roots, we can write them
as two complex numbers that

59
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,790
are conjugates of each other.

60
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,610
And I think light blue is a
suitable color for that.

61
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,870
So in that situation, let me
write this, the complex

62
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:23,710
roots-- this is a complex roots
scenario-- then the

63
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,385
roots of the characteristic
equation are going to be, I

64
00:03:27,385 --> 00:03:31,710
don't know, some number--
Let's call it lambda.

65
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,250
Let's call it mu, I think that's
the convention that

66
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,300
people use-- actually let me see
what they tend to use, it

67
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:42,460
really doesn't matter--
let's say it's lambda.

68
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,830
So this number, some constant
called lambda, and then plus

69
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:51,830
or minus some imaginary
number.

70
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:55,640
And so it's going to be
some constant mu.

71
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,900
That's just some constant, I'm
not trying to be fancy, but

72
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,150
this is I think the convention
used in most differential

73
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,100
equations books.

74
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,390
So it's mu times i.

75
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,860
So these are the two
roots, and these

76
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,720
are true roots, right?

77
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,440
Because we have lambda plus mu
i, and lambda minus mu i.

78
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,130
So these would be the two roots,
if B squared minus 4AC

79
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,970
is less than 0.

80
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:23,100
So let's see what happens when
we take these two roots and we

81
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,630
put them into our general
solution.

82
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,760
So just like we've learned
before, the general solution

83
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,460
is going to be-- I'll stay in
the light blue-- the general

84
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:39,380
solution is going to be y is
equal to c1 times e to the

85
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,220
first root-- let's make that
the plus version-- so

86
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:49,770
lambda plus mu i.

87
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:58,920
All of that times x, plus c2
times e to the second root.

88
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:06,890
So that's going to be lambda
minus mu i times x.

89
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,220
Let's see if we can do some
simplification here, because

90
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,900
that i there really kind of
makes things kind of crazy.

91
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,600
So let's see if we can do
anything to either get rid of

92
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,460
it or simplify it, et cetera.

93
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:20,080
So let's multiply the x out.

94
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,940
Just doing some algebraic
manipulation.

95
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,780
I'm trying to use as much
space as possible.

96
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:30,730
So we get y is equal to
c1 e to the what?

97
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:41,450
Lambda x-- just distributing
that x-- plus mu xi, plus c2

98
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:50,230
times e to the lambda
x minus mu xi.

99
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,960
Just distributed the x's
in both of the terms.

100
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,770
And let's see what we can do.

101
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:00,550
Well, when you add exponents,
this is the exact same thing

102
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:12,020
as y is equal to c1 e to
the lambda x, times e

103
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:16,490
to the mu xi, right?

104
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,300
If you have the same base and
you're multiplying, you could

105
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,750
just add exponents, so this
is the same thing as that.

106
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:33,173
Plus c2 times e to the lambda x,
times e to the minus mu xi.

107
00:06:33,173 --> 00:06:36,390
Now let's see, we have an e to
the lambda x in both of these

108
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,150
terms, so we can
factor it out.

109
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:43,380
So we get y is equal to-- let
me draw a line here, I don't

110
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,280
want you to get confused with
all this quadratic equation

111
00:06:45,280 --> 00:07:00,610
stuff-- y is equal to e to the
lambda x times c1 e to the mu

112
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:11,430
xi-- that's an i-- plus c2 times
e to the minus mu xi.

113
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,540
Now what we can we do?

114
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,240
And this is where it gets fun.

115
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,090
If you watched the calculus
playlist, especially when I

116
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:22,160
talk about approximating
functions with series, we came

117
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,260
up with what I thought was the
most amazing result in

118
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,070
calculus, just from a-- or in
mathematics-- just from a

119
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,040
metaphysical point of view.

120
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,180
And now we will actually use it
for something that you'll

121
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,680
hopefully see is
vaguely useful.

122
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,490
So here we have two terms that
have something times e to the

123
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,960
something times i.

124
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,410
And we learned before,
Euler's formula.

125
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,340
And what was Euler's formula?

126
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,160
I'll write that in purple.

127
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:58,110
That e to the i theta, or we
could write e to the ix, is

128
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:06,070
equal to cosine of x
plus i sine of x.

129
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,610
And what's amazing about that
is, if you put negative 1 in

130
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:15,120
here, then you get e to the-- oh
no, actually if you put pi

131
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,210
in here-- so e to the i pi is
equal to negative 1, right?

132
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,070
If you substituted this because
sine of pi is 0.

133
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:25,700
So I thought that was amazing,
where you could write e to the

134
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,000
i 2 pi is equal to 1.

135
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,660
That's pretty amazing as well.

136
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,750
And in one equation you have all
of the fundamental numbers

137
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,700
of mathematics.

138
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,059
That's amazing, but let's
get back down to

139
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,080
earth and get practical.

140
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,010
So let's see if we can use this
to simplify Euler's--

141
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:46,570
This is actually a definition,
and the definition makes a lot

142
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,680
of sense, because when you
do the power series

143
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,410
approximation, or the
Maclaurin series

144
00:08:51,410 --> 00:09:01,150
approximation, of e to the x, it
really looks like cosine of

145
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:05,970
x plus i times the power series
approximation of x.

146
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,470
But anyway, we won't
go into that now.

147
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,360
I have like six or seven
videos on it.

148
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,110
But let's use this to simplify
this up here.

149
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:22,640
So we can rewrite that as y is
equal to e to the lambda x

150
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,990
times-- let's do the
first one-- c1.

151
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:31,285
It's e to the mu xi,
so instead of an x

152
00:09:31,285 --> 00:09:32,130
we have a mu x.

153
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:37,890
That will be equal to cosine of
whatever is in front of the

154
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:48,760
i, so cosine of mu x plus
i sine of mu x.

155
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:55,710
And then plus c2 times what?

156
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:12,355
Times cosine of minus mu x plus
i sine of minus mu x.

157
00:10:12,355 --> 00:10:15,380
And let's see if we can
simplify this further.

158
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:19,140
So one thing that you might--
So let's distribute the c's.

159
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,860
So now we get-- I'll do it in
a different color-- actually

160
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,430
I'm running out of time,
so I'll continue

161
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,200
this in the next video.

162
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,760
See you soon.

163
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:26,900
