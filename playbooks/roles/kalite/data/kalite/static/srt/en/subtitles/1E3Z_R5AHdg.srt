00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,610
What I want to do in this video is think about

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,900
the two different ways of interpreting lowercase g

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:14,380
as we talked about before. Many textbooks would give you either 9.81 m/s^2

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,070
downward or towards the Earth's center

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,950
or sometimes give you a negative quantity that signifies the direction

6
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:25,260
essentially downward, -9.81 m/s^2

7
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,100
And probably the most typical way to interpret this value

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:44,680
as the acceleration due to gravity near Earth's surface

9
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,510
for an object in freefall--this is what we're gonna focus on in this video

10
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:56,120
For an object freefall

11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,350
and the reason why I am stressing this last part

12
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:05,240
is because we know many objects that are near the surface of the Earth

13
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,000
that are not in freefall

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,170
For example, I'm near the surface of the Earth right now and I am not in freefall

15
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,610
What's happening to me right now is I'm sitting in the chair

16
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,490
And so this is my chair

17
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,500
and this is me

18
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,240
Let's say the chair is supporting all my weight

19
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,810
My legs are flying in the air

20
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,000
So this is me and so what's happening right now?

21
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,270
If I were in freefall, I would be accelerating towards the center of the Earth

22
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,500
at 9.81 m/s squared

23
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:46,780
But what's happening is is all the force due to gravity

24
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:54,200
is being completely offset by the normal force from the surface of the chair onto my pants

25
00:01:54,790 --> 00:02:01,890
And so this is normal force. I'll make them both as vectors

26
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:10,430
So the net force in my situation is equal to zero, especially in this vertical direction

27
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,260
Because the net force is equal to zero

28
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:18,140
I am not accelerating towards the center of the Earth. I am not in freefall

29
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:24,480
And because this 9.81 m/s^2 still seems relevant to my situation

30
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,400
I'll talk about that in a second, but I'm not an object in freefall

31
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,850
Another way to interpret this

32
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,290
it's not as the acceleration due to gravity near Earth's surface

33
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,740
for an object in freefall. Although it is that

34
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,750
A maybe more general way to interpret this, is the Earth's gravitational field--

35
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,510
or it's really the average acceleration

36
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,780
because it actually changes slightly throughout the surface of the Earth

37
00:02:49,800 --> 00:03:02,290
But another way to view this as the average gravitational field at Earth's surface

38
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:06,630
I'll talk about what a field means in the physics context in a second

39
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:14,380
Field. The average gravitational field at Earth's surface

40
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,880
This is a little bit more of a abstract thing. We'll talk about that in a second

41
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:24,080
But it does help us think about how g is related this scenario where I'm not an object in freefall

42
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,660
A field when you think of it in the physics context--

43
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,140
slightly more abstract a notion in the mathematics context

44
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,940
But in the physics context

45
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:38,270
a field is something that associates a quantity with every point in space

46
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:47,950
So this is just a quantity is with every point in space

47
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,830
And it can actually be a scalar quantity, in which case we call this a scalar field

48
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,640
There's just value

49
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,530
Or it could be a vector quantity with the magnitude and the direction

50
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,570
associated with every point in space

51
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,000
in which case we're dealing with a vector field

52
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:08,400
And the reason why this is called a field is because it's near Earth's surface

53
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:14,180
if you give me a mass--so for example, maybe my mass is in kilograms

54
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:21,020
If you're near Earth's surface, you give me a mass. Let's say that mass is 10 kg

55
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:27,950
You can use g to figure out the actual force on that--of gravity on that object

56
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,630
at that point in space

57
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:35,270
So for example, if this has a mass of 10 kg

58
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,640
This is the surface of the Earth

59
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,170
That's the center of the Earth

60
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:44,520
So it actually associates a vector quantity whose direction is towards the center of the Earth

61
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:51,710
and the magnitude of this vector quantity is going to be the mass times g

62
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:58,540
This already specified the direction. You can say 9.81 m/s^2 towards the center of the Earth

63
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:07,770
And so in the situation it would be 10 kg times 9.81 m/s^2

64
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:19,110
which is approximately 98.1 kg m / s^2

65
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:24,490
which is the unit of force, or 98.1 N

66
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,080
And this thing might not be in freefall. So this is why it becomes

67
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:32,910
why g is relevant even in a situation where the object isn't in freefall

68
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:43,980
g has given us the force per unit mass of gravity on an object near the surface of the Earth

69
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:49,830
So let me think about it. So this is the average gravitational field

70
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:55,010
What it's giving is force per mass

71
00:05:55,010 --> 00:06:00,100
So if you give me a mass near Earth's surface, whether it's an object in freefall or not

72
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:04,970
you multiply that mass times g because it's giving you force per mass

73
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:10,040
And it would give you the force of gravity acting on that object

74
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,690
near the surface of the Earth whether or not it's in freefall

75
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,870
So I just want to make this little distinction

76
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,950
because although g tends to be referred to this way right over here

77
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:22,200
sometime you might encounter this and say, no no no no no

78
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,390
but g is relevant even when it's not in freefall

79
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:30,960
You obviously can't say that my acceleration when I'm sitting in my chair is 9.81 m/s^2

80
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,860
towards the center of the Earth. I'm not accelerating towards the center of the Earth

81
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:38,690
And so they'll say, no no no no. You can't just call this acceleration

82
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:43,810
It is the acceleration when an object is in freefall near the surface of the Earth

83
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:49,470
If you don't have air resistance, if the net force is the force of gravity

84
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,780
then this really would be the object's acceleration

85
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:56,320
But it becomes relevant--we know a lot of objects are not in freefall

86
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,840
And the object in freefall doesn't stay in freefall for long because it'll hit something

87
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,710
But we know that now g is actually relevant to all objects

88
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:06,690
It tells us the force per mass

89
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:11,010
It's tempting to call it always acceleration because of the units of an acceleration

90
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,820
But even when you talk about in terms of the gravitational field, it's still the same quantity

91
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,930
It still has the exact same unit, the same magnitude

92
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,990
and the same direction. It's just a different way of viewing it

93
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,520
Here acceleration for an object in freefall

94
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,240
Here, something to multiply by mass to figure out the force due to gravity
