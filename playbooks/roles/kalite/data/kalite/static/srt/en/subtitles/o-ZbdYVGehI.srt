1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,610
   

2
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:05,300
We need to factor 25x to
the fourth minus 30x

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,280
squared plus 9.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,390
And this looks really daunting
because we have something to

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,600
the fourth power here.

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,690
And then the middle term
is to the second power.

7
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,730
But there's something
about this that

8
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,070
might pop out at you.

9
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,960
And the thing that pops out at
me at least is that 25 is a

10
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,040
perfect square, x to the fourth
is a perfect square, so

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,980
25x to the fourth is
a perfect square.

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,560
And 9 is also perfect square, so
maybe this is the square of

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,230
some binomial.

14
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,560
And to confirm it, this center
term has to be two times the

15
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,740
product of the terms that you're
squaring on either end.

16
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,920
Let me explain that a
little bit better

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:48,450
So, 25x to the fourth, that is
the same thing as 5x squared

18
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,490
squared, right?

19
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,890
So it's a perfect square.

20
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:56,560
9 is the exact same thing as,
well, it could be plus or

21
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,770
minus 3 squared.

22
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,250
It could be either one.

23
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,120
Now, what is 30x squared?

24
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,770
What happens if we take 5
times plus or minus 3?

25
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,660
So remember, this needs to be
two times the product of

26
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,510
what's inside the square, or
the square root of this and

27
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,340
the square root of that.

28
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,420
Given that there's a negative
sign here and 5 is positive,

29
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,330
we want to take the
negative 3, right?

30
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,770
That's the only way we're going
to get a negative over

31
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,750
there, so let's just try
it with negative 3.

32
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:35,260
So what is what is 2 times 5x
squared times negative 3?

33
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,920
What is this?

34
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,770
Well, 2 times 5x squared is 10x
squared times negative 3.

35
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:47,030
It is equal to negative
30x squared.

36
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,570
We know that this is
a perfect square.

37
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:57,210
So we can just rewrite this as
this is equal to 5x squared--

38
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,100
let me do it in the
same color.

39
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:09,290
5x squared minus 3 times
5x squared minus 3.

40
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:13,590
   

41
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,500
And we saw in the last
video why this works.

42
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,210
And if you want to verify
it for yourself,

43
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,550
multiply this out.

44
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:24,020
You will get 25x to the fourth
minus 30x squared plus 9.

45
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:24,466
