1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
Well the whole premise of the
last series of videos was

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,610
really just trying to get at
trying to figure out whether

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,080
some transformation T-- let's
have some transformation that

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:17,040
is a mapping from, let's say
it's a mapping from Rn to Rm,

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,100
--the whole question is,
is T invertible.

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:26,790
   

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:29,110
And we showed several videos
ago that a function, and a

9
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,900
transformation is really just a
function, that a function is

10
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,400
invertible if it meets
two conditions.

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,740
So invertible.

12
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,840
So I don't have to keep writing
the word over again.

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,010
You have to have
two conditions.

14
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,980
It has to be onto or essentially
it has to map to

15
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,210
every member of your codomain
and it also has to be

16
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,540
one-to-one.

17
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,060
Another way of saying one-to-one
is that every

18
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,960
member of your codomain is
mapped to by at most one

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,700
member of your domain.

20
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,060
And we did several videos where
we thought well if we

21
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,599
had a transformation, a linear
transformation, that's defined

22
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:11,140
by a matrix, A, where this would
be an m-by-n matrix, we

23
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:19,150
said that this is going to be
met if the rank-- This is only

24
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:24,740
met if the rank of A is equal to
the number of rows in your

25
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,710
transformation matrix
is equal to m.

26
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:31,100
And in the last video I just
showed that this is only true

27
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,360
if every one of your column
vectors are linearly

28
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,200
independent or that they all
are basis vectors for your

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,720
column space or that the rank
of your matrix it has to be

30
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,320
equal to n.

31
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,600
Now in order for something to
be invertible, in order for

32
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,290
the transformation to be
invertible, both of these

33
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,350
things have to be true.

34
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,440
Your rank of A has to be equal
to m and your rank of A has to

35
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,490
be equal to n.

36
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,050
So in order to be invertible,
a couple of

37
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,890
things have to happen.

38
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:04,340
In order to be invertible your
rank of your transformation

39
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,660
matrix has to be equal to m,
which has to be equal to n.

40
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,340
So m has to be equal to n.

41
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,610
So we have an interesting
condition.

42
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,145
You have to have a
square matrix.

43
00:02:13,145 --> 00:02:17,180
   

44
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,790
Your matrix has to be n-by-n.

45
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,030
That's what this implies.

46
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,930
If both of these are true, then
m has to be equal n and

47
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,480
you're dealing with
a square matrix.

48
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,650
Even more, you're dealing with
the square matrix where every

49
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,760
one of the columns are
linearly independent,

50
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,660
so this is our A.

51
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,750
A looks like this.

52
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:41,200
A1, A2, all the way to An.

53
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,140
Since the rank of A is equal to
n, and this is of course an

54
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,280
n-by-n matrix.

55
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,240
We just said that this has to
be the case because its rank

56
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,470
has to be equal to m, which is
the number of rows, and its

57
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,870
rank has to be equal to n,
which is the number of

58
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,780
columns, so the rows and columns
have to be the same.

59
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,010
But the fact that your rank
is equal to the number of

60
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,250
columns, that means that all
of your column vectors are

61
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,300
bases for your column space, or
that if you put them into

62
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:14,500
reduced row echelon form, what
are you going to get?

63
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,130
Well all of these guys are basis
vectors so they're all

64
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,780
going to be associated with
pivot vectors or they're all

65
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,500
going to be associated
with pivot columns.

66
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,570
So this is going to be 1, 0,
bunch of 0's, and then you're

67
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:29,180
going to have a 0, 1, a bunch
of 0's like this.

68
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:40,690
They're all going to be
associated with pivot columns

69
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,610
when you go into reduced
row echelon form.

70
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,090
So all of them are
pivot columns.

71
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,890
It's an n-by-n matrix.

72
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,470
So what is an n-by-n
matrix where every

73
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,570
column is a pivot column?

74
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,120
What is an n-by-n matrix?

75
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,870
Let me write this.

76
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,970
So you have an n.

77
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:02,710
So the reduced row echelon form
of A has to be equal to

78
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:15,350
an n-by-n matrix, cause A is
n-by-n, where every column is

79
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,510
a linearly independent
pivot column.

80
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,870
And I mean by definition of
reduced row echelon form you

81
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,570
can't have the same pivot
column twice where every

82
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:28,460
column is a linearly independent
pivot column.

83
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,450
It's a little bit redundant, but
I think you get the idea.

84
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,550
So what is an n-by-n matrix
where every column is a

85
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,560
linearly independent
pivot column?

86
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:42,960
Well that is just a matrix that
has 1's down the diagonal

87
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,215
and everything else is a 0.

88
00:04:44,215 --> 00:04:46,890
   

89
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:50,940
Or, you've seen this matrix
before, this is just an n-by-n

90
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:56,410
identity matrix or the identity
matrix on n or on Rn.

91
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,965
So if you multiply this matrix
times any member of Rn, you're

92
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,350
just going to get that
matrix again.

93
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,740
But this is interesting.

94
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,440
We now have a pretty usable
condition for invertibility.

95
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:12,360
We can say that the
transformation T that is a

96
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,800
mapping from Rn to-- well it
has to map to the same

97
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,300
dimension space so
from Rn to Rn.

98
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:27,720
It's equal to some square matrix
n-by-n, it has to be an

99
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,030
n-by-n matrix, times our
vectors in our domain.

100
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:41,690
And it's only going to be
invertible if the reduced row

101
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:47,550
echelon form of our
transformation matrix is equal

102
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:50,620
to the identity matrix on n.

103
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,590
I mean I could have written an
m here and I could've said

104
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:58,160
this is an m-by-n matrix, but
the only way that this is

105
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,700
going to be true is if
this is also an n and

106
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,670
this is also an m.

107
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,900
But maybe I could leave
them there.

108
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,080
Let me leave those
m's there because

109
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,700
that's the big takeaway.

110
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,990
The big takeaway is that in
order for the transformation

111
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,330
matrix to be invertible, the
only way it's invertible is if

112
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:20,640
the reduced row echelon form of
our transformation matrix

113
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,870
is equal to an n-by-n
identity matrix.

114
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,410
The identity matrix is always
going to be n-by-n.

115
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,510
So that's a big takeaway.

116
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,880
Now we'll use that in the future
to actually solve for

117
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,620
transformations or solve for
inverses of transformations.

118
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,127
