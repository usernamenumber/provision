1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,010
We're asked to graph the function

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:07,848
y = 2sin(-x) on the interval

3
00:00:07,848 --> 00:00:10,349
the closed interval so it includes the endpoints

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,648
-2π to 2π

5
00:00:13,648 --> 00:00:14,681
So to do this

6
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:18,507
I'm going to graph the function y = sin(x)

7
00:00:18,507 --> 00:00:21,402
and then think about how it's changed by the 2

8
00:00:21,402 --> 00:00:24,519
and the negative in front of the x over here

9
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:27,873
So let's look at the sine of x first

10
00:00:27,873 --> 00:00:32,633
So let me draw our x-axis

11
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:36,754
let me draw the y-axis

12
00:00:36,754 --> 00:00:37,894
pretty straight forward

13
00:00:37,894 --> 00:00:38,869
and we care about it

14
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:40,865
between -2π and 2π

15
00:00:40,865 --> 00:00:43,913
so let's say this is -2π

16
00:00:43,913 --> 00:00:48,081
and then this one right over here would be -π

17
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:50,151
this of course is 0

18
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:54,435
then this is positive π

19
00:00:54,435 --> 00:01:00,842
and then this right over here is 2π again

20
00:01:00,842 --> 00:01:04,201
And then this could be 1

21
00:01:04,201 --> 00:01:05,792
this could be 2

22
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,730
this could be -1

23
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,876
and this can be -2

24
00:01:09,876 --> 00:01:12,665
Now let me copy this thing so I can use it for later

25
00:01:12,665 --> 00:01:14,627
when I adjust this graph

26
00:01:14,627 --> 00:01:18,021
So just this graph so let me copy

27
00:01:18,021 --> 00:01:21,804
Alright so let's think about sin(x)

28
00:01:21,804 --> 00:01:23,863
So what happens when sine is zero?

29
00:01:23,863 --> 00:01:25,408
When sine is zero

30
00:01:25,408 --> 00:01:30,330
Oh sorry, when x is zero, sin(0) is 0

31
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,158
Ok, I'll draw a little unit circle here for reference

32
00:01:33,158 --> 00:01:35,072
This is what I like to do in my head

33
00:01:35,072 --> 00:01:36,664
as I like to figure out the value

34
00:01:36,664 --> 00:01:39,697
of the trigonometric functions

35
00:01:39,697 --> 00:01:41,128
so this is x

36
00:01:41,128 --> 00:01:42,741
this is y

37
00:01:42,741 --> 00:01:45,724
Draw unit circle

38
00:01:45,724 --> 00:01:49,613
And remember over here x is refering to the angle

39
00:01:49,613 --> 00:01:52,038
So that's my unit circle radius 1

40
00:01:52,038 --> 00:01:55,062
So then the angle is 0

41
00:01:55,062 --> 00:01:56,453
sin is going to be the y-coordinate here

42
00:01:56,453 --> 00:01:59,062
so sin(0) is a 0

43
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,230
when as sine increases

44
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:05,389
we go up all the way to sin(π/2) which is 1

45
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:11,251
so sin(π/2) is going to get you to 1

46
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:14,934
then sin(π) gets you to 0

47
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:19,618
sin(3π/2) gets you to -1

48
00:02:19,618 --> 00:02:22,233
and then sin(2π) gets you back to 0

49
00:02:22,233 --> 00:02:24,535
So if I were to graph this I'd look something like this

50
00:02:24,535 --> 00:02:30,666
so this is between 0 and 2π it looks something like that

51
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:31,925
And we also want to go in the negative direction

52
00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:39,402
and so as we go in the negative direction

53
00:02:39,402 --> 00:02:40,799
as we go in the negative direction

54
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:49,182
so sin(-π/2) is -1

55
00:02:49,182 --> 00:02:52,303
then you go back to -π and you go back to zero

56
00:02:52,303 --> 00:02:56,276
-3π/2 you're going all the way back around like that

57
00:02:56,276 --> 00:03:00,070
that gets you all the way back to sine is equal to 1

58
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,872
so sine is equal to 1

59
00:03:01,873 --> 00:03:07,096
And then 2π you go back sine is back equalling 0

60
00:03:07,127 --> 00:03:11,258
So the curve will look something like this

61
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:13,616
In the negative so as you go from

62
00:03:13,616 --> 00:03:17,438
between 0 and -2π

63
00:03:17,438 --> 00:03:20,431
And this is consistent with everything else we know about sine

64
00:03:20,431 --> 00:03:23,752
the period of sin(x)

65
00:03:23,752 --> 00:03:24,823
what you see here

66
00:03:24,823 --> 00:03:26,398
you have a coefficient of 1 here

67
00:03:26,398 --> 00:03:29,512
so the period is going to be 2π over the absolute value of 1

68
00:03:29,512 --> 00:03:31,794
which is a little bit obvious it's just 2π

69
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:34,176
or you just see here that the period is 2π

70
00:03:34,176 --> 00:03:42,500
It took 2π length to do our smallest repeating pattern

71
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,248
And what is the amplitude?

72
00:03:44,248 --> 00:03:47,918
Well we vary between 1 and -1

73
00:03:47,918 --> 00:03:50,448
The total difference between the minimum and maximum is 2

74
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:52,062
Half of that is 1

75
00:03:52,062 --> 00:03:53,549
Or another way of thinking about it is

76
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:57,787
we vary 1 from our middle point

77
00:03:57,787 --> 00:04:01,132
So that was pretty straight forward

78
00:04:01,132 --> 00:04:02,814
Let's change it up a little bit

79
00:04:02,814 --> 00:04:14,101
Now let's graph y=2sin(x)

80
00:04:14,101 --> 00:04:16,726
So let me draw

81
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:21,071
let me put my little axis there

82
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:23,170
want to do it right under it

83
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,696
So what is going to happen

84
00:04:25,696 --> 00:04:30,576
now that we have y = 2sin(x)

85
00:04:30,576 --> 00:04:34,838
how is the graph going to change?

86
00:04:34,838 --> 00:04:40,336
Well all we did is multiply this function by 2 so

87
00:04:40,336 --> 00:04:43,410
whatever this value it takes on is going to be twice as high now

88
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,658
so 2 times 0 is 0

89
00:04:45,658 --> 00:04:48,645
2 times 1 is now 2

90
00:04:48,645 --> 00:04:49,742
2 times 1 is 2

91
00:04:49,742 --> 00:04:51,156
2 times 0 is

92
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:52,464
let me be careful

93
00:04:52,464 --> 00:04:55,302
2 times 1 is 2

94
00:04:55,302 --> 00:04:56,884
that's a π/2

95
00:04:56,884 --> 00:04:59,894
2 times 0 is a 0

96
00:04:59,894 --> 00:05:04,726
2 times -1 is -2

97
00:05:04,726 --> 00:05:08,256
2 times 0 is 0

98
00:05:08,256 --> 00:05:10,700
so it looks something like this

99
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:15,932
between 0 and 2π

100
00:05:15,932 --> 00:05:18,533
so it looks something like that

101
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:20,936
and we keep going in the negative direction

102
00:05:20,936 --> 00:05:25,726
2 times -1 is -2

103
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:28,238
2 times 0 is 0

104
00:05:28,238 --> 00:05:31,517
2 times 1 is 2

105
00:05:31,517 --> 00:05:32,864
2 times 0 is 0

106
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:36,950
so in the negative direction it looks something like that

107
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,845
my best attempt to draw a relatively smooth curve

108
00:05:39,845 --> 00:05:41,956
hopefully you get the idea

109
00:05:41,956 --> 00:05:43,605
so it would look something like that

110
00:05:43,605 --> 00:05:45,820
So what just happened?

111
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,875
Well the difference between the minimum

112
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,151
value and the maximum value just increased by a factor of 2

113
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:56,532
the total difference is 4, half of that difference is 2

114
00:05:56,532 --> 00:05:59,178
So what is the amplitude here?

115
00:05:59,178 --> 00:06:05,101
Well the amplitude is 2

116
00:06:05,101 --> 00:06:08,124
you can view it as the absolute value of 2

117
00:06:08,124 --> 00:06:09,972
well it's common sense

118
00:06:09,972 --> 00:06:14,953
the amplitude here was 1 but now you're swaying from that middle position twice as far

119
00:06:14,953 --> 00:06:17,983
because you're multiplying by 2

120
00:06:17,983 --> 00:06:19,488
Now let's go back to

121
00:06:19,488 --> 00:06:23,580
sin(x) and let's change it in a different way

122
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,230
Let's graph sin(-x)

123
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:31,546
so now let me once again put some graph paper here

124
00:06:31,546 --> 00:06:40,736
And now my goal is to graph sin(-x)

125
00:06:40,736 --> 00:06:43,703
y=sin(-x) so at least for the time being I've got rid of that 2 there

126
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:47,118
and I'm just going straight from sin(x) to sin(-x)

127
00:06:47,118 --> 00:06:50,922
So let's think about how the values are going to work out

128
00:06:50,922 --> 00:06:56,048
So when x is 0 this is still going to be sin(0) which is 0

129
00:06:56,048 --> 00:07:01,845
But then what as x increases, what happens when x is π/2

130
00:07:01,845 --> 00:07:04,017
the angle that we're inputting in to sine

131
00:07:04,017 --> 00:07:05,270
we're going to have to multiply by this negative

132
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,681
so when x is π/2

133
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:09,948
we're really taking sin(-π/2)

134
00:07:09,948 --> 00:07:16,740
but what's sin(-π/2) but we can see over here here it's -1

135
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,705
It's - 1

136
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:24,988
and then when x = π well sin(-π) we see this is 0

137
00:07:24,988 --> 00:07:29,588
When x is 3π/2 well it's going to be sin(-3π/2)

138
00:07:29,588 --> 00:07:32,851
which is 1

139
00:07:32,851 --> 00:07:38,515
Once again when x is 2π it's going to be sin(-2π)

140
00:07:38,515 --> 00:07:39,689
is 0

141
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:45,083
So notice what was happening as I was trying to graph between 0 and 2π

142
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:48,514
I kept referring to the points in the negative direction

143
00:07:48,514 --> 00:07:51,740
so you can imagine taking this negative side

144
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:56,325
right over here between 0 and -2π

145
00:07:56,325 --> 00:07:59,855
and then flipping it over to get this one right over here

146
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:02,187
that's what that -x seems to do

147
00:08:02,187 --> 00:08:05,079
and by that same logic when we go in then negative direction

148
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:10,198
you say when x = -π/2 where you have the negative in front of it

149
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,654
so it's going to be sin(π/2) so it's going to be equal to 1

150
00:08:13,654 --> 00:08:17,677
and you can flip this over the y-axis

151
00:08:17,677 --> 00:08:19,581
so essentially what we have done

152
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:20,672
is we have flipped it we have

153
00:08:20,672 --> 00:08:26,983
reflected the graph of sin(x) over the y-axis

154
00:08:26,983 --> 00:08:38,940
So we have reflected it over the y-axis

155
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,050
This is the y-axis so hopefully you see that reflection

156
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:47,218
that's what that -x has done

157
00:08:47,218 --> 00:08:51,117
So now let's think about kind of the combo

158
00:08:51,117 --> 00:08:54,185
Having the 2 out the front and the -x right over there

159
00:08:54,185 --> 00:08:58,502
so let me put the graph on the axis there one more time

160
00:08:58,502 --> 00:09:02,981
And now let's try to do what was asked of us

161
00:09:02,981 --> 00:09:04,533
So I'll do it in a new colour

162
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:05,285
I'll do it in blue

163
00:09:05,285 --> 00:09:17,502
now let's graph y = 2sin(-x)

164
00:09:17,502 --> 00:09:19,789
so based on everything we've done

165
00:09:19,789 --> 00:09:21,010
how will this look

166
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:24,215
what are the transformations we will do?

167
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:32,648
If we are going from the original sin(x) to y=2sin(-x)

168
00:09:32,648 --> 00:09:35,062
Well there're 2 ways of thinking about it

169
00:09:35,062 --> 00:09:37,333
You could either take 2sin(x)

170
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:41,421
so here we multiply it by 2 to get double the amplitude

171
00:09:41,421 --> 00:09:42,752
And you could say

172
00:09:42,752 --> 00:09:47,018
well I'm going to flip it over to get the negative side of x

173
00:09:47,018 --> 00:09:50,013
And so if you did that you'd get

174
00:09:50,013 --> 00:09:51,728
so let me make it clear what I'm flipping

175
00:09:51,728 --> 00:09:56,318
so if I took between 0 and -2π

176
00:09:56,318 --> 00:09:58,054
and I flip it over

177
00:09:58,054 --> 00:10:02,340
what used to be here you reflect it over the y-axis

178
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,906
and you now have

179
00:10:03,906 --> 00:10:07,435
so we go negative first

180
00:10:07,435 --> 00:10:09,556
then we go back to 0 and then it'll go positive

181
00:10:09,556 --> 00:10:13,974
and then you get right over there

182
00:10:13,974 --> 00:10:17,268
So all I did to get from 2sin(x) to 2sin(-x)

183
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:20,701
is I just reflected over the y-axis

184
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:24,186
and then of course what is between 0 and -2pi

185
00:10:24,186 --> 00:10:26,610
you just have to look between 0 and 2pi

186
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,102
so it's going to go up

187
00:10:29,102 --> 00:10:30,192
up and down

188
00:10:30,192 --> 00:10:32,000
and make it even a little bit better

189
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,167
draw a little bit neater

190
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:37,691
and then down and then down and up

191
00:10:37,691 --> 00:10:41,093
so it's a reflection of what was between 0 and 2π

192
00:10:41,093 --> 00:10:43,320
so you see that right over here

193
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,140
or if you start with sin(-x) and you go to 2sin(-x)

194
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:52,163
notice what happens between sin(-x) and 2sin(-x)

195
00:10:52,163 --> 00:10:55,570
What's the difference between this graph and this graph?

196
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:58,460
Well we just have twice the amplitude

197
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:01,955
we're multiplying this one by 2

198
00:11:01,955 --> 00:11:05,057
and so you get twice the amplitude

199
00:11:05,057 --> 00:11:07,937
And so the last thought or question I have for you

200
00:11:07,937 --> 00:11:13,791
is how does the period of 2sin(-x)

201
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,866
how does that relate to the period of sin(x)

202
00:11:17,866 --> 00:11:19,340
Well there's 2 ways of thinking about it

203
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,451
we could actually I'll you think about it for a second

204
00:11:23,451 --> 00:11:25,331
Well there's 2 ways to thinking about it

205
00:11:25,331 --> 00:11:28,150
you could refer to the graphs over here

206
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:31,753
or you can think about the formula which is hopefully a little intuitive right now

207
00:11:31,753 --> 00:11:35,274
if you wanted to refer to the kind of classical formula

208
00:11:35,274 --> 00:11:37,742
the period is going to be 2π

209
00:11:37,742 --> 00:11:40,464
and you divide by the absolute value of the coefficient

210
00:11:40,464 --> 00:11:44,269
to figure out how much faster you're going to get to 2π

211
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:52,020
So the absolute value of -1 is just 1

212
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,435
so you get 2π

213
00:11:53,435 --> 00:11:58,973
So you get the exact same period as the period of sin(x)

214
00:11:58,973 --> 00:12:00,236
And you see that

215
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:08,083
you complete one cycle every 2π ...

216
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,975
Now what is the difference?

217
00:12:09,975 --> 00:12:11,051
Well the period's the same.

218
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:14,310
But remember this negative is not completely ignored.

219
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:18,203
It doesn't change the period but it does change how the graph looks

220
00:12:18,203 --> 00:12:20,314
When you start getting increased x's

221
00:12:20,314 --> 00:12:22,763
instead of sin being positive as it would be

222
00:12:22,763 --> 00:12:25,805
in the case of a traditional sine function

223
00:12:25,805 --> 00:12:27,616
here as x grows

224
00:12:27,616 --> 00:12:29,492
you're taking the sine of -x

225
00:12:29,492 --> 00:12:32,056
You're taking the sine of a negative angle

226
00:12:32,056 --> 00:12:35,439
And that's why you start off having negative values of sine

227
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:36,696
and that's also another way

228
00:12:36,696 --> 00:12:37,673
if you want to think about it

229
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,861
that it's just a reflection over the y-axis

230
00:12:39,861 --> 00:12:41,158
of just sin(x)

231
00:12:41,158 --> 00:12:43,804
These two are reflections and these two are reflections

232
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:47,296
this one is two times the amplitude of this one

233
00:12:47,296 --> 00:12:51,296
and that one is two times the amplitude of that one
