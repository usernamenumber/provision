1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
   

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,940
All of the work we've been
doing so far with line

3
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,940
integrals has been with
scalar functions or

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,420
scalar-valued functions.

5
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:11,020
And when I say that, that just
means you give me an x and a y

6
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,130
and you evaluate the function
at that x and y, and you

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,640
get another scalar value.

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,710
You get just a number.

9
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,620
You don't get a vector.

10
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,940
So what I want to do in this
video is start to get ourselves

11
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,860
warmed up with regards to
vectors so that we can

12
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,220
understand what it means to
take a line integral with

13
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,030
vector-valued functions.

14
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,910
So let me write down some
vector-valued functions.

15
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,052
Actually, even a better place
to start, let me draw a curve

16
00:00:35,052 --> 00:00:36,290
or let me describe a curve.

17
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,440
So let's put that little
f of x, y to the side.

18
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,820
We can ignore it for now.

19
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:45,525
Let's say I have some curve c
and it's described, it can be

20
00:00:45,525 --> 00:00:50,720
parameterized-- I can't say
that word-- as let's say, x is

21
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:57,590
equal to x of t, y is equal
to some function y of t.

22
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:02,440
And let's say that this is
valid for t is between a and b.

23
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,280
So t is greater than or
equal to a and then,

24
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,240
less than or equal to b.

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,990
So if I were to just draw
this on-- let me see-- I

26
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,320
could draw it like this.

27
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,270
I'm staying very
abstract right now.

28
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,740
This is not a very
specific example.

29
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,910
This is the x-axis.

30
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,360
This is the y-axis.

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,150
My curve-- let's say this
is when t is equal to a.

32
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,750
And then the curve might
do something like this.

33
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,640
I don't know what it does.

34
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,920
Let's say it's over there.

35
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,510
This is t is equal to b.

36
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:40,430
This actual point right
here will be x of b.

37
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,560
That would be the x-coordinate.

38
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,270
You evaluate this function
at b and y of b.

39
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,610
And this is, of course,
when t is equal to a.

40
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:53,370
The actual coordinate in r2 on
the Cartesian coordinates will

41
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:57,140
be x of a, which is
this right here.

42
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,840
And then, y of a, which
is that right there.

43
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,050
And we've seen that before.

44
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,770
That's just a standard way
of describing a parametric

45
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:09,650
equation or curve using
2 parametric equations.

46
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:13,350
What I want to do now is
describe this same exact curve

47
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,340
using a vector-valued function.

48
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,970
So if I define a vector-valued
function-- and if you don't

49
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,230
remember what those are, we'll
have a little bit

50
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:21,910
of review here.

51
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,180
Let me say I have a
vector-valued function, r,

52
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,150
and I'll put a little
vector arrow on top of it.

53
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,670
And a lot of textbooks, they'll
just bold it and they'll

54
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,940
leave scalar-valued
functions unbolded.

55
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,120
But it's hard to draw bold,
so I'll put a little

56
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,550
vector on top.

57
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,220
And let's say that r
is a function of t.

58
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,045
And these are going to
be position vectors.

59
00:02:41,045 --> 00:02:46,800
   

60
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,930
And I'm specifying that
because, in general, when

61
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:54,170
someone talks about a vector,
this vector and this vector

62
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,320
are considered equivalent.

63
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,990
As long as they have the same
magnitude and direction, no one

64
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,550
really cares about what their
start and end points are as

65
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,490
long as their direction's
the same and their

66
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,710
length is the same.

67
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,520
But when you talk about
position vectors you're saying

68
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,155
no, these vectors are all going
to start at 0, at the origin.

69
00:03:10,155 --> 00:03:12,440
And when you say it's a
position vector, you're

70
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,000
implicitly saying this is
specifying a unique position.

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,710
In this case, it's going
to be in two-dimensional

72
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,550
space, but it could be in
three-dimensional space.

73
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,260
Or really, even four, five,
whatever-- n dimensional space.

74
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,010
So when you say it's a position
vector, you're literally

75
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,520
saying, OK, this vector
literally specifies

76
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,580
that point in space.

77
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:35,560
So let's see if we can describe
this curve as a position

78
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,050
vector-valued function.

79
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,110
So we could say r of t.

80
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,750
Let me switch back
to that pink color.

81
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,020
This can stay in green.

82
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:48,750
Is equal to x of t times the
unit vector in the x direction.

83
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,400
The unit vector gets a little
caret on top-- a little hat.

84
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,750
That's like the arrow for it.

85
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,600
That just says it's
a unit vector.

86
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:00,870
Plus y of t times j.

87
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,970
If I was dealing with a curve
in three dimensions I would

88
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,735
have plus z of t times k.

89
00:04:04,735 --> 00:04:07,270
But we're dealing with two
dimensions right here.

90
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,450
And so the way this works is
you're just taking your-- well,

91
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:14,690
for any t and still, we're
going to have t is greater

92
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,610
than or equal to a and then,
less than or equal to b.

93
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,810
And this is the exact
same thing as that.

94
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,105
Let me just redraw it.

95
00:04:21,105 --> 00:04:24,070
So let me draw our coordinates.

96
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:28,400
Our coordinates right
here, our axes.

97
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,410
So that's the y-axis and
this is the x-axis.

98
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,765
So when you evaluate r of a,
that's our starting point.

99
00:04:34,765 --> 00:04:36,180
So let me do that.

100
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,140
So r of a-- maybe I'll
do it right over here.

101
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,860
Our position vector-valued
function evaluated at t is

102
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:50,390
equal to a, is going to be
equal to x of a times our unit

103
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,040
vector in the x direction.

104
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,460
Plus y of a times our unit
vector in the vertical

105
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,865
direction, or in
the y direction.

106
00:04:57,865 --> 00:04:59,500
And what's that
going to look like?

107
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,830
Well, x of a is this thing
right here, so it's x of

108
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,220
a times a unit vector.

109
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,860
You know, maybe the unit
vector is this long.

110
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,180
It has length 1, so now we're
just going to have a length

111
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,070
of x of a in that direction.

112
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,520
And then, same thing in y of a.

113
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,240
It's going to be y of a
length in that direction.

114
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,830
But the bottom line, this
vector right here-- if you add

115
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:25,910
these scaled values of these
two unit vectors, you're going

116
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,460
to get r of a looking
something like this.

117
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,070
it's going to be a vector that
looks something like that.

118
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,270
Just like that.

119
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,770
It's a position vector.

120
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,330
That's why we're nailing it
at the origin, but drawing

121
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,840
it in standard position.

122
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:44,450
And that right there is r of a.

123
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,980
Now what happens if a
increases a little bit?

124
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,590
What is r of a plus
a little bit?

125
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,680
And I don't know, we could
call that r of a plus

126
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,305
delta or r of a plus h.

127
00:05:54,305 --> 00:05:56,355
I'll do it in a
different color.

128
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:59,850
Let's say we increase a
a little bit. r of a

129
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,070
plus some small h.

130
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:06,060
Well, that's just going to
be x of a plus h times

131
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,710
a unit vector i.

132
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,820
Plus y times a plus h
times the unit vector j.

133
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,230
And what's that
going to look like?

134
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,730
Well, we're going to go
a little bit further

135
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,370
down the curve.

136
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,100
That's like saying the
coordinate x of a plus

137
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,980
h and y plus a plus h.

138
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,590
I might be that
point right there.

139
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:25,640
So it'll be a new unit vector.

140
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,300
Sorry, it'll be a new
vector-- position vector--

141
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,070
not a unit vector.

142
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,940
These don't necessarily
have length 1.

143
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,470
That might be right here.

144
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,590
Let me do that same
color as this.

145
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:39,970
So it might be just like that.

146
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:44,930
So that right here
is r of a plus h.

147
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,270
So you see, as you keep
increasing you value of t until

148
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:53,950
you get to b, these position
vectors-- we're going to keep

149
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,860
specifying points
along this curve.

150
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,160
So the curve-- let me draw the
curve in a different color.

151
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,230
The curve looks
something like this.

152
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,150
It's meant to look exactly like
the curve that I have up here.

153
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:08,080
And for example, r of b
is going to be a vector

154
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,180
that looks like this.

155
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,680
It's going to be a vector
that looks like that.

156
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,120
I want to draw it
relatively straight.

157
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:22,310
That vector right
there is r of b.

158
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,740
So hopefully you realize that,
look, these position vectors

159
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,910
really are specifying the same
points on this curve as this

160
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,880
original, I guess, straight
up parameterization that

161
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,070
we did for this curve.

162
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,880
And I just wanted to that as a
little bit of review because

163
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,730
we're now going to break in
into the idea of actually

164
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:41,860
taking a derivative of this
vector-valued function.

165
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,210
And I'll do that in
the next video.

166
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:44,266
