1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,820
   

2
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,220
Let's see if we can remove the
parameter t from a slightly

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,180
more interesting example.

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:14,130
So let's say that x is equal
to 3 times the cosine of t.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,570
And y is equal to 2
times the sine of t.

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,470
We can try to remove the
parameter the same way we did

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,970
in the previous video, where we
can solve for t in terms of

8
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,120
either x or y and then
substitute back in.

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,300
And I'll do that.

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,575
But I want to do that first,
just to show you that it kind

11
00:00:31,575 --> 00:00:34,740
of leads to a hairy or
an unintuitive answer.

12
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,220
So if we solve for--
let's solve for t here.

13
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,940
We could do it either one,
they're equally complex.

14
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,940
So if we solve for t here,
we would say divide

15
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,060
both sides by 2.

16
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:48,970
You'd get y over 2 is
equal to sine of t.

17
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,150
And then you would take the
arcsine of both sides, or the

18
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:56,730
inverse sine of both sides, and
you would get-- I like writing

19
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,710
arcsine, because inverse sine,
people often confuse it with an

20
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,600
exponent, taking it to
the negative 1 power.

21
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,510
Arcsine of y over
2 is equal to t.

22
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,050
Actually, let me do that
little aside there.

23
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,630
I should probably do it at the
trigonometry playlist, but it's

24
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,710
a good thing to hit home.

25
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,570
Because I think
people get confused.

26
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:24,840
So arcsine of anything,
let's say, y.

27
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,910
The other way of writing
that is sine minus 1 of y.

28
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,320
These two things are
equivalent, when

29
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,420
they're normally used.

30
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,200
But I don't like using this
notation most of the time,

31
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,890
because it can be ambiguous.

32
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:47,150
This could mean sine of y to
the negative 1 power, which

33
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,990
equals 1 over sine of y.

34
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:55,540
And arcsine and this are
definitely not the same thing.

35
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,750
So you want to be very careful
there to make sure that you

36
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,750
don't get confused when someone
writes an inverse

37
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,560
sine like this.

38
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,365
But they're not actually
taking sine of y to

39
00:02:02,365 --> 00:02:03,700
the negative 1 power.

40
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,970
On the other hand, if someone
were to write sine squared of

41
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:13,270
y, this is unambiguously the
same thing as sine

42
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,230
of y squared.

43
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,050
In fact, I wish this was the
more conventional notation

44
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,770
because it wouldn't make people
think, oh, 2 and minus 1

45
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,860
there, and of course, that's
just sine of y squared.

46
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,380
So it can be very ambiguous.

47
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,950
And of course, if this was a
negative, this would be a minus

48
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:34,480
2, and then this really would
be 1 over sine of y squared.

49
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,930
That's why, just a long-winded
way of explaining why I

50
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,120
wrote arcsine, instead of
inverse sine right there.

51
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,830
Needless to say, let's
get back to the problem.

52
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,090
So we've solved for
t in terms of y.

53
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,410
Now we can substitute
back here.

54
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,780
And we've got an expression
for x in terms of y.

55
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:56,135
So we get x is equal to 3
times the cosine of t.

56
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:59,510
But we just solved for t. t
is this thing right here.

57
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:07,030
So it's the cosine of
arcsine of y over 2.

58
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,380
And we have eliminated the
parameter, but this is a very

59
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,680
non-intuitive equation.

60
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,710
We could have done
the other way.

61
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,190
We could have solved for y in
terms of x and we would have

62
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,200
gotten the sine of
the arccosine.

63
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,840
It would have been equally
hairy or non-intuitive.

64
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,400
But either way, we did remove
the parameters so I guess

65
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,720
we could mildly pat
ourselves on the back.

66
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,110
But that's not the
purpose of this video.

67
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,280
The purpose of this video is to
see if there's any way we can

68
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,150
remove the parameter that leads
to a more intuitive equation

69
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,790
involving x and y.

70
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,250
And what we're going to do is,
I guess you can call it a bit

71
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,140
of a trick, but it's something
that shows up a lot.

72
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,850
Especially when you deal
with polar coordinates.

73
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,250
And you might want to watch
my polar coordinate videos,

74
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,545
because this essentially
touches on that.

75
00:03:47,545 --> 00:03:52,800
But if I said-- let me rewrite
them. x is equal to 3 cosine of

76
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,940
t and y is equal
to 2 sine of t.

77
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,780
So what we can do is
just think, well, how

78
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,620
can we write this?

79
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,110
And you know, cosine
of t and [? kind ?]

80
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,270
of t, how can we relate them?

81
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,460
And the first thing that comes
to my mind is just the unit

82
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,300
circle, or to some degree, the
most basic of all of the

83
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,890
trigonometric identities.

84
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:19,320
And that is that the cosine
squared of t plus the sine

85
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,980
squared of t is equal to 1.

86
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,210
This comes from
the unit circle.

87
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,000
I explained it in the unit
circle video, and that's

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,840
because the equation for the
unit circle is x squared plus

89
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,330
y squared is equal to 1.

90
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,300
The cosine of the angle is the
x coordinate, the sine of the

91
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,180
angle is the y coordinate,
and so on and so forth.

92
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,100
But this is our trig identity.

93
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,690
You don't have to think about
it too much right now.

94
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,550
Just, I guess, know that it's
true and watch some of the

95
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,330
other videos if you want
it proven that it's true.

96
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,600
But if we can somehow replace
this cosine squared with some

97
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,880
expression in x, and replace
the sine or the sine squared

98
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,400
with some expression of
y, we'd be done, right?

99
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,490
And then we would
have it equaling 1.

100
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,680
And that shouldn't be too hard.

101
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,160
We can rewrite this.

102
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,040
We can set cosine of t equal to
something in x, and we can set

103
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,780
sine of t equal in
something in y.

104
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,400
So let's do that.

105
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,100
We divide both sides
of the equation by 3.

106
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,165
You get x over 3 is
equal to cosine of t.

107
00:05:12,165 --> 00:05:16,400
And if you divide both sides of
this equation by 2, you get y

108
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,590
over 2 is equal to sine of t.

109
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:25,120
And then we can use this
trigonometric identity.

110
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,190
Instead of the cosine of t,
we can substitute x over 3.

111
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:31,780
Instead of the sine of t, we
can substitute y over 2.

112
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:39,810
And you get x over 3 squared--
that's that, right there,

113
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:45,490
that's just cosine of t
squared-- plus y over 2

114
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:51,730
squared-- that's just sine of t
squared-- is equal to 1.

115
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:57,190
And now this is starting to
look a lot better than this.

116
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,330
This, I have no
idea what this is.

117
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,850
But hopefully if you've watched
the conic section videos, you

118
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,110
can already recognize that this
is starting to look

119
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,660
like an ellipse.

120
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,870
We can simplify
it a little bit.

121
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:11,010
We could say this is equal to x
squared over 9 plus y squared

122
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,070
over 4 is equal to 1.

123
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,380
And if we were to graph this
ellipse-- we will actually

124
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,220
graph it-- we get--
let me draw my axis.

125
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,910
I'm using this blue color
a little bit too much,

126
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,920
it's getting monotonous.

127
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,530
OK, let me use the purple.

128
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:29,210
So that's our x-axis.

129
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:29,860
That's our y-axis.

130
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,820
   

131
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,610
The major axis is in the
x direction because the

132
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,010
denominator here is
larger than that one.

133
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:42,150
And it's the semi-major
radius-- this is going

134
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,240
to be the square root
of this, it's 3.

135
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,360
1, 2, 3 in that direction.

136
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,720
1, 2, 3.

137
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,470
I know I'm centered in
0, because neither of

138
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,140
these are shifted.

139
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,540
You should watch the conic
section videos if this

140
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,160
sounds unfamiliar to you.

141
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,540
And the semi-minor radius
is the square root

142
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,210
of 4, so that's 2.

143
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,665
So they get 1, 2.

144
00:07:02,665 --> 00:07:05,410
And 1, 2.

145
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:09,570
Let me see if I can
draw this ellipse.

146
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:17,020
So it looks something
like that.

147
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,870
There you go.

148
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:24,860
So just like that, by
eliminating the parameter t, we

149
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,170
got this equation in a form
that we immediately were able

150
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,360
to recognize as ellipse.

151
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,970
When I just look at that,
unless you deal with parametric

152
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,680
equations, or maybe polar
coordinates a lot, it's not

153
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,170
obvious that this is the
parametric equation

154
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,110
for an ellipse.

155
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,050
But this, once you learn
about conic sections,

156
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,100
is pretty clear.

157
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:41,410
It's an ellipse.

158
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,490
And it's easy to
draw that ellipse.

159
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:48,400
But in removing the t and from
going from these equations up

160
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,090
here, and from going from that
to that, like in the last

161
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,050
video, we lost information.

162
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,330
We lost, one, what is the
direction that we move

163
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,850
in as t increases?

164
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,180
And we also don't know what
point on this ellipse we

165
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,230
are at any given time, t.

166
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:10,750
So to do that, let's
make our little table.

167
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:15,710
   

168
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,525
So let's take some values of t.

169
00:08:17,525 --> 00:08:20,370
   

170
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:26,510
So we'll make a little
table. t, x, and y.

171
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,960
It's good to pick values of t.

172
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,620
Remember-- let me rewrite the
equations again, so we didn't

173
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:35,250
lose it-- x was equal to 3
cosine of t, and y is

174
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,010
equal to 2 sine of t.

175
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:41,250
It's good to take values of t
where it's easy to figure out

176
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,900
what the cosine and sine are,
and without using a calculator.

177
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,130
We're assuming the t is in
radiance, just for simplicity.

178
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,560
So let's pick t is equal to 0.

179
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,550
t is equal to pi over 2.

180
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,240
That's 90 degrees in degrees.

181
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,650
And t is equal to pi.

182
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,750
And so what is x when
t is equal to 0?

183
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:03,980
Well, cosine of 0 is
1 times 3, that's 3.

184
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,810
What's x, when t is
just pi over 2?

185
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,490
Cosine of pi over 2 is 0.

186
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:13,780
0 times 3 is 0.

187
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:17,100
And what's x equal when
t is equal to pi?

188
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,300
Cosine of pi is minus 1.

189
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,380
Minus 1 times 3 is minus 3.

190
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,750
Fair enough.

191
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,770
Now let's do the y's.

192
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,740
When t is 0 what is y?

193
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,060
Sine is 0, 0.

194
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,480
So 2 times 0 is 0.

195
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,890
When t is pi over 2,
sine of pi over 2 is 1.

196
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,380
1 times 2 is 2.

197
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,570
And when t is pi, sine of
pi-- that's sine of 180

198
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:42,770
degrees-- that's 0.

199
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,420
2 times 0 is 0.

200
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,720
So let's plot these points.

201
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,410
When time is 0, we're
at the point 3, 0.

202
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:53,040
So 3, 0-- 3, 0 is right there.

203
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,090
This is t equals 0.

204
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:01,230
When t increases by pi over 2,
or if this was seconds, pi over

205
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:04,380
2 seconds is like 1.7
something seconds.

206
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:10,030
So at t equals pi over 2,
we're at the point 0, 2.

207
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,700
We're right over here.

208
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,380
So this is at t is
equal to pi over 2.

209
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,820
And then when t increases a
little bit more-- when we're

210
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,820
at t is equal to pi-- we're
at the point minus 3, 0.

211
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,760
We're here.

212
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,160
So this is t is equal to
pi or, you know, we could

213
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,090
write 3.14159 seconds.

214
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,080
3.14 seconds.

215
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,830
And actually, you know, I want
to make the point, t does not

216
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,620
have to be time, and we don't
have to be dealing

217
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,090
with seconds.

218
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,360
But I like to think
about it that way.

219
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,700
I like to think about, maybe
this is describing some object

220
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,230
in orbit around, I don't
know, something else.

221
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,380
So now we know the direction.

222
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:56,650
As t increased from 0 to pi
over 2 to pi, we went this way.

223
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,000
We went counterclockwise.

224
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,280
So the direction of t's
parametric equations

225
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,090
is in that direction.

226
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:07,150
And you might be saying,
Sal, you know, why'd we

227
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,450
have to do 3 points?

228
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,110
We could have just done
2, and made a line.

229
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,850
If we just had that point and
that point, you might have

230
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,680
immediately said, oh, we
went from there to there.

231
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,500
But that really wouldn't
have been enough.

232
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,150
Because maybe we got from
here to there by going

233
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,470
the other way around.

234
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:23,220
So giving that third point lets
us know that the direction is

235
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,610
definitely counterclockwise.

236
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:31,200
And so what happens if we just
take t from 0 to infinity?

237
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,470
What happens if we bound t?
t is greater than 0 and

238
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,200
less than infinity.

239
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,130
Well, we're just going
to keep going around

240
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,820
this ellipse forever.

241
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,760
Multiple times.

242
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,600
Keep writing over and
over, infinite times.

243
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,480
If we went from minus infinity
to infinity, then we would

244
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,480
have always been doing it, I
guess is the way to put it.

245
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,590
Or if we just wanted to trace
this out once, we could go from

246
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:58,440
t is less than or equal to-- or
t is greater than

247
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,370
or equal to 0.

248
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:03,900
All the way to t is less
than or equal to 2 pi.

249
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,090
And in this situation,
t really is the angle

250
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,010
that we're tracing out.

251
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:11,220
If we were to think of this
in polar coordinates, this

252
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,010
is t at any given time.

253
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,570
And I just thought I would
throw that out there.

254
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,700
It isn't always, but in
this case it really is.

255
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,510
When you go from 0 to 2 pi
radius, you've made 1 circle.

256
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:24,280
But this is about parametric
equations and not trigonometry.

257
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,090
So I don't want to focus
too much on that.

258
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,850
But anyway, that was neat.

259
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,340
When we started with this,
if I just showed you those

260
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,330
parametric equations, you'd
have no idea what

261
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,040
that looks like.

262
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,470
But by recognizing the trig
identity, we were able to

263
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,930
simplify it to an ellipse,
draw the ellipse.

264
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,880
And then by plotting a couple
of points, we were able to

265
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,000
figure out the direction at
which, if this was describing

266
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,380
a particle in motion, the
direction in which that

267
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,140
particle was actually moving.

268
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,530
Anyway, hope you enjoyed that.
