1
00:00:00,738 --> 00:00:04,204
the alternative form of the derivate of the function f of the number 'a'

2
00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:08,672
denoted by f'(a) is given by ... this stuff ...

3
00:00:08,672 --> 00:00:11,804
now this might look a little strange to you but if you really think about

4
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:16,137
what it's saying, it's really just taking the slope of the tangent line between

5
00:00:16,137 --> 00:00:19,804
a, f(a) ... so let's imagine some

6
00:00:19,804 --> 00:00:23,069
arbitrary function like this, let's say that is

7
00:00:23,069 --> 00:00:27,948
I'll just write that's our function f, and so you could

8
00:00:27,948 --> 00:00:31,339
have the point when x=a, this is our x-axis

9
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:35,071
this is the point: (a, f(a))

10
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:38,733
notice: a, f(a)

11
00:00:38,733 --> 00:00:39,734
and then

12
00:00:39,734 --> 00:00:44,069
we could take the slope between that and some arbitrary point, let's call that x

13
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:48,366
so this is the point: x, f(x)

14
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:51,470
and notice ...

15
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:56,403
this top, the numerator right here, this is just our change in the value of the function

16
00:00:56,403 --> 00:00:58,948
or you could view that as the change in the vertical axis

17
00:00:58,948 --> 00:01:03,737
so that would give you this distance right over here, so that's what we're doing up here, in the numerator

18
00:01:03,737 --> 00:01:06,947
and then in the denominator we're finding the change

19
00:01:06,947 --> 00:01:11,282
in our horizontal values, horizontal coordinates

20
00:01:11,282 --> 00:01:13,403
that we'll do in a different color

21
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:16,088
that would give you

22
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:19,870
so the change in the horizontal, that's this right over here

23
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:23,115
and then they're trying to apply the limit as x approaches a, so as x gets

24
00:01:23,115 --> 00:01:26,948
closer and closer and closer and closer to a what's going to

25
00:01:27,163 --> 00:01:31,616
happen is is that when x is out here we have this secant line

26
00:01:31,616 --> 00:01:35,205
we're finding the slope of this secant

27
00:01:35,205 --> 00:01:39,281
line, but as x gets closer and closer the secant line gets

28
00:01:39,281 --> 00:01:43,139
better and better and better approximated to the slope of the tangent line

29
00:01:43,323 --> 00:01:47,137
where the limit as x approaches a but doesn't quite equal it

30
00:01:47,137 --> 00:01:55,537
is going to be, this is actually the definition of our derivate or the alternate form of the derivate definition, and this would be the slope of the tangent line

31
00:01:55,537 --> 00:01:56,782
that exists

32
00:01:57,105 --> 00:02:00,032
so with that all out of the way, let's try to answer our question

33
00:02:00,032 --> 00:02:03,050
with the alternate form of the derivates as an aid, makes sense of the

34
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:07,070
following limit expression by identifying the function f and the number

35
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:11,485
a. So right here they want to find the slope of the tangent

36
00:02:11,485 --> 00:02:15,204
line at 5, here they wanted to find the slope of the tangent line at a

37
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,949
so it's pretty clear that a is

38
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:22,870
equal to 5, and that f(a)

39
00:02:24,638 --> 00:02:27,076
is equal to 125

40
00:02:27,276 --> 00:02:29,616
now what about f(x)? f(x)?

41
00:02:30,523 --> 00:02:35,137
Well, here is a limit of f(x)-f(a), well here's the limit as x

42
00:02:35,137 --> 00:02:39,365
x to the 3rd minus 125, and this makes sense

43
00:02:39,365 --> 00:02:43,405
if f(x) = x to the third

44
00:02:43,405 --> 00:02:46,947
then it makes sense that f(5)

45
00:02:46,947 --> 00:02:50,204
f(5) is going to be 5 to the third

46
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:54,805
is going to be 125, and we're also taking up here the limit is x

47
00:02:54,805 --> 00:02:59,282
approaches a which is x approaches 5

48
00:02:59,282 --> 00:03:03,139
so this is the derivate of the function f(x)

49
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:08,943
is equal to x to the third, let me write that down in a green color

50
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:12,702
x to the third at the number x equals

51
00:03:12,702 --> 00:03:15,370
at the number a equals to 5, so we can imagine

52
00:03:15,524 --> 00:03:19,075
this, let's try to actually graph it so that we can image, actually I'll do it

53
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:22,402
out here, where we have a little bit better contrast with the colors

54
00:03:24,355 --> 00:03:27,537
so let's say that is my y-axis

55
00:03:27,537 --> 00:03:30,656
let's say that this is my

56
00:03:30,733 --> 00:03:34,365
x-axis, I'm not going to quite draw it to scale, let's say that here

57
00:03:34,365 --> 00:03:39,003
is a point 125 or y=125

58
00:03:39,003 --> 00:03:42,471
this is when x=5 so they're clearly not at the same

59
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:47,094
scale. But the function is going to look something

60
00:03:47,124 --> 00:03:54,489
is going to look something like this, you know what x to the third is going to look like

61
00:03:54,489 --> 00:04:02,725
it looks something, something like, something like, let me draw a little bit, something like this

62
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:05,537
we know it's going to look something like this. So here our a

63
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:06,806
a=5. Our a=5. This point right here

64
00:04:06,806 --> 00:04:14,364
is, is: (5, 125) .... (5,125)

65
00:04:14,364 --> 00:04:17,870
and then we're taking the slope between that point and

66
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:21,736
an arbitrary x value, and an arbitrary, or I should say

67
00:04:21,736 --> 00:04:25,071
an arbitrary other point on the curve, so this right over here would be the point

68
00:04:25,071 --> 00:04:30,003
called: x comma x to the third. We know that

69
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:33,782
f(x) is equal to x to the third. Let me make it clear

70
00:04:33,782 --> 00:04:36,071
that the graph of y is equal to, y is equal to

71
00:04:37,563 --> 00:04:41,536
x to the third, and so this expression

72
00:04:41,536 --> 00:04:45,537
right over here, all of this is the slope between two points

73
00:04:46,644 --> 00:04:49,698
this is the slope between these two points. And as we take the limit

74
00:04:49,898 --> 00:04:53,948
as x approaches 5, so right now this is our x

75
00:04:53,948 --> 00:04:57,616
as x get closer and closer and closer to 5

76
00:04:57,616 --> 00:05:01,472
as it gets closer and closer to 5 these secant lines are better and better

77
00:05:01,472 --> 00:05:05,337
and better approximate the slope of the tangent line

78
00:05:05,337 --> 00:05:10,366
at x equals 5. So let's look at the tangent line a little bit

79
00:05:10,366 --> 00:05:13,537
looks something to be even more, looks something like

80
00:05:13,537 --> 00:05:17,000
something like that.
