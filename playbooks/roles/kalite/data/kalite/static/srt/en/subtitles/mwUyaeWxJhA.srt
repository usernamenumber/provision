1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,065
Farming as we now associate the word has been around for about 7 to 10 thousand years and..

2
00:00:08,065 --> 00:00:12,823
when we think of farming we imagine a farmer planting seeds and later harvesting the crops

3
00:00:12,823 --> 00:00:15,820
or maybe having cattle that they can allow to graze

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,707
and using that cattle later either for meat or milk or wool.

5
00:00:19,707 --> 00:00:22,398
But there's actually a different type of farming that predates

6
00:00:22,398 --> 00:00:27,699
this association with what we can call traditional form of farming.

7
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:31,709
And it predates it by several tens of thousands of years

8
00:00:31,709 --> 00:00:37,398
and we believe it started with the original inhabitants of Australia.

9
00:00:37,398 --> 00:00:40,148
And what they did is, and this is why we call it farming,

10
00:00:40,148 --> 00:00:43,157
because if you think about farming in the most general sense

11
00:00:43,157 --> 00:00:47,076
is really humans using technology to manipulate their environment

12
00:00:47,076 --> 00:00:49,975
so it becomes more suitable for humans

13
00:00:49,975 --> 00:00:53,236
and more suitable for things that humans might want to eat

14
00:00:53,236 --> 00:00:56,818
or get milk from or ... or whatever.

15
00:00:56,818 --> 00:01:02,731
And this type of farming is called firestick farming.

16
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:05,402
And I think you can already imagine what it might involve.

17
00:01:05,402 --> 00:01:08,904
It involves using fire which is really a form of technology

18
00:01:08,904 --> 00:01:10,573
or can be a form of technology,

19
00:01:10,573 --> 00:01:16,322
using fire to make the environment more suitable for human activity.

20
00:01:16,322 --> 00:01:20,079
And so what the original Australians did, the indigenous Australians,

21
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:27,968
or sometimes we refer to them as the Aboriginal Australians.

22
00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:31,150
If you're wondering where the word Aboriginal comes from,

23
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,070
you might recognise some parts of it:

24
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:36,321
original - you know what that means, the first things

25
00:01:36,321 --> 00:01:38,738
the things that were there from the beginning,

26
00:01:38,738 --> 00:01:42,897
and then you have "ab", which is Latin for "from".

27
00:01:42,897 --> 00:01:44,700
So this is literally "from the beginning",

28
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,631
so when we say Aboriginal Australians we're really

29
00:01:46,631 --> 00:01:49,400
kind of saying that they were there from the beginning.

30
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:56,317
And so what they would do is that we believe if you go back 50-60,000 years

31
00:01:56,317 --> 00:02:00,043
before the first Aboriginal Australians settled Australia,

32
00:02:00,043 --> 00:02:03,176
Australia had much more forest. It still has forest,

33
00:02:03,176 --> 00:02:07,321
this is a modern picture of an Australian forest,

34
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:10,697
but what they did is that they set up controlled burns.

35
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,032
And what these controlled burns did is that

36
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:15,405
they cleared away a lot of forest,

37
00:02:15,405 --> 00:02:19,080
they cleared away a lot of the brush that's at the bottom over here,

38
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,746
and it made it much more suitable for grassland to develop.

39
00:02:22,746 --> 00:02:24,306
And the reason why they liked grassland -

40
00:02:24,306 --> 00:02:26,826
so let's make a little cycle here of what they did.

41
00:02:26,826 --> 00:02:31,407
So they have controlled burns, controlled fires

42
00:02:31,407 --> 00:02:37,237
those controlled fires helped promote grassland

43
00:02:37,237 --> 00:02:40,244
and then once you have grassland that made the environment

44
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:47,162
more suitable for animals that the original human settlers could essentially live off of,

45
00:02:47,162 --> 00:02:49,824
that they could hunt, that they could potentially eat their meat,

46
00:02:49,824 --> 00:02:55,563
for example things like ... kangaroos

47
00:02:55,563 --> 00:02:59,317
and these supported the human population

48
00:02:59,317 --> 00:03:03,162
which obviously would then do the controlled burns.

49
00:03:03,162 --> 00:03:06,369
And you see here we could have started off with something like this,

50
00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:08,990
someone provides a controlled burn,

51
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:12,043
and they were actually pretty scientifical about how they did it.

52
00:03:12,043 --> 00:03:13,747
They wouldn't just go with the end of summer

53
00:03:13,747 --> 00:03:16,989
when everything was hot and ready to just blow up

54
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:19,329
and to start a fire that they couldn't control.

55
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:21,832
They would often do these is seasons knowing that

56
00:03:21,832 --> 00:03:25,659
they had a certain level of moisture in the air, it wasn't too hot

57
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:29,075
and to a large degree by doing these controlled burns,

58
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:33,308
not only did it provide an environment

59
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,080
that was suitable for things like kangaroos

60
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,828
some type of thing that humans could eat,

61
00:03:38,828 --> 00:03:41,574
but it also prevented major fires.

62
00:03:41,574 --> 00:03:44,739
And you still see forest rangers doing this type of thing.

63
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:49,572
There is some reason to believe that what the original Australians did

64
00:03:49,572 --> 00:03:52,700
on some level was more nuanced and more fine too

65
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,327
than even what we do in a modern sense of controlled burns.

66
00:03:56,327 --> 00:04:06,034
So these controlled fires also prevented major, uncontrollable fires.

67
00:04:06,034 --> 00:04:08,834
Because what happens if you don't have these controlled fires,

68
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:12,241
then you have brush building up year after year after year,

69
00:04:12,241 --> 00:04:13,750
you have stuff building up,

70
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:18,995
and then when the fires do occure, they're not going to occure,

71
00:04:18,995 --> 00:04:20,740
they're less likely, the uncontrollable fires

72
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,823
are less likely to start during the winter

73
00:04:22,823 --> 00:04:25,641
when the air is cool, when there might be some moisture,

74
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:27,973
they're more likely to ocure in the dry seasons.

75
00:04:27,973 --> 00:04:31,080
So you have all this stuff built up, and then when the fire does happen,

76
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,299
it happens in the driest season and then when it happens

77
00:04:34,299 --> 00:04:36,414
with all the stuff built up in the driest season

78
00:04:36,414 --> 00:04:39,579
it just becomes uncontrollable.

79
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:44,826
One of the several by-products of this firestick farming

80
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:48,972
we believe is a lot of the grassland in Australia now

81
00:04:48,972 --> 00:04:53,739
might have been more forested befor even when the first European settlers

82
00:04:53,739 --> 00:04:57,910
came in the late 1700s, they were kind of surprised

83
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,032
when they went into what is now Sydney Harbour

84
00:05:00,032 --> 00:05:02,300
and they said:'Wow, look at all the grassland here,

85
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,744
it almost looks like a park space!'

86
00:05:03,744 --> 00:05:06,079
And then they would like their sheep graze there

87
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09,165
and they were surprised, because they have driven out the original inhabitants,

88
00:05:09,165 --> 00:05:12,243
and then they were surprised when forest just started to grow up in that grassland.

89
00:05:12,243 --> 00:05:17,484
It was because the original Australians were actually controlling that forest growth

90
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:21,243
to make it more inhabitable for things like kangaroos

91
00:05:21,243 --> 00:05:23,310
and then when the English settlers came

92
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,990
they started to have their sheep grazing in those grasslands.

93
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,976
And also it was responsible for the disappearance,

94
00:05:30,976 --> 00:05:35,827
we think of many major, or better mega-fauna.

95
00:05:35,827 --> 00:05:40,747
So really large animal that inhabited Australia for millions of years

96
00:05:40,747 --> 00:05:45,242
until humans showed up. And this is one of them, if you just to need to look at them.

97
00:05:45,242 --> 00:05:50,489
This is called Diprotodon optatum, or the giant wombat.

98
00:05:50,489 --> 00:05:54,699
And there are fossils of the giant wombat around 40-50,000 years ago,

99
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:56,743
but they disappeared with humans showing up.

100
00:05:56,743 --> 00:05:59,245
And there're multiple ways we can think about why they disappeared.

101
00:05:59,245 --> 00:06:01,662
They might have, and this is probably the case,

102
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:04,746
they might have been more dependent on the forest habitat,

103
00:06:04,746 --> 00:06:10,409
or this was a more favorable habitat for them than the grasslands,

104
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:13,739
maybe because they ate leaves that were higher up.

105
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:15,977
Or another thing is once the forest habitat goes away

106
00:06:15,977 --> 00:06:17,896
they were actually also easier to hunt down,

107
00:06:17,896 --> 00:06:20,917
or either way to think about it they might have just been hunted by humans.

108
00:06:20,917 --> 00:06:24,567
But we do see with humans coming to the Australian continent

109
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:28,412
you start to see the disappearance, and this is not the only one,

110
00:06:28,412 --> 00:06:32,239
there were several major species of megafauna,

111
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:36,239
of super-large animals that disappeared at that time period.
