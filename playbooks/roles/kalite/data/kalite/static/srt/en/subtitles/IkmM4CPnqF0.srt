1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,510
   

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,500
In the video on sp3 hybridized
orbitals, we went in pretty

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,910
good detail about how a methane
molecule looks.

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,590
But just as a bit of a review,
it's the tetrahedral shape.

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,970
You have a carbon in the middle,
and then you would

6
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,870
have a hydrogen-- you can
imagine I'm drawing it like

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,580
this because this hydrogen is
poking out of the page.

8
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,780
Then maybe you have another
hydrogen that's in the page.

9
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,640
You have one above the carbon,
and you have one

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,630
that's behind the page.

11
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:30,760
You could imagine it's like a
tripod with a pole sticking

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,409
out of the top of the tripod.

13
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,690
Or if you were to imagine the
shape another way, if you were

14
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:41,140
to connect the hydrogens, you
would have a four-sided

15
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,530
pyramid with a triangle
as each of the sides.

16
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,230
So it would to look something
like this.

17
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,096
   

18
00:00:50,096 --> 00:00:53,320
I'm trying my best to draw--
the pyramid would look

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,060
something like this if you
could see through it.

20
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:59,780
So this would be one side,
another side would be over

21
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:04,685
here, and then the backside
would be over here, and then

22
00:01:04,685 --> 00:01:06,170
the fourth side is actually
the side that's

23
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,430
transparent out front.

24
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:11,970
So the fourth side would be the
actual kind of thing that

25
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,790
we're looking through when
we look at this pyramid.

26
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:16,610
It would be this front
side right over here.

27
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,910
So you can imagine it different
ways, this was the

28
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,160
case with methane.

29
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,700
   

30
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,590
Now let's extend this into
a slightly more complex

31
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,400
molecule, and that's ethane.

32
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,710
So the way we've been drawing
it so far-- I guess the

33
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,260
simplest way to draw ethane,
is just like that.

34
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,580
By implication this is ethane.

35
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,810
By implication you have a carbon
there, and a carbon

36
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,010
there, and they'll each have
three hydrogens bonded to it.

37
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,310
And we've drawn it something
like this.

38
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:50,150
Three hydrogens bonded to
each of these guys.

39
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:54,240
But now we know that carbon
has these sp3 hybridized

40
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,970
orbitals, that it likes to form
more of a tetrahedral

41
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,780
shape when it bonds.

42
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,550
So an ethane molecule would
actually look more like this.

43
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,270
Let me draw the carbons.

44
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,810
So I'll do the carbons
in orange.

45
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,030
So if that's the carbon
and that's the carbon.

46
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,759
So you can imagine you have
a carbon molecule here.

47
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,710
I'll draw it as this
little circle.

48
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,370
And then if we have some
perspective, so the

49
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,350
carbon-carbon bond is going
to look like that.

50
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,520
And then you have
another carbon

51
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,150
molecule right over there.

52
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,160
So that's that bond over here.

53
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,880
And we want both the carbons,
all of their bonds to be kind

54
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,820
of in a tetrahedral shape.

55
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,870
So then you could imagine
this bond over

56
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,826
here going like this.

57
00:02:31,826 --> 00:02:33,630
This bond going like that.

58
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,690
And you have your hydrogen
at the end.

59
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,210
Let's make the green circles
the hydrogens.

60
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:42,180
So you have that hydrogen, and
then-- or actually just the

61
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,900
circles, we'll call them
hydrogen-- and then you can

62
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,970
imagine this one, maybe it's
coming out of the page a

63
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:47,510
little bit.

64
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,760
That is that hydrogen.

65
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,420
   

66
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,030
Let me label the hydrogens,
actually.

67
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,470
I'm doing it in all different
colors so you can see what I'm

68
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,900
talking about.

69
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,920
And then this hydrogen is going
right below it, maybe

70
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,200
pointed back a little bit.

71
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,370
So that hydrogen is
right over there.

72
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,380
So you can see this carbon,
its bonds have

73
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,470
a tetrahedral shape.

74
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,960
Or, if you just looked at this
part of it, these would be the

75
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,630
base of the tripod and
this would be the

76
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,580
thing sticking up.

77
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,350
Now for this carbon it would
be very similar idea.

78
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,380
   

79
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,990
This hydrogen right
here, might be

80
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,240
sticking down like this.

81
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,730
   

82
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,460
And I'll stop switching
colors soon enough.

83
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,230
It takes a lot of time.

84
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,100
That hydrogen over there, it's
pointing out in that

85
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,870
direction like that.

86
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,850
And then you would have,
let's see what

87
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:36,820
colors do I have left?

88
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,180
Well, I'll just do yellow.

89
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,610
That hydrogen right
there, maybe it's

90
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,110
pointing out like that.

91
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:46,030
So this is a possible
configuration for ethane.

92
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,220
And the way that I've drawn this
right now, and you can

93
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,010
actually have a model that has
this, where you have little

94
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,050
wooden sticks with balls and
this, the balls to represent

95
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:58,100
the actual atoms, this is called
a ball and stick model.

96
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:04,550
   

97
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,140
And this is a ball and stick
model for ethane.

98
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,490
Now a simpler way we could
have drawn this, this is

99
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,100
called a horse shoe projection--
or actually it's

100
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,310
a sawhorse production.

101
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,450
I always say horse shoe.

102
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,290
A sawhorse projection.

103
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,230
It would look like this.

104
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:20,060
This exact same configuration
of ethane in a sawhorse

105
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,110
projection.

106
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:24,330
And you know what a sawhorse
looks like, well, it looks

107
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,130
like what I'm about to draw.

108
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,520
It looks like this.

109
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,720
So you could, well I could
draw it exactly the

110
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,760
way I drew it here.

111
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:35,280
So you have the carbon, carbon,
and then you have the

112
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,910
hydrogen, hydrogen, hydrogen,
and then you have a-- well,

113
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,310
the way I've drawn it up
here is more like this.

114
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,850
Just so we see the parallel
and then we can

115
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,240
rotate things around.

116
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,690
The way I drew it up here,
you have a hydrogen,

117
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,810
hydrogen, and hydrogen.

118
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,340
And then over here you
have a hydrogen,

119
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,020
hydrogen, and hydrogen.

120
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:04,830
This is a sawhorse projection.

121
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,290
Now, either way you depict
it, I mean, these are

122
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,030
really the same way.

123
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,650
This is kind of just like
the lazier way of

124
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,550
doing it on some level.

125
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,620
You're not drawing all of these
circles and all of that,

126
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,680
and you're putting a little
less care into actually

127
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,130
showing the angle, how things
are angled away from the

128
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,010
carbon and showing the
tetrahedral shape.

129
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,885
But in either case, when you
start visualizing the molecule

130
00:05:21,885 --> 00:05:24,510
in this way, you start to
realize there's, well, there's

131
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,430
actually infinite ways that
these things can be

132
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,110
configured.

133
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:31,370
And it all comes from the notion
that this is just a

134
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,700
sigma bond right here.

135
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,690
We learned that in the video on
sp3 hybridization and sigma

136
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:36,890
and pi bonds.

137
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:41,030
This is just a sigma bond.

138
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,250
And so we can rotate
around the bonds.

139
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,930
One of these carbons could
rotate around the axis of that

140
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,150
bond without the other
carbon having to

141
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,240
necessarily rotate with it.

142
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,760
If this was a double bond, if
this was a pi bond, they would

143
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,280
have to rotate together.

144
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,230
So you could have a situation
like I've drawn here or you

145
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,490
could have a situation where
they're kind of rotated the

146
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,380
inverse of each other.

147
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,570
And this is what I mean.

148
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,210
So I'll do a ball and stick.

149
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:06,760
So let's say this is our front
carbon, that is our back

150
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,080
carbon, and we'll compare it
to this one over here.

151
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,710
So let me draw this guy
the exact same way.

152
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:18,900
So he's got a hydrogen down
here, he's got a hydrogen up

153
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:23,890
there, and then he's got
a hydrogen up here.

154
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,510
So that part of the ethane
looks identical.

155
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,410
Now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to flip the other

156
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,240
side of the ethane.

157
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,850
I want you to pay close
attention, because hopefully

158
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,310
you'll see the difference
between the two.

159
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,440
So instead of doing this blue
ethane down here-- this blue

160
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,610
hydrogen down here-- I'm
going to do it on top.

161
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:44,310
So this blue one, I want to
do that in blue, this blue

162
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,280
hydrogen, put it on top.

163
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,720
So I'm just rotating
this around.

164
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,850
So the blue hydrogen's on top.

165
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,950
So I've rotated it so the
blue one's on top now.

166
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:59,710
And now the green one is
going to go over here.

167
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:04,060
So now the green hydrogen
is now over here.

168
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,310
And then this purple, or this
magenta hydrogen, the way I've

169
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,010
rotated it, is now going
to go over here.

170
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,780
   

171
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,680
So what's the difference between
this configuration and

172
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,830
this configuration right here?

173
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,870
And we could have
had every other

174
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,040
configuration in between.

175
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,700
But what's the real
difference here?

176
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,260
Well, here the hydrogen, you
could imagine that hydrogen is

177
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,510
kind of, if you were looking
from that direction, that

178
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,890
hydrogen is directly behind that
hydrogen, that hydrogen

179
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,060
is directly behind that
hydrogen, that hydrogen is

180
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,360
directly behind that.

181
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,740
This is called an eclipsed
configuration, or eclipsed

182
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,160
conformation.

183
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:43,340
So eclipsed conformation.

184
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:47,050
   

185
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,620
And this right here, nothing
is behind anything.

186
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,380
If you went straight
back from this guy,

187
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,140
you'd get to this point.

188
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,010
And no one's behind it.

189
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,470
And if you went straight forward
from this guy you'll

190
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:58,850
get-- So in no way are any of
the guys in the back-- once

191
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,750
again, if your viewing from
this direction-- are they

192
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,400
blocked by any of
the people here.

193
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,965
So we call this a staggered
conformation.

194
00:08:03,965 --> 00:08:08,900
   

195
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,670
Now, why do we even care?

196
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:15,190
OK, I can twist around
this back molecule.

197
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:19,890
What's that even going to do for
our actual-- why does it

198
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:20,530
even matter?

199
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,500
Well, one, it's just interesting
that you can

200
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,720
actually change, that this thing
can twist around without

201
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,870
changing the front-- without the
front molecule having to

202
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,940
twist with it.

203
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,600
But even more important, these
have different energy levels,

204
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,590
so you can kind of think of
them as you're kind of

205
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:39,630
twisting a spring and the spring
might want to go back

206
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,610
to one conformation
or another.

207
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,760
And to visualize it a little
better, I'll draw what's

208
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,580
called a Newman Projection.

209
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,150
So I'm going to draw this exact
thing, but with a Newman

210
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,790
Projection, you draw the carbon
molecules directly in

211
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,890
front or directly behind
each other.

212
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:58,570
So in this situation, you would
draw the carbon molecule

213
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,040
in front, would just be the
intersection of these bonds.

214
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,640
So for a Newman Projection--
let me draw that out.

215
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:14,320
So it's a Newman Projection and
I'll start with the Newman

216
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,290
Projection for the staggered
conformation.

217
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,460
So in the front-- we'll consider
this carbon the front

218
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,340
carbon-- we have our
hydrogen pointing

219
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:28,095
straight down like that.

220
00:09:28,095 --> 00:09:31,700
And we have a hydrogen
coming out to the

221
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,420
top left, like that.

222
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,020
And then we have this
hydrogen over here

223
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,380
coming up to the right.

224
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,400
I want to do that in
that same color.

225
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,020
   

226
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,010
So the front carbon is
implicitly at the intersection

227
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:47,060
of the bonds of these
three hydrogens.

228
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:52,260
And then the back carbon-- I
said the front carbon is the

229
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,490
intersection of the bonds of
these three hydrogens-- the

230
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,480
back carbon you represented
as a circle.

231
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,680
So the circle represents
the back of carbon.

232
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,740
The front carbon is kind
of that point there.

233
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,680
This is a way of
visualizing it.

234
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,990
But if we were to draw it this
way, the back carbon now has

235
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,520
that blue hydrogen popping
off of it.

236
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:19,580
So it has that blue hydrogen,
this green hydrogen, and then

237
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,830
this magenta hydrogen.

238
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,570
   

239
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,300
And when you look at it like
this, it is more clear that

240
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:26,830
it's staggered.

241
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:29,820
We're just looking straight on
to this ethane molecule.

242
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,520
When we look straight on, the
front carbon, they're

243
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,880
obviously blocking each other.

244
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,370
But this way you can see the
front carbon's hydrogens are

245
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,020
staggered relative
to the back ones.

246
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,230
So this is right here, once
again, this is staggered.

247
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:43,600
Now let's draw the eclipsed
conformation as a Newman

248
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,720
Projection.

249
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,450
So as a Newman Projection
the front's

250
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,390
going to look the same.

251
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:53,860
You have a hydrogen there, you
have this hydrogen, you have

252
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,800
that hydrogen, and then you
have that blue, or I guess

253
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,820
that purple hydrogen,
down here.

254
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,270
So that's the front of it.

255
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,750
But the back, they're
right behind it's.

256
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,260
So let me draw the
back carbon.

257
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,590
The front carbon is kind of
represented by just that dot.

258
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:11,020
The back carbon we'll
represent like that.

259
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,770
And the staggered conformation,
if this guy's

260
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,280
really behind that, you're going
to have to draw it like,

261
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,070
right there, like
right behind it.

262
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:21,100
But since that's a little bit
messy, normally when people

263
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:27,780
draw a staggered projection-- an
eclipsed conformation, as a

264
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,270
Newman Projection.

265
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:32,910
Instead of directly eclipsing
that last, that back hydrogen,

266
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,720
they'll put it to the right a
little, or they'll push it off

267
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,500
a little bit.

268
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,010
So that's that hydrogen.

269
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,450
That magenta hydrogen
is right there.

270
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:42,790
It's really right behind the
front one, but this is just so

271
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,590
you can actually see
that it's there.

272
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:47,210
And then finally you have this
blue one down there.

273
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:51,590
So that blue one is going
to be right over here.

274
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:57,690
So this is the eclipsed
conformation as a Newman

275
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,940
Projection.

276
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:03,430
   

277
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,290
And as you can see,
it's eclipsed.

278
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,280
The back hydrogens are eclipsed
by the front ones.

279
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,700
If I were to draw it perfectly,
they would be

280
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,700
right behind it.

281
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,510
Now there's one other piece of,
I guess one more idea, I

282
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:16,250
want to introduce you to, and
that's the notion of the angle

283
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,040
between the different
hydrogens.

284
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,690
So if you wanted to say, well,
what is this angle?

285
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:24,690
What is this angle between the
blue hydrogen and this pink

286
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,770
hydrogen right here?

287
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,720
Now, when you actually think
of it in three dimensions,

288
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,340
it's like, wow, you can't really
say the angle over here

289
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,350
between blue and the pink.

290
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,840
But on a Newman Projection, when
you're just saying how

291
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,560
much are they rotated away from
each other, this angle

292
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,130
right here is called
a dihedral angle.

293
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:43,490
   

294
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,200
Sometimes it's just said, you
know, this hydrogen relative

295
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,160
to that hydrogen has a DA of,
in this case, 60 degrees.

296
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,120
In this case, this hydrogen
relative to that hydrogen has

297
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,970
a dihedral angle of
zero degrees.

298
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:57,740
And it's a way of saying,
how staggered, or how

299
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,920
eclipsed, you are.

300
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,990
Now, one last thing I touched on
the idea, so again, why do

301
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,250
we even care?

302
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,230
Well, all of these hydrogens
have electron clouds around

303
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,650
them, and all of these
bonds have electron

304
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:07,270
clouds around them.

305
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,960
And electron clouds, they're all
negative, so they want to

306
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,140
get as far away from each
other as possible.

307
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,580
And they're all stable now,
because they've bonded in ways

308
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,090
that they have nice
stable structures.

309
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,890
Everyone feels like they
have full valence

310
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,820
shells, full orbitals.

311
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,100
And so the electron
clouds want to get

312
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,440
away from each other.

313
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,560
Now in this situation, in the
eclipsed conformation, this

314
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,190
hydrogen and this hydrogen--
let me do it in-- this

315
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:40,050
hydrogen and this hydrogen are
closer to each other than when

316
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,680
you go to the staggered
conformation.

317
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,070
The staggered conformation, the
closest hydrogen to this

318
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:47,960
guy is going to be either that
hydrogen or that hydrogen.

319
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,300
But they're both further away
than this hydrogen was in the

320
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,720
eclipsed conformation.

321
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,060
So in general, the staggered
conformation is going to be

322
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,020
more stable.

323
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,920
It's going to have a lower
potential energy.

324
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,990
You can imagine that if you
start with an eclipsed

325
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,910
conformation, these guys are all
going to want to get away

326
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,010
from each other.

327
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,900
So it's kind of like this is
the wound conformation.

328
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,300
It has higher potential
energy.

329
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,300
So it'll want to unwind and
it'll want to unwind to a

330
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,580
staggered conformation, because
in this conformation,

331
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,640
all of the hydrogens
have gotten as far

332
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,890
away from each other.

333
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,133
