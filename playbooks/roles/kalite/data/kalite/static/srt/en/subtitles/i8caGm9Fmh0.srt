1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,000
   

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,010
When you use a remote control to change channels on

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:12,020
your TV, your remote is using light waves. But this light is beyond

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,030
the visible spectrum of light you can see. Back in 1800,

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,040
William Herschel conducted an experiment measuring the temperature changes

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,050
between the colors of the spectrum, plus one measurement beyond visible red.

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,060
When that thermometer registered a temperature warmer than all the other colors,

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,070
Herschel had discovered another region of the electromagnetic spectrum, infrared light.

9
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:36,080
This region consists of

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,090
short wavelengths around 760 nanometers to longer wavelengths

11
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,100
about 1 million nanometers, or about a thousand micrometers, in length.

12
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,110
We can sense some of this infrared energy as heat.

13
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:52,120
Some objects are so hot they also emit visible light,

14
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,130
such as a fire. Other objects such as humans,

15
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:00,140
are not as hot and only emit infrared waves.

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,150
We cannot see these infrared waves with our eyes alone. However

17
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,160
instruments that can sense infrared energy, such as night vision goggles

18
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,170
or infrared cameras, allow us to 'see' these infrared waves from

19
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:16,180
warm objects like humans and animals. Infrared energy

20
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,200
can also reveal objects in the Universe that cannot be seen with optical

21
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,210
telescopes. Infrared waves have longer wavelengths than visible

22
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:28,230
light and can pass through dense regions of gas and dust with lower

23
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,240
scattering and absorption. When you look up at the constellation Orion,

24
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,250
you see only the visible light. But NASA's Spitzer

25
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,260
telescope was able to detect nearly 2,300 planet-forming discs

26
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,280
in the Orion nebula by sensing the infrared glow of their warm dust.

27
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,290
Each disc has the potential to form planets and its own solar system.

28
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:52,310
Incoming ultraviolet, visible,

29
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:56,320
and a limited portion of infrared energy, together sometimes called

30
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,330
"shortwave radiation", from the sun drives our Earth system.

31
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:04,350
Some of this radiation is reflected off of clouds and some is

32
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:08,360
absorbed in the atmosphere. Larger aerosol particles in the atmosphere

33
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,380
interact with and absorb some of the radiation causing the atmosphere

34
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,390
to warm. The heat generated by this absorption is emitted

35
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,410
as long-wave infrared radiation, some of which radiates out to space.

36
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,420
The solar radiation that does pass through Earth's atmosphere

37
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,440
is either reflected off snow, ice or other surfaces

38
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:32,450
or is absorbed by the Earth's surface. This absorption of radiation

39
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:36,470
warms the Earth's surface and this heat is emitted as long-wave

40
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,480
radiation into the atmosphere which allows only a small amount to radiate

41
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,490
out to space. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,

42
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:48,500
such as water vapor and carbon dioxide, absorb most of this

43
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,520
emitted long-wave infrared radiation, and this absorption heats

44
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,530
the lower atmosphere. In turn, the warmed atmosphere emits

45
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,550
long-wave radiation, some of which radiates towards the Earth's surface

46
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:04,560
keeping our planet warm and generally comfortable.

47
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,570
The energy entering, energy reflected, energy absorbed, and energy

48
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,580
emitted by the Earth system constitutes the components of the

49
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,600
Earth Radiation Budget. A budget that's out of balance can cause the temperature of the

50
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,610
atmosphere to increase and eventually affect our climate.

51
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,630
For scientists to understand climate, they must also determine what

52
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,640
drives the changes within the Earth's radiation budget.

53
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,650
The CERES instrument aboard NASA's Aqua and Terra satellites can

54
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,670
measure the reflected shortwave and emitted long-wave radiation into space

55
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,680
accurately enough for scientists to determine the Earth's total radiation budget.

56
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,700
Other NASA instruments monitor the changes in other aspects

57
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,710
of the Earth's climate system, such as clouds, aerosol particles,

58
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,720
or surface reflectivity, and scientists are examining their many

59
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,730
interactons with the energy budget. A portion of solar radiation

60
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,750
from the Sun that is just beyond the visible spectrum is referred to

61
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:04,770
as near-infrared. Scientists can study how this radiation

62
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,780
reflects off the Earth's surface to understand changes in land cover

63
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,800
such as growth of cities or changes in vegetation. Our eyes

64
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,850
perceive a leaf as green because wavelengths in the green region

65
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,899
of the visible light spectrum are reflected while other visible wavelengths

66
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,940
are absorbed. Yet, the chlorophyll and the cell structure of the

67
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,990
leaf are also reflecting near-infrared light, light we cannot see.

68
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:33,080
This reflected near-infrared radiation can be

69
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,120
sensed by satellites, allowing scientists to study vegetation from space.

70
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,160
Using these data, scientists can identify some

71
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,210
types of trees, can examine the health of forests, and can even

72
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:49,260
monitor the health of vegetation such as forests infested with pine beetles

73
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,320
or crops affected by drought. Studying the emission and

74
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,330
reflection of infrared waves helps us to understand the Earth's system

75
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,340
and its energy budget. Near-infrared data can also help scientists

76
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,340
study land cover such as changes in snow, ice,

77
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,350
forests, urbanization, and agriculture.

78
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,370
Scientists are beginning to unlock the mysteries of cooler objects across

79
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:17,410
the Universe such as planets, cool stars, nebulae,

80
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,980
and much more using infrared waves.
