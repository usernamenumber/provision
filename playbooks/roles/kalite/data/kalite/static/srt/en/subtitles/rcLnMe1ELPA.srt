1
00:00:01,184 --> 00:00:03,981
In the last video I hinted that things were about to get wacky,

2
00:00:03,981 --> 00:00:08,707
and they are! So if we start where we left off in the last video,

3
00:00:08,707 --> 00:00:10,937
we started right over here, looking at the distance

4
00:00:10,937 --> 00:00:13,677
to the nearest star and, just a reminder

5
00:00:15,976 --> 00:00:18,259
in this drawing right here this depiction right here this circle right here

6
00:00:18,274 --> 00:00:22,639
this solar system circle, its not the size of the sun, its not the size

7
00:00:25,634 --> 00:00:28,630
of the orbits of the Earth or Pluto or the Kuiper belt this is close

8
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:34,203
to the size of the Oort cloud. The actual orbit of earth is

9
00:00:34,203 --> 00:00:37,686
about one, well the diameter of the orbit of earth is about one

10
00:00:37,686 --> 00:00:42,051
fifty thousandth of this so you wouldn't even see it on this. it wouldn't even make

11
00:00:42,051 --> 00:00:47,299
up a pixel on this screen right here, much less the actual size

12
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:48,467
of the sun or something much smaller.

13
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:53,383
And just remember that orbit of the earth that was at a huge distance. It takes

14
00:00:53,383 --> 00:00:59,048
8 mins for light to get from the sun to the earth. It's a super long distance.

15
00:00:59,048 --> 00:01:05,133
If you shot a bullet at the sun from earth, it would take you 17 years to get to the sun.

16
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:09,544
So this huge distance wouldnt even show up on this picture.

17
00:01:09,544 --> 00:01:14,048
Now what we saw in the last video is that if you travel at unimaginably fast speeds,

18
00:01:14,048 --> 00:01:21,711
if you travel at 60,000 km/h, and I picked that speed 'cause that's how fast

19
00:01:21,711 --> 00:01:24,219
Voyager 1 actually is travelling

20
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:27,702
that's one of the fastest, I think one of the fastest objects we have

21
00:01:27,702 --> 00:01:31,278
out there in space, right here, and is actually kind of leaving the solar system

22
00:01:31,278 --> 00:01:35,271
as we speak. But even if you were able to get that fast,

23
00:01:35,271 --> 00:01:44,049
it would still take 80,000 years, 75 or 80,000 years to travel the

24
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:48,971
4.2 light years to the Alpha Centauri cluster of stars. To the nearest star,

25
00:01:48,971 --> 00:01:54,219
it would take 80,000 years, 80,000 years.

26
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:58,677
And that scale of time is already an amount of time I have trouble comprehending

27
00:01:58,677 --> 00:02:04,621
You can imagine all of modern civilization has occured definitely in the last 10,000 yrs

28
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:08,383
but most of recorded history is in the last 4 or 5000 years.

29
00:02:08,383 --> 00:02:12,609
So this is 80,000 years to travel to the nearest star.

30
00:02:12,609 --> 00:02:13,677
So its a huge distance.

31
00:02:13,677 --> 00:02:16,046
Another way to think about it, is that if the sun

32
00:02:16,046 --> 00:02:22,965
were the size of a basketball and you put that basketball in London,

33
00:02:22,965 --> 00:02:26,866
if you wanted to do it in scale, the next closest star which is actually a smaller

34
00:02:26,866 --> 00:02:33,368
basketball right over here, Proxima Centauri, that smaller basketball you'd have to put

35
00:02:33,368 --> 00:02:39,067
in Kiev, Ukraine. in order to have a similiar scale.

36
00:02:39,067 --> 00:02:41,959
So these are basketballs, sitting in these cities and you would have

37
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:44,374
to travel about 1200 miles

38
00:02:44,374 --> 00:02:49,390
to place the next basketball. and these basketballs are representing these super huge things

39
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,873
that we saw in the first video, the Sun. If you actually made the earth

40
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:56,030
relative to these basketballs, these would be little grains of sand

41
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,733
so if there are any little small planets over here they would have to be grains

42
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:05,272
of sand in Kiev, Ukraine versus the grain of sand in London.

43
00:03:05,272 --> 00:03:10,705
So this is a massive, massive distance. Already, at least in my mind, unimaginable. And when it gets

44
00:03:10,705 --> 00:03:14,606
really whacky is when you start realising that this, even this, is a super

45
00:03:14,606 --> 00:03:19,018
super small distance relative to the galactic scale.

46
00:03:19,018 --> 00:03:23,709
So this whole depiction of kind of our neighborhood of stars this thing over here

47
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:32,346
is about, give or take, and we're doing rough estimates right here

48
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:40,381
its about 30 light years. I'll just do LY for short. So thats abt 30 LY

49
00:03:40,381 --> 00:03:45,350
Now and once again you cannot actually, you can take pictures of our galaxy

50
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,018
from our point of view but you actually can't take a picture of the whole galaxy from above it.

51
00:03:49,018 --> 00:03:52,687
So these are going to be artist depictions, but if this is 30 LY

52
00:03:52,687 --> 00:03:58,028
This drawing right here of kind of our local neighborhood of the galxy

53
00:03:58,028 --> 00:04:03,693
this right here is roughly, these are all approximations, this is about

54
00:04:03,693 --> 00:04:13,353
let me do this in a darker color, this about 1 thousand LY

55
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:17,718
and this is the 1000 LY of our suns neighborhood if you can even call it a neighborhood

56
00:04:17,718 --> 00:04:21,619
even this isn't really a neighborhoood if it takes you 80,000 yrs to get to your nearest neighbor

57
00:04:21,619 --> 00:04:26,031
but this whole drawing over here it would take forever to get anywhere over here

58
00:04:26,031 --> 00:04:32,733
it would be 1/30th of this so it would be about that big

59
00:04:32,733 --> 00:04:36,016
this whole drawing and what's really going to blow your mind is

60
00:04:36,016 --> 00:04:40,288
this would be roughly a little bit more than a pixel on this drawing right here

61
00:04:40,288 --> 00:04:44,282
that spans a 1000 LY but then when you start to really put it into

62
00:04:44,282 --> 00:04:48,879
perspective so new lets zoom out a little bit. So this drawing right here

63
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:55,381
this 1000 LY is now this 1000 LY over here. so this is our local vicinity of the sun

64
00:04:55,381 --> 00:04:59,375
and once again the word local is used in a very liberal way

65
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,675
at this point

66
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,369
so this right here is a 1000 ly

67
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:11,681
if your sitting here and your looking at an object that is sitting (let me do this in a darker color)

68
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:14,700
if we're sitting here on earth and we're looking at an object sitting here

69
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:20,366
that's 500 LY away we're looking at it as it was 500 years ago

70
00:05:20,366 --> 00:05:25,706
becasue the light that is reaching our eyeballs right now or our telescopes

71
00:05:25,706 --> 00:05:33,044
right now left this guy over here 500 yrs ago. in fact he's not even going to be there anymore

72
00:05:33,044 --> 00:05:37,363
he'll probably have moved around a little bit. So just even on this scale, we're alredy

73
00:05:37,363 --> 00:05:41,357
talking abt these unimaginably huge distances and then when we zoom out

74
00:05:41,357 --> 00:05:47,208
this is kind of like our local part of the galaxy over here. This piece right here

75
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:51,016
this is called the Orion Spur and people are still trying to work out

76
00:05:51,016 --> 00:05:58,354
exactly what the actual details of the actual shape of the milky way galaxy is

77
00:05:58,354 --> 00:06:03,044
the galaxy that we're in but we're pretty sure we have these spiral arms

78
00:06:03,044 --> 00:06:06,620
and we have these spurs off of them, but its actually very hard to come up with the actual shape

79
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,614
especally because you can't see a lot of the galaxy because it's kinda on the other side,

80
00:06:10,614 --> 00:06:12,378
on the other side of the centre

81
00:06:12,378 --> 00:06:16,883
but really just to get a sense, I mean at least it blows my mind if you really

82
00:06:19,508 --> 00:06:22,133
think about what it saying these unbeleivable distances show up as a lil dot here

83
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:26,635
this whole drawing shows up as a dot here. now when we zoom out over here

84
00:06:26,635 --> 00:06:28,632
that dot would no longer even show up

85
00:06:28,632 --> 00:06:32,208
it wouldn't even register a pixel on this drawing right over here

86
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:36,341
and then this drawing this whole thing right over here

87
00:06:36,341 --> 00:06:47,067
this whole pic is this grid is this grid right over here it is this right over here

88
00:06:47,067 --> 00:06:52,967
so hopefully that gives you a sense of how small even our local neighborhood

89
00:06:52,967 --> 00:06:55,939
is relative to THE galaxy as a whole

90
00:06:55,939 --> 00:07:00,629
the galaxy as a whole just to give you a sense has 200,

91
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:05,273
200-400 billion stars

92
00:07:05,273 --> 00:07:11,357
or maybe i should say solar systems just to give you a sense that you know

93
00:07:11,357 --> 00:07:13,029
when we saw the solar system its not just the sun

94
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:17,719
its all this neat dynamic stuff in there, planets and asteroids

95
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:22,549
and solar winds and so there's 200 to 400 billion stars

96
00:07:22,549 --> 00:07:27,425
and for the most part 200 to 400 billion solar systems so its and

97
00:07:27,425 --> 00:07:35,000
unimaginably complex or huge place

98
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,221
and just to make it clear you know even when we zoom into this pic right here

99
00:07:39,221 --> 00:07:44,376
and i think its obvious based on this that these lil white pockets right here

100
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:48,695
these aren't this isn't one star this isn't two stars these are thousands of stars

101
00:07:48,695 --> 00:07:49,949
here so when you go over here

102
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:54,546
each little blotch of white that you see that's not a star that's not a thousand stars

103
00:07:54,546 --> 00:07:59,376
we're starting to talk in the millions of stars when you look at certain blotches here and there

104
00:07:59,376 --> 00:08:02,023
i mean it maybe one star that closer to you or it might be a million

105
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,949
stars that are far apart and that are just relatively close

106
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:08,014
together and eveything has to be used in kind of

107
00:08:08,014 --> 00:08:11,218
loose terms here. And we'll talk more about other galaxies

108
00:08:11,218 --> 00:08:14,051
but even this isn't the upper bound of galaxies

109
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:17,209
people believe the Andromeda Galaxy has a trillion stars in it

110
00:08:17,209 --> 00:08:19,345
a trillion sources and we're talking about these huge

111
00:08:19,345 --> 00:08:22,549
huge immense distances and so just to give you a sense

112
00:08:22,549 --> 00:08:27,286
of where we fit in the picture this is a rough location of our sun

113
00:08:27,286 --> 00:08:29,376
and remember that lil dot i drew just now

114
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:32,952
is including millions of stars, millions of solar systems

115
00:08:32,952 --> 00:08:37,039
already unimaginable distances but if you really wanna get the sense

116
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,033
relative to the whole galaxy, this is an artist's depiction

117
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:44,701
once again we could never obviously get this perspective on the galaxy

118
00:08:44,701 --> 00:08:46,048
it would take forever to travel this far

119
00:08:46,048 --> 00:08:49,624
so that you could see the galaxy from above but this is our best guess

120
00:08:49,624 --> 00:08:53,432
looking at things from our vantage point we actually could never even see

121
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:56,358
we actually can't even see this whole area over here

122
00:08:56,358 --> 00:09:00,026
'cause it's on the other side of the centre of the galaxy which is super super

123
00:09:00,026 --> 00:09:03,695
dense and super bright and so its very hard to see things on the other side

124
00:09:03,695 --> 00:09:09,036
we think or actually there's a super massive black hole at the centre of the galaxy

125
00:09:09,036 --> 00:09:12,426
and we think that they're at the centre of all or most galaxies

126
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:15,352
but you know the whole pint of this video or actually this whole series of videos

127
00:09:15,352 --> 00:09:22,133
is just to put you in awe a lil bit of just how huge this is

128
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:27,008
'cause when you think about the scales it's just, i dunno no, words can reallly describe it

129
00:09:27,008 --> 00:09:39,640
but just to give you sense we're about 25000LY from the centre of

130
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,887
the galaxy so even when we look at things at the centre of the galaxy that's how they

131
00:09:44,887 --> 00:09:47,117
were 25000 yrs ago

132
00:09:47,117 --> 00:09:51,621
it took 25000 yrs for that light to get to us, I mean when that light left the centre

133
00:09:51,621 --> 00:09:55,104
of the galaxy I won't even guess to think what

134
00:09:55,104 --> 00:09:58,680
humanity was like at that point in time

135
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,349
so its these huge distances and the whole galaxy of here

136
00:10:02,349 --> 00:10:06,621
and like solar systems its hard to say the edge of the galaxy

137
00:10:06,621 --> 00:10:10,104
'cause there's always gonna be a few more stars and other things orbiting

138
00:10:10,104 --> 00:10:13,030
around the galaxy as you go further and further out but the main

139
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:23,340
density the main disc is about 100,000LY

140
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:28,959
is the diameter roughly of the main part of the galaxy and it's about a 1000 LY thick

141
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,699
so you kind of imagine it as a disc its fairly flat

142
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:40,733
but its a 1000 LY thick! It's a 1000 LY thick you would have to do this distance

143
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:45,956
250 times just to go from the top part of the galaxy to the bottom part

144
00:10:45,956 --> 00:10:47,721
much less going across the galxy

145
00:10:47,721 --> 00:10:51,204
so it might sem relatively flat but it's still immensely

146
00:10:51,204 --> 00:10:55,012
immensely thick. and just as another way to visualise it

147
00:10:55,012 --> 00:10:58,355
if this thing right over here that includes the Oort cloud

148
00:10:58,355 --> 00:11:06,622
roughly a LY in diameter it is a grain of sand

149
00:11:06,622 --> 00:11:10,105
a mm in diameter grain of sand

150
00:11:10,105 --> 00:11:14,284
then the universe as a whole is gonna be the diameter of a football field

151
00:11:14,284 --> 00:11:19,764
and those are two tractable things, i can imagine a grain of sand

152
00:11:19,764 --> 00:11:25,337
a mm wide grain of sand in a football field. but remember that's a grain sand

153
00:11:25,337 --> 00:11:34,950
that grain of sand is still 50 or 60, 000 times the diameter of the Earth's orbit

154
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:39,467
and it would still take a bullet or something travelling as fast as a jet plane

155
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:46,003
15 hrs to just go half of that or sorry 15 yrs or 17 yrs I forgot

156
00:11:46,003 --> 00:11:51,297
the exact number but you knpw 15, 16 , 17 yrs to even cover half of that distance

157
00:11:51,297 --> 00:11:56,777
30 yrs to cover an entire diamtere, so 30 yrs to cover the entire diameter

158
00:11:56,777 --> 00:12:03,696
of earths orbit tahts one 60,000th of our lil grain of sand in the football field

159
00:12:03,696 --> 00:12:12,381
and just to kind of really i dunno have an appreciation for how amaz- i dunno how mind blowing this

160
00:12:12,381 --> 00:12:15,956
really is , this is a picture of the milky way galaxy, our galaxy

161
00:12:15,956 --> 00:12:20,043
from our vantage point as you can see we're in the galaxy so we're

162
00:12:20,043 --> 00:12:22,087
seeing and this is looking towards the centre and

163
00:12:22,087 --> 00:12:25,755
even this picture you start to appreciate the complexity of what a 100

164
00:12:25,755 --> 00:12:31,003
billion stars are but what i really wanna point out is that even in this pic

165
00:12:31,003 --> 00:12:33,789
when yu're looking at some of these things that are like stars

166
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:39,037
those arent stars! those are thousands of stars or millions of stars

167
00:12:39,037 --> 00:12:41,777
maybe it could be one star closer up but when we're startin

168
00:12:41,777 --> 00:12:43,449
to approach the centre of the galaxy these are thousands

169
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:46,793
and thousands and millions of stars or solar systems

170
00:12:46,793 --> 00:12:49,765
that we're actually looking at so its really, it starts to

171
00:12:49,765 --> 99:59:59,999
boggle the mind to imagine what might actually be going on over there.
