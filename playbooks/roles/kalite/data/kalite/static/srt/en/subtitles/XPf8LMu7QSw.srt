1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
   

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,510
Solve the system of equations
by substitution.

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,300
Check your solution by graphing
the equation.

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,500
Let's do it by substitution.

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,890
We know that y is equal to this
thing over here, and we

6
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,270
also know that y is equal
to this thing over here.

7
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,270
So they're going to intersect
when they both equal the same

8
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,410
y, or when this thing is equal
to this thing, or when

9
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:29,540
negative x squared is equal to
2x squared plus 3x minus 6.

10
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,915
The x value, which these two are
equal, is going to be the

11
00:00:32,915 --> 00:00:35,610
x values where these y's are
equal, so that's going to be

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,480
their point of intersection.

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,900
That will be an x and y
pair that satisfies

14
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,070
both of these equations.

15
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,600
Let's solve for x here.

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,270
A good starting point-- let's
just add x squared to both

17
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:55,990
sides, and we end up with
0 is equal to 3x squared

18
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:00,010
plus 3x minus 6.

19
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,520
Then, just to simplify this on
the right hand side, we could

20
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,030
divide both sides of the
equation by 3-- we can divide

21
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,150
everything by 3-- and we're
left with 0 is equal to x

22
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:16,500
squared plus x minus 2.

23
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,810
We could do the quadratic
equation, or complete the

24
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,840
square, or all sorts of crazy
things, but this is actually

25
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,460
very factorable-- 0 is equal
to two numbers, which are 2

26
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,590
and negative 1.

27
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,270
When you multiply them, you get
negative 2, and when you

28
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,130
add them, you get positive 1.

29
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,500
So this is x plus 2
times x minus 1.

30
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,430
That tells us that x plus 2 is
equal to 0, or x minus 1 could

31
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,420
be equal to 0.

32
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,100
Subtract 2 from both
sides of this.

33
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,210
You could get x is equal
to negative 2.

34
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:53,890
Or add 1 to both sides of
this, x is equal to 1.

35
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:58,290
These are our two solutions-- x
is equal to negative 2 or x

36
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,350
is equal to 1.

37
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,540
Let's verify it.

38
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,750
When I put x is equal to
negative 2-- let's do it over

39
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,670
here-- what do I get?

40
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,020
Negative 2 squared
is positive 4.

41
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,160
And then you put a negative
there, so it's negative 4--

42
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,520
the point here is negative
2, and then negative 4.

43
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,540
That's what happens when you
put negative 2 there.

44
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,060
And then what happens
when I put 1?

45
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,370
1 squared is 1, and then if you
put a negative there, it's

46
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,110
negative 1.

47
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,630
So it's 1, negative 1.

48
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,200
And so these are both points on
this equation right here,

49
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,600
on this function.

50
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,610
If you look at this one over
here, if you put negative 2

51
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,080
over here-- 2 times negative
2 squared.

52
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,660
Negative 2 squared
is positive 4.

53
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,140
2 times positive 4 is 8.

54
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,535
3 times negative 2 is negative
6, so 8 minus 6.

55
00:02:44,535 --> 00:02:47,470
   

56
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:52,010
8 minus 6 is 2, and 2 minus
6 is equal to negative 4.

57
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:57,910
The point negative 2, negative
4 is on this function.

58
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,460
They both share that
point in common, so

59
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,980
they intersect there.

60
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:07,400
If I put 1 into this, I
get 2 plus 3 minus 6.

61
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,280
2 plus 3 is 5, minus 6, when x
is 1, which is negative 1.

62
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,600
The point 1, negative 1 is
also on this top graph.

63
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,670
We can plot these points:
negative 2 comma negative 4.

64
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:23,745
Negative 2-- 1, 2, 3,
4-- is right there.

65
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,010
That's going to be a point
of intersection.

66
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,770
Then we have the point
1, negative 1.

67
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:33,330
1, negative 1 is also going
to be a point of

68
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,160
intersection there.

69
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,550
Let's graph this second one and
just verify-- they say,

70
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,530
check your solution by graphing
the equation.

71
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,530
Let's graph the first one.

72
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,770
This is pretty easy to
graph-- y is equal

73
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,430
to negative x squared.

74
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:49,140
It's going to intersect
the point 0, 0.

75
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,910
It's going to be a
downward slope,

76
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,730
downward opening parabola.

77
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:57,390
   

78
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,390
When x is positive or negative
1, y is going to be negative

79
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,660
1, because you square them and
then you take the negative.

80
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,820
When x is positive or negative
2, y is going

81
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,030
to be negative 4.

82
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,690
So the graph will look
something like this--

83
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,720
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

84
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,800
The graph will look something
like that.

85
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,700
That is that equation
right here.

86
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:25,100
This is going to be an upward
opening parabola, and a quick

87
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,920
way-- we could do all of that
completing the square, but if

88
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,250
you think about it, let's just
apply the quadratic equation

89
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:32,820
right here.

90
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,140
I want to show you something,
a quick way of where the

91
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,120
vertex formula comes
from when you apply

92
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,190
the quadratic formula.

93
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,900
If you take this, and you wanted
to find its zeros, you

94
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:46,380
would say x is equal to negative
b-- which is negative

95
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:52,250
3-- plus or minus the square
root of b squared-- which is

96
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,530
9-- minus 4ac.

97
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,000
Minus 4 times 2 times
negative 6.

98
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,510
   

99
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:07,780
All of that over 2 times
a, or 2 times 2.

100
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,470
   

101
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,260
Now, we can evaluate this and
figure out the zeros of this,

102
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,550
but the real point why I wanted
to show you this is

103
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,780
because we always have
two solutions.

104
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,570
Let me actually write
down the quadratic

105
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,220
formula here for you.

106
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,110
The quadratic formula is
negative b plus or minus the

107
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:30,150
square root of b squared
minus 4ac over 2a.

108
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:34,050
You always end up-- or if this
is a positive number-- with

109
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,360
two solutions, and they're
equal distant.

110
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,990
They're this far away, this far
over 2a away from negative

111
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:45,620
b over 2a-- we could write this
as negative b over 2a

112
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,380
plus or minus the square
root of b squared

113
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,210
minus 4ac over 2a.

114
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:55,430
You have at most two solutions
that are equal distant from

115
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,380
this x value right here.

116
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,520
We've seen in multiple videos:
what is that point that is

117
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,310
equidistant from the
two solutions,

118
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,400
that is right in between?

119
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,170
That's going to be the line of
symmetry, or the x value of

120
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,300
the vertex.

121
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,320
This is where the x value of the
vertex formula comes from:

122
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:16,720
x val of vertex is negative
b over 2a.

123
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,500
If we wanted to find the vertex,
the x value of this

124
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,800
guy right here, we just take
negative b-- which is negative

125
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:27,200
3-- over 2 times a, 2
times 2, which is 4.

126
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,770
So, x is equal to negative
3/4 is the

127
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,480
vertex of this parabola.

128
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,130
And when x is equal to negative
3/4, what is y?

129
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,990
We could actually-- that's a
little bit more complicated

130
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,090
right here, but I'll
just go through it.

131
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:51,310
It's going to be 2 times
9 over 16 minus 9

132
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,300
over 4 minus 6.

133
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,540
Let me actually get the
calculator out for this one.

134
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,850
It's going to be 18 over 60.

135
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,240
Let me just get the calculator
out, because it will be

136
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,130
simpler, and I don't want
to waste your time doing

137
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,380
arithmetic.

138
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,020
   

139
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:23,530
It's going to be 18 divided by
16 minus 9 divided by 4 minus

140
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:29,300
6 is equal to negative 7.125.

141
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,110
This is equal to
negative 7.125.

142
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,220
So the vertex occurs when x is
negative 3/4-- when x is right

143
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:42,190
there-- and y is negative 7.

144
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:50,170
This is essentially 7 1/8, so
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.125.

145
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,980
So it's a little over 7.

146
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:58,240
The vertex of this top graph
is right over there.

147
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,630
It's symmetric around
the vertex.

148
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:02,250
   

149
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,610
That is the line of symmetry,
and so this top graph is going

150
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,920
to look something like this.

151
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:11,150
   

152
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,100
Just like that and we're done.

153
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,160
We've found our two points of
intersection, right over there

154
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,870
