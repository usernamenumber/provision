1
00:00:00,767 --> 00:00:03,133
[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,067
&gt;&gt;: WE'RE LOOKING AT A SCULPTURE
THAT IN MANY WAYS DOESN'T REALLY

3
00:00:09,067 --> 00:00:10,533
SEEM TO BE --

4
00:00:10,533 --> 00:00:11,367
&gt;&gt;: -- A SCULPTURE.

5
00:00:11,367 --> 00:00:12,133
&gt;&gt;: RIGHT.

6
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:13,333
&gt;&gt;: IT'S NOT FREE-STANDING.

7
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:13,967
&gt;&gt;: IT'S NOT.

8
00:00:13,967 --> 00:00:15,900
IT'S MORE LIKE A RELIEF, BUT --

9
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,400
&gt;&gt;: -- IT'S NOT REALLY A RELIEF.

10
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,500
&gt;&gt;: NOT REALLY, BECAUSE THERE IS
NO BACKGROUND THAT IT IS

11
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,333
ATTACHED TO.

12
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:23,567
&gt;&gt;: AND THEY'RE ISOLATED UNITS
ALL THE SAME.

13
00:00:23,567 --> 00:00:24,500
&gt;&gt;: THAT'S RIGHT.

14
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,833
THIS IS A WORK BY DONALD JUDD,
AND IT'S A PIECE OF MINIMALIST

15
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,267
SCULPTURE.

16
00:00:29,267 --> 00:00:32,900
AND IT WAS DONE IN 1969, AND
IT'S AN UNTITLED WORK.

17
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,933
HE WOULD HAVE HAD THE EXACT SAME
FORM REPLICATED OVER AND OVER

18
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:38,733
AGAIN.

19
00:00:38,733 --> 00:00:43,833
SO EACH ONE OF THOSE BOXES THAT
YOU SEE THERE WERE NOT MADE BY

20
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:47,600
HIM AND IT WAS ALSO MADE IN A
FACTORY.

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,133
SO IT HAS A KIND OF MACHINEMADE
AESTHETIC TO IT.

22
00:00:51,133 --> 00:00:54,100
&gt;&gt;: SOMEHOW IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE
IT IS MADE TO SORT OF INTERACT

23
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,100
IN THE SPACE OF THE GALLERY.

24
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:56,733
&gt;&gt;: ABSOLUTELY.

25
00:00:56,733 --> 00:00:59,767
IN FACT HE IS VERY SPECIFIC IN
GIVING INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO

26
00:00:59,767 --> 00:01:02,400
HANG THIS, YOU KNOW, HOW TO
ATTACH IT TO THE WALL, THAT EACH

27
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:08,267
ONE IS TO BE SPACED SIX INCHES
APART, AND USUALLY THE WORK IS

28
00:01:08,267 --> 00:01:11,767
SUPPOSED TO GO, THE FIRST TIME
IT WAS MADE, IT WAS SUPPOSED TO

29
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:14,400
BE EVENLY SPACED ALL THE WAY UP
TO THE CEILING.

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,233
SO IT WOULD BE SOMEWHAT DICTATED
BY --

31
00:01:17,233 --> 00:01:18,133
&gt;&gt;: -- BY THE HEIGHT.

32
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:20,167
&gt;&gt;: -- BY THE NORMAL HEIGHT OF
THE CEILING.

33
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:22,000
OF COURSE THAT WOULD CHANGE
DEPENDING ON WHAT SPACE.

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,833
&gt;&gt;: BUT THIS ONE DOESN'T DO
THAT.

35
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:24,633
&gt;&gt;: RIGHT.

36
00:01:24,633 --> 00:01:25,667
I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE
PHOTOGRAPH WE ARE LOOKING AT

37
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:26,800
PARTICULARLY.

38
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,667
&gt;&gt;: AND IT IS MADE OF SOMETHING
THAT HAS A REFLECTIVE SURFACE.

39
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:30,933
&gt;&gt;: HIGH SHEEN TO IT.

40
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:34,933
THE OUTSIDE OF IT IS BRASS AND
THEN THE -- IT'S DIFFICULT TO

41
00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:40,033
SEE HERE, BUT THERE ARE PLEXI
KIND OF WINDOWS THAT ARE THE

42
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,900
TOPS OF EACH ONE OF THESE BOXES.

43
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,833
SO YOU CAN SEE THROUGH IT AND
SOMETIMES DEPENDING ON WHICH

44
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:48,667
PIECE IT IS, THEY'RE INTENSELY
COLORED LIKE PINK, OR KIND OF A

45
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:50,567
YELLOWISH COLOR OR TRANSLUCENCY.

46
00:01:50,567 --> 00:01:53,500
SO IT CREATES, IT INTERACTS WITH
THE SPACE AND CREATES A KIND OF

47
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,900
A SHADOW AND COLORISTIC EFFECT
ON THE WALL, THE BLANK WALL OF

48
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,033
THE GALLERY.

49
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:01,833
&gt;&gt;: SO SHOULD WE BE THINKING
BACK HERE TO SCULPTURES MADE OF

50
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,233
BRONZE?

51
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:06,467
&gt;&gt;: I THINK SO, BUT ALSO THE
NEGATION OF THAT.

52
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:08,833
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT JUDD AND
OTHER MINIMALISTS ARE TRYING TO

53
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,833
DO ARE TO BE OF THEIR TIME.

54
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,067
SO THERE THE WHOLE
TRADITION THAT

55
00:02:12,067 --> 00:02:14,967
HE IS CONTINUING OF MODERN ART,
YOU KNOW, WHERE YOU CHOOSE THE

56
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:18,667
MATERIALS AND THE THEMES OF YOUR
OWN TIME, AND HERE TO CHOOSE

57
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:23,300
SOMETHING THAT IS BRASS WHICH
CAN BE USED IN OLDER ART, BUT TO

58
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,767
MAKE IT LOOK LIKE IT'S SHEET
METAL, SOMETHING THAT COMES OUT

59
00:02:25,767 --> 00:02:28,700
OF A FACTORY, AND IN FACT IS NOT
MADE BY HIM BUT MADE BY OTHER

60
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,333
WORKERS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

61
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:35,633
&gt;&gt;: SO IT SPEAKS TO OUR FACTORY
INDUSTRIAL CULTURE.

62
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:37,133
&gt;&gt;: EXACTLY, AND IT IS WHAT IT
IS.

63
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:38,567
IT DOESN'T DISGUISE ITSELF.

64
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:41,267
HE IS VERY EXPLICIT ABOUT NOT
TRYING TO MAKE ILLUSIONISTIC

65
00:02:41,267 --> 00:02:42,767
ART.

66
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:45,267
SO HE DOESN'T WANT TO MAKE A
SCULPTURE LOOK LIKE A PERSON OR

67
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:47,433
A SPACE THAT ISN'T THERE.

68
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:50,233
AND SO THERE ARE CLEARLY BOXES
AND THE PLEXI ALLOWS YOU TO SEE

69
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:52,467
THAT THEY ARE NOT SOLID.

70
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:56,467
SO THERE'S A CLARITY AND A
LITERAL QUALITY THAT HE WANTS TO

71
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,567
BRING OUT.

72
00:02:57,567 --> 00:03:01,133
&gt;&gt;: AND IT ALSO REMINDS ME OF A
SKYSCRAPER, OTHER KINDS OF

73
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:03,100
MODERNIST FORMS.

74
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,900
&gt;&gt;: RIGHT.

75
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,200
IT DOES EVOKE THAT AND JUST THE
SHEER REPLICATION OF THE SAME

76
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,033
FORM OVER AND OVER AGAIN
SUGGESTS --

77
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:11,000
&gt;&gt;: -- VERY MODERN.

78
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,100
&gt;&gt;: YEAH, SUGGESTS
MACHINE PRODUCTION,

79
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,533
AND ONE THING BEING --

80
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:16,600
&gt;&gt;: -- GOING SHOPPING, AND
SEEING EVERY THING THE SAME IN

81
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,833
THE GROCERY STORE.

82
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,067
&gt;&gt;: EXACTLY.

83
00:03:19,067 --> 00:03:20,800
&gt;&gt;: -- NINE HUNDRED VERSIONS OF
THE SAME THING.

84
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,300
&gt;&gt;: KIND OF A PRODUCTLIKE
QUALITY TO IT.

85
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,867
IT'S EASY TO SEE HOW THE CLEAN
QUALITIES OF IT, THE SHININESS

86
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:31,600
OF IT, AND ALSO THE PLEXI MAYBE
AT FIRST GLANCE IT SEEMS

87
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,900
OVERSIMPLIFIED, BUT ON FURTHER
SCRUTINY THERE IS A LOT OF COLOR

88
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,700
AND REFLECTION AND
LIGHT AT PLAY.
