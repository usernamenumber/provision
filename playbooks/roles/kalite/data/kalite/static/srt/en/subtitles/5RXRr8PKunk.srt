1
00:00:03,187 --> 00:00:07,704
So let's talk about body mass index (BMI).

2
00:00:07,704 --> 00:00:15,903
This is a term that's often discussed and so let's first figure out how it's calculated - how do we figure this out?

3
00:00:15,903 --> 00:00:23,719
So, if you have a little stick person, what you could do is have them step on a scale.

4
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:27,754
And you could get their weight. So, the first thing you need is their weight.

5
00:00:27,754 --> 00:00:33,237
And then you go on and you ask them if they would mind if you would take their measurement of height.

6
00:00:33,237 --> 00:00:36,453
And so you get their "H" or height.

7
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:44,052
And a BMI is basically just taking those two numbers and using them in a little equation

8
00:00:44,052 --> 00:00:49,519
where you take the weight divided by the height squared.

9
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:51,986
Very simple, right?

10
00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:55,104
So now, let me calculate my BMI.

11
00:00:55,104 --> 00:00:57,204
But before I do that, I have to tell you one more thing

12
00:00:57,204 --> 00:01:03,220
Which is that, the weight, this is in kilograms (kg)

13
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:08,136
and the height is actually in meters squared.

14
00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:11,038
So, when I was actually figuring out my own height and weight

15
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:13,253
I realized the problem and I'll show you what that was.

16
00:01:13,253 --> 00:01:23,736
So, my weight is 160 pounds and my height is six foot, one inch.

17
00:01:23,736 --> 00:01:27,769
Which is the same as 73 inches.

18
00:01:27,769 --> 00:01:33,586
So, I would love to use this easy equation, but I have pounds and inches - I don't have kilograms and meters.

19
00:01:33,586 --> 00:01:38,387
So what do I do? Well, what I need to do first is convert over, right?

20
00:01:38,387 --> 00:01:51,419
So I can say, "Alright, well one pound equals 0.454 kilograms. So far, so good.

21
00:01:51,419 --> 00:01:59,705
And now one inch, which is pretty small, is going to be a small number relative to a meter, which is huge, right?

22
00:01:59,705 --> 00:02:09,786
And so, it is, it's 0.0254 meters."

23
00:02:09,786 --> 00:02:16,053
So, now I've got my conversions and actually, what I can do, is I can take these numbers and plug them in here

24
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:23,602
to help me easily convert from kilos and meters over to pounds and inches - make my equation much simpler for me to use.

25
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:34,685
So I can say, "Okay, well now how about weight in pounds and height in inches squared?"

26
00:02:34,685 --> 00:02:36,286
And I have to multiply, right? Because I have to multiply by the conversion.

27
00:02:36,286 --> 00:02:52,870
And so, I'll multiply by 0.454 divided by 0.0254 squared.

28
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:58,720
And to make it even easier, I can actually take this whole thing, plug it into my calculator

29
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:07,203
and it gives me the number 703. So I can say, "Okay, so really what I have here is, again, weight in pounds

30
00:03:07,203 --> 00:03:17,387
divided by height in inches squared, multiplied by 703."

31
00:03:17,387 --> 00:03:20,704
So going back now, I can finally throw in my own numbers, right?

32
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:45,053
I can say, "Okay, so my BMI is 160 divided by 73 squared times 703."

33
00:03:45,053 --> 00:03:47,154
Let me erase that just to make it clear.

34
00:03:47,154 --> 00:03:51,270
Okay, so this math works out to 21.

35
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,503
So my BMI is 21.

36
00:03:53,503 --> 00:03:56,302
Wonderful. The next question is: well, what does that mean?

37
00:03:56,302 --> 00:04:04,102
You know, if I have a BMI of 21, is that normal or is that good or how should I feel about that?

38
00:04:04,102 --> 00:04:09,620
So, if you put a scale on here starting with zero to, let's say 30

39
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:18,219
and I have 25 here and let's say this is about 18.5

40
00:04:18,219 --> 00:04:23,453
What physicians have done is basically divide up the BMI into catergories

41
00:04:23,453 --> 00:04:30,387
and they said, "Okay, well if your BMI as an adult is somewhere between zero and 18.5

42
00:04:30,387 --> 00:04:34,852
somewhere in this range. I'm going to do it in yellow.

43
00:04:34,852 --> 00:04:44,219
Then you're underweight. I'm just going to write "under." And if you're between 18.5 and 25

44
00:04:44,219 --> 00:04:49,686
if you're in this range, you're in a very healthy range.

45
00:04:49,686 --> 00:04:53,502
And so I'll write a little smiley face for that.

46
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:59,569
And if you're above 25, let's say 25 to 30, then you're in the overweight range.

47
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:07,937
And finally, if you're above 30, let's say you're out here, then you're obese."

48
00:05:07,937 --> 00:05:11,753
And so that's where the word obese really comes from.

49
00:05:11,753 --> 00:05:15,053
It comes from a category of BMI.

50
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:19,519
And so, going back to my BMI, I'm right here at 21

51
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:24,369
and I'm doing pretty well. But, the question might come up in my head,

52
00:05:24,369 --> 00:05:30,086
"What weight would I be if I was overweight and what weight would I be if I was obese?

53
00:05:30,086 --> 00:05:34,236
How many pounds away am I from being in those categories?

54
00:05:34,236 --> 00:05:38,103
So I can go back to my equation:

55
00:05:38,103 --> 00:05:41,803
BMI equals W over H squared and I can just rearrange it

56
00:05:41,803 --> 00:05:55,320
I can say, "Well how about W equals BMI times H squared over 703, right?"

57
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:00,587
Because that's the conversion. So if I rewrite the equation like this

58
00:06:00,587 --> 00:06:07,288
then now I can solve for my weight. I can say, "Okay, well let's say that I wanted to figure out what to do

59
00:06:07,288 --> 00:06:14,370
if I have a BMI of 25 and I know that my height probably won't change,

60
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:22,404
I'm not going to grow anymore and 703 is the number we always have to use when we're using the conversion from

61
00:06:22,404 --> 00:06:27,188
pounds to kilos and inches to meters. So, what does that equal?

62
00:06:27,188 --> 00:06:38,370
Well, in this particular case, using 25, I can see that for me to be overweight, I would be around 190 pounds.

63
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:43,852
190 pounds. So that's actually really, really good to know

64
00:06:43,852 --> 00:06:46,737
That's actually 30 pounds above what I am today.

65
00:06:46,737 --> 00:06:52,253
So that gives me a sense for how far away I am from being overweight

66
00:06:52,253 --> 00:06:57,610
and I can even do this for a BMI of 30.

67
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,609
I can say, what about a BMI of 30?

68
00:06:59,609 --> 00:07:04,710
My current height, again, is 73 inches. That's not going to change.

69
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:14,394
And I can do the math and find out that, in this case, my weight would be 227 pounds.

70
00:07:14,394 --> 00:07:18,394
So if I was 227 pounds, given my height, I would be considered obese.
