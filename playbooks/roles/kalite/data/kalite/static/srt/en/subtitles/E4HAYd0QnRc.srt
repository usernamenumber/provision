1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,510
   

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,450
In the last video we talked
about different ways to

3
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,920
represent the central tendency
or the average of a data set.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,690
What we're going to do in this
video is to expand that a

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,170
little bit to understand
how spread apart

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,830
the data is as well.

7
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,200
So let's just think about
this a little bit.

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:27,780
Let's say I have negative
10, 0, 10, 20 and 30.

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,090
Let's say that's one data
set right there.

10
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:38,290
And let's say the other data
set is 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12.

11
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:42,640
Now let's calculate the
arithmetic mean for both of

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,880
these data sets.

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,690
So let's calculate the mean.

14
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,270
And when you go further on in
statistics, you're going to

15
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,130
understand the difference
between a

16
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,780
population and a sample.

17
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,830
We're assuming that
this is the entire

18
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,050
population of our data.

19
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,240
So we're going to be dealing
with the population mean.

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,000
We're going to be dealing
with, as you see, the

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,420
population measures
of dispersion.

22
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,890
I know these are all
fancy words.

23
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,950
In the future, you're not going
to have all of the data.

24
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,810
You're just going to have some
samples of it, and you're

25
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,420
going to try to estimate
things for the entire

26
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:13,790
population.

27
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:16,370
So I don't want you to worry too
much about that just now.

28
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,170
But if you are going to go
further in statistics, I just

29
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,910
want to make that
clarification.

30
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:24,690
Now, the population mean, or
the arithmetic mean of this

31
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:29,790
data set right here, it is
negative 10 plus 0 plus 10

32
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:36,730
plus 20 plus 30 over-- we have
five data points-- over 5.

33
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:37,530
And what is this equal to?

34
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,620
That negative 10 cancels out
with that 10, 20 plus 30 is 50

35
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,290
divided by 5, it's
equal to 10.

36
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,720
Now, what's the mean
of this data set?

37
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:56,470
8 plus 9 plus 10 plus 11 plus
12, all of that over 5.

38
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:02,160
And the way we could think about
it, 8 plus 12 is 20, 9

39
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,770
plus 11 is another 20, so
that's 40, and then

40
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,890
we have a 50 there.

41
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:06,710
Add another 10.

42
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,690
So this, once again, is
going to be 50 over 5.

43
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:18,380
So this has the exact same
population means.

44
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,440
Or if you don't want to worry
about the word population or

45
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,830
sample and all of that, both
of these data sets have the

46
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,690
exact same arithmetic mean.

47
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,360
When you average all these
numbers and divide by 5 or

48
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,570
when you take the sum of these
numbers and divide by 5, you

49
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,950
get 10, some of these numbers
and divide by 5,

50
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,390
you get 10 as well.

51
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,310
But clearly, these sets of
numbers are different.

52
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,810
You know, if you just looked at
this number, you'd say, oh,

53
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,270
maybe these sets are very
similar to each other.

54
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,760
But when you look at these two
data sets, one thing might pop

55
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,710
out at you.

56
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,790
All of these numbers are
very close to 10.

57
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,300
I mean, the furthest number
here is two away from 10.

58
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,120
12 is only two away from 10.

59
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,840
Here, these numbers are
further away from 10.

60
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,990
Even the closer ones are still
10 away and these guys are 20

61
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:01,920
away from 10.

62
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,660
So this right here, this data
set right here is more

63
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,160
disperse, right?

64
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,730
These guys are further away from
our mean than these guys

65
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,610
are from this mean.

66
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:19,630
So let's think about different
ways we can measure

67
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,840
dispersion, or how far
away we are from

68
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,070
the center, on average.

69
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,130
Now one way, this is
kind of the most

70
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,170
simple way, is the range.

71
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,840
And you won't see it used too
often, but it's kind of a very

72
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,850
simple way of understanding how
far is the spread between

73
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,850
the largest and the
smallest number.

74
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,760
You literally take the largest
number, which is 30 in our

75
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,020
example, and from that, you
subtract the smallest number.

76
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:48,280
So 30 minus negative 10, which
is equal to 40, which tells us

77
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,530
that the difference between the
largest and the smallest

78
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,830
number is 40, so we have a range
of 40 for this data set.

79
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:59,570
Here, the range is the largest
number, 12, minus the smallest

80
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,840
number, which is 8, which
is equal to 4.

81
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,150
So here range is actually
a pretty good measure of

82
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:06,990
dispersion.

83
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:10,370
We say, OK, both of these
guys have a mean of 10.

84
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,620
But when I look at the range,
this guy has a much larger

85
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,660
range, so that tells me this
is a more disperse set.

86
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,360
But range is always not going to
tell you the whole picture.

87
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,820
You might have two data sets
with the exact same range

88
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,840
where still, based on how things
are bunched up, it

89
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,230
could still have very different
distributions of

90
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,180
where the numbers lie.

91
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,150
Now, the one that you'll
see used most often

92
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,400
is called the variance.

93
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,270
   

94
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,390
Actually, we're going
to see the standard

95
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,390
deviation in this video.

96
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,960
That's probably what's used most
often, but it has a very

97
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,040
close relationship
to the variance.

98
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,466
So the symbol for the variance--
and we're going to

99
00:04:47,466 --> 00:04:49,180
deal with the population
variance.

100
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,470
Once again, we're assuming that
this is all of the data

101
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,650
for our whole population, that
we're not just sampling,

102
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,630
taking a subset, of the data.

103
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,730
So the variance, its symbol is
literally this sigma, this

104
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,020
Greek letter, squared.

105
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,260
That is the symbol
for variance.

106
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,540
And we'll see that the sigma
letter actually is the symbol

107
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,260
for standard deviation.

108
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,670
And that is for a reason.

109
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,630
But anyway, the definition of
a variance is you literally

110
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:17,890
take each of these data points,
find the difference

111
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:21,580
between those data points and
your mean, square them, and

112
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,560
then take the average
of those squares.

113
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,840
I know that sounds very
complicated, but when I

114
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,620
actually calculate it, you're
going to see it's not too bad.

115
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,680
So remember, the mean
here is 10.

116
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,210
So I take the first
data point.

117
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,470
Let me do it over here.

118
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,700
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

119
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,360
So I take the first
data point.

120
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,680
Negative 10.

121
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,150
From that, I'm going to subtract
our mean and I'm

122
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,840
going to square that.

123
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,210
So I just found the difference
from that first data point to

124
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,580
the mean and squared it.

125
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,820
And that's essentially
to make it positive.

126
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,950
Plus the second data point, 0
minus 10, minus the mean--

127
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:00,050
this is the mean; this is that
10 right there-- squared plus

128
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,590
10 minus 10 squared-- that's
the middle 10 right there--

129
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:10,110
plus 20 minus 10-- that's
the 20-- squared

130
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:14,770
plus 30 minus 10 squared.

131
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:18,630
So this is the squared
differences between each

132
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,280
number and the mean.

133
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,490
This is the mean right there.

134
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,960
I'm finding the difference
between every data point and

135
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,200
the mean, squaring them, summing
them up, and then

136
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,020
dividing by that number
of data points.

137
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,170
So I'm taking the average
of these numbers,

138
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,920
of the squared distances.

139
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,060
So when you say it kind of
verbally, it sounds very

140
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,520
complicated.

141
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,820
But you're taking each number.

142
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,570
What's the difference between
that, the mean, square it,

143
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,790
take the average of those.

144
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:52,320
So I have 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, divided by 5.

145
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,950
So what is this going
to be equal to?

146
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,580
Negative 10 minus 10
is negative 20.

147
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,460
Negative 20 squared is 400.

148
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:09,780
0 minus 10 is negative 10
squared is 100, so plus 100.

149
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,740
10 minus 10 squared, that's just
0 squared, which is 0.

150
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,740
Plus 20 minus 10 is 10
squared, is 100.

151
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,030
Plus 30 minus 10, which
is 20, squared is 400.

152
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:24,750
All of that over 5.

153
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,870
And what do we have here?

154
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,460
400 plus 100 is 500, plus
another 500 is 1000.

155
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:35,930
It's equal to 1000/5, which
is equal to 200.

156
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:42,520
So in this situation, our
variance is going to be 200.

157
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,250
That's our measure of
dispersion there.

158
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,850
And let's compare it to this
data set over here.

159
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:51,720
Let's compare it to the
variance of this

160
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,420
less-dispersed data set.

161
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,680
So let me scroll over a little
bit so we have some real

162
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,930
estate, although I'm
running out.

163
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,370
Maybe I could scroll up here.

164
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,200
There you go.

165
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,740
Let me calculate the variance
of this data set.

166
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,210
So we already know its mean.

167
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:10,990
So its variance of this data set
is going to be equal to 8

168
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:21,340
minus 10 squared plus 9 minus
10 squared plus 10 minus 10

169
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:26,470
squared plus 11 minus 10-- let
me scroll up a little bit--

170
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,640
squared plus 12 minus
10 squared.

171
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,059
Remember, that 10 is just the
mean that we calculated.

172
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:36,850
You have to calculate the mean
first. Divided by-- we have 1,

173
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,630
2, 3, 4, 5 squared
differences.

174
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,679
So this is going to be equal
to-- 8 minus 10 is negative 2

175
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,760
squared, is positive 4.

176
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,090
9 minus 10 is negative 1
squared, is positive 1.

177
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,800
10 minus 10 is 0 squared.

178
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,050
You still get 0.

179
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,730
11 minus 10 is 1.

180
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,380
Square it, you get 1.

181
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,710
12 minus 10 is 2.

182
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,930
Square it, you get 4.

183
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:00,960
And what is this equal to?

184
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,100
All of that over 5.

185
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,390
This is 10/5.

186
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:09,160
So this is going to be--all
right, this is 10/5, which is

187
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,350
equal to 2.

188
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,420
So the variance here-- let me
make sure I got that right.

189
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,480
Yes, we have 10/5.

190
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,970
So the variance of this
less-dispersed data set is a

191
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:19,820
lot smaller.

192
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:26,150
The variance of this data set
right here is only 2.

193
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,630
So that gave you a sense.

194
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,540
That tells you, look, this is
definitely a less-dispersed

195
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,300
data set then that there.

196
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,780
Now, the problem with the
variance is you're taking

197
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,680
these numbers, you're taking
the difference between them

198
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,390
and the mean, then you're
squaring it.

199
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,910
It kind of gives you a bit of
an arbitrary number, and if

200
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,460
you're dealing with
units, let's say

201
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:48,160
if these are distances.

202
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,700
So this is negative 10 meters, 0
meters, 10 meters, this is 8

203
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,110
meters, so on and so forth, then
when you square it, you

204
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,250
get your variance in terms
of meters squared.

205
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,740
It's kind of an odd
set of units.

206
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,550
So what people like to do is
talk in terms of standard

207
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:20,770
deviation, which is just the
square root of the variance,

208
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:24,510
or the square root
of sigma squared.

209
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,470
And the symbol for the standard

210
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,200
deviation is just sigma.

211
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,990
So now that we've figured out
the variance, it's very easy

212
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,250
to figure out the standard
deviation of both of these

213
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:33,720
characters.

214
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,390
The standard deviation of this
first one up here, of this

215
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:42,660
first data set, is going to
be the square root of 200.

216
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,300
The square root of
200 is what?

217
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,780
The square root of
2 times 100.

218
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,480
This is equal to 10
square roots of 2.

219
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,210
That's that first data set.

220
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:58,410
Now the standard deviation of
the second data set is just

221
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:02,820
going to be the square root of
its variance, which is just 2.

222
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:08,300
So the second data set has 1/10
the standard deviation as

223
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,170
this first data set.

224
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,540
This is 10 roots of 2, this
is just the root of 2.

225
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:18,935
So this is 10 times the
standard deviation.

226
00:11:18,935 --> 00:11:25,890
   

227
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:29,480
And this, hopefully, will make
a little bit more sense.

228
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:29,960
Let's think about it.

229
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,160
This has 10 times more the
standard deviation than this.

230
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,480
And let's remember how
we calculated it.

231
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,330
Variance, we just took each
data point, how far it was

232
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,680
away from the mean,
squared that, took

233
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,020
the average of those.

234
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,490
Then we took the square root,
really just to make the units

235
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,260
look nice, but the end result
is we said that that first

236
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,850
data set has 10 times the
standard deviation as the

237
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,290
second data set.

238
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,980
So let's look at the
two data sets.

239
00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:07,170
This has 10 times the standard
deviation, which makes sense

240
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,790
intuitively, right?

241
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:12,210
I mean, they both have a 10 in
here, but each of these guys,

242
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:15,520
9 is only one away from
the 10, 0 is 10 away

243
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,640
from the 10, 10 less.

244
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,860
8 is only two away.

245
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,990
This guy is 20 away.

246
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:21,770
So it's 10 times, on average,
further away.

247
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,410
So the standard deviation, at
least in my sense, is giving a

248
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:29,090
much better sense of how far
away, on average, we

249
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,960
are from the mean.

250
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,560
Anyway, hopefully, you
found that useful.
