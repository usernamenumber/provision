00:00:06,428 --> 00:00:12,435
We're in the Capitoline Museums in Rome looking at the equestrian sculpture of the emperor Marcus Aurelius.

2
00:00:12,435 --> 00:00:19,602
We're not exactly sure of the date, but it's sometime around 176 CE or 180 CE.

3
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:23,734
It's in a new space, because it was suffering some conservation problems,

4
00:00:23,734 --> 00:00:28,603
and so it had to be removed from the campidoglio where Michelangelo had put it.

5
00:00:28,603 --> 00:00:32,820
And, actually, that's an important point because we don't know where it originally was in Rome.

6
00:00:33,205 --> 00:00:40,136
What's really important is that this is the only equestrian sculpture of its size to survive from antiquity.

7
00:00:40,136 --> 00:00:42,321
And we know that there had been dozens of them in Rome.

8
00:00:42,321 --> 00:00:45,506
They were created to celebrate the triumphal return of an emperor.

9
00:00:45,506 --> 00:00:49,913
There's so much authority as a result of him on horseback, clearly ruling.

10
00:00:49,913 --> 00:00:55,183
His left arm is lightly holding the reigns, or what would have been lightly holding the reigns of the horse.

11
00:00:55,183 --> 00:00:59,857
The right hand protrudes out, addressing the citizens of Rome.

12
00:00:59,857 --> 00:01:04,151
There's a sense of confidence in his posture, and of course in the scale, it is enormous.

13
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:08,637
This survived because it was thought to have represented Constantine,

14
00:01:08,637 --> 00:01:11,227
the emperor who made Christianity legal in the Roman Empire,

15
00:01:11,227 --> 00:01:17,590
and so this wasn't melted down for it's bronze, the way that almost all other Equestrian sculptures were.

16
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:18,958
This could have ended up as a cannon.

17
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:22,832
Right, so we're lucky it survived and it had enormous influence in the Renaissance,

18
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:26,150
for artists beginning with Donatello, and Leonardo da Vinci.

19
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:32,918
And of course, also, the ability to cast something this size in bronze had also been lost.

20
00:01:32,918 --> 00:01:35,274
And it just shows how accomplished the ancient Romans were,

21
00:01:35,274 --> 00:01:38,467
both in their handling of the material, but also in the representation,

22
00:01:38,467 --> 00:01:41,000
the real understanding of the body and its musculature.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,353
And of the anatomy of the horse, striding forward, it's so animated and lifelike.

24
00:01:46,353 --> 00:01:49,971
The folds of the neck, as his head pushes downwards.

25
00:01:49,971 --> 00:01:53,489
And the folds of the drapery that Marcus Aurelius is wearing.

26
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:57,124
How it comes down and drapes over his leg and the back of the horse.

27
00:01:57,124 --> 00:02:02,172
There's also something really wonderfully momentary and also at the same time very timeless here.

28
00:02:02,172 --> 00:02:06,103
The horse is striding, his arm is raised but there's also a wonderful sense of balance.

29
00:02:06,103 --> 00:02:09,836
The horse is in motion, he's pulling to the right.

30
00:02:09,836 --> 00:02:14,568
He had, in his left hand, the reigns so there's a tension in that

31
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:19,454
he sort of seems to be pulling back and the horse pulls its head back a little bit.

32
00:02:19,454 --> 00:02:25,418
At the same time, the right side of his body seems to be moving forward, and leaning to the right,

33
00:02:25,418 --> 00:02:28,086
there's a kind of animation throughout.

34
00:02:28,086 --> 00:02:32,822
There's also this unity between this incredibly powerful animal and Marcus Aurelius,

35
00:02:32,822 --> 00:02:35,539
and he's in full control of the horse.

36
00:02:36,216 --> 00:02:41,986
And even, kind of, moving forward while pulling the horse back slightly, holding it back.

37
00:02:41,986 --> 00:02:46,075
And you're right, his left hand is holding the reigns, but it's a light touch, even though he's in command

38
00:02:46,075 --> 00:02:48,409
of this incredibly powerful animal.

39
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:52,461
Is it me, or does he seem a little too big for the horse?

40
00:02:52,461 --> 00:02:55,110
Do you know if this was cast in one piece?

41
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:00,525
It would have been cast in individual pieces, and then it would have been assembled

42
00:03:00,525 --> 00:03:04,492
and then the bronze would have been worked so as to erase the seams.

43
00:03:04,492 --> 00:03:12,523
And so this commemorating of a great man and his great deeds was an important idea in the Renaissance

44
00:03:12,523 --> 00:03:16,942
with the flowering of Humanism, this recognition of the achievement of an individual,

45
00:03:16,942 --> 00:03:20,540
the representation of that individual in a portrait.

46
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,053
These are things that had been lost in the Middle Ages.

47
00:03:24,053 --> 00:03:30,288
This interest in representation, both of his authority, of his position in society, but also

48
00:03:30,288 --> 00:03:36,360
the ability to render the body and the interest in rendering, all those things come together in the Renaissance,

49
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,617
again, having originally come together, of course, in the Classical world.
