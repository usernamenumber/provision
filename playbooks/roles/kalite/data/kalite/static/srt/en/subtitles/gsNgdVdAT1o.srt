1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760
   

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,280
In the last video we saw how a
matrix and figuring out its

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,730
inverse can be used to solve
a system of equations.

4
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:07,790
And we did a 2 by 2.

5
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,200
And in the future, we'll
do 3 by 3's.

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,170
We won't do 4 by 4's because
those take too long.

7
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,740
But you'll see it applies to
kind of an n by n matrix.

8
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,310
And that is probably the
application of matrices that

9
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,420
you learn if you learn this in
your Algebra 2 class, or your

10
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,190
Algebra 1 class.

11
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,720
And you often wonder,
well why even do the

12
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,120
whole matrix thing?

13
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,570
Now I will show you another
application of matrices that

14
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,920
actually you're more likely to
see in your linear algebra

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,200
class when you take
it in college.

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,030
But the really neat thing here
is, and I think this will

17
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,220
really hit the point home, that
the matrix representation

18
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,360
is just one way of representing
multiple types of

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,550
problems. And what's really
cool is that if different

20
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,590
problems can be represented the
same way, it kind of tells

21
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,920
you that they're the
same problem.

22
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,550
And that's called an isomorphism
in math.

23
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,240
That if you can reduce one
problem into another problem,

24
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,450
then all the work you
did with one of them

25
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,570
applies to the other.

26
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,330
But anyway, let's figure
out a new way that

27
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,580
matrices can be used.

28
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,120
So I'm going to draw
some vectors.

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,880
Let's say I have the vector--
Let's call this vector a.

30
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,920
   

31
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,920
And I'm going to just write this
is as a column vector.

32
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,780
And all of this is
just convention.

33
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,080
These are just human
invented things.

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,320
I could have written
this diagonally.

35
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,640
I could have written
this however.

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:31,120
But if I say vector a
is 3, negative 6.

37
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,265
And I view this as the x
component of the vector, and

38
00:01:33,265 --> 00:01:35,330
this is equal to the y component
of the vector.

39
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,690
And then I have vector b.

40
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:41,920
   

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:57,810
Vector b is equal to 2, 6.

42
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:04,330
And I want to know are there
some combinations of vectors a

43
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:08,949
and b-- where you can say, 5
times vector a, plus 3 times

44
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:13,350
vector b, or 10 times victor a
minus 6 times vector b-- some

45
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:19,420
combination of vector a and b,
where I can get vector c.

46
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:31,250
And vector c is the
vector 7, 6.

47
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,205
So let me see if I can visually
draw this problem.

48
00:02:33,205 --> 00:02:35,560
So let me draw the
coordinate axes.

49
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,300
Let's see this one.

50
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,490
3, negative 6.

51
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,440
That'll be in quadrant--
these are both

52
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,180
in the first quadrant.

53
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,840
So I just want to figure
out how much of the

54
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,900
axes I need to draw.

55
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,580
So let's see-- Let me do
a different color.

56
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,640
   

57
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,670
That's my y-axis.

58
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,160
I'm not drawing the second or
third quadrants, because I

59
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,140
don't think our vectors
show up there.

60
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,385
And then this is the x-axis.

61
00:03:01,385 --> 00:03:03,910
   

62
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,365
Let me draw each of
these vectors.

63
00:03:05,365 --> 00:03:08,270
   

64
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:11,130
So first I'll do vector a.

65
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,310
That's 3, negative 6.

66
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:17,770
1, 2, 3, and then negative 6.

67
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:24,170
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

68
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,970
So it's there.

69
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:31,010
So if I wanted to draw it
as a vector, usually

70
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,260
start at the origin.

71
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,894
   

72
00:03:34,894 --> 00:03:36,980
And it doesn't have to start
at the origin like that.

73
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,730
I'm just choosing to.

74
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,990
You can move around a vector.

75
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,190
It just has to have the
same orientation

76
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,680
and the same magnitude.

77
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:52,620
So that is vector
a for the green.

78
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,670
Now let me do in magenta,
I'll do vector b.

79
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,050
That is 2, 6.

80
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:04,280
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

81
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:12,630
So 2, 6 is right over there.

82
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,740
And that's vector b.

83
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:22,160
   

84
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,300
So it'll look like this.

85
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,370
That's vector b.

86
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,630
And then let me write down
vector a down there.

87
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,790
That's vector a.

88
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,210
And I want to take some
combination of

89
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,720
vectors a and b.

90
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,400
And add them up and
get vector c.

91
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,690
So what does vector
c look like?

92
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,620
It's 7, 6.

93
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,290
Let me do that in purple.

94
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:50,390
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

95
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,240
Comma 6.

96
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,940
So 7, 6 is right over there.

97
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,190
That's vector c.

98
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:00,400
   

99
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,145
Vector c looks like that.

100
00:05:02,145 --> 00:05:09,000
   

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,730
I'm going to draw
it like that.

102
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:14,640
And that's vector c.

103
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,010
So what was the original
problem I said?

104
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:19,460
I said I want to add some
multiple of vector a to some

105
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,890
multiple of vector b,
and get vector c.

106
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,000
And I want to see what
those multiples are.

107
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,650
So let's say the multiple
that I multiply

108
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,650
times vector a is x.

109
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,210
And the multiple of
vector b is y.

110
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,380
So I essentially want to say
that-- let me do it in another

111
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:42,330
neutral color-- that vector ax--
that's how much of vector

112
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:49,740
a I'm contributing-- plus vector
by-- that's how much of

113
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,920
vector b I'm contributing--
is equal to vector c.

114
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,200
And you know, maybe I can't.

115
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,470
Maybe there's no combinations of
vector a and b when you add

116
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,830
them together equal vector c.

117
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,120
But let's see if we
can solve this.

118
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,830
So how do we solve?

119
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,900
So let's expand out
vectors a and b.

120
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,710
Vector a is what?

121
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:07,860
3, negative 6.

122
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:17,210
So vector a, we could write
as 3, minus 6 times x.

123
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,120
That just tells us how much
vector a we're contributing.

124
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,120
Plus vector b, which is 2, 6.

125
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,790
   

126
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,240
And then y is how much vector
b we're contributing.

127
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,960
And that is equal to 7, 6.

128
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,920
Vector c.

129
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,440
Now this right here, this
problem can be rewritten just

130
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,990
based on how we've defined
matrix multiplication, et

131
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,150
cetera, et cetera, as this.

132
00:06:47,150 --> 00:07:07,780
As 3, minus 6, 2, 6, times
x, y, is equal to 7, 6.

133
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,150
Now how does that work out?

134
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,850
Well think about how matrix
multiplication works out.

135
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:16,530
The way we learned matrix
multiplication, we said, 3

136
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:25,250
times x, plus 2 times
y is equal to 7.

137
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,740
3 times x plus 2 times
y is equal to 7.

138
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,800
That's how we learned matrix
multiplication.

139
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,700
That's the same thing here.

140
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:37,170
3 times x, plus 2 times y, is
going to be equal to 7.

141
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,270
These x and y here are
just scalar numbers.

142
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,380
So 3 times x plus 2 times
y is equal to 7.

143
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:45,630
And then matrix multiplication
here, minus 6 times x plus 6

144
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,030
times y is equal to 6.

145
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,080
That's just traditional matrix
multiplication that we learned

146
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,330
several videos ago.

147
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,120
That's the same thing here.

148
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,390
Minus 6x plus 6y
is equal to 6.

149
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,560
These x's and y's are
just numbers.

150
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,410
They're just scalar numbers.

151
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,380
They're not vectors
or anything.

152
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,640
We would just multiply them
times both of these numbers.

153
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,710
So hopefully you see that this
problem is the exact same

154
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,580
thing as this problem.

155
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,030
And you've maybe had an a-ha
moment now, if you watched the

156
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:08,700
previous video.

157
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:16,070
Because this matrix also
represented the problem, where

158
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,210
do we find the intersection
of two lines?

159
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,220
Where the two lines-- I'm just
going to do it on the side

160
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,290
here-- the intersection of
the two lines, 3x plus

161
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,210
2y is equal to 7.

162
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:31,800
And minus 6x plus 6y
is equal to 6.

163
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,409
And so, I had drawn two lines.

164
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:34,900
And we said, what's the
point of intersection,

165
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,600
et cetera, et cetera.

166
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,539
And it was represented
by this problem.

167
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:39,860
But here, we have-- well I
won't say a completely

168
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,140
different problem, because
we're learning they're

169
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,580
actually very similar-- but here
I'm doing a problem of,

170
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,870
I'm trying to find what
combination of the matrices a

171
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,570
and b add up to the matrix c.

172
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,340
But it got reduced to the same
matrix representation.

173
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,430
And so we can solve this the
same exactly way we solved

174
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,750
this problem.

175
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:02,570
If we call this the matrix a,
let's figure out a inverse.

176
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:06,190
So we get a inverse
is equal to what?

177
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,222
It equals 1 over the
determinant of a.

178
00:09:08,222 --> 00:09:10,740
The determinant of
a is 3 times 6.

179
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,850
18 minus minus 12.

180
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:18,560
So that's 18 plus 12,
which is 1/30.

181
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,850
And we did this in the
previous video.

182
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,170
You swap these two numbers.

183
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,150
So you get 6 and 3.

184
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,120
And then you make these
two negatives.

185
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,600
So you get 6 and minus 2.

186
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,730
That's a inverse.

187
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,590
And now to solve for x and y, we
can multiply both sides of

188
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,210
this equation by a inverse.

189
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,340
If you multiply a inverse times
a, this cancels out.

190
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:45,790
So you get x, y is equal to
a inverse times this.

191
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:53,740
It's equal to 1/30 times
6, minus 2, 6, 3.

192
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,330
Times 7, 6.

193
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,250
And remember, with matrices,
the order that

194
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,830
you multiply matters.

195
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,830
So on this side, we multiplied
a inverse on

196
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,250
this side of the equation.

197
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,580
So we have to do a inverse on
the left side on this side of

198
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,530
this equation.

199
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:08,360
So that's why did it here.

200
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,570
If we did it the other way,
all bets are off.

201
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,310
So what does this equal?

202
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:17,860
This is equal to 1/30 times--
and we did this the previous

203
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,060
problem-- 6 times 7
is 42, minus 12.

204
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,250
30.

205
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,410
6 times 7, 42.

206
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,220
Plus 18.

207
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,170
60.

208
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:30,800
So that equals 1, 2.

209
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,170
So what does this tell us?

210
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:37,130
This tells us that if we have
1 times vector a, plus 2

211
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,610
times vector b.

212
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:43,360
1 times-- this is 1-- and
2 times vector b.

213
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,420
So 1 times vector a plus
2 times vector b is

214
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,685
equal to vector c.

215
00:10:47,685 --> 00:10:49,090
And let's confirm
that visually.

216
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,820
So 1 times vector a.

217
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,140
Well that's vector
a right there.

218
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,410
So if we add 2 vector b's to
it, we should get vector c.

219
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,300
So let's see if we
can do that.

220
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,150
So if we just shift vector b
over this way, well vector

221
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,330
let's see, vector b is
over 2 and up 6.

222
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:08,020
So over 2 and up 6 would
get us there.

223
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:12,230
So 1, vector b-- just doing
heads to tail visual method of

224
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:16,240
adding vectors-- would
get us there.

225
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,271
1, 2, 3.

226
00:11:17,271 --> 00:11:18,521
Good.

227
00:11:18,521 --> 00:11:20,820
   

228
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,250
No, let me see.

229
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,780
1, 2, 3.

230
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,340
And then vector b goes
over two more.

231
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:33,140
two more.

232
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,240
So it'll get us up 6.

233
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,860
It's like that.

234
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,410
So that's 1, vector b.

235
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:43,550
And then if we add another-- but
we want 2 times vector b.

236
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,180
We essentially need
two vector b's.

237
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,820
So we had one, and then
we add another one.

238
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,395
I think visually you see that
it does actually-- I didn't

239
00:11:51,395 --> 00:11:52,160
want to do it like that.

240
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,240
I wanted to use the line
tool so it looks neat.

241
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,830
So you add another vector b.

242
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,840
And there you have it.

243
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,320
That's a vector b.

244
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,680
So it's 2 times vector b.

245
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,530
So it's the same direction as
vector b, but it's two times

246
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,270
the length.

247
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,610
So we visually showed it.

248
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:10,530
We solved it algabraically.

249
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,990
But the real learning, and the
big real discovery of this

250
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:18,730
whole video, is to show you that
the matrix representation

251
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:23,720
can represent multiple different
problems. This was a

252
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,210
finding the combinations
of a vector problem.

253
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,360
And the previous one it
was figure out if

254
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,090
two lines can intersect.

255
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:32,420
But what it tells you is that
these two problems are

256
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,980
connected in some deep way.

257
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,830
That if we take the veneer of
reality, that underlying it,

258
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,260
they are the same thing.

259
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,890
And frankly, that's why math
is so interesting.

260
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:45,480
Because when you realize that
two problems are really the

261
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,540
same thing, it takes all of the
superficial human veneer

262
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,780
away from things.

263
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,280
Because our brains are kind of
wired to perceive the world in

264
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:52,790
a certain way.

265
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:56,330
But it tells us that there's
some fundamental truth,

266
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:00,050
independent of our perception,
that is tying all of these

267
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,350
different concepts together.

268
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,800
But anyway, I don't want to
get all mystical on you.

269
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,780
But if you do see
the mysticism in

270
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,310
math, all the better.

271
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:10,890
But hopefully you found that
pretty interesting.

272
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,660
And actually, I know I'm going
over time, but I think this

273
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,820
is-- A lot of people take linear
algebra, they learn how

274
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,500
to do all of the things, and
they say, well what is the

275
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,180
whole point of this?

276
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,020
But this is kind of
an interesting

277
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,250
thing to think about.

278
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:27,070
We had this had vector a and
we had this vector b.

279
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,310
And we were able to say, well
there's some combinations of

280
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,600
the vectors a and b, that
when we added it up,

281
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,400
we got vector c.

282
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,250
So an interesting question is,
what are all the vectors that

283
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,390
I could get to by adding
combinations of

284
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,220
vectors a and b.

285
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,600
Or adding or subtracting.

286
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,280
Or you could say,
I could multiply

287
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,090
them by negative numbers.

288
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:47,730
But either way.

289
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,260
What are all of the vectors
that I can get by taking

290
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,490
linear combinations of
vectors a and b?

291
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:57,600
And that's actually called the
vector space spanned by the

292
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,360
vectors a and b.

293
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,060
And we'll do more of that
in linear algebra.

294
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,460
And here we're dealing
with a two

295
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,450
dimensional Euclidean space.

296
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,160
We could have had three
dimensional vectors.

297
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,740
We could've had n dimensional
vectors.

298
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,990
So it gets really, really,
really abstract.

299
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:14,390
But this is, I think, a really
good toe dipping for linear

300
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:14,980
algebra as well.

301
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,110
So hopefully I haven't confused
or overwhelmed you.

302
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,430
And I'll see you in
the next video.

303
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:19,500
