1
00:00:00,708 --> 00:00:01,910
As you might imagine

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:04,769
World war I was one of the bloodiest events

3
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:09,045
in frankly all of human history. I was thinking about putting pictures in here and I encourage you

4
00:00:09,045 --> 00:00:12,570
to do a picture search of WWI, of mass graves

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,770
and people starving, soldiers dead,...

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,836
trenches. I will make you feel ill and..

7
00:00:19,836 --> 00:00:24,042
it's probably a good thing to look for these images. Because it will remind you

8
00:00:24,042 --> 00:00:29,309
how disgusting, gross and crazy wars can be.

9
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:32,370
Sometimes we abstract it. When we look at it in hindsight and we

10
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:36,111
just talk about the numbers. WWI was gruesome

11
00:00:36,111 --> 00:00:39,035
especially because this was the first time industrialized weapons

12
00:00:39,035 --> 00:00:43,634
were put to use in a war context. There was far more bloodshed than any

13
00:00:43,634 --> 00:00:47,570
of the fighting powers actually believed there would be.

14
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,571
But, just to put things in numbers, and these are huge numbers,

15
00:00:50,571 --> 00:00:54,904
numbers that are hard for us to comprehend.

16
00:00:54,904 --> 00:00:56,911
And, we don't know the exact numbers.

17
00:00:56,911 --> 00:00:58,922
As you can imagine, it is not easy to take a census

18
00:00:58,922 --> 00:01:02,843
the militaries have a better count of who might have been kille

19
00:01:02,843 --> 00:01:06,902
or who might be missing. Civilian casualties are almost impossible

20
00:01:06,902 --> 00:01:10,283
to count. You have people who are invertantly killed by a bomb, or dying

21
00:01:10,283 --> 00:01:15,303
of starvation or a famine. So, these are very hard numbers to count.

22
00:01:15,303 --> 00:01:20,390
But there is some concensus on the rough estimates, on the total casualties in WWI.

23
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,902
In particular I want to focus on the deaths.

24
00:01:22,902 --> 00:01:25,654
When people talk about casualties, then we often also talk about injured.

25
00:01:25,654 --> 00:01:30,330
But just the deads alone, the estimates I see and I encourages you to look it

26
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,381
your own and trying to figure out what concensus you can get to.

27
00:01:33,381 --> 00:01:36,044
But the estimates that I see

28
00:01:36,044 --> 00:01:40,969
have on the order of 16 millions deaths

29
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:44,036
during or due to WWI

30
00:01:44,036 --> 00:01:47,530
and if were to break down these deads we have 8 to 10 million

31
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:50,507
in the military. So directly, in the military, this is the death of soldiers

32
00:01:50,507 --> 00:01:54,550
So this is the military. It is roughly based on the accounts of

33
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,388
On the accounts that I've seen, about 16 percent of these deaths

34
00:01:56,388 --> 00:02:03,741
were amongst the Entente. And about 40 percent were amongst the central powers.

35
00:02:03,741 --> 00:02:05,332
But in either case, we're talking about millions

36
00:02:05,332 --> 00:02:07,503
on either side of WWI.

37
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:12,375
and the rest, if we are talking in the order of 6-7 million, were civilian

38
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:18,608
The estimates that I've seen were directly

39
00:02:18,608 --> 00:02:22,902
due to military action. So this is military action

40
00:02:22,902 --> 00:02:29,842
civilians. This was disproportionately felt on the side of the Entente, on the side of the allies

41
00:02:29,842 --> 00:02:31,771
That's if you look at, especially, I suppose,

42
00:02:31,771 --> 00:02:35,501
where the western front was fought, it becomes clear, also where the eastern front was fought

43
00:02:35,501 --> 00:02:39,238
it was thought, the war was fought on Russian land,

44
00:02:39,238 --> 00:02:41,912
or was controlled by the Russian Empire at the time

45
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:45,239
The western front much of the, or most of the battle was in France

46
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,370
and in Belgium. And also in Italy. That was also

47
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,855
where you have a significant amount of the battle actually going on. This is were the

48
00:02:52,855 --> 00:03:00,969
allies, the Entente, felt a disproportionate number of the civilian deaths,

49
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:02,569
directly to due military casualties.

50
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:07,237
To put on top of that: the rest of the civilian casualties. This is what, frankly,

51
00:03:07,237 --> 00:03:08,400
very hard to get an exact number on.

52
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,969
This could be due to famine,

53
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:12,770
starvation, disease,

54
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:17,770
we've talk before about the blockades,

55
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,502
the central powers and you have definitely

56
00:03:20,502 --> 00:03:26,855
people not being able to eat properly

57
00:03:26,855 --> 00:03:28,502
you had the Spanish Flu.

58
00:03:28,502 --> 00:03:33,037
You had this all around ugly situations. To make matter worse, and this is

59
00:03:33,037 --> 00:03:36,045
is what the history books often forget:

60
00:03:36,045 --> 00:03:39,837
You often had an explicit extermination of people,

61
00:03:39,837 --> 00:03:47,913
during WWI the most notable, but often forgotten was the Armenian genocide

62
00:03:47,913 --> 00:03:52,925
There was this campaign on the part of the Ottomans. This started before

63
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:56,703
WWI, but it kind of hit full page during WWI

64
00:03:56,703 --> 00:04:03,309
where, I have seen estimates, 1 million into 1,5 millions Armenians were systematically

65
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:08,953
I mean, I am talking about men, women,

66
00:04:08,953 --> 00:04:11,105
children, systematically killed by the Ottoman

67
00:04:11,105 --> 00:04:16,433
government. So, war is ugly and brings out the worst in people

68
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:19,570
and you see it just from these numbers.

69
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,501
Just to give you a context on all of this

70
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:26,836
it's very easy for us to abstract these things.

71
00:04:26,836 --> 00:04:28,102
I just wanted to say how horrible

72
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:33,303
this was. Just to bring it all into focus

73
00:04:33,303 --> 00:04:36,772
this right here is a

74
00:04:36,772 --> 00:04:39,169
passage from the Atlantic Monthly, volume 129, published in

75
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:45,554
1922. It is a passage on Joseph Tumulty's book.

76
00:04:45,554 --> 00:04:49,887
Joseph Tumulty was the private secretary of staff, of Woodrow Wilson.

77
00:04:49,887 --> 00:04:52,155
This is about his account

78
00:04:52,155 --> 00:04:54,494
of being with Woodrow Wilson, after the war

79
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:57,978
was declared in WWI

80
00:04:57,978 --> 00:05:02,732
It is fascinating, it applies to frankly all wars

81
00:05:02,732 --> 00:05:05,696
The war president in the war.

82
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:07,911
At the time of delivering his far echoed

83
00:05:07,911 --> 00:05:13,688
war message in April, 1917, the president was cheered by dense multitudes

84
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,818
phronging (?) the streets

85
00:05:15,818 --> 00:05:19,222
past from the White House, to the Capitol and back again.

86
00:05:19,222 --> 00:05:20,287
This is from Tumulty own description of the return

87
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:21,748
own description of the return

88
00:05:22,142 --> 00:05:32,626
for a while he, we're talking about Woodrow Wilson, he

89
00:05:32,626 --> 00:05:34,256
sat silent and pale in the cabinet room.

90
00:05:34,256 --> 00:05:36,027
At at last, he said,

91
00:05:36,027 --> 00:05:38,026
think what it was they were applauding

92
00:05:38,026 --> 00:05:41,695
my message today was a message of death for our young men.

93
00:05:41,695 --> 00:05:44,492
How strange it seems to applaud that.
