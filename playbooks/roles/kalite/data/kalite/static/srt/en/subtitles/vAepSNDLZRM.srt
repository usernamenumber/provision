1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,950
   

2
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,790
Before we move on past the
method of undetermined

3
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:07,140
coefficients, I want to make and
interesting and actually a

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,400
useful point.

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,170
Let's say that I had the
following nonhomogeneous

6
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:16,830
differential equation: the
second derivative of y minus 3

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:23,220
times the first derivative minus
4y is equal to-- now

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,650
this is where gets interesting--
3e to the 2x

9
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:41,870
plus 2 sine of x plus-- let me
make sure that I'm doing the

10
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,780
same problems that I've
already worked

11
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,400
on-- plus 4x squared.

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,840
   

13
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,640
So you might say,
wow, this is a

14
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,350
tremendously complicated problem.

15
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,730
I have the 3 types of functions
I've been exposed

16
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,180
to, I would have so many
undetermined coefficients, it

17
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,020
would get really unwieldy.

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,410
And this is where you need
to make a simplifying

19
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:05,110
realization.

20
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:08,560
We know the three particular
solutions to the following

21
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,410
differential equations.

22
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:13,870
We know the solution to the
second derivative minus 3

23
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,750
times the first derivative
minus 4y.

24
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,890
Well, this is this the
homogeneous, right?

25
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,000
And we know that the solution to
the homogeneous equation--

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,865
we did this a bunch of times--
is C1e to the 4x plus C2e to

27
00:01:28,865 --> 00:01:30,180
the minus x.

28
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,150
We know the solution to-- and
I'll switch colors, just for a

29
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:39,820
variety-- y prime prime minus 3y
prime minus 4y is equal to

30
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:44,310
just this alone: 3e to the 2x.

31
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,470
And we saw that that particular
solution there, y

32
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,920
particular, was minus
1/2 e to the 2x.

33
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,600
And we did this using
undetermined coefficients.

34
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,560
We did that a couple
of videos ago.

35
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,070
And then let me just write this
out a couple of times.

36
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,940
We know the solution to
this one, as well.

37
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,130
This was another particular
solution we found.

38
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,160
I think it was two videos ago.

39
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,700
And we found that the particular
solution in this

40
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:22,060
case-- and this was a fairly
hairy problem-- was minus 5/17

41
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,020
x plus 3/17.

42
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,000
Sorry.

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:37,250
The particular solution was
minus 5/17 sine of x plus 3/17

44
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,545
cosine of x.

45
00:02:38,545 --> 00:02:43,910
And then finally this last
polynomial, we could call it.

46
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,430
We know the solution when that
was just the right-hand side.

47
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,950
   

48
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,560
That was this equation.

49
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,040
And there we figured out-- and
this was in the last video.

50
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,460
We figured out that the
particular solution in this

51
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:08,240
case was minus x squared
plus 3/2 x minus 13/8.

52
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,650
So we know the particular
solution when 0's on the

53
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,240
right-hand side.

54
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,230
We know it when just 3e to the
2x is on the right-hand side.

55
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,820
We know it just when 2 sine of
x is on the right-hand side.

56
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,650
And we know it just when
4x squared is on

57
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,790
the right-hand side.

58
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,650
First of all, the particular
solution to this

59
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,540
nonhomogeneous equation, we
could just take the sum of the

60
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,330
three particular solutions.

61
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,800
And that makes sense, right?

62
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,235
Because one of the particular
solutions, like this one when

63
00:03:34,235 --> 00:03:35,710
you put it on the left-hand
side, it will

64
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,480
just equal this term.

65
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,640
This particular solution, when
you put it in the left-hand

66
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,230
side, will equal this term.

67
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,760
And finally, this particular
solution, when you put it on

68
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,670
the left-hand side, will
equal the 4x squared.

69
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:50,250
And then you could add the
homogeneous solution to that.

70
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,020
You put it in this side
and you'll get 0.

71
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,160
So it won't change the
right-hand side.

72
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,900
And then you will have the most
general solution because

73
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,260
you have these two constants
that you can solve for

74
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,180
depending on your initial
condition.

75
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:08,890
So the solution to this
seemingly hairy differential

76
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:13,980
equation is really just the sum
of these four solutions.

77
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,209
Let me clean up some space
because I want everything to

78
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:20,410
be on the board at
the same time.

79
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:27,230
So the solution is going
to be-- well, I

80
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,480
want that to be deleted.

81
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,680
   

82
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,210
I'll do it in baby blue.

83
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:39,400
Is going to be the solution to
the homogeneous C1e to the 4x

84
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:47,580
plus C2e to the minus x
minus 1/2 e the to 2x.

85
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,220
And I'll continue this line.

86
00:04:49,220 --> 00:05:01,670
Minus 5/17 sine of x plus 3/17
cosine of x minus x squared

87
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:08,030
plus 3/2 x minus 13/8.

88
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,140
And it seems daunting.

89
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,170
When you saw this, it probably
looked daunting.

90
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,030
This solution, if I told you
this was a solution and you

91
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,400
didn't know how to do
undetermined coefficients,

92
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,740
you're like, oh, I would never
be able to figure out

93
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,690
something like that.

94
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,930
But the important realization is
that you just have to find

95
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,420
the particular solutions for
each of these terms and then

96
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,170
sum them up.

97
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,170
And then add them to the general
solution for the

98
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,255
homogeneous equation,
if this was a 0 on

99
00:05:29,255 --> 00:05:30,130
the right-hand side.

100
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:35,410
And then you get the general
solution for this fairly

101
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:42,860
intimidating-looking second
order linear nonhomogeneous

102
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,940
differential equation with
constant coefficients.

103
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,610
See you in the next video, where
we'll start learning

104
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,460
another method for solving
nonhomogeneous equations.

105
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:53,900
