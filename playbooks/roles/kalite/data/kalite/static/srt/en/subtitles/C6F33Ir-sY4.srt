1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
   

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,810
Eric is selling raffle tickets
for a school fundraiser.

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:09,160
Each ticket costs $3, and he
knows the amount of money he

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,670
collects is a function of how
many tickets he sells.

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,540
What are the domain and range
for that function?

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,350
So let's write the
function for how

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,040
much money he collects.

8
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,850
So I'll call that m, the
function will be m, and it's a

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,690
function of how many
tickets he sells.

10
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,290
So it's a function of
t, for tickets.

11
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:32,030
So m, the amount of money
collected, is a function of

12
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,820
the number of tickets
he sells.

13
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,940
That's a pretty straightforward
function.

14
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,690
Every ticket costs $3.

15
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,920
He gets $3 for every ticket.

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,630
So it's going to be 3 times
t dollars or 3t dollars.

17
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,420
That's how much money
he collects.

18
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,490
Now they ask us, what
are the domain and

19
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,850
range for that function?

20
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,250
It sounds all fancy and
difficult, but just remember

21
00:00:55,250 --> 00:01:00,070
the domain, this just
means, what can I

22
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,320
input into the function?

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:08,860
   

24
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,140
So another way to think about
is what are the possible t's

25
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,520
that can be input into
this function?

26
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,270
The range is, what are the
possible values that the

27
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,190
function can take on?

28
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,710
So think about it.

29
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,980
You might at first say I could
put any t there, but think

30
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,820
about the actual reality
of what he's doing.

31
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,540
He's selling tickets,
and so he can't

32
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:29,670
sell negative tickets.

33
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,880
He might sell 0 tickets,
and he might

34
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,280
sell a gazillion tickets.

35
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,290
I guess he could sell an
infinite amount of tickets.

36
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,670
At some point that becomes
unrealistic.

37
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,590
But he definitely can't
sell negative tickets.

38
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,970
He also is not going to
sell half of a ticket.

39
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,520
Every ticket he sells is a whole
number, it's an integer.

40
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:58,590
So the domain for this function,
we could say t has

41
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:09,389
to be a non-negative integer.

42
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:12,160
I think that covers what
I just talked about.

43
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,150
Non-negative.

44
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,730
Instead of saying positive,
because it could be 0.

45
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,620
He might literally
sell no tickets.

46
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,550
He can't sell a negative 1
ticket or negative 2, so it's

47
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,730
anything that's non-negative.

48
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:25,450
It has to be an integer, he
can't sell half of a ticket,

49
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:28,730
so, and he definitely-- it
has to be an integer.

50
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,200
So that's our domain,.

51
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,050
And let's think about
what our range is.

52
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:36,960
A range is the possible values
that we can take on.

53
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,850
If t is always going to be a
non-negative integer, then

54
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,910
what's 3t always going to be?

55
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,850
Well it's going to be a
non-negative multiple of 3.

56
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:58,130
So non-negative multiples
of 3.

57
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,450
Think about it.

58
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,530
He'll never be able to collect
$2, because he could either

59
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,920
sell 0 tickets and
get nothing.

60
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,790
Let me write this down.

61
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,480
He might sell 0 tickets, so m
of 0, he's going to get $0.

62
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,050
m of, if he sells one ticket,
he's going to get $3.

63
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,800
If he sells two tickets,
he's going to get $6.

64
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,710
So he's never going to be
able to get 2 or 4.

65
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,440
Every possible value for the
amount of money he collects

66
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,370
for our function has to
be a multiple of 3.

67
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,660
It's going to be a non-negative
multiple of 3

68
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,610
because the domain is
non-negative integers.

69
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,466
