00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,667
In this video I want to see if we can

2
00:00:03,667 --> 00:00:06,533
understand the idea of a hedge fund

3
00:00:06,533 --> 00:00:07,800
a little bit better

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,667
These tend to be pretty mysterious

5
00:00:09,667 --> 00:00:11,467
and sometimes get a bad name

6
00:00:11,467 --> 00:00:14,067
because some hedge funds do do some

7
00:00:14,067 --> 00:00:17,867
fairly strange things and secretive things in the market

8
00:00:17,867 --> 00:00:21,067
and people are so, rightfully so, suspicious

9
00:00:21,067 --> 00:00:22,667
of many of them but the real difference

10
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:25,667
between a hedge fund and the types of mutual funds

11
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:27,733
that we just talked about are that

12
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:30,067
they are not regulated by the SEC

13
00:00:30,067 --> 00:00:35,000
Not regulated by the SEC

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,133
And because they are not regulated

15
00:00:37,133 --> 00:00:41,200
they can't market themselves - they can't market

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,733
-that's why when you watch, when you watch

17
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:44,133
when you watch financial shows

18
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:46,200
or you get a magazine, a finance magazine

19
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,600
you will not see ads for hedge funds

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,200
the mutual funds are all over the place

21
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,333
marketing them left and right

22
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,600
Hedge funds, the most, the largest hedge-funds in the world,

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,067
are definitely not even household names

24
00:00:57,067 --> 00:00:59,200
No-one - very few people even know

25
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,933
what those largest hedge funds in the world are

26
00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:04,067
that's because they can't market themselves

27
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:07,200
no matter how good of a track record

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,467
or really how reasonable of a fund they might be

29
00:01:09,467 --> 00:01:10,800
some might not be reasonable, some are

30
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,067
they can't market themselves

31
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:15,933
and they also can't take money from the public

32
00:01:15,933 --> 00:01:22,067
can't take money from the public

33
00:01:22,067 --> 00:01:24,133
so in general, in order to invest in a hedge fund

34
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:26,200
you have to be an accredited investor

35
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,733
which means you have a certain net worth

36
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:29,667
or you have a certain income, or maybe

37
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:31,933
by virtue of your education you can prove

38
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:34,800
that you have a certain level of sophistication to invest

39
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,333
in these things that aren't regulated

40
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:38,667
I guess you don't need the SEC to watch

41
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:40,533
your back.

42
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:44,467
So the regulation is a key difference - no marketing

43
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:45,467
no money from the public and the other

44
00:01:45,467 --> 00:01:47,467
key difference is how the managers tend to be

45
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:51,533
incented - I know incented is not a word

46
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:53,733
or motivated. In the mutual fund world

47
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:57,333
managers get a percent of assets

48
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:00,333
so for a mutual funds manager, larger is better

49
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:03,933
the more undermanagement, the more money the mutual fund manager is going to make

50
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:06,467
so they really just want to keep marketing and marketing

51
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:09,067
they don't get a cut of the profit

52
00:02:09,067 --> 00:02:11,933
so really there's not a lot of incentive for them to

53
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:15,667
to try to really beat the market here

54
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:17,733
because if they don't beat the market one year

55
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:21,000
then all the sudden, they are you know, their fund will shrink

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,933
so they really just get a fee on the size of the fund

57
00:02:24,933 --> 00:02:30,200
and a hedge fund, usually the implication is that hedge fund will be more actively managed

58
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:41,867
so larger management fee, so larger management fee, instead of the 1%, 1% is actually a lot for mutual fund

59
00:02:41,867 --> 00:02:45,533
instead of that, hedge funds tend to be 1-2 percent

60
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:50,200
so 1 to 2 percent management fee, sometimes even larger than that

61
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,733
but the even bigger difference, this is where hedge fund are very different

62
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:57,333
from traditional mutual funds, is that the management company

63
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:00,533
the general partner gets a percentage of the profits

64
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:04,200
so the hedge fund manager, or the management company

65
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:10,533
the going rate tends to be about 20 percent of the profits

66
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:15,133
of the funds. Sometimes it's less, sometimes it's a lot more.

67
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:20,677
Some very successful hedge funds gets 25, 30 percent or even a larger percentage of the profit

68
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,118
so with that out of the way.

69
00:03:23,118 --> 00:03:24,964
In the next video, I am going to do a slight difference

70
00:03:24,964 --> 00:03:27,667
some different mechanics of essentially the same returns

71
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:31,518
but one by a hedge funds, and then one by traditional mutual funds.
