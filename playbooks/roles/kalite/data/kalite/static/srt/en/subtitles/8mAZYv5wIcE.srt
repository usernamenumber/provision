1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,570
   

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,800
So I've got three lines in R2,
and I want to find their

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,600
intersection.

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:11,430
So the first one is 2x minus y
is equal to 2, the second one

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:20,550
is x plus 2y is equal to 1, and
the third one is x plus y

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,520
is equal to 4.

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,790
So let's first just graph these,
just to have a visual

8
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,040
representation of what
we're trying to do.

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,380
So I like writing my lines in
y equals mx plus b form.

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,040
So this top line becomes what?

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,630
Minus y is equal to minus
2x, minus 2x plus 2.

12
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,810
I just subtracted 2x
from both sides.

13
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:44,140
Or we could write that y
is equal to 2x minus 2.

14
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,900
That's the first line here.

15
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,350
The second line-- I'm doing it
in green --we could write this

16
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:55,630
as 2y is equal to minus x plus
1, or we could write that y is

17
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:00,130
equal to minus 1/2 x plus 1/2.

18
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,540
I just divided both
sides by 2.

19
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,880
And this last line right here,
we could write this as y is

20
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,760
equal to minus x plus 4.

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,440
Go straight here.

22
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,360
y is equal to minus x plus 4.

23
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,570
Now let me graph these.

24
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:22,100
Let me draw an axis,
that is my y-axis.

25
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,740
I can call it my y-axis since
we're actually dealing with x

26
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,590
and y's now.

27
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:28,710
I'll do it slightly lighter.

28
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,670
I'll do it in this
grey as well.

29
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,470
I'd say that is my x-axis.

30
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,790
Just like that.

31
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,580
And this first guy is going
to be 2x minus 2.

32
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,180
So it's y-intercept is going
to be at minus 2.

33
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,920
It's going to have a slope of
2, so it's going to be a

34
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,720
pretty steep line,
just like that.

35
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,870
So that's that first line,
just like that.

36
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,270
2x minus 2.

37
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:54,780
The next line is 1/2,
minus 1/2, plus 1/2.

38
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,290
So if we go plus 1/2, that's
right there, and then the

39
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,760
slope is minus 1/2.

40
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:05,290
So for every 2 we go
over, we go down 1.

41
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,760
So it's going to be like that.

42
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,289
It's actually going to
be orthogonal, right?

43
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:10,355
Because it's the negative
inverse of this guy.

44
00:02:10,355 --> 00:02:14,820
So it's going to look
something like that.

45
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,940
We draw it like that,
just like that.

46
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:23,150
And this guy is minus
x plus 4.

47
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:29,940
This is 1, 2, 3, 4, and you go
minus x, so for every 1 you go

48
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,000
over, you go down 1.

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,290
So this other line is going to
look something like this.

50
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,540
This other line, this last
line, is going to look

51
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,610
something like that.

52
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:38,680
Just like that.

53
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,340
Now, I said at the beginning of
this video that I want to

54
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,610
find the intersection of
these three lines.

55
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,570
But notice, there is
no intersection

56
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,880
of these three lines.

57
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,330
They all intersect the other
two, but they don't all

58
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,440
intersect each other
in one point.

59
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,000
We can kind of call the system
as being overdetermined.

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,500
We've overconstrained it.

61
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,740
There is no intersection of
all three of these points.

62
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,360
So if I were to actually try to
solve this system, I would

63
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,850
find no solution.

64
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,070
And to say that this has no
solution is equivalent to

65
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,170
saying that this
matrix, or this

66
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,290
equation has no solutions.

67
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:09,930
Let me write this.

68
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,690
I'm just going to rewrite
the system like this.

69
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:18,450
This is equivalent to the
matrix, let me make sure I get

70
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:26,660
this right, the matrix times
the vector xy is equal

71
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:31,610
to 2, 1, and 4.

72
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:36,440
And so, this first equation is
2 times x, minus 1 times y.

73
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,850
So it's 2 and minus 1.

74
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,340
2 times x minus 1 times
y is equal to 2.

75
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,410
That's that first equation
over there.

76
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,050
The second equation-- actually
I could even, well I won't

77
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,490
color code it, that'll take
forever --that's 1 times x

78
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,960
plus 2 times y is equal to 1.

79
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,650
And then we have x plus
y is equal to 4.

80
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,770
This system and this equation,
this system right here, these

81
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,760
are equivalent.

82
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,410
Now, this isn't going to
have any solution.

83
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,330
You could try to find
a solution to this.

84
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,270
You could create an augmented
matrix, put it in reduced row

85
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:04,960
echelon form.

86
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,220
But there is no intersection
to the three things.

87
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:13,690
So you're not going to find
a solution to A times some

88
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,550
vector-- we could call this some
vector x --is equal to B.

89
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,480
Or another way to say it, is
that B is not in the column

90
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,690
space of this matrix
right here.

91
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,370
Now, we learned in the last
video that sure, we can't find

92
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,590
a solution to Ax equals B.

93
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,600
Ax equals B has no solution.

94
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,110
   

95
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,890
We see it graphically here;
these lines don't intersect

96
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:37,410
with each other.

97
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,820
And you could prove it for
yourself algebraically by

98
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,076
trying to find a
solution here.

99
00:04:41,076 --> 00:04:43,680
You'll end up with
a 0 equals 1.

100
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,300
But we can almost get
there by finding a

101
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,780
least squares solution.

102
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,970
And we find a least squares
solution if we multiply both

103
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,820
sides by A transpose.

104
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:56,890
We know that A transpose times
A times our least squares

105
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:02,330
solution is going to be equal
to A transpose times B.

106
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:06,180
So at least we can find the
closest fit for our solution.

107
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,160
So let's find the vector
x this is our

108
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,310
least squares solution.

109
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,120
So what is A transpose
times A?

110
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,730
A transpose looks like
this, you'll have 2

111
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:20,760
minus 1, 1, 2, 1, 1.

112
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,740
That is A transpose.

113
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,290
And then of course A is
just this thing: 2

114
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:30,210
minus 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.

115
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:35,760
So A transpose A is going to be
equal to-- We have a 2 by 3

116
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,620
times a 3 by 2 matrix, so it's
going to be a 2 by 2 matrix.

117
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,240
So it's going to be
a 2 by 2 matrix.

118
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,660
So what do we get, we get 2
times 2 which is 4, plus 1

119
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,620
times 1, plus 1 times 1.

120
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,800
So it's 4 plus 1 plus 1.

121
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,620
So that's equal to 6.

122
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:59,770
And then we have 2 times minus
1, which is minus 2, plus 1

123
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,470
times 2, so those cancel out.

124
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,820
Minus 2 plus 2 is 0,
plus 1 times 1.

125
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,070
That's just going to be 1.

126
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:12,680
And then we get minus 1 times
2, which is minus 2, plus 2

127
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,470
times 1, which is 2.

128
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:18,540
So the minus 2 plus 2 is 0, plus
1 times 1, so we get a 1.

129
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,670
And then finally, we get minus
1 times minus 1, which is

130
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,710
positive 1.

131
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,870
Plus 2 times 2, which is
4, so we're now at 5.

132
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,880
Plus 1 times 1, so this
is going to be 6.

133
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,950
So this is A transpose A.

134
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:36,840
Now, what is A transpose
times B?

135
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:44,190
A transpose is 2, 1,
1, minus 1, 2, 1.

136
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:49,200
And then B is just the 3 by 1
vector, the vector that's a

137
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,680
member of R3, 2, 1, 4.

138
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,470
So what is this going
to be equal to?

139
00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:02,770
This is going to be equal
to-- We get a 3.

140
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:07,300
Sorry, this is a 2 by
3 times a 3 by 1.

141
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,640
We're going to get
a 2 by 1 vector.

142
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,620
You get a 2 by 1 vector here.

143
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:19,330
So 2 times 2 is 4, plus 1
times 1, so that's plus

144
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,010
1, so that's 5.

145
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,884
Plus-- let me actually write it
down, I'm going to make a

146
00:07:22,884 --> 00:07:26,940
careless mistake --2 times 2,
which is 4, plus 1 times 1,

147
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,370
which is 1, plus 1 times
4, which is 4.

148
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:34,210
Then here, you have minus 1
times 2, which is minus 2, 2

149
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:39,640
times 1, which is 2, plus
1 times 4, which is 4.

150
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:45,790
So A transpose times B is
equal to 9, and this

151
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,090
is going to be 4.

152
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:53,970
So we can rewrite this guy right
here as the matrix A

153
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:54,560
transpose A.

154
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:01,630
Which is just 6, 1, 1, 6 times
my least squares solution-- so

155
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:05,620
this is actually going to be in
the column space of A --is

156
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:12,510
equal to A transpose times B,
which is just the vector 9 4.

157
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,890
And this'll be a little bit more
straightforward to find a

158
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,530
solution for.

159
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,740
In fact, there will
be a solution.

160
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,160
We proved it in the
last video.

161
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,750
So to find a solution, let's
create our little augmented

162
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,450
matrix: 6, 1, augmented
with a 9.

163
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,850
You have the 4 there,
you get a 1 and a 6.

164
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,630
Just like that.

165
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,860
Let's put the left hand side in
reduced row echelon form.

166
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:37,200
Actually, first I'm going
to swap these two rows.

167
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,150
That's my first row operation
that I choose to do, just

168
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,520
because I like to have
that 1 there.

169
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,230
It's a nice pivot entry.

170
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:51,640
So then it goes to 1,
6, 4, and 6, 1, 9.

171
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,180
And then let me replace my
second row with the second row

172
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,180
minus 6 times the first row.

173
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,250
So I'm going to keep my
first row the same.

174
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:05,210
So I have 1, 6, and 4.

175
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:09,190
And then my second row, I'm
going to replace my second row

176
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,610
with a second row minus
6 times the first row.

177
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,480
So 6 minus 6 is 0.

178
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:23,890
1 minus 6 times 6, that's 1
minus 36, so that's minus 35.

179
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:29,250
And then a 9 minus 6 times
4, is 9 minus 24.

180
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,480
This one always gets
me in trouble.

181
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,510
So 9 minus 24, that's the
negative of 24 minus 9, so

182
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:41,460
that is minus 15.

183
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,320
Let me make sure I didn't
make a careless mistake.

184
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:51,930
1 minus 36 is minus 35, 9
minus 24, is minus 15.

185
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:54,710
So that's what I get
right there.

186
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:59,260
And then let me go to the right
now, so let me let me

187
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:04,020
divide this row right here, let
me divide it by minus 35.

188
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,250
So I'm going to keep my
first row the same.

189
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,980
1, 6, and 4.

190
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,190
And then this guy right
here, I'm going to

191
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,300
divide by minus 35.

192
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:16,810
So I'm going to get 0, 1, and
then minus 15 over minus 35.

193
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:21,940
That's 15 over 35, or
that's 3 over 7, so

194
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,620
that is equal to 3/7.

195
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,300
And then let me just put this
in complete reduced row

196
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,110
echelon form.

197
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,840
That'll be nice.

198
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,830
Let me keep my second
row the same.

199
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:39,280
So my second row is
0, 1, and 3/7.

200
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,710
And then my first row, I'm going
to replace it with my

201
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:46,180
first row minus 6 times
my second row.

202
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:51,590
So 1 minus 6 times 0 is 1, 6
minus 6 times 1 is 0, and then

203
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:55,610
we have 4 minus 6 times 3/7.

204
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,990
So 4 is 28/7.

205
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,360
Let me write it up here.

206
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:06,690
So we have 4, which is 28/7,
minus 6 times 3/7, so minus

207
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:07,980
18/7, right?

208
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,220
That's 6 times 3/7.

209
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:18,120
So this is going to
be equal to 10/7.

210
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,590
And just like that, I've solved
this new equation.

211
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:24,010
So you could say that-- Let
me write it this way.

212
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:28,410
We could write that x star--
This is going to the first

213
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,280
entry of x star, which
we could call x,

214
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,300
is going to be 10/7.

215
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,010
Let me write this.

216
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:42,130
x star, the solution is going
to be 10/7 and 3/7.

217
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:45,390
So I'm saying that if you take
x is equal to 10/7 and y is

218
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,210
equal to 3/7, you're going
to get as close to

219
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,490
a solution as possible.

220
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,240
Let's see what that looks
like visually?

221
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,050
What is 10/7?

222
00:11:54,050 --> 00:12:05,330
Let me write this down. x star
is equal to 10/7 and 3/7.

223
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:08,245
We're saying the closest-- Our
least squares solution is x is

224
00:12:08,245 --> 00:12:13,850
equal to 10/7, so x is
a little over one.

225
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:17,320
And then y is going to be 3/7,
a little less than 1/2.

226
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,720
So our least squares solution
is going to be

227
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,860
this one, right there.

228
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:30,510
And so this, when you put this
value for x, when you put x is

229
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:39,080
equal to 10/7 and y is equal
to 3/7, you're going to

230
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,340
minimize the collective squares
of the distances

231
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,600
between all of these guys.

232
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,300
I drew this a little bit
too small to show that.

233
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,790
But let's actually figure out
what our least, what our

234
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:53,670
minimized difference is.

235
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:57,660
Remember, the whole point of
the is to minimize the

236
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:02,370
distance between Ax star, is
to minimize the distance

237
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:05,450
between Ax star and B.

238
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,660
Or between B and Ax star.

239
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,366
Now, what was Ax
star equal to?

240
00:13:11,366 --> 00:13:20,560
Ax star was equal to 9/4.

241
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,250
So this right here.

242
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,730
Sorry, Ax star, that's not
equal to 9/4, that's A

243
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:28,040
transpose Ax star
is equal to 9/4.

244
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,360
Ax star is our original matrix
A, which is this one right

245
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,590
here, so 2-- Let me write
it down here.

246
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,880
I know it's off the
page right now.

247
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:43,410
So our original matrix A was
2, minus 1, 1, 2, 1, 1.

248
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:47,150
That was our original matrix
A right there.

249
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:50,010
And then our x star,
we were able to

250
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:54,710
determine, is 10/7 and 3/7.

251
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:58,240
So Ax star is going to be
this product, so what

252
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,740
does it equal to?

253
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:05,120
It is equal to, it is going
to be a 3 by 1 matrix.

254
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:11,460
So we got 2 times 10/7, which
is 20/7, minus 1 times

255
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:16,010
3/7, so minus 3/7.

256
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:19,830
And then we get, let me see,
yep, that's 10 minus 3/7, and

257
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:28,210
we have 10/7, minus 2 times
3/7, so minus 6/7.

258
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,490
Or plus, sorry, this
is a plus.

259
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:30,850
Right?

260
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:35,280
2 times 10/7 is 20/7 minus 1
times 3/7, then we have 1

261
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,775
times 10/7 plus 2 times 3/7.

262
00:14:37,775 --> 00:14:44,180
And then we have
10/7 plus 3/7.

263
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:48,600
So Ax, so this is A and x
star, our least squares

264
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,450
approximation for x, is
equal to what is this?

265
00:14:53,450 --> 00:15:02,590
This is 17/7, this is 16/7,
and this is 13/7.

266
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,750
We want to find out with this
minimum distance is.

267
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:08,290
So, let's see, this is going
to be this thing.

268
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:17,770
So 17/7, 16/7, and 13/7
minus our original B.

269
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:23,690
Our original B was
2, 1, and 4.

270
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,790
So I'm claiming that my solution
that we just found,

271
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,530
this minimizes this distance.

272
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:32,900
Because this is the projection
of B onto the

273
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,980
column space of A.

274
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,970
We saw that before.

275
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,910
So our B we see all the
way up here is 2, 1,

276
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:41,850
4, just like that.

277
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:46,850
So if we take the length of
this-- let me switch colors

278
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,450
--this is equal to the length.

279
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,530
Let me write all of us
in sevenths-- I'll

280
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,340
just do it in my head.

281
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,280
I don't want to waste
too much time.

282
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:00,150
So this is 17/7 minus
14/7, right?

283
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:03,690
2 is 14/7, so this is
going to be 3/7.

284
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:09,980
Then it's 16/7 minus
7/7, so that's 9/7.

285
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:15,210
And then we have 13/7 minus
28/7, so that is

286
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:19,150
minus 15 over 7.

287
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:23,280
So this is the vector that
separates the B that was not

288
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,970
in my column space of A from
the projection of B.

289
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:31,740
And if we find it's length,
it's length is going to be

290
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:36,710
equal to-- Let's find the square
of it's length first.

291
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:40,900
The square of its length is
going to be 3/7 squared, so

292
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:53,310
that is 9/49, plus 9/7 squared,
which is 81/49, plus

293
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,470
minus 15/7 squared.

294
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,650
What's 15 squared?

295
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:59,860
15 squared is 225, I think.

296
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,440
Let me make sure.

297
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,920
I'm prone to careless
mistakes.

298
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:08,659
5 times 5 is 25, 1 times
5, this is 75, and

299
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:10,180
then I have a 150.

300
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,260
Yep, 225.

301
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:18,109
So plus 225/49.

302
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:24,960
Which is equal to-- So 9 plus 81
is 90, and then so 225 plus

303
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:30,510
90, to get a 5, was a 315.

304
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:35,640
So this is equal to 315/49.

305
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,690
Or, if we actually wanted the
difference, that's going to

306
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,530
square root of this.

307
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:44,130
So if we take just the regular
distance, that's equal to the

308
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,180
square root of that.

309
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:56,250
So it's equal to the square
root of 315 over 7.

310
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,310
And square root of 315,
it looks like that is

311
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,380
simplifiable.

312
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,740
Does 9 go into it?

313
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,880
Looks like 9 goes into it,
maybe 35 five times?

314
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,440
So it would be what, 3 square
roots of 35 over 7.

315
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,680
So that is just a measure.

316
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,500
Let me put it this way, you're
not going to be able to find

317
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:19,150
any member of R2, any values
of x and y, that's going to

318
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:22,660
give you a smaller value than
this when you find the

319
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,260
distance between it's solution
and the solution you were

320
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,040
trying to get to.

321
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:32,300
So this, based on our least
squares solution, is the best

322
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,040
estimate you're going to get.
x is equal to 10/7,

323
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,700
y is equal to 3/7.

324
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,560
A little bit right,
just like that.

325
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,180
Anyway, hopefully you found
that useful, and you're

326
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,620
starting to appreciate that the
least squares solution is

327
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,240
pretty useful.

328
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,400
