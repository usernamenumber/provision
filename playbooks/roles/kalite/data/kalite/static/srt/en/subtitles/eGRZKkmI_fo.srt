1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,510
   

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,920
What I want to do in the next
few videos is try to see what

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,780
happens to a line integral,
either a line integral over a

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,870
scalar field or a vector field,
but what happens that line

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,370
integral when we change the
direction of our path?

6
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,560
So let's say, when I say change
direction, let's say that

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,820
I have some curve C that
looks something like this.

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,760
We draw the x- and y- axis.

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,180
So that's my y-axis, that is
my x-axis, and let's say my

10
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,560
parameterization starts there,
and then as t increases, ends

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,120
up over there just like that.

12
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,230
So it's moving in
that direction.

13
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,130
And when I say I reverse
the path, we could

14
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,350
define another curve.

15
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:44,430
Let's call it minus C, that
looks something like this.

16
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,150
That is my y-axis,
that is my x-axis.

17
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,690
And it looks exactly the same,
but it starts up here, and then

18
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,260
as t increases, it goes down
to the starting point

19
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,370
of the other curve.

20
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,320
So it's the exact same shape
of a curve, but it goes in

21
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,530
the opposite direction.

22
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,310
So what I'm going to do in this
video is just understand how we

23
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,490
can construct a
parameterization like this, and

24
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,010
hopefully understand
it pretty well.

25
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,320
And then next two videos after
this, we'll try to see what

26
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,320
this actually does to the line
integral, one for a scalar

27
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,850
field, and then one
for a vector field.

28
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,430
So let's just say, this
parameterization right here,

29
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,630
let's just define it in the
basic way that we've

30
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:23,500
always defined them.

31
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:29,540
Let's say that this is x is
equal to x of t, y is equal to

32
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:34,280
y of t, and let's say this is
from t is equal, or t,

33
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,670
let me write this way.

34
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,695
t starts at a, so t is
greater than or equal to

35
00:01:39,695 --> 00:01:42,290
a, and it goes up to b.

36
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:47,070
So in this example, this was
when t is equal to a, and the

37
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:55,000
point right here is the
coordinate x of a, y of a.

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,590
And then when t is equal to b
up here, this is really just a

39
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,870
review of what we've seen
before, really just a review of

40
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,270
parameterization, when t is
equal to b up here, this is

41
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:11,160
the point x of b, y of b.

42
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,980
Nothing new there.

43
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,570
Now given these functions, how
can we construct another

44
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,140
parameterization here that has
the same shape, but

45
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,460
that starts here?

46
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,660
So I want this to be,
t is equal to a.

47
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,600
Let me switch colors.

48
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,570
Let me switch to,
maybe, magenta.

49
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:33,460
So I want this to be t is equal
to a, and as t increases, I

50
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,020
want this to be t equals b.

51
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,270
So I want to move in the
opposite direction.

52
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,950
So when t is equal to a,
I want my coordinate to

53
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:49,470
still be x of b, y of b.

54
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,350
When t is equal to a, I want a
b in each of these functions,

55
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,150
and when t is equal to b, I
want the coordinate to

56
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:01,400
be x of a, y of a.

57
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:01,630
Right?

58
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,770
Notice, they're opposites now.

59
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,180
Here t is equal to a, x
of a, y of a, here t is

60
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,700
equal to b, our endpoint.

61
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,460
Now I'm at this coordinate,
x of a, y of a.

62
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,520
So how do I construct that?

63
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,450
Well, if you think about it,
when t is equal to a, we want

64
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,740
both of these functions
to evaluate it at b.

65
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,210
So what if we define our x, in
this case, for our minus C

66
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:27,900
curve, what if we say x is
equal to x of, and when I say x

67
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,700
of I'm talking about the
same exact function.

68
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,240
Actually, maybe I should write
it in that same exact color.

69
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,180
x of-- but instead of putting t
in there, instead of putting a

70
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,340
straight-up t in there, what if
I put an a plus b

71
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,030
minus t in there?

72
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,520
What happens?

73
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,010
Well, let me do it
for the y as well.

74
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:54,310
So then our y, y, is equal
to y of a plus b minus t.

75
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,920
a plus b minus is t.

76
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,600
I'm using slightly different
shades of yellow, might be

77
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,180
a little disconcerting.

78
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,030
Anyway, what happens
when we define this?

79
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:10,000
When t is equal to a, when t is
equal to a, let's say that this

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
parameterization is also
for t starts at a and

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,470
then goes up to b.

82
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,040
So let's just experiment and
confirm that this

83
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,560
parameterization really is the
same thing as this thing,

84
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,070
but it goes in an
opposite direction.

85
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,950
Or at least, confirm in
our minds intuitively.

86
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:32,240
So when t is equal to a, when t
is equal to a, x will be equal

87
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:39,350
to x of a plus b
minus a, right?

88
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:44,040
This is when t is equal to
a, so minus t, or minus a,

89
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,370
which is equal to what?

90
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:50,960
Well, a minus a, cancel out,
that's equal to x of b.

91
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,280
Similarly, when t is equal
to a, y will be equal to

92
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,840
y of a plus b minus a.

93
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,990
The a's cancel out, so
it's equal to y of b.

94
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,860
So that worked.

95
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,480
When t is equal to a, my
parameterization evaluates to

96
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,160
the coordinate x of b, y of b.

97
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,480
When t is equal to
a, x of b, y of b.

98
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,210
Then we can do the exact same
thing when t is equal to b.

99
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,450
I'll do it over here, because
I don't want to lose this.

100
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,690
Let me just draw a line here.

101
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,160
I'm still dealing with this
parameterization over here.

102
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,300
Actually, let me scroll over
to the right, just so that

103
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,380
I don't get confused.

104
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,630
When t is equal to b, when t
is equal to b, what does x

105
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:39,310
equal? x is equal to x of
a plus b minus b, right?

106
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,580
a plus b minus b when
t is equal to b.

107
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,420
So that's equal to x of a.

108
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:52,000
and then when she's able to be
why is equal to lie of a plus b

109
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,080
minus b, and of course, that's
going to be equal to y of a.

110
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,410
So the endpoints work, and if
you think about it intuitively,

111
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:05,010
as t increases, so when t is at
a, this thing is going

112
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,270
to be x of b, y of b.

113
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,990
We saw that down here.

114
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:14,760
Now as t increases, this
value is going to decrease.

115
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,340
We started x of b, y of b, and
as t increases, this value is

116
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,640
going to decrease to a, right?

117
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,940
It starts from b,
and it goes to a.

118
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,370
This one obviously starts
at a, and it goes to b.

119
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,490
So hopefully, that should give
you the intuition why this is

120
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,610
the exact same curve as that.

121
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,270
It just goes in a completely
opposite direction.

122
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,570
Now, with that out of the way,
if you accept what I've told

123
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,540
you, that these are really
the same parameterizations,

124
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,770
just opposite directions.

125
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,050
I shouldn't say same
parameterizations.

126
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,500
Same curve going in an opposite
direction, or same path going

127
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,700
in the opposite direction.

128
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,530
In the next video, I'm going to
see what happens when we

129
00:06:51,530 --> 00:07:00,550
evaluate this line integral, f
of x ds, versus this

130
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,760
line integral.

131
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,020
So this is a scalar field, a
line integral of a scalar

132
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,750
field, using this curve or this
path, but what happens if we

133
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:18,050
take a line integral over the
same scalar field, but we do

134
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,150
it over this reverse path?

135
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,690
That's what we're going
to do in the next video.

136
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:25,510
And the video after that, we'll
do it for vector fields.

137
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,000
