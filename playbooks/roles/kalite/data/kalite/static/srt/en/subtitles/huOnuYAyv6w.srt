1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,180
in the last video we left off with the
assassination of Franz Ferdinand

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:09,079
archduke Franz Ferdinand, of Australia, the heir

3
00:00:09,079 --> 00:00:11,989
the Austro-Hungarian empire.

4
00:00:11,989 --> 00:00:13,919
And so you could imagine

5
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:16,680
the austro-Hungarian empire did not take
that well.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,020
They already did not enjoyed
the kingdom of serbia trying to

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,300
essentially provoke

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,300
this nationalistic movement

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,320
and they view them as this small little
week country right below them.

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,690
And so they use this to essentially
issue an ultimatum. Esentialy say,hey, look

11
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,600
immediately

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,600
bring all the people who did this to
justice all the people who might have

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,879
conspired with

14
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:41,320
the Gavrilo Princip's

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,109
to create to allow this assassination
attempt occur and, and, and and do it

16
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:48,949
or else and except full responsibility.

17
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:52,359
And actually the serbians where, the
kingdom of Serbia wasn't no meed

18
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:56,089
was in no mood to to get into a
war with Austro- Hungary and so they

19
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:57,749
tried their best to comply.

20
00:00:57,749 --> 00:01:03,379
But their best wasn't enough, so then
July twenty-eight, a month later,

21
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:07,880
you have the austrians declaring war on
the serbians.

22
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,680
Austria

23
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,670
declares war

24
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,100
declares war

25
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,750
on Serbia.

26
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,940
Now, up until this point Austria, the
Austro-Hungarian empire, the ok, serbia's

27
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,330
a small kingdom here,

28
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,210
and has some ties, and obviously it's a
slavic nation, so it has some

29
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,659
linguistic ties with the Russian empire.
The Russian empire also had some

30
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:29,950
political ties to it,

31
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,320
but Russia's not going into a war with
the sort of this

32
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,660
where justified in attacking them, they
just killed the heir to our throne.

33
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,170
So we're going to go in there. Russia's
probably not interested in actually

34
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,950
creating a a larger

35
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,940
a larger skirmish year.

36
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:47,210
And that was a severe miscalculation on
the part of the Russian, on the part of

37
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:51,710
the austrians. The Russians were not
happy about this. They felt close ties to

38
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:55,570
the Serbians, and they felt the need to
protect the serbians, or you could argue

39
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,820
that maybe the were, they were they
wanted to mobilize just to scare

40
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,090
the Austrians. Whatever it might be weather
was russia wanted to get into a war

41
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,390
whether they were really looking to
protect the serbians

42
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,630
or whether they were looking to mobilize
to a scare the austrian from actually

43
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,450
attacking

44
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,629
the russians began to mobilize.

45
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:16,749
So russians began to gather
their troop

46
00:02:16,749 --> 00:02:18,799
so the russians

47
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:22,430
russians mobilize

48
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:28,549
mobilize. And now, this is where all of
the alliance's start to come into a fact.

49
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:31,869
If you go if you remember about the
alliances we talked about

50
00:02:31,869 --> 00:02:33,599
several videos ago,

51
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,539
if you go to eighteen seventy nine you
have dual alliance treaty between

52
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:40,230
Germany and Austro- Hungary

53
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,970
to protect each other from Russia's attacks,
and actually if Russia attacks,

54
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:48,340
or mobilizes. So now Germany is like, hey, maybe i am obligated to protect

55
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,640
Austro-Hungary from Russia. You also
have to remember eighteen ninety two,

56
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,090
the franko russian military convention,
military assistance both ways

57
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,599
in the event of attack.

58
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,579
So, the Germany's thinking, look you know we've
sign this treaty,

59
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:06,599
and, we to some degree, are maybe eager for
war, because you've been militarizing

60
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,079
so much,

61
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:08,770
and,

62
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,700
I can't just fight Russia, I also know that
France and Russia have this alliance

63
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:18,330
right over here, so Germany in quite
surprising quickness, decides to declare

64
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,899
war on both.

65
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:21,909
So on August first,

66
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:23,829
on August first,

67
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:24,699
Germany

68
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:27,409
declares war on Russia

69
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:28,779
on...

70
00:03:28,779 --> 00:03:30,269
Russia

71
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:31,590
on Russia,

72
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,849
and then on August

73
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:36,559
and then on August third,

74
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:38,549
August,

75
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:42,539
August third, Germany declares war

76
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:45,459
on France, 'cause they know, or at least they
feel that they can't declare

77
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:48,340
war only one of them. And they want to
do it very quickly, because they didn't

78
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,709
want to Russia a chance to mobilize too
much.

79
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:54,450
And the fact that they will do this so
quickly, I mean we're talking three

80
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:58,300
witnesses three days after Austria
declares war on Serbia, and another two

81
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,890
days declare war in France,

82
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,610
kind of shows that Germany was already in a
war footing. It's not a joke to all of a

83
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,310
sudden invade or to declare war on
country, so Germany was essentially

84
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:11,700
preparing for this. And this this ,right
over here, gave them

85
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,760
the excuse

86
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,239
to essentially declare war.

87
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,850
So they declare war on both of these
characters, Germany against Russia,

88
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,310
Germany's declaring war on France. Now,

89
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,919
the easiest way for them to move into
France, so they're literally going on the

90
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:27,850
offense here,

91
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,780
is for them to go through Belgium is for
them

92
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,289
is for them too

93
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:34,610
go through Belgium.

94
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,469
But the germans were where?

95
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:39,589
There where, that there's a seventy
five-year-old treaty, the treaty of

96
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:42,810
London, in eighteen thirty nine, article
seven said, that Britain

97
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,000
was to protect the neutrality of
Belgium.

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,960
And Germany was a no interest to get
into a war

99
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,930
with the British. the British had a
powerful military, especially a very

100
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,830
powerful, a very powerful navy.

101
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,880
The German said hey let's just take on
the russians and the french from now, for

102
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,740
now, and so that she reached out to the
british and said, hey you know this

103
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,440
little treaty that you got here from
eighteen thirty nine, the seventy

104
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,290
five-year-old treaty, you don't really take
this seriously, right? I mean if we have

105
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:11,100
to go through Belgium you're not really
going to kind of hold true this

106
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,010
treaty? And, and the british said no, we, we
actually take that very seriously.

107
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:15,689
Obviously,

108
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:19,039
the british had didn't want them, the
germans to be aggressive you did the

109
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,680
british didn't want the germans to be
able to invade France.

110
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,639
And, so when

111
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,999
in August

112
00:05:24,999 --> 00:05:27,620
in August forth, on August fourth,

113
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,430
August fourth,

114
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,650
when Germany essentially rolls through
Belgium

115
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,409
Germany invades Belgium,

116
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:39,739
to get to France, this gave the legal

117
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:43,949
justification for the british to declare
war on Germany.

118
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:45,580
British

119
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,770
British

120
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:50,099
declare

121
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,180
war on

122
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,280
Germany.

123
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,300
And so, in a matter of only, I mean not
even, and we're talking in a few months here

124
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,929
from the assassination of

125
00:05:57,929 --> 00:06:00,289
Franz Ferdinand of Austria,

126
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:04,740
you essentially have all of the major powers
of Europe, and that's will see because

127
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,099
they had these empires

128
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:09,660
and and and and and not too long most of
the world as it

129
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,470
war with each other.
