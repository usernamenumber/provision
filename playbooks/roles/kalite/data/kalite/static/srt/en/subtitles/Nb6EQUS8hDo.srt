1
00:00:07,243 --> 00:00:13,659
We're in Tate Britain and we're looking at Lucian Freud's "Standing by the Rags" from 1988-89

2
00:00:13,736 --> 00:00:21,944
It's a pretty big oil and like so many of his canveses it's a very, very forthright nude

3
00:00:21,959 --> 00:00:29,054
Yes she's life-sized and oddly positioned in that he expects her to be lying down

4
00:00:29,054 --> 00:00:33,176
almost viewed from above, you know most nudes are horizontal

5
00:00:33,192 --> 00:00:39,739
So the fact that she's vertical is odd and then we notice she's actually standing and yet leaning. It's very odd

6
00:00:40,096 --> 00:00:45,125
It is. The space is really difficult to read, in part, because the rags give us no indication

7
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:50,709
of space and actually obstruct the angle between the floor and the wall

8
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:52,928
which would give us some kind of clue as to what's going on.

9
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,044
And so she is standing this weight on her feet

10
00:00:56,044 --> 00:00:58,452
But at the same time she is also leaning back leaning back right?

11
00:00:58,452 --> 00:01:01,725
And then she's leaning on, as she says in the taped interview,

12
00:01:01,725 --> 00:01:04,511
she's leaning on a heater, which is actually warming the rags

13
00:01:04,511 --> 00:01:08,226
Apparently this was painted at night, and it must've been exhausting for her

14
00:01:08,226 --> 00:01:11,591
But here's the thing about Freud. I don't think any of that is important for him.

15
00:01:11,622 --> 00:01:17,478
I don't think that there is a conscience interest in dismantling perspective

16
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:23,552
or any of those kinds of goals. I think that his concern was to reveal the experience of

17
00:01:23,552 --> 00:01:27,963
the body itself in the most direct and tangible way.

18
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:30,953
Since we all share the experience of inhabiting a body

19
00:01:30,953 --> 00:01:41,150
his rendering in really the most unsparing way of weight, of fat, of bone, of temperature, of texture

20
00:01:41,303 --> 00:01:47,270
All of those things that experience that is so incredibly immediate and powerful

21
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,032
You know, what I see largely is paint.

22
00:01:49,124 --> 00:01:56,100
I see a body but I'm also simueltaneously seeing paint that is really thick

23
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:02,467
almost stifling of it. Around her face and neck and chest especially,

24
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:05,702
a little bit on her thighs and calves and knees.

25
00:02:05,702 --> 00:02:10,466
But really, the face is almost broken apart by the paint

26
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:13,832
Think about the incredible tradition of painting the nude throughout the history of art.

27
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:16,271
This idealization, this beauty.

28
00:02:16,271 --> 00:02:19,994
And that handling the paint is not only actually conveying

29
00:02:19,994 --> 00:02:24,293
the body but it is also forcing us to rethink all those assumptions

30
00:02:24,293 --> 00:02:26,315
in a pretty violent and aggressive way.

31
00:02:26,315 --> 00:02:28,791
That is absolutely true. You know, we sort of feel like

32
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,563
I don't I want to look at this

33
00:02:30,563 --> 00:02:31,095
Right

34
00:02:31,095 --> 00:02:35,363
You have very immediate, kind of visceral reaction to it.

35
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,416
There's no question.

36
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:41,440
In some ways there's a kind of actuality and realism to the body

37
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,510
and in other ways the body is really quite distorted here.

38
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:51,934
Her feet are too large, her right arm is way too long, and that foreshortening of her forearm and wrist is a little bit off.

39
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,797
There's a kind of distortion.

40
00:02:54,797 --> 00:02:58,515
When I see these kind of distortions in Lucien Freud's work

41
00:02:58,515 --> 00:03:03,394
I see in some ways an attempt to place the body in the most direct way

42
00:03:03,394 --> 00:03:10,031
almost in a perceptually immediate way than a more classically proportioned figure might be.

43
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:13,353
So he is trying to create the reality, in a sense, of that part

44
00:03:13,383 --> 00:03:17,633
That maybe he gets slightly dislocated from another

45
00:03:17,633 --> 00:03:21,196
So there's a kind of confrontation of the viewer

46
00:03:21,196 --> 00:03:21,696
I think that' right.

47
00:03:21,696 --> 00:03:22,496
that's going on

48
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,840
There is no question

49
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,081
She's so close to us too

50
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:28,724
And she's a reflection of who we are, even though we're clothed, we're upright

51
00:03:28,724 --> 00:03:31,947
We may enter into the view of the painting with a

52
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:33,893
kind of properness in a museum context.

53
00:03:33,893 --> 00:03:38,071
Nevertheless this is a kind of revelation of the reality of our own bodies.
