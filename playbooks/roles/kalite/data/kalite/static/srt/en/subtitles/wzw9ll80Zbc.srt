00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
what i want to do in this video is to provide ourselves with a rigorous definition

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:09,460
of what it means to take the limit of a sequence as n approaches infinity

3
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:15,508
and what we'll see is actually very similar to the definition of any

4
00:00:15,508 --> 00:00:22,182
function as a limit approaches infinity and this is because the sequences really can be just viewed

5
00:00:22,182 --> 00:00:25,732
as a function of their indices, so let's say

6
00:00:25,871 --> 00:00:30,302
let me draw an arbitrary sequence right over here

7
00:00:30,302 --> 00:00:33,240
so actually let me draw like this just to make it clear

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,504
but the limit is approaching so let me draw a sequence

9
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:39,573
let me draw a sequence that is jumping around

10
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:43,966
little bit, so lets say when n=1, a(1) is there,

11
00:00:43,966 --> 00:00:50,802
when n = 2, a(2) is there, when n = 3, a(3) is over there

12
00:00:50,802 --> 00:00:59,004
when n=4, a(4) is over here, when n=5 a(5) is over here

13
00:00:59,004 --> 00:01:04,049
and it looks like is n is so this is 1 2 3 4 5

14
00:01:04,093 --> 00:01:08,071
so it looks like that as n gets bigger and bigger and bigger

15
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:13,539
a(n) seems to be approaching, seems to be approaching some value

16
00:01:14,277 --> 00:01:18,373
it seems to be getting closer and closer, seems to be converging

17
00:01:18,373 --> 00:01:23,264
to some value L right over here. What we need to do is come up with a definition of

18
00:01:23,264 --> 00:01:27,363
what is it really mean to converge to L.

19
00:01:27,363 --> 00:01:33,486
So let's say for any, so we're gonna say that you converge to L for any,

20
00:01:33,486 --> 00:01:37,454
for any Îµ > 0, for any positive epsilon, you can,

21
00:01:37,877 --> 00:01:44,819
you can come up, you can get or you can, there is

22
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:52,835
let me rewrite it this way, for any positive epsilon there is a positive,

23
00:01:52,835 --> 00:01:57,989
positive M, capital M, such that,

24
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:07,578
such that if, if, lower case n is greater than capital M,

25
00:02:07,578 --> 00:02:17,269
then the distance between a(n) and our limit, this L right over here

26
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:22,286
the distance between those two points is less than epsilon.

27
00:02:22,286 --> 00:02:25,199
If you can do this for any epsilon, for any epsilon,

28
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:30,117
greater than 0, there is a positive M, such that if n is greater than M,

29
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:33,669
the distance between a(n) and our limit is less than epsilon

30
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:36,288
then we can say, then we can say

31
00:02:36,288 --> 00:02:43,193
that the limit of a(n) as n approaches infinity is equal to L and

32
00:02:43,193 --> 00:02:51,286
we can say that a(n) converges, converges, converges to L.

33
00:02:51,286 --> 00:02:56,500
So let's, let's, let's parse this, so here I was making the claim

34
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,786
that a(n) is approaching this L right over here,

35
00:02:58,786 --> 00:03:01,388
I tried to draw it as a horizontal line.

36
00:03:01,388 --> 00:03:05,794
This definition of the of what it means to converge for sequence to converge

37
00:03:05,794 --> 00:03:09,045
says look for any epsilon greater than zero.

38
00:03:09,045 --> 00:03:14,795
So let me pick an epsilon greater than zero, so I am gonna go to L plus epsilon,

39
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:17,939
actually let me do it right over here, L, so see this is L plus epsilon

40
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:24,353
and let's say this is right here this is L minus epsilon.

41
00:03:24,353 --> 00:03:28,657
So let me draw those two bounds, right over here.

42
00:03:28,657 --> 00:03:32,568
And so I picked an epsilon here so for any,

43
00:03:32,568 --> 00:03:38,831
for any arbitrary epsilon, any arbitrary positive epsilon I pick, we can find a positive

44
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:43,277
M, we can find a positive M, so that as long as,

45
00:03:43,277 --> 00:03:45,755
so let's say that is our M right over there.

46
00:03:45,755 --> 00:03:50,881
So that as long as our n is greater than our M, then our a(n)

47
00:03:50,881 --> 00:03:55,932
our a(n) is within epsilon of L, so being within the epsilon,

48
00:03:55,932 --> 00:03:59,747
being within epsilon of L is essentially being in this range.

49
00:03:59,747 --> 00:04:04,839
This right over here is just saying, look that the distance between a(n) and L is less than epsilon,

50
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:09,618
so that would be any of these, anything that is in this, between L minus epsilon and L plus epsilon.

51
00:04:09,618 --> 00:04:15,292
The distance between that and our limit is going to be less than epsilon.

52
00:04:15,292 --> 00:04:16,992
And we see right over here, at least visually,

53
00:04:16,992 --> 00:04:20,978
if we pick M there and if you can take an n that's larger than that M,

54
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:26,019
if you pick an N that's larger than M, if M is equal to 3, a(n) seems to be

55
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:30,843
close enough. If M is 4, a(n) is even getting closer. It's within our epsilon.

56
00:04:30,843 --> 00:04:36,559
So if we can say, if we can say that it is true, for any epsilon that we pick, then we can say,

57
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:41,528
we can say that the limit exists, that a(n) converges to L.

58
00:04:41,528 --> 00:04:45,528
In the next video we will use this definition to actually prove that a sequence converges.
