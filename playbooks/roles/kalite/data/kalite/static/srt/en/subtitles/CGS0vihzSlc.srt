1
00:00:00,636 --> 00:00:03,187
Solve for y and check your solution

2
00:00:03,187 --> 00:00:07,852
Twenty minus seven 'y' equals six 'y' minus six

3
00:00:07,852 --> 00:00:16,942
So what I really want to do is just isolate all of the 'y's on one side of the equation then if there's some sort of coefficient in front of it, I can divide both sides by that coefficient,

4
00:00:16,942 --> 00:00:21,302
and I can isolate the 'y' on either the left side or the right side of the equation.

5
00:00:21,302 --> 00:00:23,748
Actually let me do it both ways.

6
00:00:23,748 --> 00:00:28,833
So, first, let's... it looks like it'll be a little bit simpler if I isolate it on the right-hand side

7
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,121
and I'll show you that in a second.

8
00:00:30,121 --> 00:00:32,206
So if I want to put all of the y's on the right

9
00:00:32,206 --> 00:00:35,243
hand side, how can I get rid of all the 'y's on the left-hand side?

10
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:38,367
I have a minus seven 'y' or you can use the negative

11
00:00:38,367 --> 00:00:39,302
seven 'y'.

12
00:00:39,302 --> 00:00:43,201
I can add seven 'y' to both sides of this equation, so I'm just

13
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:45,969
adding seven 'y' to both sides.

14
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:50,301
Then the left hand side of the equation you have twenty minus seven 'y' plus seven y.

15
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:53,636
Those are going to cancel out you're going to be just left with twenty.

16
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:55,637
And on the right hand side of the equation

17
00:00:55,637 --> 00:01:00,122
you have six 'y' plus seven 'y' which is thirteen y.

18
00:01:00,122 --> 00:01:03,105
And then you have your minus six.

19
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:08,908
And I want only 'y's or multiples of 'y's on the right hand side of the equation

20
00:01:08,908 --> 00:01:12,367
so I have to get rid of this minus six over here.

21
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:15,708
So let's add six to both sides of this equation.

22
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:20,302
Let's add six and then on the right hand

23
00:01:20,302 --> 00:01:22,564
side, I have thirteen 'y' minus six, plus

24
00:01:22,564 --> 00:01:25,876
six, that's just thirteen 'y'. Got rid of the minus.

25
00:01:25,876 --> 00:01:32,126
Then I have twenty plus six, so that's twenty-six. So I get twenty-six is equal to thirteen 'y'.

26
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:33,622
I have isolated the 'y'

27
00:01:33,622 --> 00:01:36,102
on the right hand side although it's to be multiplied by thirteen.

28
00:01:36,102 --> 00:01:38,236
So if I just want a 'y'

29
00:01:38,236 --> 00:01:40,953
on the right hand side, one 'y' on the right hand side.

30
00:01:40,953 --> 00:01:43,125
I can divide both sides by thirteen.

31
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:48,458
Or the equivalent statement would be to multiply both sides by one over thirteen, same thing.

32
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:52,039
So let's divide both sides of this equation by thirteen.

33
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:56,968
On the right-hand side, thirteen times 'y' divided by thirteen, that's just going to be 'y'.

34
00:01:56,968 --> 00:01:59,042
So this is just 'y'.

35
00:01:59,042 --> 00:02:01,453
And then twenty-six divided by thirteen

36
00:02:01,453 --> 00:02:03,036
that is two.

37
00:02:03,036 --> 00:02:05,638
So our solution we got is 'y' is equal to two.

38
00:02:05,638 --> 00:02:11,014
Now I'm going to take a step back, why did I say it was going to be a little easier to put the 'y'

39
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:12,949
on the right hand side of the equation.

40
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:16,981
That way I have a positive coefficient in terms of 'y'.

41
00:02:16,981 --> 00:02:20,683
If I had subtracted six 'y'

42
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:23,958
from both sides, I would have got a negative thirteen on both sides, which would have been a legitimate t

43
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:24,862
thing to do

44
00:02:24,862 --> 00:02:26,738
Let me just show you, what I'm talking about.

45
00:02:26,738 --> 00:02:28,428
So I could have done the problem this way:

46
00:02:28,428 --> 00:02:29,612
Twenty
