1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Over which interval does y(x) have an average rate of change of -4?

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So... average rate of change, if you think about it... you're literally just averaging (for example), this bowl section right over here.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The slope is really really steep, it gets less steep... very negatively sloped.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It gets less negative, less negative...

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Slope is 0 here. Then it gets positive... more positive, and more positive... and more positive.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But when you get to this point right over here... You see you got to where you started from.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the average... One, you could say the average... the net change has been 0.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And any interval over which the net change has been 0, also tells you that the average rate of change is going to be 0.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So you could view that the average rate of change is really the slope of the line that connects the 2 endpoints of your interval.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So another way of asking, "Over what interval does y(x) have an average rate of change of -4?" is: "Can you come up with an interval where the slope between the endpoints of the interval is -4?"

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's see what choices they give us.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This first interval is x is between -1 and 1 (-1< x <1). So this is X < -1. When X = -1... y(x) is all the way over here.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Y(-1) = 7

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Then when X = 1, our graph is down over here.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Y(1) = -1
