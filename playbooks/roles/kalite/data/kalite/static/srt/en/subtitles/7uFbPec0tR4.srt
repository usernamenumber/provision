1
00:00:06,317 --> 00:00:13,718
My name is Marc Ecko. I am by nature, an artist.

2
00:00:14,334 --> 00:00:19,995
I came up at a time when there was a very unique window in popular culture.

3
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:25,707
Hip hop was emerging. There's an entrepreneurial virus that is hip hop,

4
00:00:25,907 --> 00:00:28,562
that rock and roll didn't quite have in the same way.

5
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:32,386
There was a little more self-loathing amongst the rock set,

6
00:00:32,386 --> 00:00:35,048
in terms of the commercialization of their work.

7
00:00:35,048 --> 00:00:39,781
Where in hip hop, it's been embraced to go create industry around your ideas.

8
00:00:39,781 --> 00:00:44,573
It's become a part of the ecosystem, because it's coming from nothing, right?

9
00:00:44,757 --> 00:00:50,324
And there's kind of this implied element of social justice, as well, in the business,

10
00:00:50,324 --> 00:00:53,205
born out of, like, what is hip hop and street culture.

11
00:00:53,205 --> 00:00:56,621
So, that's kind of baked into the DNA of what we do.

12
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:01,932
I love this fact that folks are making something from nothing, in my peer set.

13
00:01:02,578 --> 00:01:06,645
We're founding value, basically in the ether amongst themselves.

14
00:01:06,645 --> 00:01:10,395
Four rappers will get together, rhyme in a circle, and all of the sudden

15
00:01:10,395 --> 00:01:13,691
it's like "Oh, let's make a mix tape". Like, from nothing.

16
00:01:13,938 --> 00:01:18,388
I wanted to fit into the ecosystem. I couldn't rap, I couldn't breakdance, right?

17
00:01:18,388 --> 00:01:24,537
But I did connect to art, so I kind of started to parrot the art of graffiti.

18
00:01:25,676 --> 00:01:30,646
And started painting t-shirts. I love the emotive - the feedback.

19
00:01:30,646 --> 00:01:37,168
Both the financial feedback, that someone would pay me, as 15 year old kid, to make them this t-shirt.

20
00:01:37,168 --> 00:01:40,243
And then they would wear it with such pride, and kind of beat their chest.

21
00:01:40,243 --> 00:01:45,283
There was that kind of emotional transaction that was really powerful

22
00:01:45,283 --> 00:01:48,472
and created the feedback loop to want me to go and dig deeper.

23
00:01:48,472 --> 00:01:55,225
and pull on that thread, to keep on unfolding what eventually became this path of entrepreneurship.

24
00:01:55,225 --> 00:01:59,770
It wasn't like I onboarded because someone said "Be an entrepreneur!"

25
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:03,890
Right? I onboarded because I wanted to realize my dream.

26
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:10,170
I was an emotional, artistic kid, and graffiti was kind of the extreme sport of art.

27
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:14,449
That was a moment of luck for me, so when people are "Oh, graffiti is a gateway to crime"

28
00:02:14,449 --> 00:02:18,397
Right? For me, it was a gateway to entrepreneurship. Go figure.

29
00:02:18,397 --> 00:02:22,736
I've really kind of been a curator of, like, pop culture.

30
00:02:22,736 --> 00:02:29,891
for let's say, males, 16-40. And that's been my lane, having come up in the 80's

31
00:02:29,891 --> 00:02:37,448
around hip hop and skateboarding culture - kind of the emergence of technology.

32
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:40,784
I've just kind of trafficked in my hobbies.

33
00:02:40,784 --> 00:02:44,313
The things I consumed, as a kid, are now the business.

34
00:02:44,313 --> 00:02:47,895
Young people know, instinctively, what it is they need to do.

35
00:02:47,895 --> 00:02:49,744
Just need to go out there and get it done.

36
00:02:49,744 --> 00:02:56,558
Shifting from what is effectively a consumer mindset, to believing in themselves to be a producer.

37
00:02:56,558 --> 00:03:04,771
Going from "I am consumer of X" to "I am maker of Y".

38
00:03:04,771 --> 00:03:10,202
That's an aspiration that is amongst all of us, but some of us, we just don't know how to do it.

39
00:03:10,202 --> 00:03:11,835
We kind of doubt ourselves.

40
00:03:11,835 --> 00:03:15,278
Why is it that you go to a classroom of Kindergartners

41
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,730
You ask them &quot;Who in this room is an artist?&quot;

42
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,548
Everybody raises their hand.

43
00:03:18,548 --> 00:03:22,170
You ask that same cohort, 20 years later, no one raises their hand. Maybe one guy.

44
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,729
They look at him like he's a freak.

45
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:25,590
Something is wrong there.

46
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:28,958
You have to connect to your artist, your instigator.

47
00:03:29,112 --> 00:03:33,042
You know, it's right brain, it's left brain, it's chocolate, it's peanut butter. You have to find that.
