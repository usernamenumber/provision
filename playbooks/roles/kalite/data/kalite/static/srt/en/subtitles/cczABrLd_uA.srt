1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,114
what I want to start thinking about in this video

2
00:00:03,114 --> 00:00:08,113
is giving that we do having monopoly on something in this example in this video

3
00:00:08,113 --> 00:00:10,515
we're going to have a monopoly on oranges

4
00:00:10,515 --> 00:00:12,071
giving that we have monopoly on oranges

5
00:00:12,071 --> 00:00:15,765
and the demand curve for oranges in the market

6
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:18,767
how to we maximize our profit?

7
00:00:18,767 --> 00:00:23,025
To answer that questions, we're gonna think about our total revenue for different quantities

8
00:00:23,025 --> 00:00:25,889
and from that we're gonna get the marginal revenue for different quantities

9
00:00:25,889 --> 00:00:28,430
and that we can compare that to our marginal cost curve

10
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:34,385
and should give us a pretty good sense of what quantity we should produce to optimize things

11
00:00:34,385 --> 00:00:37,104
so let's just figure out total revenue first

12
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:38,732
so obviously if we produce nothing

13
00:00:38,732 --> 00:00:41,498
if we produce zero quantity, we have nothing to sell

14
00:00:41,498 --> 00:00:44,636
we know total revenue is price times quantity

15
00:00:44,636 --> 00:00:46,698
your price is six, your quantity is zero

16
00:00:46,698 --> 00:00:51,422
so your total revenue is going to be zero if you produce nothing

17
00:00:51,422 --> 00:00:53,136
and if you produce one unit

18
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,995
and this over here is actually one thousand ponds per day

19
00:00:55,995 --> 00:00:58,533
we'll call it unit ponds per day

20
00:00:58,533 --> 00:00:59,983
if you produce one unit

21
00:00:59,983 --> 00:01:03,902
then your total revenue is one unit times five dollars per pond

22
00:01:03,902 --> 00:01:06,203
so that will be five times, actually, one thousand

23
00:01:06,203 --> 00:01:08,507
so that will be five thousand dollars

24
00:01:08,507 --> 00:01:13,135
and you can also view it as the area of this rectangle over here

25
00:01:13,135 --> 00:01:16,905
you have the height is the price, and the width is the quantity

26
00:01:16,905 --> 00:01:19,213
but we can that five times

27
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:22,533
whenever you produce one unit, you gonna get five thousand dollars

28
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:27,531
so this right over here is in thousands of dollars

29
00:01:27,531 --> 00:01:33,902
and this right over here is in thousands of ponds

30
00:01:33,902 --> 00:01:36,505
just to make sure we are consisted this right over here

31
00:01:36,643 --> 00:01:37,669
let's keep going

32
00:01:37,669 --> 00:01:43,355
so that was this point, when we produce one thousand ponds we get five thousand dollars

33
00:01:43,355 --> 00:01:46,722
if we produce two thousand ponds

34
00:01:46,722 --> 00:01:51,369
and now we are talking about our price is going to be four dollars

35
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:56,168
or we can say our price is four dollars we can sell two thousand ponds, given this demand curve

36
00:01:56,168 --> 00:02:00,053
and our total revenue is going to be the area of this rectangle right over here

37
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,818
height is price width is quantity

38
00:02:01,818 --> 00:02:03,540
four times two is eight

39
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,274
so if I produce two thousand ponds

40
00:02:06,274 --> 00:02:10,214
then I will get a total revenue of eight thousand dollars

41
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:16,284
so this is seven and a half, eight is going to put a something right about there

42
00:02:16,284 --> 00:02:17,952
and then we can keep going

43
00:02:17,952 --> 00:02:22,314
if I produce, or if the price is three dollars per pond

44
00:02:22,314 --> 00:02:24,384
I can sell three thousand ponds

45
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,782
my total revenue is this rectangle right over here

46
00:02:27,782 --> 00:02:30,783
three times three is nine thousand dollars

47
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:35,765
so if I produce three thousand ponds, I can get a total revenue of nine thousand dollars

48
00:02:35,765 --> 00:02:39,799
so right about there, and let's keep going

49
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:45,899
if I produce, or the price is two dollars per pond

50
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:51,917
I can sell four thousand ponds, my total revenue is two times four, which is eight thousand dollars

51
00:02:51,917 --> 00:02:56,365
so if I produce four thousand ponds, I can get a total revenue of eight thousand dollars

52
00:02:56,365 --> 00:03:00,830
that should be even with that one right over there, just like that

53
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:06,487
and then if I produce, or if the price is one thousand dollars

54
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:07,427
let me use a new color

55
00:03:07,427 --> 00:03:10,197
the price is one dollar per pond I should say

56
00:03:10,197 --> 00:03:13,520
I can sell five thousand ponds

57
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,014
my total revenue is gonna be one times five or five thousand dollars

58
00:03:18,014 --> 00:03:19,816
so it's gonna be even with this here

59
00:03:19,816 --> 00:03:23,568
so if I produce five thousand units I'm gonna get five thousand dollars of revenue

60
00:03:23,568 --> 00:03:29,969
and if the price is zero, the market will demand six thousand ponds per day

61
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:33,563
it's free, but I'm not gonna generate any revenue because I'm gonna be given this away for free

62
00:03:33,563 --> 00:03:37,747
so I will not be generating any revenue in the situation

63
00:03:37,747 --> 00:03:45,445
our total revenue curve it looks like, if you are taking algebra you recognize this as a downward facing parabola

64
00:03:45,445 --> 00:03:50,697
our total revenue looks like this

65
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:54,622
our total revenue...easier for me to draw curve with dotted line

66
00:03:54,622 --> 00:03:58,536
our total revenue looks something like that

67
00:03:58,536 --> 00:04:03,488
and you can even solve with algebraically that solve that this is a downward facing parabola

68
00:04:03,488 --> 00:04:08,585
the formula right over here of the demand curve is y-intercept is six

69
00:04:08,585 --> 00:04:10,669
so if I wanna right price as a function of quantity

70
00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:16,792
we have price is equal to six minus quantity

71
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:20,760
or if you wanna right in a traditional slope intercept form, or "mx plus b" form

72
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,878
and if that doesn't make any sense you might wanna review some of our algebra play

73
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:28,882
that you can right as P is equal to negative Q plus six

74
00:04:28,882 --> 00:04:31,271
Obviously these are the same exact thing

75
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:36,505
you have y-intercept of six and you have a negative one slope

76
00:04:36,505 --> 00:04:41,056
if you increase quantity by one, you decrease price by one

77
00:04:41,056 --> 00:04:45,418
or another way to think about it, if you decrease price by one, you increase quantity by one

78
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:48,399
so that's why you have a negative one slope

79
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,468
so this price as a function of quantity

80
00:04:50,468 --> 00:04:57,961
what is total revenue? well, total revenue is equal to price times quantity

81
00:04:57,961 --> 00:05:01,004
but we can write price as a function of quantity, we did it just now

82
00:05:01,004 --> 00:05:07,231
now this is what it is, or we can rewrite it or we can even be written like this

83
00:05:07,231 --> 00:05:17,500
we can rewrite the price part as... so this is going to be equal to negative Q plus six times quantity

84
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,983
and this is equal to total revenue

85
00:05:19,983 --> 00:05:26,839
and if you multiply this out, you get total revenue is equal to Q times Q is negative Q squared

86
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:30,357
plus six Q

87
00:05:30,357 --> 00:05:33,699
so you might recognize this, this is clearly a quadratic

88
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:39,947
since you have a negative out front before the second degree term right over here before the Q squared

89
00:05:39,947 --> 00:05:42,370
it is a downward opening parabola

90
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,216
so it makes complete sense

91
00:05:44,216 --> 00:05:46,922
now I wanna leave you there in this video

92
00:05:46,922 --> 00:05:50,454
because I 'm trying to make an effort not to make my video too long

93
00:05:50,454 --> 00:05:57,609
but in the next video, we're gonna think about is "what is the marginal revenue we get for each of this quantity"

94
00:05:57,609 --> 00:05:59,883
just as a review

95
00:05:59,883 --> 00:06:10,830
marginal revenue is equal to change in total revenue divided by change in quantity

96
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,265
or another way to think about it

97
00:06:12,265 --> 00:06:19,257
the marginal revenue at any one of these quantities, is the slope of the line tangent to that point

98
00:06:19,257 --> 00:06:23,871
and you really have to do a little bit of calculus in order to actually calculate slopes of tangent line

99
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:26,930
but we'll approximate with a little bit of algebra

100
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:30,706
but since you want to do is to figure out the slope, so we're gonna figure out the marginal revenue

101
00:06:30,706 --> 00:06:35,519
when we're selling one thousand ponds, so exactly how much more total revenue do we get

102
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:41,352
if we just barely increase, if we just start selling another a million double ponds of oranges

103
00:06:41,352 --> 00:06:43,171
what's going to happen?

104
00:06:43,171 --> 00:06:50,488
so what we do is we're trying to figure out the slope of the tangent line at any point that you can see that

105
00:06:50,488 --> 00:06:54,316
cause the change in total revenue is this

106
00:06:54,316 --> 00:07:01,034
and change in quantity is that there's

107
00:07:01,034 --> 00:07:04,051
so we're trying to find the instantaneus slope with that ponit

108
00:07:04,051 --> 00:07:06,935
or you can think of it as the slop of the tangent line

109
00:07:07,058 --> 00:07:11,000
and we will continue doing that in the next video
