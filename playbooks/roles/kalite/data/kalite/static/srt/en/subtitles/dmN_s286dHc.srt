1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
We're on problem 151.

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,860
If x and y are positive,

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,060
is the ratio of x to y greater than 3?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,830
And they're telling us that x and y are positive.

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,220
Fair enough. Statement one.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,360
x is 2 more than 3 times y.

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,060
So x is equal to 3y plus 2.

8
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,230
Let's rewrite the original question

9
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,110
because I think it's going to look a lot like this.

10
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,460
If we multiply y times both sides of the equation--

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,940
and we don't have to change the inequality

12
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,580
because they told us that y is positive.

13
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,710
They're both positive.

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,830
So if you multiply both sides of the equation times y,

15
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,820
you get x is greater than 3y.

16
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,380
This is the same question as this.

17
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,050
Well, if we look at statement number one,

18
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,130
clearly x is greater than 3y.

19
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,440
Because x is 2 more than 3y based on statement number one.

20
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,060
So statement number one is sufficient to answer this question

21
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,850
x is definitely greater than 3y.

22
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:06,820
x actually equals 3y plus 2.

23
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,820
This plus 2 tells you that x is that much greater.

24
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,500
2 greater. Second statement.

25
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:21,700
The ratio of 2x to 3y is greater than 2.

26
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,610
Let's just do some algebraic manipulation.

27
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,530
3y, once again, we know that's positive.

28
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,810
So when we multiply both sides of the equation by it,

29
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,080
we don't have to switch the sign.

30
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:35,560
So you get 2x is equal to 6y.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,930
Now we can divide both sides by 2.

32
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,680
And you get-- oh, sorry,why did I put equals?

33
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,250
It should be greater than.

34
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,810
Divide both sides by 2 and you get x is greater than 3y.

35
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,770
So this statement and this statement are the same thing,

36
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,940
so 2 alone is also sufficient.

37
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,500
So either statement alone is sufficient

38
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,250
to answer this or this question.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,570
152.

40
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,540
OK, if arc PQ-- OK, let me see if I can draw this.

41
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,330
So they've drawn a semicircle.

42
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,970
So let me draw a circle.

43
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,330
That's a circle, and I can make it a semicircle

44
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:19,620
by drawing a line from there to there.

45
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,870
That's about as good as I can do.

46
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,550
And they have it connecting to some point.

47
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,660
Let me see if I could do this.

48
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,480
Looks like that.

49
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,060
And then it looks like that.

50
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,460
And then they actually have drawn an altitude

51
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,510
coming down like that.

52
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,960
And I think I've done all my line drawing.

53
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,390
And then, let's see, they labeled this P.

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,100
They labeled this Q. They labeled this R. And this is 2.

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,460
And they say that this distance right here is a.

56
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,150
This distance right here.

57
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,260
And then they say that this distance right here is b.

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,880
Fair enough.

59
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,940
So they say if arc PQR-- so that's that arc right there--

60
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,550
is a semicircle, what is the length of diameter PR?

61
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,340
So they essentially want to know what a plus b is, right?

62
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,280
That's PR. So that's their question.

63
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,930
So immediately-- well let's just look at their statements.

64
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,010
What did they give us?

65
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,920
Statement one, they tell us that a is equal to 4.

66
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,660
So from knowing that a is equal to 4,

67
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,110
if we can figure out what b is,

68
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,410
then we would know what a plus b is and we would be done.

69
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,190
Well, let's see if we can do that.

70
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:41,190
Statement two is b is equal to 1.

71
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,760
So if we know what b is,

72
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,540
and then we can figure out a from it,

73
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,380
then we know what a plus b is.

74
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,710
So actually, I think if either of these is sufficient,

75
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,190
the other one probably is.

76
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,980
Because if statement one is sufficient--

77
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,230
if knowing a we can figure out b,

78
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,370
then probably knowing b we could figure out a.

79
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,980
But let's see if that holds.

80
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,180
So one thing that immediately should pop out of your head,

81
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,570
although I don't know if it will--

82
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,170
and this pops out of my head, really,

83
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,460
from going to math competitions when I was a kid.

84
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,370
But if you have a triangle inscribed in a semicircle,

85
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,560
that triangle-- and one of its sides is a diameter, right?

86
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,050
And that's the case with this one.

87
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,250
Because we know it's a semicircle,

88
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,810
so we know that this is the diameter--

89
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,610
then that triangle is a right triangle.

90
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,620
This is a right triangle.

91
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,110
Even the way they drew it, it kind of looks like that.

92
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,390
But you that's something you should know.

93
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,030
Even if this triangle was drawn like that,

94
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,910
it's always going to be a right triangle.

95
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,300
And I'll maybe do another YouTube video proving that.

96
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,940
But that's just a good thing to know for the gmat.

97
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,490
So let's see if we could use that information

98
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,520
and the Pythagorean theorem to come up with a formula

99
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,030
that relates a and b.

100
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:53,760
So if we look at just this triangle right there,we know what?

101
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:59,500
We know that a squared plus 4 is equal to--

102
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:05,980
let's call this side c squared-- is equal to c squared.

103
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,710
Fair enough.

104
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,720
If we look at this smaller triangle right here,

105
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:17,710
we know that b squared plus 4 is equal to--

106
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,030
let's call this d squared,

107
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,280
that's the hypotenuse of the smaller triangle--

108
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,720
is equal to d squared.

109
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,840
Now, if we look at the larger triangle,

110
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,310
which we also know is a right triangle,

111
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:34,380
now c squared and d squared are the non-hypotenuse sides,

112
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,790
and a plus b is a hypotenuse side.

113
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:42,060
So we know that c squared plus d squared is equal to

114
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:48,140
this entire side squared, which is a plus b squared.

115
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,270
Well, we know what c squared and d squared are.

116
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,270
We can substitute that.

117
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,060
So c squared is a squared plus 4--

118
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,240
and I'll switch colors just to avoid the monotnony.

119
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,840
So c squared is a squared plus 4.

120
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,710
And d squared is b squared plus 4.

121
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,570
And all of that's equal to a plus b squared.

122
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,970
Let's just multiply that out

123
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,330
because I think we can do some canceling.

124
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:21,530
So we get a squared plus 2ab plus b squared.

125
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,470
OK. So, we could subtract a squared from both sides.

126
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,350
a squared, a squared.

127
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,630
Subtract b squared from both sides.

128
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,560
b squared and b squared.

129
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,120
And this simplifies out quite nicely. Let's see.

130
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,210
4 plus 4 is 8, is equal to 2ab.

131
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:47,630
Divide both sides by 2, and you get ab is equal to 4.

132
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,160
So all of this crazy information,

133
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,000
that this is inscribed in the semicircle and this is a,

134
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,830
this is b, all of that reduces down to ab is equal to 4.

135
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,220
So now we know.

136
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,530
If we know a, if a is 4,

137
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,780
then we know that b has to be equal to 1.

138
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,670
And then we can figure out what a plus b is. It's 5.

139
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,450
So statement one alone is sufficient.

140
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,130
And similarly, if we know what b is,

141
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,630
we know that a has to be 4.

142
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,880
And so a plus b is equal to 5.

143
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,240
So that was actually less hairy than I thought going into it.

144
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,970
Next problem.

145
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,320
And this really is the home stretch.

146
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,000
153.

147
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:33,550
Does the integer k have a factor p such that

148
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,820
1 is less than p is less than k.

149
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,310
OK, so they're essentially saying, is k prime?

150
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,990
This is another way of saying is k--

151
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,830
or you could say, is k not prime?

152
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,140
Or k is composite. I think that's the word for it.

153
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,710
A non-prime number. So that's all they're asking.

154
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,490
Does k have some other factor other than 1 and itself.

155
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,200
So let's see, statement number one.

156
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,080
k is greater than 4 factorial.

157
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,880
Well, 4 factorial is 4 times 3 times 2 times 1.

158
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,770
So that's 12 times 2. That's 24.

159
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,970
So this boils down to k is greater than 24.

160
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,360
So I can give you both prime

161
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,470
and non-prime numbers greater than 24.

162
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:23,060
29 is prime. 30 is not prime.

163
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,610
So statement one, at least by itself, is pretty useless.

164
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,150
k can be greater than 24 and be prime or not prime.

165
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:36,990
Statement two. This looks interesting.

166
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:40,280
13 factorial-- which is a large number,

167
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,380
so it's hard to multiply it out--

168
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:47,630
plus 2 is less than or equal to k,

169
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:56,110
which is less than or equal to 13 factorial plus 13.

170
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:01,280
So, essentially, what we need to prove, somehow,

171
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:06,730
is that every number between this and this is not prime.

172
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,900
And let's think about how we can do it.

173
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:14,320
Well, let's take the initial example of 13 factorial plus 2.

174
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,640
So 13 factorial, just so you know, is 13 times 12,

175
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:24,580
times 11-- you keep going-- times 3 times 2 times 1.

176
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,620
That's 13 factorial.

177
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,070
So 13 factorial is definitely divisible by 2.

178
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,690
So we could rewrite 13 factorial. We could write that as--

179
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:43,380
13 factorial divided by 2 times 2 plus 2.

180
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,540
I just rewrote 13 factorial plus 2.

181
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,730
And I want you to see that this is the same thing, right?

182
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,650
I just divided by 2 and multiplied by 2.

183
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,860
And you'll see in a second why I did that.

184
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,220
And this is a tricky problem.

185
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,500
When I looked at this at first,

186
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,460
which I actually did glance at before the video,because--

187
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,390
I don't know if this is something I would have gotten right

188
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,080
if I was under time pressure on the gmat.

189
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,880
But when I thought about it a little bit more it made sense.

190
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,290
So if I divide by 2 and times 2,I could--

191
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,360
and this is going to be an integer.

192
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,850
Because we know that 13 factorial is divisible by 2.

193
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,550
2 is actually one of its factors.

194
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,790
So as long as you understand where I got--

195
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,320
you can divide anything by 2 and multiply by 2

196
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,390
and not change it So this is the same thing as this.

197
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:31,610
And then if we factor the 2 out,

198
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:41,640
this becomes 2 times 13 factorial over 2 plus 1.

199
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,300
I just factored the 2 out. This isn't a fraction.

200
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,250
That's just a line I did just to not make it look too messy.

201
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,560
So what we show is that

202
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,450
13 factorial plus 2 is definitely divisible by 2.

203
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,550
Whatever that number is, it's definitely divisible by 2.

204
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,430
And how do I know that?

205
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,140
Because this is just another way of writing

206
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,930
13 factorial divided by 2.

207
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,730
I'm sorry, this is another way--let me write this down--

208
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,200
this is the same thing as 13 factorial plus 2.

209
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,350
It's just another way of writing it.

210
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,320
I took 13 factorial divided by 2 and multiplying by 2,

211
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,850
and then taking out the 2.

212
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,860
And the reason why I know that 2 is divisible into this is

213
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,400
because I know that this is an integer.

214
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,740
We know that 13 factorial is divided by 2

215
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,710
because 2 is one of the things that goes into it.

216
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,900
And so this is an integer. You add 1. So this is an integer.

217
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,060
And so you're multiplying 2 times some integer.

218
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,870
So this has to be divisible by 2.

219
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,520
So 13 factorial plus 2 is divisible by 2.

220
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,630
Now let's just extend that generally.

221
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,980
13 factorial plus x.

222
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:47,640
Let's prove that as long as x is less than or equal to 13

223
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,540
that this is divisible by x.

224
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,820
So we can do the same trick.

225
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:57,170
You could say this is equal to 13 factorial divided by x,

226
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,310
times x plus x.

227
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,890
That's equal to-- you can factor the x out--

228
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:08,830
x times 13 factorial over x plus 1.

229
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,530
And how do we know that this number,

230
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,170
which is the same thing as this number,

231
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,320
how do we know that this is divisible by x?

232
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,260
Well, just a little thought experiment.

233
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:24,770
We know as long as x is greater than or equal to 1

234
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:30,510
and less than or equal to 13, and x is an integer.

235
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,190
As long as x is an integer that's greater than

236
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,310
or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 13,

237
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:38,320
it is one of the factors of 13 factorial.

238
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,440
13 factorial is 13 times 12 times 11.

239
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,530
It's all of those numbers multiplied together.

240
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:46,010
So we know that as long as x is less than or equal to 13,

241
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:49,250
we know that this right here,this is an integer.

242
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,830
If this is an integer,

243
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,600
then the integer plus 1 is also an integer.

244
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,020
So 13 factorial plus x can be rewritten as

245
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:01,060
x times some integer. I'll call it I.

246
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:05,070
But the bottom line is, the reason why I wanted to do that,

247
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:10,800
it shows you that every number between 13 factorial plus 2

248
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:17,430
and 13 factorial plus 13 is actually divisible

249
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,880
by whatever number you're adding to the factorial.

250
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,190
So since it's divisible by those numbers,

251
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,130
the numbers cannot be prime.

252
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,190
So hopefully-- I've actually run way over time--

253
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:31,530
but hopefully I've shown you that that information alone,

254
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:32,630
statement two alone,

255
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:38,420
is sufficient to show that k is not prime

256
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:42,980
or that k does have a factor p that's between 1 and k.

257
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,340
Anyway, I hope didn't confuse you.

258
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,830
I think that was one of the hardest problems we've done,

259
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,790
so don't feel bad if you found that a little daunting.

260
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,480
See you in the next video.
