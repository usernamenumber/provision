1
00:00:01,003 --> 00:00:06,484
We are asked what time is it?

2
00:00:06,484 --> 00:00:11,988
So we first want to look at the hour hand which is the shorter hand here and see where it is pointing.

3
00:00:11,988 --> 00:00:17,663
And it is pointing right at Seven, so we have just crossed the seventh hour.

4
00:00:17,663 --> 00:00:19,877
So the hour is Seven.

5
00:00:19,877 --> 00:00:22,492
and then we look at the minute hand, which is the longer hand.

6
00:00:22,492 --> 00:00:27,012
and this minute hand is pointing straight up, right at 12. So this means...

7
00:00:27,012 --> 00:00:35,068
..when you think of the minutes,..That's zero minutes past the hour. Each number represents five more minutes.

8
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:41,600
So this is right at 7 'o' clock.

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,901
Let's check our answers and do a few more of these..

10
00:00:43,901 --> 00:00:46,069
Where is the hour hand?

11
00:00:46,069 --> 00:00:51,276
This hour hand, you might say, hey, this looks closer to eight, than it is to seven.

12
00:00:51,276 --> 00:00:57,072
But the key is to realize that it has passed seven, and hasn't gotten quite to eight yet.

13
00:00:57,072 --> 00:01:01,675
So, we are still in the seventh hour. So the hour is seven.

14
00:01:01,675 --> 00:01:04,676
Notice that these hands go in a clock-wise direction.

15
00:01:04,676 --> 00:01:08,492
So just past seven hasn't gotten to eight yet.

16
00:01:08,492 --> 00:01:12,152
So the hour is seven and when we want to think about the minutes, remember...

17
00:01:12,152 --> 00:01:12,893
   

18
00:01:12,893 --> 00:01:17,312
.. we started at the top of the clock, that's zero minutes past the hour.

19
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:21,336
and then we can count by fives all the way to where the minute hand is.

20
00:01:21,336 --> 00:01:26,809
So, Zero, Five, Ten, Fifteen, Twenty,

21
00:01:26,809 --> 00:01:28,733
Twenty-Five, Thirty, Thirty-Five, Forty,

22
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:32,340
Forty-five. We are forty-five minutes past the hour.

23
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,754
So it's Seven - Forty Five.

24
00:01:36,754 --> 00:01:39,743
Let's do a couple more. So where is the hour hand?

25
00:01:39,743 --> 00:01:43,084
Well, its between the one and the two but the key is..

26
00:01:43,084 --> 00:01:46,676
to realize that it was going clock wise, it has passed the one and..

27
00:01:46,676 --> 00:01:50,477
.. it is about to get to two. So it is still in the first hour.

28
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:53,067
So the hour is still one. And then the minutes...

29
00:01:53,067 --> 00:01:58,647
we just have to count from Zero by Fives.

30
00:01:58,647 --> 00:02:00,673
So Zero, Five, Ten, Fifteen,..

31
00:02:00,673 --> 00:02:08,203
.. Twenty, Twenty-Five, Thirty, Thirty Five, Forty, Forty Five.. It is One-Forty Five PM..

32
00:02:08,203 --> 00:02:11,067
Let's do one more

33
00:02:11,067 --> 00:02:15,739
So here once again, the hour hand is between one and two.

34
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:17,897
So it's past one but hasn't gotten to two yet.

35
00:02:17,897 --> 00:02:20,564
So we are still in the first hour. And then the minutes...

36
00:02:20,564 --> 00:02:24,535
.. Well we start at 12, that's zero minutes past the hour.

37
00:02:24,535 --> 00:02:28,899
Zero, Five, Ten, Fifteen.

38
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:31,484
So it is One - Fifteen.

39
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,566
Let's do even one more.

40
00:02:34,566 --> 00:02:38,673
So this one, the hour hand is exactly at two.

41
00:02:38,673 --> 00:02:43,564
and the minute hand is exactly at twelve.

42
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:47,564
That means we are zero minutes past the hour.
