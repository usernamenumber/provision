1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,146
What I have attempted to draw here is

2
00:00:04,146 --> 00:00:07,796
a unit circle

3
00:00:07,796 --> 00:00:09,844
and the fact I'm calling it a

4
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:12,261
"unit circle" means it has a radius of one

5
00:00:12,261 --> 00:00:16,912
so this length here from the center, and I've centered it at the origin,

6
00:00:16,912 --> 00:00:23,743
this length, from the center to any point on the circle is of length one.

7
00:00:23,743 --> 00:00:30,279
so what would this co-ordinate be right over there? Right where it intersects along the x axis?

8
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:34,262
well X would be one, Y would be zero (1,0)

9
00:00:34,262 --> 00:00:36,395
what would this co-ordinate be up here?

10
00:00:36,395 --> 00:00:40,261
well we've gone one above the origin, but we haven't moved to the left or the right...

11
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:43,629
so our X value is zero, our Y value is one.

12
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:45,612
what about back here?

13
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:49,462
well here our X value is negative-one, we've moved one to the left

14
00:00:49,462 --> 00:00:52,245
and we haven't moved up or down so our Y value is zero

15
00:00:52,245 --> 00:00:54,260
and what about down here?

16
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,994
well, we've gone one unit down (one below the origin)

17
00:00:58,994 --> 00:01:04,694
but we haven't moved in the X direction... so our X is zero, and our Y is negative-one.

18
00:01:04,694 --> 00:01:08,162
now with that out of the way, I'm going to draw an angle...

19
00:01:08,162 --> 00:01:13,478
and the way I'm going to draws this angle- I'm going to define a convention for positive angles.

20
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:20,228
I'm going to say a positive angle, well the initial side of the angle, we're always going to draw along the positive X axis.

21
00:01:20,228 --> 00:01:26,444
so this is the... you can kind of view it as the starting side of the angle (the initial side of an angle)

22
00:01:26,444 --> 00:01:35,661
and then to draw a positive angle the terminal side we going to move in a counter-clockwise direction

23
00:01:35,661 --> 00:01:39,296
so a positive angle- means we're going counter clockwise

24
00:01:39,296 --> 00:01:41,929
...counter clockwise...

25
00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:46,462
this is just the convention I'm going to use, and it's also the convention that is typically used,

26
00:01:46,462 --> 00:01:50,661
and so you can imagine that a negative would move in a clockwise

27
00:01:50,661 --> 00:01:52,181
...clockwise... direction.

28
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:54,744
so let me draw a positive angle

29
00:01:54,744 --> 00:02:00,912
a positive angle might look, something like this. (this is the initial side)

30
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:07,512
and then from that I go in a counter-clockwise direction until I measure out the angle...

31
00:02:07,512 --> 00:02:09,295
and this is the terminal side.

32
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,180
so this is a positive angele- "theta"

33
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,812
and what I want to do is think about this point of intersection,

34
00:02:15,812 --> 00:02:19,797
between the terminal side of this angle and my unit circle.

35
00:02:19,797 --> 00:02:23,261
and let's just say it has the co-ordinates (a,b)

36
00:02:23,261 --> 00:02:28,978
the X value (where it intersects) is "a", the Y value (where it intersects) is "b"

37
00:02:28,978 --> 00:02:33,295
and I'm also, the whole point of what I'm doing here is,

38
00:02:33,295 --> 00:02:38,729
I want to see how this unit circle might be able to help us extend our traditional definitions of trig-functions

39
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:43,545
and so what I want to do is... I want to make this "theta" part of a "right-triangle" (right-angled triangle)

40
00:02:43,545 --> 00:02:48,678
so to make it part of a "right-triangle" let me draw up an altitude...

41
00:02:48,678 --> 00:02:51,210
right over here, and let me make it clear that-

42
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,662
this is a 90 degree agle

43
00:02:54,662 --> 00:02:58,345
so this "theta" is part of this right triangle

44
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:03,578
so! let's see what we can figure out about the sides of this "right-triangle"

45
00:03:03,578 --> 00:03:06,145
so the first question I have to ask you is-

46
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:15,279
What is the length of the hypotenuse? (of this "right-triangle" that I have just constructed)

47
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:20,095
well this hypotenuse is just a radius of a unit circle!

48
00:03:20,095 --> 00:03:21,662
the unit circle has a radius of one

49
00:03:21,662 --> 00:03:25,278
so the the hypotenuse has length one!

50
00:03:25,278 --> 00:03:28,628
now what is the length of this blue side right over here?

51
00:03:28,628 --> 00:03:34,546
this blue side which you could view as the opposite side to the angle...

52
00:03:34,546 --> 00:03:42,779
well this height is the exact same thing as the Y co-ordinate of this point of intersection.

53
00:03:42,779 --> 00:03:46,679
so this height right over here is going to be equal to "b"

54
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:51,078
(the Y co-ordinate over here is "b"; this height is equal to "b")

55
00:03:51,078 --> 00:03:55,662
now, exact same logic: what is the length of this base going to be?

56
00:03:55,662 --> 00:03:59,860
the base just of the "right-triangle"?

57
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,278
well this is going to be the X co-ordinate of this point of intersection

58
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:07,528
and if you were to drop this down... this is the point: X equals "a"

59
00:04:07,528 --> 00:04:15,161
or this whole length between the origin and that, is of length "a".

60
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:17,260
now that we have set that up-

61
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:32,994
What is the co-sine of my angle going to be? (in terms of a's and b's and any other number that might show up)

62
00:04:32,994 --> 00:04:36,411
well to think about that we just need our "SOH CAH TOA" definition

63
00:04:36,411 --> 00:04:40,180
that's the only one we have now (we're actually in the process of extending it)

64
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,594
..."SOH CAH TOA" definition of trig-functions...

65
00:04:44,594 --> 00:04:47,645
and the "CAH" part is what helps us with co-sine; it tells us...

66
00:04:47,645 --> 00:04:52,879
that the co-sine of an angle is equal to the length of the adjacent side, over the hypotenuse

67
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,545
so what's this going to be?

68
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:59,412
the length of the adjacent side, for this angle... the adjacent side has length "a"

69
00:04:59,412 --> 00:05:01,779
so it's going to be equal to "a", over...

70
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:03,694
what's the length of the hypotenuse?

71
00:05:03,694 --> 00:05:05,761
well that's just one...

72
00:05:05,761 --> 00:05:09,328
so the co-sine of "theta" is just equal to "a"

73
00:05:09,328 --> 00:05:11,494
...let me write this down again...

74
00:05:11,494 --> 00:05:15,578
so the co-sine of "theta"... is just equal to "a"...

75
00:05:15,578 --> 00:05:21,678
it's equal to the X co-ordinate of where the terminal side of this angel intersected the unit circle.

76
00:05:21,678 --> 00:05:23,829
now let's think about the sine of "theta"!

77
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:28,862
... and I'm going to do it in (let me see)... I'll do it in orange!

78
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:34,961
so what's the sine of "theta" going to be?

79
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:38,545
well, we just have to look at the "SOH" part of our "SOH CAH TOA" definition

80
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:41,744
it tells us that sine is: opposite, over hypotenuse.

81
00:05:41,744 --> 00:05:49,011
well the opposite side here has length "b", and the hypotenuse has length one...

82
00:05:49,011 --> 00:05:55,261
so our sine of "theta" is equal to "b"

83
00:05:55,261 --> 00:06:02,678
so an interesting thing! This point where our terminal side of our angle intersected the unit circle at point (a,b)

84
00:06:02,678 --> 00:06:04,745
we can also view this, as...

85
00:06:04,745 --> 00:06:11,137
"a" is the same thing as co-sine of "theta"

86
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:16,490
and "b" is the same thing as sine of "theta"

87
00:06:16,535 --> 00:06:19,237
well that's interesting, we just used our "SOH CAH TOA" definition.

88
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,658
now, can we in some way use this to extend "SOH CAH TOA" ?

89
00:06:24,658 --> 00:06:26,326
because "SOH CAH TOA" has a problem...

90
00:06:26,326 --> 00:06:31,510
it works out fine if our angle is greater than zero degree's (if we're dealing with degrees)

91
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:36,725
and if it's less than 90 degrees we can always make it part of a "right-triangle"

92
00:06:36,725 --> 00:06:42,942
but "SOH CAH TOA" starts to break down as our angle is either zero, or even becomes negative

93
00:06:42,942 --> 00:06:46,542
or as our angle is 90 degrees or more.

94
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:49,625
you can't have a "right-triangle" with two 90 degree angles in it!

95
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,891
it starts to break down... let me just make this clear...

96
00:06:52,891 --> 00:06:57,109
so sure! this is a "right-triangle", so the angle is pretty large-

97
00:06:57,109 --> 00:07:00,059
I can make the angle even larger and still have a "right-triangle"

98
00:07:00,059 --> 00:07:03,942
or even larger- but I can never quite get to 90 degrees!

99
00:07:03,942 --> 00:07:07,991
at 90 degrees it's not clear that I have a "right-triangle" anymore, it all seems to break down...

100
00:07:07,991 --> 00:07:12,309
and especially the case- what happens when I go beyond 90 degrees...

101
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:16,389
so let's see if we can use what we said up here,

102
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:19,660
let's set up a new definition of our trig-functions,

103
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:25,360
which is really an extension of "SOH CAH TOA" and is consistant with "SOH CAH TOA"

104
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,010
instead of defining co-sine as "oh if I have a right-triangle, which is the adjacent over the hypotenuse"

105
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:34,692
and saying "sine is the opposite over the hypotenuse, tangent is the opposite over the adjacent"

106
00:07:34,692 --> 00:07:42,359
why don't I just say: for any angle, I can draw it in the unit circle using this convention I've just set up.

107
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:51,984
and say that: the co-sine of our angle is equal to the X co-ordinate where we intersect.

108
00:07:56,792 --> 00:08:02,030
or where the terminal side of our angle intersects the unit-circle.

109
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:17,409
I'll write... Where the terminal side of the angle intersects the unit-circle...

110
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:23,809
and why don't we define sine of "theta" to be equal to the Y co-ordinate

111
00:08:23,809 --> 00:08:28,477
where the terminal side intersects the unit circle.

112
00:08:28,477 --> 00:08:34,456
so essentially for any angle- this point is going to define co-sine of theta and sine of theta

113
00:08:34,456 --> 00:08:37,475
and so what would be a reasonable definition for tangent of theta?

114
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:44,875
well, tangent of theta (even with SOH CAH TOA) could be defined as "sine of theta, over co-sine of theta"

115
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:53,808
which in this case is just going to be the Y co-ordinate, where we intersect the unit circle, over the X co-ordinate.

116
00:08:53,808 --> 99:59:59,999
in the next few video's I'll show some examples where we use the unit circle definition to start evaluating some trig-ratios...
