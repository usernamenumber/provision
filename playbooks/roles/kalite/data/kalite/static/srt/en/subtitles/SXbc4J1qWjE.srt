1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,460
   

2
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,180
Let's explore another mechanism
that we can have

3
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:03,760
with the ketone.

4
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,180
And actually, an aldehyde can
undergo a very similar or

5
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,230
actually the same type
of reaction.

6
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:13,380
So let's say that I had a ketone
that looked like this.

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,780
Let me draw my carbonyl group,
just like that, and then it is

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,390
bonded to a carbon
that is bonded to

9
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,680
two other CH3 groups.

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,320
And just to make it clear,
there's three hydrogens off of

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,500
this carbon there implicitly.

12
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,590
But I'm going to draw the fourth
bond here, which is to

13
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,180
a hydrogen, because this
hydrogen is going to be

14
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,630
important for this reaction.

15
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,490
Now, we know that the
oxygen has two

16
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,200
lone pairs of electrons.

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,590
Let me draw it up here.

18
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,270
And let's just imagine it's
floating around in some water,

19
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,340
and we know that in water
there is some

20
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,180
concentration of hydronium.

21
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,540
And let's say that one of the
hydroniums is right over here.

22
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,400
Hydronium is just positively
charged, so

23
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,920
this is right here.

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,890
Let me do it in a
different color.

25
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,320
This is what water looks like.

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,500
And if water gives away an
electron to a proton,

27
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,790
it looks like this.

28
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,430
It is hydronium, and then
it only has one

29
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,330
lone pair of electrons.

30
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,890
It gave away one of the other
electrons in its other lone

31
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,670
pair to a proton.

32
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,010
So you can imagine a reality,
where it's like, hey, I could

33
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,810
grab that proton from this
hydronium, and then this will

34
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,280
turn back into water, and in
that situation, the mechanism

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,485
would look like this.

36
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:27,360
Let me do it in a
different color.

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,060
This blue electron gets given
to this proton, if they just

38
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,930
bump into each other just right,
and then the hydrogen's

39
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,650
electron gets taken
back by what will

40
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,540
become a water molecule.

41
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,410
So if that happens, what do our
molecules now look like?

42
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,650
So now, what was a ketone looks
a little bit different

43
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,350
than a ketone.

44
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,910
It looks like this.

45
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,400
I changed it to a slightly
lighter color of green, so it

46
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,660
looks like that.

47
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,390
We have our lone pair over here,
but we no longer have

48
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,570
this lone pair.

49
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,990
At this end, we still have this
magenta electron, but now

50
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,889
it is in a covalent bond with
the blue electron, which was

51
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:11,490
now given to the hydrogen
proton.

52
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,525
Let me scroll up a little bit.

53
00:02:12,525 --> 00:02:17,230
It was given to this hydrogen
proton up here.

54
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:21,010
   

55
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,860
And then this hydronium
molecule, it took back an

56
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,280
electron, and now it is
just neutral water.

57
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,000
   

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,360
It took back that magenta
electron, so now it has two

59
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,350
lone pairs again, so it
is just neutral water.

60
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,730
Since this oxygen up here in the
carbonyl group gave away

61
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,165
an electron, it now has
a positive charge.

62
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:46,920
   

63
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,680
But this is actually resonance
stabilized.

64
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,670
You could maybe see that this
would be in resonance, or

65
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:59,760
another resonance form of this
would be-- if this guy's

66
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,290
positive, so he wants to gain an
electron, so maybe he takes

67
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,830
an electron from this carbon,
the carbon in the carbonyl

68
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:07,810
group right over there.

69
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,420
So if you takes that electron,
then the other resonance form

70
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,370
would look like this.

71
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,460
Let me doing it in
the same colors.

72
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:20,150
You have now only a single bond
with this oxygen up here.

73
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,430
This carbon down here is still
bonded to the same carbons,

74
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,480
and then this carbon over here,
we could call this an

75
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,600
alpha carbon.

76
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,110
This is an alpha carbon
to the carbonyl group.

77
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,290
It still has a hydrogen on
it right over there.

78
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:37,010
And this oxygen, since it gained
this magenta electron,

79
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,260
now it has two lone pairs.

80
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,660
It has this pair over there,
and then it gained this

81
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,200
electron and this electron, so
it has another lone pair.

82
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,510
And, of course, it has the
bond to the hydrogen.

83
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,660
Since it gained an electron,
it is now neutral.

84
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,710
This carbon lost an electron,
so now it is positive.

85
00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:01,040
So now this carbon right over
here is positive, and these

86
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,020
two are two different resonance
forms, so they help

87
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:03,970
stabilize each other.

88
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,480
And the reality is actually
someplace in between.

89
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,950
I could actually draw it in
brackets to show that these

90
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,500
are two resonance structures.

91
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,320
Now, you can imagine, just as
likely-- and actually, I

92
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,920
shouldn't just draw this as a
one-way arrow, because this

93
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,200
guy could take a hydrogen from
this hydronium, or a water

94
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,470
could take a hydrogen from this
guy, so this actually

95
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,680
could go in both directions.

96
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,620
So let me make that clear.

97
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,835
This could go in both
directions.

98
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:32,890
You could say that they're in
equilibrium with each other.

99
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,740
You're just as likely to go in
that direction as you really,

100
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,070
for the most part, are to go
on the other direction.

101
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:41,060
But you can now imagine, this
has now turned from a carbonyl

102
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,740
group, this has now an OH group,
this has now turned

103
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,520
into an alcohol, although we
have this carbocation here,

104
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,920
that this does not like
being positive.

105
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,690
And so you could imagine where
this electron right here on

106
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,760
this hydrogen nucleus might want
to go really bad to this

107
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,720
carbocation, and it just needs
something to nab the proton

108
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,240
off for it to go there.

109
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,970
And the perfect candidate
for that would

110
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,240
just be a water molecule.

111
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,550
We have this water floating
around, so let me draw another

112
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,680
water molecule, just
like this.

113
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,440
It has two lone pairs.

114
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,290
It can act as a weak base.

115
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,930
It can give one of
its electrons to

116
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,240
this hydrogen proton.

117
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,830
If it does that at the exact
same time, bumps into it in

118
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:27,860
the exact same way, this
electron can then go to the

119
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,960
carbocation.

120
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,980
And if that happened, you could
go in either direction.

121
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,130
This reaction is just as
likely to happen as the

122
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,150
reverse reaction, so we could
put this in equilibrium.

123
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,710
   

124
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,990
But if that were to happen, then
what started off as our

125
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,510
ketone now looks like this.

126
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:53,970
We have a bond to an OH group
just like this, and over

127
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,770
here-- actually, let me
draw the rest of it.

128
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,130
We had our molecule that looked
like that, but now,

129
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,860
this electron gets giving back
to this carbocation.

130
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:07,940
We now have a double bond here
between what was a carbonyl

131
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,780
carbon and our alpha carbon.

132
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,130
So now we have this double
bond right over here.

133
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:16,320
   

134
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,320
That hydrogen has been
taken by the water,

135
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,680
and now that is hydronium.

136
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,990
So let me draw the water
or the hydronium.

137
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,270
So that water, it had that one
lone pair, and then the other

138
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,570
lone pair got broken up, because
it gave one of the

139
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,270
electrons to this hydrogen right
over here, and it went

140
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,850
back to being hydronium.

141
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:35,700
So what happened here?

142
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:42,270
We started with a ketone, and
they sometimes will call this

143
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:46,040
the keto form of the molecule,
and then we ended up with

144
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,050
something called
the enol form.

145
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,620
   

146
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:59,690
An enol comes from the fact that
it is an alkene that is

147
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,545
also an alcohol.

148
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,110
You could even call
it an alkenol.

149
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,960
It has a double bond, and on one
of the carbons that has a

150
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,960
double bond, it has
an OH group.

151
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,870
And the whole reason I show you
this mechanism is, one,

152
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,870
just to show you a mechanism
that could happen with an

153
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,260
aldehyde or a ketone.

154
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,590
This was a ketone, but if this
was a hydrogen right here,

155
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,570
this would have been occurring
with an aldehyde.

156
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,380
But even more, this is a pretty
common mechanism that

157
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,950
you'll see in organic chemistry
classes, and

158
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,430
actually has a lot of functions

159
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,260
in biology, in general.

160
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:31,670
And these two molecules, this
ketone and this enol form,

161
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,920
these are called tautomers.

162
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:38,740
   

163
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,400
And the keto form is actually
the much more stable form.

164
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,800
In a solution, you won't see
much of the enol form, but

165
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,575
these can occur.

166
00:07:46,575 --> 00:07:50,440
It can spontaneously through
equilibrium get to

167
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,320
the actual enol form.

168
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,870
And so you could imagine, these
are tautomers, so this

169
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:58,210
mechanism is actually called a
tautomerization, and these are

170
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:01,620
the keto and enol forms
of the tautomers.

171
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,870
