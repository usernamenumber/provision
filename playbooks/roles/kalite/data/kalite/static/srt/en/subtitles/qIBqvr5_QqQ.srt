99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In this video I will attempt to prove or -actually in the next several

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
videos attempt to prove a special case version

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of stokes' theorem or essentially stokes'

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
theorem for a special case and I'm doing this

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because that the proof will be a little bit

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
simpler but at the same time it's pretty convincing

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the special case we're going to assume is

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that the surface we're dealing with is function

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of x and y so if you give me any particular x and y

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it only determines one point on that surface

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so a surface like this would be the case

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so it's kind of a mapping of this region of the x y

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
plane into three demensions so for any x y we can

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
figure out the height so essentially z is going to be a function of

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
x and y and we can get a point on the surface

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this proof would not apply to a surface

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that's like a sphere or something like that where any

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
point on the x y plane could actually determine two

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
points on our surface but this is a pretty good start

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the other thing that we are going to assume, we are going to assume

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that z which is essentially a function of x and y

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that this function of x and y has continuous

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
second order derivatives so continuous

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
second derivatives and the reason why I'm

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
going to make that assumption

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is it's going to help us in our proof later on

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's going to allow us to say " that the partial of our surface

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or the partial of z with respect to x and then taking the derivative of that

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with respect to y is going to be the same as

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the partial of z with respect to y and taking the n

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
derivative of that with respect to x

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and in order to be able to make this statement we have to

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
assume that z or or z right over here z is a function of

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
x and y has continuous second order derivatives

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and over here we've just written our vector field f

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that we're going to deal with when we're trying

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to play with stokes' theorem

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we'll assume that it has continuous first-order

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
derivatives now with that out of the way

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let's think about what stokes' theorem tells us,

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then we'll think about for this particular case

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
how we can write it out and hopefully

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we will see the two things are equal!

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let me write it out

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so stoke's theorem tells us that

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if x dot dr over some path

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the path that we care about is essentially

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this path right over here I'll do it in blue

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's this path right over here

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is the boundary this is the boundary

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of our surface

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this is c right over here

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
stokes' theorem tells us that this should be the same

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
thing this should be equivalent to the surface

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
integral over our surface

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
--over our surface of curl of f--- curl of f DOT ds

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
dot- dotted with the surface itself

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so in this video I want to focus

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or probably this and the next video

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I want to focus on the second half

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I want to focus this I want to see how we

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
can express this given the assumptions

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we've made and then after that we're going to

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
see how we can express this given the same assumptions

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then hopefully we'll find that we get them to

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
be equal to each other!

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so let's just start figuring out what the curl

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of f is equal to

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the curl of f

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the curl of f

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is equal to

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you can view it as the dell operator crossed

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with our vector field f which is equal to

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
can write our components so i- let's do it in different colors-

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
i, j and k components

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
i j and k components and then I need to

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
write my dell operator or my partial

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
operator or my partial operator as I guess I could call them

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the partial with respect to x

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the partial with respect to y

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the partial with respect to z

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then I have to write i, j and k

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
components of my vector field f

84
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I will do that in gre- well, I'll do that in blue

85
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so we have p which is a function of x y and z

86
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
q which is a function of x y and z

87
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and r which is a function of x y and z

88
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so this is going to evaluate as

89
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's going to be i* so blank out that column that row

90
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's going to be the partial of r with respect to y

91
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
minus the partial of q with respect to z

92
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then checkerboard pattern

93
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
minus j and then times the partial of r
