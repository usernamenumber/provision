1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,530
   

2
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,810
We're asked to simplify m to
the third and then that

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,600
squared all over mx to the
third all of that to the

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,580
fourth power.

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,330
And they want us to
express our answer

6
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,490
in exponential form.

7
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,090
And then they tell us that m
does not equal zero and x does

8
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,110
not equal zero.

9
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,560
Because if they did, then this
denominator would be equal to

10
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,310
zero if either of them
did and then that

11
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,590
would just be undefined.

12
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,600
So that's what they have to put
that little caveat there.

13
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,170
That neither of them are going
to be equal to zero.

14
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,890
So let's try to simplify this.

15
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:30,690
Let me rewrite it.

16
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:35,690
So the numerator is m to
the third squared.

17
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:47,520
And our denominator is mx to the
third to the fourth power.

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,490
Now let's just work on each
of these independently.

19
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:53,530
What is m to the third and then
that to the second power?

20
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,150
Well if you raise something to
an exponent, and then raise

21
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,560
that whole thing to another
exponent, this is going to be

22
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,730
the same thing.

23
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,720
So this numerator up here
is going to be m to

24
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,180
the 3 times 2 power.

25
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,340
Or m to the sixth power.

26
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,670
We're raising it to third
and then squaring it.

27
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,400
And if you think about it, this
expression right here--

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,950
let me just do a little
aside here.

29
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,340
M to the third squared, there's
no magic behind why

30
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,280
were multiplying that.

31
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,890
If you think about m to the
third squared, this is the

32
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:26,620
same thing as m to the third
times m to the third.

33
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,050
And if you saw something
like this, you would

34
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,160
add these two exponents.

35
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,860
3 plus 3.

36
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,140
You have exactly two 3's here.

37
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,330
If this was 4, you would be
multiplying it four times.

38
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,710
So you'd have four 3's.

39
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,380
So that's why we're multiplying
these two

40
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,720
numbers, 3 times 2.

41
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,780
So that gives us
m to the sixth.

42
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,660
And then the denominator here,
we have mx to the third to the

43
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,920
fourth power.

44
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,230
Now in general, when you have
the product of some numbers,

45
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:54,720
and you're raising the entire
product to some exponent, you

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,750
can raise each of the terms
to that exponent.

47
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,610
So this denominator right here,
this is going to be m to

48
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:05,200
the fourth times x to the
third to the fourth.

49
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,674
I'm just raising both of these
terms, m to the fourth x to

50
00:02:08,674 --> 00:02:10,669
the third, to the
fourth power.

51
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,700
Now, what does this
simplify to?

52
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,200
Well, our numerator is
still m to the sixth.

53
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,370
I'll do one step at a time.

54
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,135
Our denominator is
m to the fourth.

55
00:02:22,135 --> 00:02:25,920
But we have x to the third and
then that to the fourth power.

56
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,040
So we can multiply these.

57
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,230
3 times 4.

58
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:33,650
So this is x to the 12th power,
so times x to the 12th.

59
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:37,130
Now, we have an m to the sixth
in the numerator and an m to

60
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,750
the fourth in the denominator.

61
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,400
You can view this as the same
thing as m to the sixth times

62
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,540
m to the negative four,
either way.

63
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:52,110
But we know, or hopefully we
know, that this right here can

64
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,130
be simplified as m to the
sixth minus 4 power.

65
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,580
So this is going to be equal
to-- so the numerator, we

66
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:04,600
could have m to the sixth minus
4, which is m squared.

67
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,480
That's what this
simplifies to.

68
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:13,600
And the denominator we still
have an x to the 12th.

69
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,460
And we're done.

70
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,020
If we don't want something in
the denominator, we could

71
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,500
rewrite this x to the 12th in
the denominator as x to the

72
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,890
negative 12th in
the numerator.

73
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:25,660
So we could rewrite this whole
expression as being equal to m

74
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:31,390
squared times x to
the negative 12.

75
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,180
Either of these would be
an acceptable answer.

76
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:34,333
