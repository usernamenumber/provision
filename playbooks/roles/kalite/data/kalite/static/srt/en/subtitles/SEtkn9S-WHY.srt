1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,030
We're on problem 138.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,660
At a loading dock, each worker on the night crew

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,650
loaded 3/4 as many boxes as each worker on the day crew.

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:14,040
So that means that the boxes per night crew worker

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,890
is equal to 3/4 the number of boxes per day crew worker.

6
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:19,650
Fair enough.

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:25,520
If the night crew has 4/5 as many workers as the day crew--

8
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,470
the number of night crew workers is going to be

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,330
4/5 times the number of day crew workers.Fair enough.

10
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,350
What fraction of all the boxes loaded

11
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,810
by the two crews did the day crew load?

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,380
So, how many boxes will the day crew load?

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,880
The day crew is going to load the number of day crew workers

14
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,440
times the boxes per day crew worker.

15
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,580
And they want to know

16
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,780
what fraction of all of the boxes loaded is this?

17
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,350
So that'll be the numerator,

18
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,160
and the denominator will be all the boxes loaded.

19
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,760
So all the boxes loaded are going to be the

20
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,520
boxes loaded by the day crew.

21
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,910
So that's the number of workers times the boxes per worker,

22
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,350
plus the number of boxes loaded by the night crew.

23
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,590
That's going to be the number of night crew workers

24
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,150
times the number of boxes per night crew worker.

25
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,000
And to simplify this,

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,120
if we could just substitute these variables with things

27
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,860
that look a lot more like that. And lo and behold,

28
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,280
we have easy substitutions to tell us what b sub n is,

29
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,800
the boxes per night crew worker.

30
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,360
And they tell us what the number of night crew workers are

31
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,620
in terms of the day crew workers.

32
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,480
So let's just substitute. So this is equal to

33
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:45,240
day crew workers times boxes per day crew worker,

34
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,640
divided by day crew workers times boxes per day crew workers,

35
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,560
plus, what is the number of night crew workers?

36
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,650
It's w sub n, but that's the same thing as 4/5 w sub d.

37
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,540
And then what are the number of boxes per night crew worker?

38
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,120
That's 3/4 times the boxes per day crew worker.

39
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,960
The 4's cancel out.

40
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,580
Actually, we could simplify this.

41
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,060
We can divide the top and the bottom

42
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:31,060
by this w sub d times b sub d, and you get 1 over 1 plus--

43
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,900
all of these cancel and you're just left with 3/5.

44
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:44,170
That's equal to 1 over 8/5,which is equal to 5/8.

45
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:54,040
And that is choice E. Next problem, 139.

46
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:04,360
A restaurant meal costs $35.50 and there is no tax.

47
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,820
If the tip was more than 10%

48
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:15,600
but less than 15% of the cost of the meal,

49
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,390
then the total amount must have been--

50
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:21,000
So what's the range for the tip? 10% of $35.50.

51
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,620
That's just going to be $3.55.

52
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:29,150
And 15%-- there's a couple ways you can think about it.

53
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,240
You could say it's half more than this,right?

54
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,470
What's half of this?

55
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:39,830
Half of this is $1.77 1/2.

56
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,440
I think that's right.

57
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,660
Really, you can't get a half-cent. Is that right?

58
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,210
2 times that, you get 2.

59
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:56,290
And 2 times 70 is $1.40.

60
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,060
Right, so this would be 5%.

61
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,220
I just took half of this That's how people do it.

62
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,220
Half of 10%.

63
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,540
If where you live,

64
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,640
the tax is 10%, but I don't want to get into that.

65
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:18,070
So if you add this to this, you get 4, 5, 12, 13, and 5.

66
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:27,430
So the tip is going to be between $3.55 and $5.33,

67
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,480
I guess we could say.

68
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,430
And so the total bill, that's what they want to know,

69
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,590
we just add both of these.

70
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:38,750
So at minimum, you're going to pay what's this plus $35?

71
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:49,380
So $35.50 and $3.55. 5, 10, 9. $39.05.

72
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:55,030
And at the high end,you have $35.50.

73
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,980
And then you have $5.33.

74
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:07,380
And that is equal to 3, 8, 0, 1, 4.

75
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:13,620
So your total bill is going to be between $39 and $41.

76
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,680
And that is exactly choice B.

77
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,490
They just round up.

78
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,040
They say $41 is here and $39 is here.

79
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,410
If it's between these 2 numbers,

80
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,260
it's definitely between $39 and $41.

81
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:30,280
And that's choice B. Problem 140.

82
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,190
In a weightlifting competition,

83
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:38,230
the total weight of Joe's two lifts was 750.

84
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:44,620
So l1, his first lift plus the second lift was 750 pounds.

85
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:49,730
If twice the weight of the first lift was 300--

86
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:59,640
If 2 times the first lift was equal to 300 more

87
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,300
than the weight of his second lift,

88
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,270
what was the weight in pounds of his first lift?

89
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,880
So we just want to solve for l1.

90
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:18,410
So this top equation we can rewrite as

91
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:23,260
l2 is equal to 750 minus l1.

92
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,060
Then we can substitute that here.

93
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:31,360
So then you get 2 times l1 is equal to 300 plus l2,

94
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,850
which is this, plus 750 minus l1.

95
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,850
Add l1 to both sides.

96
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:41,650
You get 3 l1 is equal to 300 plus 750.

97
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,550
That's 1,050.

98
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,860
And 3 goes into 1,050--

99
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:55,200
3 times 3 is 9, 15, 3 goes into 15 5 times, so it's 350.

100
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:01,690
So his first lift was 350 pounds. And that's choice D.

101
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,240
Problem 141.

102
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,640
A club collected exactly $599 from its members.

103
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,890
If each member contributed at least $12,

104
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:21,810
what is the greatest number of members the club could have?

105
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,410
So the more that each member contributed,

106
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:32,060
the smaller you the number of people in the club.

107
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,790
If each member contributed at least $12--

108
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,920
so what is the greatest number of members

109
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,980
the club could have?

110
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:43,210
So if they all contributed exactly $12--

111
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:56,250
12 goes into 600 50 times.

112
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,960
So if this number were $600, you could say

113
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:12,850
if $600 were collected in increments of at least $12,

114
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,190
then you could have at most 50 people.

115
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,590
But we don't have $600.

116
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:25,500
$600 would be 50 times 12. We have $599.

117
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:32,860
$599 can be done by at most not 50 people,

118
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,220
but at most 49 people.

119
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,880
Let's think about it. Let's make sure that that's right.

120
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,390
So my answer is 49,which is C.

121
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:46,090
And let's think about how much money would be left over,

122
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,760
so 49 times 12.

123
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,740
This is just a reality check. 49 times 12.

124
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,640
2 times 9 is 18.

125
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,520
2 times 4 is 8 plus 1 is 9. 0, 49.

126
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:05,500
8, 18, 588.

127
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:10,490
So if you have 49 people,and they all contribute $12 exactly,

128
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,030
you'll raise $588.

129
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,190
And then you could have had a couple of other people,

130
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,010
you could have had 11 other people who instead of $12,

131
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:24,180
they paid $13. And that's how you get to $599,

132
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,550
because they say at least $12.

133
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:29,150
You can't have 50 people,because 50 people,

134
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,650
if they contribute at least $12,

135
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:33,150
you would have to raise at least $600.

136
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,210
So it can't be 50, so the answer is 49.

137
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:38,590
And you might say why did you go immediately to $600?

138
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,910
And a lot of times on the GMAT,

139
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,790
where they have these numbers that are 12 and 599--

140
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,490
those are strange numbers.

141
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,980
You say 599 is awfully close to 600.

142
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,550
Let's see if I can use that information to

143
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,770
deduce something interesting about this problem.

144
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,210
Anyway, next problem, 142.

145
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:03,680
Of the 3,600 employees of Company x, 1/3 are clerical.

146
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,980
So clerical is equal to 1/3 times 3,600,

147
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,430
which is equal to 1,200.

148
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,720
If the clerical staff were to be reduced by 1/3,

149
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,290
what percentage of the total number of remaining employees

150
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,070
would then be clerical?

151
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:23,000
Ok, we're going to reduce the clerical staff by 1/3,

152
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,950
so how many people are we going to get rid of?

153
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:28,850
So 1/3 of 1,200 is what? It's 400.

154
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:36,700
So the clerical staff is now going to be 1,200 minus 1/3,

155
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,360
minus 400, which is equal to 800.

156
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,990
So what proportion is this of the remaining employees?

157
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,850
So clerical is 800,

158
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,950
and how many remaining employees are there?

159
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,600
Are there 3,600?

160
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,630
No, we've gotten rid of 400 employees who were clerical.

161
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,980
So now we have 3,200 employees.

162
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:02,150
3,600 minus 400, so that is equal to 1/4.

163
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:09,650
And that's A, 25%. Problem 143.

164
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,540
Actually, I'm out of time.

165
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,790
I'll continue this in the next video.

166
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,700
See you soon.
