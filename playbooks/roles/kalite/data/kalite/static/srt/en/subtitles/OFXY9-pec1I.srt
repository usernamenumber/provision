1
00:00:04,757 --> 00:00:06,693
We're in the British Museum, and we're looking at

2
00:00:06,693 --> 00:00:08,891
one of the most important objects in the collection –

3
00:00:08,891 --> 00:00:10,090
the Rosetta Stone.

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,903
It's in a glass case, surrounded by people

5
00:00:12,903 --> 00:00:14,524
who are taking pictures of it.

6
00:00:14,524 --> 00:00:15,887
People love it! They do.

7
00:00:15,887 --> 00:00:18,154
There [are] gifts in the gift shop about it.

8
00:00:18,154 --> 00:00:20,197
You can get your own little Rosetta Stone.

9
00:00:20,197 --> 00:00:22,178
You can get Rosetta Stone posters.

10
00:00:22,178 --> 00:00:23,877
Exactly. On a mug.

11
00:00:23,877 --> 00:00:25,777
I think you can get a doormat Rosetta Stone. Yeah.

12
00:00:25,777 --> 00:00:29,347
But, the stone itself is historically incredibly important.

13
00:00:29,347 --> 00:00:32,668
It allowed us for the first time to be able to understand,

14
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:36,074
to be able to read, to be able to translate hieroglyphics.

15
00:00:36,074 --> 00:00:38,097
Hieroglyphics was the written language

16
00:00:38,097 --> 00:00:39,802
of the ancient Egyptians.

17
00:00:39,802 --> 00:00:42,911
And, until the mid-19th century,

18
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:45,225
we really didn't know what it said.

19
00:00:45,225 --> 00:00:46,888
The language itself is pictorial,

20
00:00:46,888 --> 00:00:49,578
and actually that led to one of the real confusions.

21
00:00:49,578 --> 00:00:52,298
Because, I think that early archaeologists believed –

22
00:00:52,298 --> 00:00:54,831
and linguists believed – that the pictures they could see –

23
00:00:54,831 --> 00:00:56,577
(You can make out birds and snakes,

24
00:00:56,577 --> 00:00:58,045
and various different kinds of forms.)

25
00:00:58,045 --> 00:00:59,749
– actually referred in some way

26
00:00:59,749 --> 00:01:01,319
to a specific thing in the world.

27
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:02,763
Right, so if you saw a bird,

28
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:05,098
it somehow referred to a bird.

29
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,172
And then, in fact, that's not the case. Right.

30
00:01:07,172 --> 00:01:09,138
This is a far more sophisticated language.

31
00:01:09,138 --> 00:01:11,264
And the Rosetta Stone was really what helped them

32
00:01:11,264 --> 00:01:15,774
to understand that Egyptian hieroglyphics are not pictorial.

33
00:01:15,774 --> 00:01:16,936
They're not pictographs.

34
00:01:16,936 --> 00:01:18,742
They're actually phonetic.

35
00:01:18,742 --> 00:01:20,583
So, all those things that look like pictures

36
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:22,393
actually represent sounds.

37
00:01:22,393 --> 00:01:25,164
And that's how they were able to finally figure out –

38
00:01:25,164 --> 00:01:27,880
and translate – ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.

39
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,977
And the reason we were able to do that

40
00:01:28,977 --> 00:01:31,992
is because this stone said the same statement

41
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:34,259
three times, in three different languages.

42
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,249
So, the three languages are:

43
00:01:36,249 --> 00:01:38,424
Ancient Greek, which is down at the bottom.

44
00:01:38,424 --> 00:01:41,092
Now, that was the language of the administration.

45
00:01:41,092 --> 00:01:42,548
That was the language of government.

46
00:01:42,548 --> 00:01:44,089
And the reason for that is because

47
00:01:44,089 --> 00:01:46,399
Alexander the Great had conquered Egypt,

48
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,301
and had set up this sort of Greek rule

49
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:50,795
in this Hellenistic era –

50
00:01:50,795 --> 00:01:53,433
and that maintained itself in ancient Egypt.

51
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:56,575
Let's remember, we're talking around 200 B.C. here.

52
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,072
– which is actually getting close to the end

53
00:01:58,072 --> 00:02:00,078
of the life of hieroglyphics, as well.

54
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,745
It would last for another few hundred years

55
00:02:01,745 --> 00:02:03,639
before it died out completely.

56
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:04,804
So, this is really the tail end

57
00:02:04,804 --> 00:02:07,674
of this 3000-year-long language.

58
00:02:07,674 --> 00:02:10,543
So, the middle section is Demotic,

59
00:02:10,543 --> 00:02:13,200
which actually means "the language of the people."

60
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,718
And it was this common language used by the Egyptians.

61
00:02:17,718 --> 00:02:20,469
And the top, of course, was the sacred writing.

62
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:22,265
This was hieroglyphs. Right.

63
00:02:22,265 --> 00:02:25,139
And that was the language that we really couldn't read –

64
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:27,625
– until we had the Rosetta Stone.

65
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:31,113
And we could see within the writing of the Rosetta Stone,

66
00:02:31,113 --> 00:02:35,115
cartouches, which held the names of the rulers.

67
00:02:35,115 --> 00:02:37,754
Cartouches are a kind of oblong shape

68
00:02:37,754 --> 00:02:39,916
that contains the name of the ruler.

69
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,374
In this case, that would be Ptolemy the Fifth.

70
00:02:42,374 --> 00:02:44,901
And by recognizing that ruler's name,

71
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:47,133
in these three different languages,

72
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:49,504
we found a way to begin to unlock hieroglyphics.

73
00:02:49,504 --> 00:02:50,640
Now, that would take decades.

74
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,426
It was an incredibly difficult task.

75
00:02:52,426 --> 00:02:55,234
And we haven't even talked yet about how this was found!

76
00:02:55,234 --> 00:02:57,578
Napoleon has his army in Egypt.

77
00:02:57,578 --> 00:03:00,244
And Napoleon's brought with him some –

78
00:03:00,244 --> 00:03:03,707
what I guess we would call, sort of – archaeologist types.

79
00:03:03,707 --> 00:03:06,801
And, one of those people who accompanied Napoleon

80
00:03:06,801 --> 00:03:10,476
found – or came across – the Rosetta Stone.

81
00:03:10,476 --> 00:03:11,498
It was being used as a part

82
00:03:11,498 --> 00:03:13,568
of the foundation of a fort, in fact.

83
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,927
And of course, it would originally have been erected

84
00:03:15,927 --> 00:03:19,062
in a temple, or near an ancient Egyptian temple.

85
00:03:19,062 --> 00:03:20,395
And, I suppose it's important to say that

86
00:03:20,395 --> 00:03:22,982
this is the bottom portion of a much larger stele –

87
00:03:22,982 --> 00:03:26,335
or sort of stone tablet – that would have been quite tall.

88
00:03:26,335 --> 00:03:27,873
So, Napoleon took it back.

89
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:29,186
Except, hold on a second –

90
00:03:29,186 --> 00:03:30,585
because we're not in the Louvre.

91
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,168
We're in London, in the British Museum.

92
00:03:32,168 --> 00:03:33,636
So, how does that work?

93
00:03:33,636 --> 00:03:36,079
Well, the British defeated Napoleon,

94
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,966
and brought back the stone.

95
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:41,308
And a year or two later – I think, 1801 or 1802 –

96
00:03:41,308 --> 00:03:42,344
it's brought to the British Museum.

97
00:03:42,344 --> 00:03:44,053
And it's been here ever since.

98
00:03:44,053 --> 00:03:47,033
Well, it's clearly still extremely popular.
