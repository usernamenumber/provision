1
00:00:00,164 --> 00:00:03,948
(music playing)

2
00:00:04,148 --> 00:00:09,827
We're at the Getty Villa in Malibu with Francesca Tronchin and Beth Harris. This is Stephen Zucker.

3
00:00:09,827 --> 00:00:15,425
And we were going to look at a gorgeous little Roman statue - well, sort of Roman.

4
00:00:15,425 --> 00:00:22,382
Yeah, sort of Roman. This is actually what I would call a Roman reproduction of a Greek work of sculpture.

5
00:00:22,382 --> 00:00:28,678
And that word reproduction is a particularly thorny one and we can talk about that later.

6
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:34,906
But, just generally speaking, the Romans were absolutely crazy about Greek art.

7
00:00:34,906 --> 00:00:38,221
Well, so am I. Right. As we all are.

8
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:48,155
They made many, many reproductions of works of Greek sculpture as well as Greek painting, usually putting their own little finishing touches on it so to speak.

9
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:57,023
And in some cases there were slight variations, so we can't really think of it as a photocopy or an absolutely perfect 1-to-1 reproduction.

10
00:00:57,023 --> 00:01:01,100
Obviously, it tells us alot about the Greeks at a particular moment in time.

11
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,903
But, does it tell us a little about the Romans also?

12
00:01:02,903 --> 00:01:04,222
Oh, absolutely.

13
00:01:04,222 --> 00:01:10,571
There's alot that you can tell about Roman taste by looking at the kinds of Greek works of art that they reproduced.

14
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:18,922
And it seems that there are a number of criteria for copying and reproducing a work of - let's just keep it on sculpture for the moment.

15
00:01:18,922 --> 00:01:30,741
And one of those disiderata, so to speak, one of those motivations for copying a Greek statue would be that the original Greek statue was famous in some way,

16
00:01:30,741 --> 00:01:34,100
that there was some kind of notoriety associated with it.

17
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:39,412
Or, if the sculptor of the original was significant in some way.

18
00:01:39,412 --> 00:01:44,742
And, this piece that we're looking at here really packs a one-two punch. It's got both.

19
00:01:44,742 --> 00:01:46,291
It's got both. Absolutely.

20
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:56,730
First of all, the original sculptor was Praxiteles, who worked in the 4th century B.C.E.

21
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:03,526
And the reproduction that we're looking at here, the copy, is probably from the late 2nd century C.E.

22
00:02:03,526 --> 00:02:10,675
So about 600 years. That gives you a real sense of something must of have been really special about this original

23
00:02:10,675 --> 00:02:17,214
if 400 years, 500 years, 600 years later they're still making reproductions of it.

24
00:02:17,214 --> 00:02:27,660
Just in the same way like if you go to the Louvre, you can buy your mousepad and your coffee cup with the Mona Lisa, you know, something that is 500 years old.

25
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:33,839
So, the original would have been life-sized? Would have been lifesized. Absolutely. Maybe 3 feet?

26
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:40,115
This is about 3 feet tall, and I think judging from the size of it, judging also by the subject matter

27
00:02:40,115 --> 00:02:48,150
which we should say is a depiction of Venus, the Roman version of the Greek goddess Aphrodite the sexy goddess of Love.

28
00:02:48,150 --> 00:03:01,254
So judging by subject matter, scale, material and so forth, I think it's relatively safe to say that this would have been in a domestic context, that is to say it was on display in a house.

29
00:03:01,254 --> 00:03:03,307
So, this would not have been in a temple.

30
00:03:03,307 --> 00:03:06,379
It really would have been something that you would have had a more personal relationship with?

31
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:08,512
A more intimate sculpture? Sure.

32
00:03:08,512 --> 00:03:12,554
Would it have been decorative? Would it have had a religious function, given that it is a goddess?

33
00:03:12,554 --> 00:03:22,938
Well, if it's a depiction, if it's a statuette that was in a house, I would say that it was really decorative in function.

34
00:03:22,938 --> 00:03:29,898
But, it had also a certain function, almost like how we show our travel slideshows to our friends.

35
00:03:29,898 --> 00:03:36,062
These are the beautiful works of art that we saw on our trip to Paris, or whatever. A keepsake.

36
00:03:36,062 --> 00:03:44,505
I think that this was something that was decorative, but also functional, in the way that it showed off the Roman homeowners erudition,

37
00:03:44,505 --> 00:03:51,673
his knowledge of Greek sculpture, as a way, as a kind of a pretentious way of collecting and showing art.

38
00:03:51,673 --> 00:03:54,263
Art still functions that way. Oh, absolutely.

39
00:03:54,263 --> 00:04:02,824
And, I think among art historians, looking at what books they keep in their living room on view, I think that's another similar sort of pretention.

40
00:04:02,824 --> 00:04:04,050
That's exactly right.

41
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,093
So, this sculpture has changed over time.

42
00:04:06,093 --> 00:04:08,628
We're looking at this very pristine, white marble.

43
00:04:08,628 --> 00:04:13,870
And, marble is this beautiful, soft material, that's translucent. It glows, almost skinlike.

44
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,892
But, is that the way that this sculpture would have been represented originally?

45
00:04:16,892 --> 00:04:28,295
No, and as you can see if you look very closely; for example, in the folds of the drapery, around her eyes, and also in her hair there is a headband there.

46
00:04:28,295 --> 00:04:37,126
There are several traces of paint. And, this is something that's very important to remember about ancient sculpture from the classical world.

47
00:04:37,126 --> 00:04:42,827
That all of that sculpture that today we really appreciate that beautiful, white crispness.

48
00:04:42,827 --> 00:04:45,827
All of that would have been painted in antiquity.

49
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:49,831
I'm not so sure about the flesh part of this nude Aphrodite.

50
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:56,409
But, certainly as I mentioned the drapery and the hair. It was painted with something called encaustic,

51
00:04:56,409 --> 00:05:00,701
which was pigment that was melted into beeswax.

52
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:04,406
And so, it had kind of a glistening quality to it as well.

53
00:05:04,406 --> 00:05:09,989
There are a couple of other things that are missing when we look at this statuette, that would have been there in the original.

54
00:05:09,989 --> 00:05:18,332
Not only are we missing that original paint, but we're also missing her eyes, which probably would have been inlaid in some material.

55
00:05:18,332 --> 00:05:23,533
Perhaps glass, stone, bone. There are lots of different options for inlaying the eyes.

56
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:25,274
And, would there have been some jewelery perhaps?

57
00:05:25,274 --> 00:05:28,103
Absolutely. that was the third thing I was going to mention.

58
00:05:28,103 --> 00:05:30,475
You can see she has pierced ears.

59
00:05:30,475 --> 00:05:34,499
And, so we can imagine maybe little dangly, gold earrings.

60
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:39,487
So, in a way she would have looked so much more alive than she does now.

61
00:05:39,487 --> 00:05:40,349
Absolutely.

62
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:45,821
And, if you read some of the ancient testimony, ancient descriptions about sculpture, in general,

63
00:05:45,821 --> 00:05:53,745
there are lots of cases of Romans and Greeks thinking that statues were so lifelike that they actually could come alive.

64
00:05:53,745 --> 00:06:03,191
And there are stories about statues that were chained down to their bases so that they wouldn't just walk off the base and walk out of the sanctuary.

65
00:06:03,191 --> 00:06:11,641
So, why is Venus always coming out of the bath and feigning a kind of modesty?

66
00:06:11,641 --> 00:06:18,958
I think we probably have to tell the story of why the statue was so important in antiquity to get to that story.

67
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:28,838
But, certainly this pose that she's in, with one arm, one hand picking up some drapery that she had draped over a water jar down by her left foot

68
00:06:28,838 --> 00:06:38,896
with the right hand over the lower part of her body, ostensibly shielding her genitals; but in reality drawing our gaze right to it.

69
00:06:38,896 --> 00:06:42,479
So, it's absolutely a kind of false modesty.

70
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,092
But, she is Aphrodite. She's meant to be sexy.

71
00:06:46,092 --> 00:06:48,415
She doesn't mind that we're looking there.

72
00:06:48,415 --> 00:06:54,559
A goddess like Artemis, on the other hand, would be horrified. I can't even think of a nude Artemis in antiquity.

73
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:57,642
And, if I remember correctly, she punished several people for simply looking at her.

74
00:06:57,642 --> 00:07:00,213
But, not Venus. Not Venus.

75
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:09,072
But, to tell a little bit about the story of the original 4th century statue of Aphrodite by Praxiteles.

76
00:07:09,072 --> 00:07:17,929
Praxiteles in the 4th century was commissioned by the citizens of the island of Kos, which is off the coast of western Turkey.

77
00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:21,885
They said "we need a statue of Aphrodite for our temple."

78
00:07:21,885 --> 00:07:28,869
And, so Praxiteles said, "no problem." And, in fact, he made two statues of Aphrodite.

79
00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:30,884
One showed her fully clothed.

80
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:34,551
And, then really this one was the other option.

81
00:07:34,551 --> 00:07:43,671
Nowadays, especially looking at ancient art or even Rennaisance art, we've really become accustomed to nudity in art.

82
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:55,471
But, in the 4th century B.C.E., this was something really brand new. To see a nude female goddess rendenered lifesize was something incredibly shocking.

83
00:07:55,471 --> 00:08:05,716
And, so the residents of the city of Kos, when they were presented by Praxiteles with these two options - naked Aphrodite, or clothed Aphrodite.

84
00:08:05,716 --> 00:08:08,654
Their sense of propriety took hold of them.

85
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,377
And, they said "We want the one with her clothes on."

86
00:08:11,377 --> 00:08:15,527
The nude Aphrodite was just something too radical.

87
00:08:15,527 --> 00:08:25,221
So, the nude Aphrodite, which of course was the second choice, went to the city of Knidos, which is on the western shore of modern day Turkey.

88
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:27,811
So, really just right across the water from Kos.

89
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:37,496
It's interesting to know that we have many written descriptions of people traveling to Knidos to see Praxiteles' nude Aphrodite.

90
00:08:37,496 --> 00:08:43,477
We have scores and scores of reproductions of that statue, including the one that we're looking at here.

91
00:08:43,477 --> 00:08:50,079
We have no idea what the clothed Aphrodite looked like. What a surprise. Yeah.

92
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:56,196
I think that tells us alot about Greek art, about Greeks, about Romans, about travel, about us.

93
00:08:56,196 --> 00:08:57,295
Absolutely.

94
00:08:57,295 --> 00:08:58,406
Yeah, little has changed.

95
00:08:58,406 --> 00:09:01,897
That's terrific. You've really brought this sculpture alive for us. Thanks.

96
00:09:01,897 --> 00:09:04,878
