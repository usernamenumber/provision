1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,802
We're told that Jared is twice the age of his brother, Peter.

2
00:00:04,925 --> 00:00:11,423
So, Jared is twice the age of his brother, Peter. Peter is four years old.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:17,495
Peter is four years old, and Jared is twice the age of his brother, Peter.

4
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:20,657
So, Jared is twice Peter's age of four.

5
00:00:20,657 --> 00:00:26,064
And then they tell us Talia's age is 3 times Jared's age.

6
00:00:26,064 --> 00:00:28,571
How old are Talia and Jared?

7
00:00:28,587 --> 00:00:33,531
So Talia's age is 3 times Jared's age.

8
00:00:33,531 --> 00:00:37,679
So let's write this down. We have Peter is four years old.

9
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:44,636
So Peter- Peter's age- Peter's age,he's four years old.

10
00:00:44,636 --> 00:00:48,423
Jared is twice the age of his brother, Peter.

11
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:54,336
So Jared-Let me do that in yellow-So Jared- That's not yellow.

12
00:00:54,398 --> 00:01:01,398
Jared- Jared is twice the age of his brother.

13
00:01:01,413 --> 00:01:08,644
So twice- twice is the same thing as two times, two times the age of his brother.

14
00:01:08,644 --> 00:01:11,577
We could-though- You could say Jared is twice the age of his brother.

15
00:01:11,577 --> 00:01:13,864
Or Jared is two times the age of his brother.

16
00:01:13,864 --> 00:01:17,054
Well, his brother is four;they told us that right over there.

17
00:01:17,054 --> 00:01:21,325
So Jared is going to be two times four years old.

18
00:01:21,325 --> 00:01:25,685
Two times four years old and if you know your multiplication tables,

19
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:29,621
You know that's the same thing as eight. Two times four is eight.

20
00:01:29,621 --> 00:01:34,075
Four times two is eight or you know this is the same thing as Peter's age twice.

21
00:01:34,075 --> 00:01:38,746
Which is the same thing as four plus four. That would also get you eight.

22
00:01:38,746 --> 00:01:44,105
So this would give you- so Jared's age is equal to eight.

23
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:49,094
And then finally they say Talia's age- let me write Talia's- Talia

24
00:01:49,094 --> 00:01:54,383
right over here. Talia's age and they say it- they tell it to us right over here.

25
00:01:54,383 --> 00:02:00,136
It's three times Jared's age. So Talia's age is three times Jared's age.

26
00:02:00,136 --> 00:02:03,158
Well we were able to figure out Jared's age. it is eight.

27
00:02:03,158 --> 00:02:06,046
It is three times Jared's age.

28
00:02:06,046 --> 00:02:09,300
If you know your multiplication tables this should maybe jump out at you.

29
00:02:09,315 --> 00:02:13,085
And your multiplication tables really are one of those things in mathmatics

30
00:02:13,085 --> 00:02:16,743
That you should just, just really just know back and forth,

31
00:02:16,743 --> 00:02:19,269
Just because it will make the rest of your life very, very, very simple,

32
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:23,275
But or you could do three times eight as literally eight three times.

33
00:02:23,275 --> 00:02:27,371
So it's eight plus eight plus eight. Eight plus eight is sixteen.

34
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:31,356
Sixteen plus eight is twenty-four. So three times eight is twenty-four.

35
00:02:31,356 --> 99:59:59,999
So Peter is four, Jared is eight, and Talia is twenty-four.
