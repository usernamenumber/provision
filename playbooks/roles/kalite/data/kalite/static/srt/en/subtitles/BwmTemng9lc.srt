1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:05,933
simplify 2 a square over 3 b to the fifth

2
00:00:05,933 --> 00:00:08,133
All of that to the fourth power

3
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:13,933
So here we could use the property that if i have x over y to the Nth power

4
00:00:13,933 --> 00:00:18,000
this is the same thing as x to the Nth power

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,667
over y to the nth power. we can see that with an exemple really fast.

6
00:00:21,667 --> 00:00:26,773
if i had x over y to the 3rd power

7
00:00:26,773 --> 00:00:28,333
what would be this equal to?

8
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,600
that would be x over y

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,333
times x over y times x over y

10
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:41,533
which is equal to x times x times x over y times y times y

11
00:00:41,533 --> 00:00:46,000
This is clearly x to the power of 3 over y to the power of 3

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,600
particular example of why, hope this makes you feel more confident about it.

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,867
Makes you feel good about using this property.

14
00:00:53,867 --> 00:00:55,267
Lets use it right

15
00:00:55,267 --> 00:00:56,733
here in the actual problem

16
00:00:56,733 --> 00:00:59,281
So we have 2 a squared over b to the fifth

17
00:00:59,281 --> 00:01:00,733
all of that to the fourth power

18
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:02,531
So this going to be the same thing

19
00:01:02,531 --> 00:01:05,933
as to a squared to the fourth power

20
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:07,867
Let me write it this way. It's going to be

21
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:13,000
2 a squared to the fourth power, let me do the fourth power in blue

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,463
to the fourth power, all of that,

23
00:01:16,463 --> 00:01:20,600
over 3 b to the fifth, all of that over

24
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,800
3 b to the fifth, to the fourth power

25
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,533
to the fourth power

26
00:01:28,533 --> 00:01:31,867
and now we can use the property that if I take the product of things

27
00:01:31,867 --> 00:01:35,086
and raise that to a power, that's the same thing as

28
00:01:35,086 --> 00:01:39,467
raising each of the things in the product to the power

29
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:42,067
and then taking the product, so this is going to be the same thing

30
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:43,800
Let me just write the property

31
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:50,800
So if I have x times y to the nth power, this is the same thing

32
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,333
as x to the nth times y to the nth power.

33
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:58,538
And you could a similar argument that we did rigth here

34
00:01:58,538 --> 00:02:00,400
to see why this works out. So let's do that over here.

35
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,267
2 a squared to fourth power is going to be equal to

36
00:02:04,267 --> 00:02:08,733
2 to the fourth power, colour coded,

37
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:12,800
2 to the fourth power times a squared to the fourth power

38
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,667
times a squared to the fourth power

39
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:18,800
and then all of that over

40
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,467
3 b to the fifth to the fourth power, that's going to be

41
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:27,133
3 to the fourth power, 3 to the fourth power

42
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:31,400
times b to the fifth, times b to the fifth,

43
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,067
to the fourth power, times b to the fifth to the fourth power

44
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:38,400
Now the last interesting thing here,

45
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,733
We can evaluate what this numbers come out to be

46
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:43,067
2 to the fourth power, let me just do it rigth now

47
00:02:43,067 --> 00:02:47,133
2 to the fourth power, 2 squared is 4,

48
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:51,667
2 to the third power is 8, 2 to the fourth power is 16

49
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:53,867
So this rigth here is 16.

50
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:57,533
3 to the first power is 3, 3 squared is 9,

51
00:02:57,533 --> 00:03:01,533
3 to the third power is 27, 3 to the fourth power is 81.

52
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:04,867
So this over here, this over here is

53
00:03:04,867 --> 00:03:08,533
let me do it in that green colour, this is 81.

54
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:12,200
81, and to simplify this terms here

55
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,733
we just have to remember

56
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:17,067
the what we call to power property or the power rule of exponents.

57
00:03:17,067 --> 00:03:19,200
That's just the notion that if I have,

58
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,267
if I have x to the nth and I raise that

59
00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:27,800
to the mth power, this is the exact same thing as

60
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,400
x to n times m power

61
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,533
So if we want to simplify this,

62
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:37,400
or numerator is now, it is now 16

63
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,200
that's the 2 to the fourth, and then a squared

64
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,667
and then that to the fourth power,

65
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:45,533
That's going to be a to the 2 times 4 power,

66
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:48,467
or a to the 8th power

67
00:03:48,467 --> 00:03:52,267
This is literally 2 times 4, so we are just multiplying 2 times 4

68
00:03:52,267 --> 00:03:56,067
This 2 times this 4 to get that 8.

69
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:58,399
And then in the denominator

70
00:03:58,399 --> 00:04:03,800
We have our 81, and then b to the fifth and that to the fourth power

71
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,467
That's going to be b to the 5 times 4 power

72
00:04:06,467 --> 00:04:12,935
or b to the 20th power. So I got 20 by multiplying 5 times 4.

73
00:04:12,935 --> 99:59:59,999
And we are done, this is about simplify as we can get.
