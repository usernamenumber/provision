1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,510
   

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,380
So far we've been able to define
the determinant for a

3
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:04,600
2-by-2 matrix.

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,700
This was our definition right
here: ad minus bc.

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,960
And then we were able to broaden
that a bit by creating

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,460
a definition for the determinant
of a 3-by-3

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,330
matrix, and we did that right
here, where we essentially

8
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,190
said the determinant is equal
to each of these terms-- you

9
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,490
could call these maybe the
coefficient terms-- times the

10
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,682
determinant of the matrix-- you
can kind of view it as the

11
00:00:28,682 --> 00:00:31,450
submatrix produced-- when you
get rid of each of these guys'

12
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:32,650
column and row.

13
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,340
So when you got rid of this
guy's column and row, you're

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,480
left with this matrix.

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,200
So we said this guy times
the determinant of this.

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,280
And we kept switching signs,
minus this guy times the

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,610
determinant, if you move
his column and his row.

18
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,440
So it was left with these terms
right there to get that

19
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:48,940
determinant.

20
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,800
Then finally, you switched
signs again.

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,620
So plus this guy times the
determinant of the 2-by-2

22
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,860
matrix if you get rid of this
row and this column.

23
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,020
So this thing right here,
which was this matrix.

24
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,850
Now let's see if we can
extend this to a

25
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,980
general n-by-n matrix.

26
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:09,780
So let's write out our n-by-n
matrix right over here.

27
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,700
I'll do it in blue.

28
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,770
So let's say I have some matrix
A that is an n-by-n

29
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:19,010
matrix, so it's going
to look like this.

30
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:23,870
This would be a11, that would
be a12, and we would go all

31
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:28,270
the way to-- you're going
to have n columns, a1n.

32
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,600
And when you go down, this is
going to be your second row:

33
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,960
a21, and it's going to go all
the way down to an1, because

34
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,800
you have n rows as well.

35
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,200
And then if you go down the
diagonal all the way, this

36
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,970
right here would be ann.

37
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,920
So there is my n-by-n matrix.

38
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,620
Now, before I define how to find
the determinant of this,

39
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,310
let me make another
definition.

40
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,250
Let me define-- so this
is my matrix A.

41
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:05,210
Let me define a submatrix Aij to
be equal to-- see this is n

42
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,290
by n, right?

43
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:11,000
So this is going to be an n
minus 1 by n minus 1 matrix.

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,370
So if this is 7 by 7, the
submatrix is going to be 6 by

45
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,150
6, one less in each direction.

46
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:22,210
So this is going to be the n
minus 1 by n minus 1 matrix

47
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:35,160
you get if you essentially
ignore or if you take away--

48
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,950
maybe I should say take away.

49
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,090
Let's say ignore, like
the word ignore.

50
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:45,630
If you ignore the i-th row, this
right here is the row,

51
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:55,380
the i-th row and the
j-th column of A.

52
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:00,060
So, for example, let's go back
to our 3 by 3 right here.

53
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,370
This thing could be denoted
based on that definition I--

54
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,670
we could have called
this, this was a11,

55
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,000
this term right here.

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,620
We could denote the matrix when
you get rid of the first

57
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,680
column and the first row or the
first row and the first

58
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,750
column, we could call this thing
right here, we could

59
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,550
call that big matrix A11.

60
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:23,270
So this was big matrix A11.

61
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:28,780
This is big matrix A21, or
actually, this matrix was

62
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,980
called C, so this would
be C11 right there.

63
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:40,010
We could call this one, this
would be matrix C12.

64
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:40,700
Why is that?

65
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,520
Because if you get rid of the
first row, let me get rid of

66
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,610
the first row, right?

67
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,190
The first term is your row.

68
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:53,360
If you get rid of the first
row and the second column,

69
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,180
this is the matrix that's
left over: 2, 3, 4, 1.

70
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,590
So this is this guy
and this guy.

71
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,600
2, 3, 4, 1.

72
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,950
So this is the submatrix C
because this is the big matrix

73
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,930
C, But this one is C12.

74
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,490
I know it's a little
bit messy there.

75
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,310
So that's all we mean
by the submatrix.

76
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,970
Very similar to what we did
in the 3 by 3 case.

77
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:21,000
You essentially get rid of--
so if you want to find out

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,970
this guy's submatrix, you would
call that A11, and you

79
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,630
would literally cross out the
first row and the first

80
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,120
column, and everything
left over here

81
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,660
would be that submatrix.

82
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,780
Now, with that out of the way,
we can create a definition,

83
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,210
and it might seem a little
circular to you at first, and

84
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,740
on some level it is.

85
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:44,210
We're going to define the
determinant of A to be equal

86
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,320
to-- this is interesting.

87
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,970
It's actually a recursive
definition.

88
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,265
I'll talk about that
in a second.

89
00:04:49,265 --> 00:04:52,220
It's equal to-- we start
with a plus.

90
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:58,540
It's equal to a11 times the
submatrix if you remove this

91
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,810
guy's row and column.

92
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:05,940
So that, by definition, is
just A, big capital A11's

93
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,460
determinant.

94
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,710
So that's exactly what we did.

95
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,540
Let me write that a
little bit neater.

96
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,670
So times the determinant of
its submatrix, so the

97
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,550
determinant of A11.

98
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,416
So you take A11, you get rid of
its column and its row or

99
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,740
its row and its column, and
everything else, you find the

100
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,120
determinant of that.

101
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,854
Actually, let me write it
in terms of-- let me

102
00:05:25,854 --> 00:05:27,600
write it this way.

103
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,420
a11 times the determinant
of the submatrix A11.

104
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,130
And then we switch signs.

105
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:39,000
We're just going to go along
this row, and then you do

106
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,490
minus a12 times the determinant
of its submatrix,

107
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,390
which we'll just call A12.

108
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,070
We would get rid of this row
and this column, and

109
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,360
everything left would
be this matrix A12.

110
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,030
We want to find its
determinant.

111
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:58,995
And then we'll take the next
guy over here would be a13.

112
00:05:58,995 --> 00:06:01,150
So we switch signs with minus.

113
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,890
Now, you go plus,
so a13 times the

114
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,960
determinant of its submatrix.

115
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,220
So if this is n by n, these each
are going to be n minus 1

116
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:11,910
by n minus 1.

117
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,070
So the determinant of A13.

118
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,800
And you're just going to keep
doing that, keep switching

119
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,020
signs, so it's going to be a
minus and then a plus and you

120
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,550
keep going all the way--
and then I don't know.

121
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,400
It depends on whether an,
whether we're dealing with an

122
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,000
odd number or an even number.

123
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,350
If we're dealing with an even
number, this is going to be a

124
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,450
minus sign.

125
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,430
If it's an odd number, it's
going to be a plus sign, but

126
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:31,970
you get the idea.

127
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,520
It's either going to be a plus
or a minus, not just-- if it's

128
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,670
odd, this is going
to be a plus.

129
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:41,790
If it's an even n, it's going to
be a minus, All the way to

130
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:47,020
a1n, the n-th column times
its submatrix, A1n.

131
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,500
With that submatrix, you get rid
of the first row and the

132
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,700
n-th column, and it's going
to be everything

133
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,330
that's left in between.

134
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,570
And you immediately might
say, Sal, what kind of a

135
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,610
definition is this?

136
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:01,130
You defined a determinant for an
arbitrary n-by-n matrix in

137
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,680
terms of another definition
of a determinant.

138
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,880
How does this work?

139
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,330
And the reason why this works
is because the determinant

140
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,630
that you use in the definition
are determinants

141
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,090
of a smaller matrix.

142
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:17,240
So this is a determinant of an n
minus 1 by n minus 1 matrix.

143
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,440
And you're saying hey, Sal, that
still doesn't make any

144
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,900
sense because we don't know how
to find the determinant of

145
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,380
an n minus 1 by n
minus 1 matrix.

146
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,470
Well, you apply this definition
again, and then

147
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:29,040
it's going to be in terms of n
minus 2 times n-- or n minus 2

148
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,220
by n minus 2 matrices.

149
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,220
And you're like how
do you do that?

150
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,260
Well, you keep doing it, and
you're going to get all the

151
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,850
way down to a 2-by-2 matrix.

152
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,770
   

153
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,840
And that one we defined well.

154
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,640
We defined the determinant of
a 2-by-2 matrix not in terms

155
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,240
of a determinant.

156
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,210
We just defined it in terms of
a times-- we defined it as--

157
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,720
let me write it up here.

158
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,635
It was a times d minus
b times c.

159
00:07:51,635 --> 00:07:52,800
And you can see.

160
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,340
I mean, we could just go down to
the 3 by 3, but the 2 by 2

161
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,210
is really the most fundamental
definition.

162
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,390
And you could see that the
definition of a 3-by-3

163
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,720
determinant is a special
case of the general

164
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,110
case for an n by n.

165
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,040
We take this guy and we
multiply him times the

166
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,800
determinant of his submatrix
right there.

167
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,810
Then we take this guy where
we switch signs.

168
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:12,890
We have a minus.

169
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,700
And we multiply him times the
determinant of his submatrix,

170
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,520
which is that right there.

171
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,950
Then you do a plus.

172
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,455
You switch signs and then you
multiply this guy times the

173
00:08:21,455 --> 00:08:24,030
determinant of his submatrix,
which is that right there.

174
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,870
So this is a general case
of what I just defined.

175
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,040
But we know it's never that
satisfying to deal in the

176
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,520
abstract or the generalities.

177
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,900
We want to do a specific case.

178
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,190
And actually, before I do that,
let me just introduce a

179
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:36,610
term to you.

180
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:40,120
This is called a recursive
formula.

181
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,090
And if you become a computer
science major,

182
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,120
you'll see this a lot.

183
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,150
But a recursive function or a
recursive formula is defined

184
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,630
in terms of itself.

185
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,110
But the things that you use in
the definition use a slightly

186
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,480
simpler version of it, and as
you keep going through, or you

187
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,730
keep recursing through it, you
get simpler and simpler

188
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,480
versions of it until you get
to some type of base case.

189
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,360
In this case, our base case is
the case of a 2-by-2 matrix.

190
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,030
You keep doing this, and
eventually you'll get to a

191
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,220
determinant of a 2-by-2 matrix,
and we know how to

192
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,260
find those.

193
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,735
So this is a recursive
definition.

194
00:09:09,735 --> 00:09:13,540
   

195
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,930
But let's actually apply it
because I think that's what

196
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,960
actually makes things
concrete.

197
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,140
So let's take-- this is going
to be computationally

198
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,900
intensive, but I think if we
focus, we can get there.

199
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:32,070
So I'm going to have a 4-by-4
matrix: 1, 2, 3, 4.

200
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:35,080
1-- throw some zeroes in there
to make the computation a

201
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:43,400
little bit simpler, 0, 1, 2,
3, and then 2, 3, 0, 0.

202
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:48,640
So let's figure out this
determinant right there.

203
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,040
This is the determinant
of the matrix.

204
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,260
If I put some brackets
there that would

205
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,100
have been the matrix.

206
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,000
But let's find the determinant
of this matrix.

207
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,590
So this is going to be equal
to-- by our definition, it's

208
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:03,000
going to be equal to 1 times the
determinant of this matrix

209
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,900
right here if you get rid of
this row and this column.

210
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:10,220
So it's going to be 1 times the
determinant of 0, 2, 0; 1,

211
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,320
2, 3; 3, 0, 0.

212
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,600
That's just this guy right here,
this matrix right there.

213
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,660
Then I'm going to have a 2, but
I'm going to switch signs.

214
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:24,580
So it's minus 2 times the
determinant if I get rid of

215
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,880
that row and this column,
so it's 1, 2, 0.

216
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,130
I'm ignoring the zero because
it's in the same column as the

217
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:40,525
2: 1, 2, 0; 0, 2, 3,
and then 2, 0, 0.

218
00:10:40,525 --> 00:10:43,330
   

219
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,540
And then I switch signs again.

220
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,240
It was a minus, so now
I go back to plus.

221
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,720
So I do that guy, so
plus 3 times the

222
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,040
determinant of his submatrix.

223
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,330
Get rid of that row and get
rid of that columm,

224
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,766
I get a 1, 0, 0.

225
00:10:54,766 --> 00:10:57,600
   

226
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,010
I get a 0, 1, 3.

227
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:05,100
   

228
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,700
I skip this column every time.

229
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:15,010
Then I get a 2, 3, 0,
just like that.

230
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,210
We're almost done.

231
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,330
One more in this column.

232
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,290
Let me switch to
another color.

233
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,160
I haven't used the
blue in this yet.

234
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,110
So then I'm going
to do a minus 4.

235
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:29,870
Remember, it's plus, minus,
plus, minus 4 times the

236
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,130
determinant of its submatrix.

237
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,480
That's going to be
that right there.

238
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:42,330
So it's 1, 0, 2; 0, 1, 2;
2, 3, 0, just like that.

239
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,040
And now we're down to
the 3-by-3 case.

240
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,390
We could use the definition of
the 3 by 3, but we could just

241
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,980
keep applying this recursive
definition.

242
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,310
   

243
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:56,140
So this is going to be equal
to-- let me write it here.

244
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,440
It's 1 times-- what's
this determinant?

245
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,640
This determinant's going to be
0 times the determinant of

246
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,950
that submatrix, 2, 3, 0, 0.

247
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,900
   

248
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,150
That was this one right here.

249
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:15,110
And then we have minus 2, minus
this 2-- remember, we

250
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,000
switched signs-- plus, minus,
plus, so minus 2 times its

251
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,020
submatrix, so it's 1, 3, 3, 0.

252
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:26,340
   

253
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:31,650
And then finally plus 0 times
its submatrix, which is this

254
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:39,370
thing right here: 1, 2,
3, 0, just like that.

255
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,770
And then we have this
next guy right here.

256
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:45,060
As you can see, this can get a
little bit tedious, but we'll

257
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,130
keep our spirits up.

258
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:53,570
So minus 2 times 1 times its
submatrix, so that's this guy

259
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:56,850
right here-- times the
determinant of its submatrix

260
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,840
2, 3, 0, 0.

261
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,290
Then minus 2 times-- get
rid of that row, that

262
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,190
column-- 0, 3, 2, 0.

263
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,320
   

264
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,620
And then plus 0 times
0, 2, 2, 0.

265
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,060
   

266
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,730
That's this one right there.

267
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,510
Halfway there, at
least for now.

268
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:28,270
And then we get this next one,
so we have a plus 3.

269
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,770
Bring out our parentheses.

270
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,570
And then we're going to have 1
times its sub-- I guess call

271
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,820
it sub-determinant.

272
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:39,580
So 1 times the determinant
1, 3, 3, 0, right?

273
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,710
You get rid of this guy's row
and column, you get this guy

274
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,870
right there.

275
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:48,620
And then minus 0-- get rid
of this row and column--

276
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,246
times 0, 3, 2, 0.

277
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,300
   

278
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:59,880
Then you have plus 0 times its
sub-determinant 0, 1, 2, 3.

279
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,740
   

280
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,230
Three-fourths of
the way there.

281
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,180
One last term.

282
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,790
Let's hope we haven't made
any careless mistakes.

283
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:15,470
Minus 4 times 1 times 1,
2, 3, 0 right there.

284
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,810
   

285
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:23,415
Minus 0 times-- get rid of those
two guys-- 0, 2, 2, 0.

286
00:14:23,415 --> 00:14:26,560
   

287
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,870
And then plus 2 times
0, 1, 2, 3, right?

288
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,130
Plus 2-- get rid of these
guys-- 0, 1, 2, 3.

289
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,660
   

290
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,350
Now, we've defined or we've
calculated or we've defined

291
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,060
our determinant of this matrix
in terms of just a bunch of

292
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,230
2-by-2 matrices.

293
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,170
So hopefully, you saw in this
example that the recursion

294
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:48,680
worked out.

295
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,410
So let's actually find what
this number is equal to.

296
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,570
A determinant is always just
going to be a number.

297
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:56,090
So let me get a nice
vibrant color.

298
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,610
This is 0 times--
I don't care.

299
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,940
0 times anything's
going to be 0.

300
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,220
0 times anything is
going to be 0.

301
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,550
0 times anything's
going to be 0.

302
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,460
0 times anything's
going to be 0.

303
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,470
Just simplifying it.

304
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:10,420
These guys are 0 because
it's 0 times that.

305
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,910
0 times this is going
to be equal to 0.

306
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,160
So what are we left with?

307
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,100
   

308
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:22,090
This is going to be equal to 1
times-- this is all we have

309
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:25,250
left here is a minus 2 times--
and what is this determinant?

310
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,450
It's 1 times 0, which is 0.

311
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,220
It's 0-- let me write this.

312
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,870
This is going to be 1 times 0
is 0, minus 3 times 3 is 0

313
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,980
minus 9, so minus 9.

314
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,940
This right here is
just minus 9.

315
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,270
So minus 2 times minus 9.

316
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,840
That's our first thing, I'll
simplify it in a second.

317
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,030
Now let's do this
term right here.

318
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:51,060
So it's minus 2 times-- now
what's this determinant?

319
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,280
2 times 0 minus 0 times 3.

320
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,030
That's 0 minus 0.

321
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,040
So this is 0.

322
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,990
That guy became 0, so we
can ignore that term.

323
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,050
This term right here is
0 times 0, which is 0,

324
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,370
minus 2 times 3.

325
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,210
So it's minus 6.

326
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:10,780
So it's minus 2 times-- so this
is a minus 6 right here.

327
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:15,150
You have a minus 2 times a minus
6, so that's a plus 12.

328
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,770
So I'll just write
a plus 12 here.

329
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,910
This minus 2 is that minus
2 right there.

330
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:23,370
And then we have a plus 3.

331
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:27,020
And then this first term is 1
times 0, which is 0, minus--

332
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,880
let me make the parentheses
here-- 1 times 0, which is 0,

333
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,395
minus 3 times 3, which
is minus 9 times 1.

334
00:16:33,395 --> 00:16:34,840
So it's minus 9.

335
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,120
Everything else was a 0.

336
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,780
We're in the home stretch.

337
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,750
We have a minus 4.

338
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:47,670
Let's see, this is 1 times 0,
which is 0, minus 3 times 2,

339
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,100
so minus 6.

340
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,660
So this is minus 6 right here.

341
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,950
Minus 6, this is 0, and then we
have this guy right here.

342
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:59,290
So we have 0 times 3, which
is 0, minus 2 times 1.

343
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:03,350
So that's minus 2, and then
you have a minus 2 times a

344
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,440
plus 2 is minus 4.

345
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,250
So now we just have
to make sure we do

346
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,900
our arithmetic properly.

347
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:15,290
This is 1 times plus 18,
so this is 18, right?

348
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,230
Minus 2 times minus 9.

349
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:21,819
This right here is minus 24.

350
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:27,010
This right here is minus 27.

351
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:30,270
And then this right here, let's
see, this is minus 10

352
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,030
right here.

353
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,650
That is minus 10.

354
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:39,860
Minus 4 times minus
10 is plus 40.

355
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,950
Let's see if we can simplify
this a little bit.

356
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,450
If we simplify this a little
bit-- I don't want to make a

357
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,540
careless mistake right
at the end.

358
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:54,690
So 18 minus 24, 24 minus 18 is
6, so this is going to be

359
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,530
equal to minus 6, right?

360
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,090
18 minus 24 is minus 6.

361
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:03,270
And then-- let me do it in
green-- now what's the

362
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,740
difference?

363
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:10,470
If we have minus 27 plus
40, that's 13, right?

364
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,510
It's positive 13.

365
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:18,310
So minus 6 plus positive
13 is equal to 7.

366
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,460
And so we are done!

367
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,700
After all of that computation,
hopefully we haven't made a

368
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,970
careless mistake.

369
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,030
The determinant of this
character right

370
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,550
here is equal to 7.

371
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,670
The determinant is equal to 7.

372
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:33,310
And so the one useful takeaway,
we know that this is

373
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:36,950
invertible because it has
a non-zero determinant.

374
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,130
Hopefully, you found
that useful.

375
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:39,297
