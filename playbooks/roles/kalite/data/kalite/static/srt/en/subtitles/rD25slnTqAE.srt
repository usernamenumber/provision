00:00:00,879 --> 00:00:04,013
The type of debt that most of us are most familiar with

2
00:00:04,013 --> 00:00:05,631
are mortgages that we might take out on our homes.

3
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:08,031
What I want to do in this video is clarify

4
00:00:08,031 --> 00:00:10,160
how a mortgage is different than the type of debt

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,221
that many corporations would take on.

6
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:17,166
So if I were to take out a $1,000,000 mortgage,

7
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:19,399
what happens is that the bank figures out a fixed payment

8
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:20,916
that I could pay

9
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:23,614
really every month. And as I pay that payment,

10
00:00:23,614 --> 00:00:26,309
and that payment will not change over the course of

11
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:29,642
the term of the mortgage, so maybe it's a 10 year mortgage,

12
00:00:29,642 --> 00:00:33,394
the payment, won't change, but as I pay that mortgage

13
00:00:33,394 --> 00:00:37,742
I pay some part of it is interest, and some part of it

14
00:00:37,742 --> 00:00:40,413
is actually paying down the mortgage.

15
00:00:40,413 --> 00:00:42,545
So early on in the life of the mortgage,

16
00:00:42,545 --> 00:00:44,481
maybe this is the first payment here

17
00:00:44,481 --> 00:00:49,317
most of the payment is going to be interest

18
00:00:49,317 --> 00:00:52,014
and a little bit of the mortgage is going to be

19
00:00:52,014 --> 00:00:54,459
the mortgage payment, is going to be principal.

20
00:00:54,459 --> 00:00:57,013
And when I say principal, that little pink part right there,

21
00:00:57,013 --> 00:01:01,116
that's actually being used to pay down the debt on the mortgage.

22
00:01:01,116 --> 00:01:04,482
So after this first payment, now the debt is a little bit less,

23
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:07,879
I'm going to make the same total mortgage payment,

24
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:09,929
but since the debt is now less, the total debt

25
00:01:09,929 --> 00:01:13,551
is now less, the amount, I'm taking the same interest rate

26
00:01:13,551 --> 00:01:15,710
I'm assuming it's a fixed interest rate here,

27
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,508
but the amount of interest is going to be less

28
00:01:17,508 --> 00:01:19,894
'cause I paid off a little bit of the principal already.

29
00:01:19,894 --> 00:01:23,561
So on the next payment, the amount of interest is going to be a little bit less

30
00:01:23,561 --> 00:01:25,003
and for that fixed payment

31
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:27,814
that I'm making, I'm going to be able to give

32
00:01:27,814 --> 00:01:31,013
more principal. And we keep doing that.

33
00:01:31,013 --> 00:01:34,383
So we keep doing that, so I'm going to do that same color.

34
00:01:34,383 --> 00:01:38,068
So the next payment after that, no that's not the same color,

35
00:01:38,068 --> 00:01:39,951
the next payment after that

36
00:01:39,951 --> 00:01:42,214
even though it's the exact same payment,

37
00:01:42,214 --> 00:01:43,882
it's going to have less interest because I've paid down

38
00:01:43,882 --> 00:01:46,740
more of the debt now, so it's going to have less interest

39
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,032
it normally doesn't happen this quickly,

40
00:01:49,032 --> 00:01:51,013
but hopefully this gives you the idea,

41
00:01:51,013 --> 00:01:53,154
and it's also going to have more principal.

42
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:56,272
So that you fast forward all the way to near the end of the term

43
00:01:56,272 --> 00:01:58,814
so this is many payments later,

44
00:01:58,814 --> 00:02:00,803
means this is the end of the 10 years

45
00:02:00,803 --> 00:02:03,057
I think I said this was a 10 year mortgage loan

46
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:05,197
on that last payment even though every

47
00:02:05,197 --> 00:02:07,067
payment was exactly the same amount,

48
00:02:07,067 --> 00:02:09,908
the mortgage payment was the same dollar amount every month,

49
00:02:09,908 --> 00:02:16,473
that last payment is going to be very little interest,

50
00:02:16,473 --> 00:02:20,782
and mostly principal. And then after that last payment

51
00:02:20,782 --> 00:02:24,209
you would, or if I'm that person taking out the mortgage loan,

52
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:31,646
I would have paid off the loan. So Loan Paid Off.

53
00:02:31,646 --> 00:02:37,447
And I own the house outright, in a traditional fixed rate mortgage.

54
00:02:37,447 --> 00:02:39,780
With corporate debt, it's not always like that,

55
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,417
in fact it's not usually like that. Corporate debt

56
00:02:42,417 --> 00:02:45,039
is usually interest only debt.

57
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,948
And there might be some things where the corporation

58
00:02:47,948 --> 00:02:50,120
has to pay off certain amounts of the loan at certain times,

59
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,596
but it isn't the model where you have a fixed payment

60
00:02:52,596 --> 00:02:55,373
and you pay off the debt over certain amount of time.

61
00:02:55,373 --> 00:02:59,129
Most corporate debt, let's say a corporation takes $1,000,000 in debt

62
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:01,876
and let's say it's a 10 year loan as well,

63
00:03:01,876 --> 00:03:05,082
but the corporation is just going to pay the interest only

64
00:03:05,082 --> 00:03:07,847
Is going to pay the interest only the entire time.

65
00:03:07,847 --> 00:03:11,408
So whatever this amount was, roughly, is what the corporation

66
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:13,346
will pay every month.

67
00:03:13,346 --> 00:03:16,843
So they'll pay exactly that much every time period,

68
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:20,079
maybe every quarter, every year, whatever it might be

69
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:23,500
and then you fast forward, you fast forward

70
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,115
to the end of the term of the loan,

71
00:03:26,115 --> 00:03:30,198
so they continue paying that same amount,

72
00:03:30,198 --> 00:03:32,280
and at the end of the term of the loan

73
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,644
they have to pay that amount, plus all of the principal

74
00:03:36,644 --> 00:03:40,230
at once. Plus all of the principal at once.

75
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,549
Now, most companies won't have all of that principal sitting around

76
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:46,922
so whatever it might be, they have to pay all of the principal

77
00:03:46,922 --> 00:03:49,649
at once at the end of the term of the loan.

78
00:03:49,649 --> 00:03:52,130
And, if they have the cash, they could pay off the loan,

79
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,947
but if they don't have the cash,

80
00:03:53,947 --> 00:03:55,803
and most corporations would not have the cash

81
00:03:55,803 --> 00:03:57,815
in this situation, that's why they borrowed it in the first place,

82
00:03:57,815 --> 00:04:01,282
what they would do is they would take out a new loan

83
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:04,680
so they would take out a new loan for the same amount of principal

84
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,815
So they'll maybe to the same bank, maybe a different bank,

85
00:04:06,815 --> 00:04:08,602
but it might now have a different interest rate,

86
00:04:08,602 --> 00:04:10,414
different loan terms, whatever,

87
00:04:10,414 --> 00:04:13,132
so they'll now take out a new loan at the end of the term period

88
00:04:13,132 --> 00:04:17,047
Use that to pay the principal on their old loan,

89
00:04:17,047 --> 00:04:20,679
and then they'll continue paying interest for the term of this new loan,

90
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:22,470
so it's a slightly different process,

91
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,202
and I just wanted to make sure you understood that.

92
00:04:24,202 --> 00:04:26,513
And the other thing, this isn't all corporate debt,

93
00:04:26,513 --> 00:04:28,796
they can be fixed interest rate, floating interest rate,

94
00:04:28,796 --> 00:04:31,964
there's often things called covenants

95
00:04:31,964 --> 00:04:34,468
covenants that the bank will place on the corporation

96
00:04:34,468 --> 00:04:37,144
to make sure that the corporation isn't doing dangerous things

97
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:38,791
that will make it less likely,

98
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,507
that they'll eventually be able to pay off the debt

99
00:04:40,507 --> 00:04:42,153
or less likely they could eventually get a loan,

100
00:04:42,153 --> 00:04:44,263
to pay off the current loan,

101
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:47,865
so it's, there are controls that the bank has

102
00:04:47,865 --> 00:04:50,403
to make sure that the company is good for this

103
00:04:50,403 --> 00:04:51,900
near the end of the term,

104
00:04:51,900 --> 99:59:59,999
but as you can see it's a fundamentally different process than most mortgage loans.
