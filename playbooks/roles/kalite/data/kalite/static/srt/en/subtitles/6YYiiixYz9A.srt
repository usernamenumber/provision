00:00:00,138 --> 00:00:03,948
Find the reciprocal of 2 and 4/5.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,840
So if we want to invert this fraction, 
we have to write it

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,780
as a pure fraction first, or
as an improper fraction.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,610
Right now, it's just a mixed number.

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,530
So let's just write it as an improper fraction.

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:20,710
So 2 and 4/5, if we write it as
an improper fraction,

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,410
it's still going to be over 5, but
the numerator is now going to

8
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:32,532
be 5 times 2 plus 4, and that's
because 2 is 10/5, or 2 times 5 fifths.

9
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:33,750
So let's write it like that.

10
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:41,512
So it's going to be 2 times 5 plus 4.

11
00:00:41,578 --> 00:00:45,330
2 times 5 is 10.

12
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:50,390
10/5 is the same thing as 2, and
then the 4/5 is this 4/5 right there.

13
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:53,790
So this is going to be equal
to 2 times 5 is 10

14
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,670
plus 4 is 14: 14/5.

15
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,930
So these are equivalent fractions.

16
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,480
This is written as a mixed number.

17
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,459
This is written as an improper fraction.

18
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:08,297
It's improper because the
numerator is bigger than the denominator.

19
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,630
Now we want to find the reciprocal.

20
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:14,241
When you find the reciprocal, you just 
switch the numerator and the denominator.

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,270
You just flip the fraction.

22
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:20,186
So if you want to take the reciprocal. 
Let me do this in a new color.

23
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:29,850
If we want to take the
reciprocal of this, we just

24
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,160
swap the 5 and the 14.

25
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,014
So this is going to be: instead of 14/5,
it's going to be 5/14.

26
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,630
And we're done!
