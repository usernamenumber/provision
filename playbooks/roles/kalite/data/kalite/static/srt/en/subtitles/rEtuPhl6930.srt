00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:06,102
Welcome to Part 2 on the
presentation on Level 1 exponent rules.

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,329
So let's start off by
reviewing the rules we've learned already.

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:19,835
If I had 2 to the tenth times 2
to the fifth,

4
00:00:19,835 --> 00:00:26,822
we learned that since we're multiplying exponents with the same base, we can add the exponent,

5
00:00:26,822 --> 00:00:31,610
so this equals 2 to the fifteenth.

6
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:39,556
We also learned that if it was 2 to the tenth over 2 to the fifth,

7
00:00:39,556 --> 00:00:41,690
we would actually subtract the exponents.

8
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,919
So this would be 2 to
the 10 minus 5,

9
00:00:45,919 --> 00:00:48,634
which equals 2 to the fifth.

10
00:00:48,634 --> 00:00:50,091
At the end of the last
presentation,

11
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:52,555
and I probably shouldn't have introduced it
so fast,

12
00:00:52,555 --> 00:00:54,101
I introduced a new concept.

13
00:00:54,101 --> 00:01:02,894
What happens if I have 2 to
the tenth to the fifth power?

14
00:01:02,894 --> 00:01:04,457
Well, let's think about
what that means.

15
00:01:04,457 --> 00:01:08,555
When I raise something to the
fifth power, that's just like saying

16
00:01:08,555 --> 00:01:15,563
2 to the tenth times 2
to the tenth times 2 to the tenth

17
00:01:15,578 --> 00:01:20,509
times 2 to the tenth times 2 to the tenth, right?

18
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:24,803
All I did is I took 2 to the tenth and I multiplied it by itself five times.

19
00:01:24,803 --> 00:01:26,370
That's the fifth power.

20
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,488
Well, we know from this rule up
here

21
00:01:29,488 --> 00:01:33,280
that we can add these exponents because they're
all the same base.

22
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,052
So if we add 10 plus 10
plus 10 plus 10 plus 10, what do we get?

23
00:01:39,052 --> 00:01:42,480
Right, we get 2 to
the fiftieth power.

24
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,090
So essentially, what
did we do here?

25
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:50,420
All we did is we multiplied
10 times 5 to get 50.

26
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,465
So that's our third exponent rule, that when I raise an exponent to a power,

27
00:01:54,465 --> 00:01:57,866
and then I raise that whole expression to another power,

28
00:01:57,866 --> 00:02:00,940
I can multiply
those two exponents.

29
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,400
So let me give you
another example.

30
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:12,248
If I said 3 to the 7, and all
of that to the negative 9,

31
00:02:12,248 --> 00:02:17,460
once again, all I do is I multiply
the 7 and the negative 9,

32
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:23,200
and I get 3 to the minus 63.

33
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,670
So, you see, it works just as
easily with negative numbers.

34
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:35,173
So now, I'm going to teach you
one final exponent property.

35
00:02:35,173 --> 00:02:44,493
If I have-- Let's say I have 2 times 9,

36
00:02:44,494 --> 00:02:48,710
and I raise that whole thing to the hundredth power.

37
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:53,540
It turns out of this is equal
to 2 to the hundredth power

38
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,890
times 9 to the hundredth power.

39
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,180
Now let's make sure
that that makes sense.

40
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,880
Let's do it with a
smaller example.

41
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:06,190
What if it was 4 times
5 to the third power?

42
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:15,440
Well, that would just be equal
to 4 times 5 times 4 times 5

43
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,890
times 4 times 5, right, which
is the same thing as 4 times 4

44
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:26,410
times 4 times 5 times
5 times 5, right?

45
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,820
I just switched the order in
which I'm multiplying,

46
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,730
which you can do with multiplication.

47
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,030
Well, 4 times 4 times 4,
well, that's just equal

48
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,640
to 4 to the third.

49
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,851
And 5 times 5 times 5 is
equal to 5 to the third.

50
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:43,341
Hope that gives you a good
intuition of why this property here is true.

51
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,047
And actually, when I had first
learned exponent rules,

52
00:03:46,047 --> 00:03:47,357
I would always forget the rules,

53
00:03:47,357 --> 00:03:50,750
and I would always do this proof myself, or the other proofs.

54
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,331
And a proof is just an explanation of why the rule works,

55
00:03:54,331 --> 00:03:56,660
just to make sure that I was doing it right.

56
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,680
So given everything that we've
learned to now--

57
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,810
actually, let me review all of
the rules again.

58
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:10,390
If I have 2 to the seventh
times 2 to the third,

59
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,366
well, then I can add the
exponents, 2 to the tenth.

60
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:19,757
If I have 2 the seventh over
2 the third,

61
00:04:19,757 --> 00:04:24,580
well, here I subtract the exponents, and
I get 2 to the fourth.

62
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:30,787
If I have 2 to the seventh to
the third power,

63
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:32,310
well, here I multiplied the exponents.

64
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,518
That gives you 2 to the 21.

65
00:04:35,518 --> 00:04:41,828
And if I had 2 times 7 to the third power,

66
00:04:41,828 --> 00:04:47,650
well, that equals 2 to the third times
7 to the third.

67
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,414
Now, let's use all of these
rules we've learned

68
00:04:50,414 --> 00:04:55,500
to actually try to do some, what I would
call, composite problems

69
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,630
that involve you using multiple
rules at the same time.

70
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:04,483
And a good composite problem was that problem that I had introduced you to at the end of that last seminar.

71
00:05:04,483 --> 00:05:20,323
Let's say I have 3 squared times 9 to the eighth power,

72
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:25,780
and all of that I'm going to
raise to the negative 2 power.

73
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,250
So what can I do here?

74
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,847
Well, 3 and 9 are two separate
bases,

75
00:05:30,847 --> 00:05:35,760
but 9 can actually be expressed as an exponent of 3, right?

76
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,540
9 is the same thing as
3 squared.

77
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,210
So let's rewrite 9 like that.

78
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,604
That's equivalent to 3 squared
times--

79
00:05:43,604 --> 00:05:49,489
9 is the same thing as 3 squared to the eighth power,

80
00:05:49,489 --> 00:05:52,350
and then all of that to the negative 2 power, right?

81
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,330
All I did is I replaced 9
with 3 squared,

82
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,610
because we know 3 times 3 is 9.

83
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:01,624
Well, now we can use the multiplication rule on this to simplify it.

84
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:10,100
So this is equal to 3 squared
times 3 to the 2 times 8,

85
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,827
which is 16.

86
00:06:12,827 --> 00:06:15,230
And all of that to the negative 2.

87
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,610
Now, we can use the first rule.

88
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:20,591
We have the same base, so we can add the exponents, and we're multiplying them,

89
00:06:20,591 --> 00:06:23,865
so that equals 3 to the eighteenth power, right?

90
00:06:23,865 --> 00:06:28,210
2 plus 16, and all that to the negative 2.

91
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,150
And now we're almost done.

92
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,685
We can once again use this multiplication rule,

93
00:06:31,685 --> 00:06:37,749
and we could say 3-- this is equal to 3 to the eighteen times negative 2,

94
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:42,220
so that's 3 to the minus 36.

95
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,994
So this problem might have seemed pretty daunting at first,

96
00:06:46,994 --> 00:06:49,088
but there aren't that many rules,

97
00:06:49,088 --> 00:06:52,965
and all you have to do is keep seeing, oh, wow,
that little part of the problem, I can simplify it.

98
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:53,935
Then you simplify it,

99
00:06:53,935 --> 00:06:59,815
and you'll see that you can keep using rules until you get to a much simpler answer.

100
00:06:59,815 --> 00:07:03,352
And actually the Level 1 problems don't even involve problems this difficult.

101
00:07:03,352 --> 00:07:06,380
This'll be more on the
exponent rules, Level 2.

102
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:12,696
But I think at this point you're ready to try the problems.

103
00:07:12,696 --> 00:07:15,537
I'm kind of divided whether I want you to memorize the rules

104
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,800
because I think it's better to almost forget the rules

105
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,986
and have to prove it to yourself over and over again to the point that you remember the rules.

106
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,523
Because if you just memorize the rules,

107
00:07:24,523 --> 00:07:27,520
later on in life, when you haven't done it for a couple of years,

108
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,709
you might kind of forget the rules,

109
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:30,590
and then you won't know how to get back to the rules.

110
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,880
But it's up to you.

111
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,422
I just hope you do understand why these rules work,

112
00:07:34,422 --> 00:07:36,616
and as, long as you practice and you pay attention to the signs,

113
00:07:36,616 --> 00:07:40,510
you should have no problems
with the Level 1 exercises.

114
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,010
Have fun!
