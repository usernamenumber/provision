1
00:00:04,709 --> 00:00:10,815
We're in the so-called mausoleum of Galla Placidia in the city of Ravenna in Italy.

2
00:00:10,815 --> 00:00:14,869
When you think about the history of the Roman Empire, you think about the city of Rome.

3
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:20,785
You don't think about Ravenna, but Ravenna played a key role at the end of the Roman Empire.

4
00:00:20,785 --> 00:00:28,943
The Roman Empire was in trouble in the Third and Fourth Centuries, that is, 300 years or so after Christ.

5
00:00:28,943 --> 00:00:32,692
It had been split. It had been rejoined and split again.

6
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:34,411
It was a complicated history.

7
00:00:34,411 --> 00:00:38,162
And there were migrating peoples coming into the Empire.

8
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:41,753
You might know these as the Ostrogoths, the Visigoths, the Huns.

9
00:00:41,753 --> 00:00:53,109
Ultimately, Constantine moved the capital of the Empire from Rome to a strategic location in the East, what is now called Istanbul but which was renamed Constantinople.

10
00:00:53,109 --> 00:01:02,979
Before it was Constantinople, it was the Greek town of Byzantium, and that's why we call the culture from the eastern part of the Empire, Byzantine.

11
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:13,349
The Roman Expire was basically split at this time between traditions that began to develop independently in the East and traditions that began to develop independently in the West.

12
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:19,861
So, here we are in the early Fifth Century, and Galla Placidia was the daughter of the Emperor Theodosius.

13
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:26,060
And Galla Placidia's brother moved the capital of the western part of the Roman Empire here to Ravenna.

14
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:39,352
Now, Ravenna had been an important port in ancient Rome. Augustus had half his navy situated here because the city was basically surrounded by marsh on one side and the Adriatic Sea on the other.

15
00:01:39,352 --> 00:01:51,782
Let's talk about Galla Placidia for just a moment because she's amazing. She's the daughter of the Emperor who ruled from Constantinople, and she's the sister of the man who would rule the western capital.

16
00:01:51,782 --> 00:01:56,569
Her father married her off to the king of the Goths in a political alliance.

17
00:01:56,569 --> 00:02:03,630
Ultimately, she would remarry, and her son would become emperor, but he was too young to rule.

18
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:10,075
She ruled the western Roman Empire in place of her son until her son was old enough to take over.

19
00:02:10,075 --> 00:02:21,800
So, she was a very powerful woman and was responsible for building many buildings here in Ravenna including this mausoleum which was originally attached to a church that she built.

20
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,969
Now, we call this the "so-called" mausoleum because art historians used to think that she was buried here.

21
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:31,564
We now believe that she died in Rome and wasn't buried here.

22
00:02:31,564 --> 00:02:34,868
From the outside, the so-called mausoleum is quite small.

23
00:02:34,868 --> 00:02:38,707
It's made of reused ancient Roman brick.

24
00:02:38,707 --> 00:02:49,758
Remember, this had been an important Roman city for the navy, and so the people in the Fifth Century dismantled those older buildings and reused those materials, and that's what we have here.

25
00:02:49,758 --> 00:02:54,208
The building used to be taller, but the ground around it rose.

26
00:02:54,208 --> 00:03:02,082
But, what everyone comes to see is the interior decorations because outside it really doesn't look like much, but inside it's fabulous.

27
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:10,120
The walls are covered up to about, oh, seven or eight feet with marble, and then above that, amazing mosaics.

28
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,503
This is a rare example where the original mosaics are completely intact.

29
00:03:15,503 --> 00:03:22,912
Now, the building itself is the shape of a cross, and on each of the four transepts there are barrel vaults.

30
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:28,949
And, then, in the center, there is a shallow dome, and all of that is covered with mosaic.

31
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:34,625
Now, mosaics are small tiles of stone, or, in this case, glass.

32
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:39,794
They're brightly colored in blues and greens and reds and golds.

33
00:03:39,794 --> 00:03:49,195
So, in this case, gold was sandwiched between pieces of glass, and these pieces, or tesseraei, are set a little bit on edge.

34
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:54,044
In other words, they're not smooth and flat against the wall, and so they catch the light and glimmer.

35
00:03:54,044 --> 00:04:03,389
And that would have been especially true when this room was illuminated not by an electric light with its steady illumination, but instead by the flickering light of lanterns.

36
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:09,175
And, so we really do experience a sense of another world.

37
00:04:09,175 --> 00:04:11,754
Let's take a look at a few of the mosaics here.

38
00:04:11,754 --> 00:04:14,861
Now, much of the wall is covered with decorative forms.

39
00:04:14,861 --> 00:04:18,394
Forms that might remind us of ancient Roman carving.

40
00:04:18,394 --> 00:04:33,910
For example, we see acanthus leaves and vines although the vines here are very specifically grape vines, and that refers to the Sacrament of the Eucharist, of taking the bread and wine of the body and blood of Christ.

41
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:41,165
When we first walk into the mausoleum, the first mosaic that we see is one that we don't entirely understand.

42
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:43,546
It shows a saint on the right.

43
00:04:43,546 --> 00:04:45,589
He's holding a book. He's holding a cross.

44
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:47,563
He's got a halo in back of him.

45
00:04:47,563 --> 00:04:52,125
And, he seems to be running towards a fire directly under a small window.

46
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,390
And that fire has a grill on it.

47
00:04:54,390 --> 00:05:00,137
We often assume that that's Saint Lawrence because Saint Lawrence was martyred by being burned to death.

48
00:05:00,137 --> 00:05:15,343
And he's the saint we most often see in western iconography, but because, on the other side, we see very prominently an opened cabinet revealing four books, the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, the four Gospels.

49
00:05:15,343 --> 00:05:26,678
And, because the Saint holds the book, one scholar has suggested that this might be Saint Vincent of Saragossa whose legend does involve books, unlike Saint Lawrence.

50
00:05:26,678 --> 00:05:37,814
Saint Vincent, or Saint Lawrence, or whoever that is, is also dressed, as are all the figures in this building, looking very much as if you were an ancient Roman.

51
00:05:37,814 --> 00:05:44,594
There's this wonderful kind of animation to his figure; the drape flows out in back of him as if he's speeding forward.

52
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:52,857
And the kind of energy that's expressed in that cloth is echoed in the liveliness of the flames themselves.

53
00:05:52,857 --> 00:06:01,292
We can see the flames underneath the grill, but we also see their shadow on the wall behind, or what must be the wall behind.

54
00:06:01,368 --> 00:06:09,309
It's very difficult to talk about it as a space that makes sense because it's so obviously not very naturalistic.

55
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:11,525
That cabinet doesn't make sense.

56
00:06:11,678 --> 00:06:23,878
We have a kind of flat background, and, yet, there are still some naturalistic aspects to it, like the drapery that the saint wears which does have some sense of modeling and three-dimensionality to it.

57
00:06:23,878 --> 00:06:26,186
There's also a real specificity.

58
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:29,108
If you look at the grill, it's actually on wheels.

59
00:06:29,108 --> 00:06:34,713
There are these decisions to place very specific elements here even if we don't entirely understand them.

60
00:06:34,713 --> 00:06:42,024
Now, opposite this mosaic, this lunette, is another, right over the door, and we don't see it until we turn to leave.

61
00:06:42,024 --> 00:06:44,855
And here we see Christ as the Good Shepherd.

62
00:06:44,855 --> 00:06:49,631
Again, looking very ancient Roman to me, although wearing a halo.

63
00:06:49,631 --> 00:06:56,270
But turning his body in a very natural way sitting in a landscape surrounded by sheep.

64
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,605
There is that wonderful torsion in that body.

65
00:06:58,605 --> 00:07:03,491
It is so classical, and it's such a careful observation of the way that the human body moves.

66
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:12,371
And, yet, at the same time, it has the kind of simplification of the body's forms that clearly locate this in the early Medieval period.

67
00:07:12,371 --> 00:07:17,600
And it's also a very symmetrical image with the figure in the center and three sheep on either side.

68
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,686
And there's a decorative quality overall.

69
00:07:20,686 --> 00:07:28,706
Now, the iconography, or the symbolism, of Christ being shown as a shepherd comes directly out of the Gospel of John.

70
00:07:28,706 --> 00:07:35,229
It's the idea that Christ is leading his flock, leading the faithful, taking care of them.

71
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:41,487
Christ looks unusually more young. We normally expect to see him older and with a beard, and here he's young and beardless.

72
00:07:41,487 --> 00:07:52,207
It's a beautiful image with those pale greens. There are fronds of a palm that rise up in back of the rocks at the horizon line, and they're flecked with gold.

73
00:07:52,207 --> 00:07:56,868
So the entire image has a kind of beauty and a luminosity that's just wonderful.
