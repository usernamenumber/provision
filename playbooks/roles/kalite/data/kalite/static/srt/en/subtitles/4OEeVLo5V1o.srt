99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Lets do some examples to simplify trigonometric expressions.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So lets say that I have 1 - sin^2 (theta).

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And this whole thing times

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
cos^2 (theta).

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
How could I simplify this?

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well the one thing that we do know - and this is the most fundamental trig identity

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this comes out of the unit circle
