1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,390
   

2
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,810
In the last video we defined a
transformation that rotated

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:09,160
any vector in R2 and just gave
us another rotated version of

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,200
that vector in R2.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,420
In this video, I'm essentially
going to extend this, so I'm

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,750
going to do it in R3.

7
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,895
So I'm going to define a
rotation transformation.

8
00:00:17,895 --> 00:00:21,550
   

9
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,220
I'll still call it theta.

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,360
There's going to be a mapping
this time from R3 to R3.

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,820
As you can imagine, the idea
of a rotation in an angle

12
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,940
becomes a little bit more
complicated when we're dealing

13
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:33,970
in three dimensions.

14
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:38,205
So in this case we're going to
rotate around the x-axis, let

15
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:48,160
me call it-- so this is going
to rotate around the x-axis.

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,290
And what we do in this video,
you can then just generalize

17
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,530
that to other axes.

18
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,950
And if you want to rotate around
the x-axis, and then

19
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:59,360
the y-axis, and then the z-axis
by different angles,

20
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,160
you can just apply the

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,580
transformations one after another.

22
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,040
And we're going to cover that
in a lot more detail in a

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,989
future video.

24
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:07,210
But this should kind of give you
the tools to show you that

25
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,820
this idea that we learned in the
previous video is actually

26
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,170
generalizeable to multiple
dimensions, and especially

27
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,340
three dimensions.

28
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,060
So let me just be clear, what
we're going to be doing here.

29
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,910
Let me draw some axes.

30
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,150
That's my x-axis.

31
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,550
That is my y-axis.

32
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,730
And this is my z-axis.

33
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,660
Of course, this is R3.

34
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,970
But any vector here in R3
I will be rotating it

35
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,380
counterclockwise around
the x-axis.

36
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,850
We'll be rotating like that.

37
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:41,520
So if I had a vector-- I'm
just drawing it in the zy

38
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,220
plane because it's a little bit
easier to visualize-- but

39
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,430
if I have a vector sitting here
in the zy plane, it will

40
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,760
still stay in the zy plane.

41
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,260
But it'll be rotated
counterclockwise by an angle

42
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,980
of theta, just like that.

43
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,490
Now, a little harder to
visualize is a vector that

44
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,970
doesn't just sit in
the zy plane.

45
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,510
If we have some vector that
has some x-component that

46
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:04,720
comes out like that, then some
y-component and some

47
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,020
z-component, it looks
like that.

48
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,650
Then when you rotate it, its
z and its y-components will

49
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,330
change, but its x-component
will stay the same.

50
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,020
So then it might look
something like this.

51
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,070
Let me see if I can
give it justice.

52
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,030
So then the vector when I rotate
it around might look

53
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,050
something like that.

54
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,850
Anyway, I don't know if I'm
giving it proper justice but

55
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,100
this was rotated around
the x-axis.

56
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,920
I think you understand
what that means.

57
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,340
But just based on the last
video, we want to build a

58
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,190
transformation.

59
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,300
Let me call this rotation
3 theta.

60
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,260
Or let me call it 3 rotation
theta now that

61
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,970
we're dealing in R3.

62
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,600
And what we want to do is we
want to find some matrix, so I

63
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:52,280
can write my 3 rotation sub
theta transformation of x as

64
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,650
being some matrix A times
the vector x.

65
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,060
Since this is a transformation
from R3 to R3 this is of

66
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,010
course going to be
a 3 by 3 matrix.

67
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,970
Now in the last video we learned
that to figure this

68
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,580
out, you just have to apply the
transformation essentially

69
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,180
to the identity matrix.

70
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,950
So what we do is we start off
with the identity matrix in

71
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,330
R3, which is just going
to be a 3 by 3.

72
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:21,040
   

73
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:28,330
It's going to have 1, 1,
1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.

74
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:32,090
Each of these columns are the
basis vectors for R3.

75
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,610
That's e1, e2, e3-- I'm writing
it probably too small

76
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,290
for you to see-- but each
of these are the

77
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,260
basis vectors for R3.

78
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,730
And what we need to do is just
apply the transformation to

79
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,220
each of these basis
vectors in R3.

80
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,500
So our matrix A will
look like this.

81
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,220
Our matrix A is going to
be a 3 by 3 matrix.

82
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,290
Where the first column
is going to be our

83
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:01,910
transformation, 3 rotation sub
theta, applied to that column

84
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:05,770
vector right there, 1, 0, 0.

85
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:09,050
And then I'm going to apply it
to this middle column vector

86
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,790
right here.

87
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,860
You get the idea, I don't
want to write

88
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,030
that whole thing again.

89
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm going to apply 3 rotation
sub theta to 0, 1, 0.

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,135
And then I'm going to apply
it-- I'll do it here-- 3

91
00:04:23,135 --> 00:04:26,400
rotation sub theta.

92
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,130
I'm going to apply it
to this last column

93
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,020
vector, so 0, 0, 1.

94
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,790
We've seen this multiple
times.

95
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,930
So let's apply it.

96
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:37,300
Let's rotate each of these
basis vectors for R3.

97
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,650
Let's rotate them around
the x-axis.

98
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,730
So the first guy, if I were
to draw an R3, what

99
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:45,690
would he look like?

100
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:49,150
He only has directionality
in the x direction right?

101
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:53,670
If we call this the x-dimension,
if the first

102
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:57,210
entry corresponds to our
x-dimension, the second entry

103
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,880
corresponds to our
y-dimension.

104
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,720
And the third entry
corresponds to our

105
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,360
z-dimension.

106
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,930
This vector would just be a unit
vector that just comes

107
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,710
out like that, right?

108
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,650
So if I'm going to rotate this
vector around the x-axis,

109
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,040
what's going to happen to it?

110
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,320
Well, nothing.

111
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,610
It is the x-axis.

112
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,480
So when you rotate it, it's not
changing its direction or

113
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,000
its magnitude or anything.

114
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,650
So this vector right here
is just going to be the

115
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,320
vector 1, 0, 0.

116
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,420
Nothing happens when
you rotate it.

117
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,040
Now these are a little
bit more interesting.

118
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,940
To do these, let me just
draw my zy-axis.

119
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,840
Let me just draw my Z.

120
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,800
So that's my z-axis and this
is my y-axis right here.

121
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,240
Now this basis vector just goes
in the y direction by 1.

122
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,690
So this basis vector just
looks like that.

123
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,520
And it has a length of 1.

124
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,255
And then when you rotate it
around the x-axis, when I draw

125
00:05:58,255 --> 00:06:00,260
it like this, you could imagine
the x-axis is just

126
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,490
popping out of your
computer screens.

127
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,455
So I could draw it like this is
like the tip of the arrow

128
00:06:05,455 --> 00:06:06,320
just popping out.

129
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,980
Instead of drawing it at an
angle like this, I'm drawing

130
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,660
it straight out of the
computer screen.

131
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,180
So if you were to rotate this
vector right here, this blue

132
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:17,800
vector right here, by
an angle of theta,

133
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,130
it'll look like this.

134
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,760
And we've done this in
the previous video.

135
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,350
What are its new coordinates?

136
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,890
First of all, will
its x-coordinate

137
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,160
have changed it all?

138
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,270
It's x-coordinate was 0 before,
because it doesn't

139
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,730
break out into the
x-dimension.

140
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,920
It just stays along
the zy plane.

141
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,240
It was 0 before.

142
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,590
When you rotate it, it's
still on a zy plane.

143
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,870
So its x direction, or
its x-component,

144
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,270
won't change at all.

145
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,960
So the x direction is
still going to be 0.

146
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,530
And then what's its
new y direction?

147
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:52,590
Well, here we do exactly what
we did in the last video.

148
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:56,830
We figure out this is going to
be its new-- I guess I don't

149
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,330
want to draw a vector there
necessarily-- but this length

150
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:03,600
right here is going to be
its new y-component.

151
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,430
And this length right here
is going to be its new

152
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,200
z-component.

153
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,440
So what's its new y-component?

154
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,270
We did this in the last video
so I won't go into as much

155
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:18,320
detail, but what is
cosine of theta?

156
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,750
The length of this vector
is 1, right?

157
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,060
These are the standard
basis vectors.

158
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,490
And one of the things that makes
them a nice standard

159
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,500
basis vector is that their
lengths are 1.

160
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:33,480
So we know that the cosine of
this angle is equal to the

161
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,870
adjacent side over
the hypotenuse.

162
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,140
The adjacent side is
this right here.

163
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,310
And what is the hypotenuse?

164
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,000
It's equal to 1.

165
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,350
So this adjacent side, which we
said is going to be our new

166
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:47,820
second component, our second
entry, is going to be equal to

167
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,500
cosine of theta, right?

168
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,630
That's A.

169
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,780
You can just ignore the 1's.

170
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,180
This going to be equal
to cosine of theta.

171
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:59,020
And what's going to be
its new z-component?

172
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:06,760
Well, sine of theta is equal
to the opposite side, this

173
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,200
side over 1.

174
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,790
So it just equals its
opposite side.

175
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,950
And the length of that
opposite side is this

176
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:16,190
vector's, once it's rotated,
is its new z-component.

177
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:19,560
So you've got a sine
theta right there.

178
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,680
Now we just have to do
everything in the z direction.

179
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,340
So this z basis vector right
there, what does it look like

180
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,760
on this graph?

181
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,850
Let me just actually redraw it
just to make things a little

182
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,400
bit cleaner.

183
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,650
So that's my z-axis and
this is my y-axis.

184
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:40,600
And my z-basis vector e3,
it starts off looking

185
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,850
something like that.

186
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,530
   

187
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,960
It just goes only in
the z direction.

188
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,530
So first of all, let's
just rotate it

189
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,510
by an angle of theta.

190
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,310
So I'm going to rotate
it like that.

191
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,900
That's an angle of theta.

192
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,430
Its former x entry was 0.

193
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,410
It did not break out in the
x direction at all.

194
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:03,800
And of course we're still just
in the zy plane so it won't be

195
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,960
moving out in the x direction.

196
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,650
So it's still going
to be a 0 up here.

197
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,480
Now what about its
new y-component?

198
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,960
Its new y-coordinate, I guess we
can call it, is going to be

199
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,290
this length, or it's going to be
this coordinate right here.

200
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,710
And how can we figure
that out?

201
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,490
Well, that length is the same
thing as that length.

202
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,740
And if we call this the opposite
side of the angle, we

203
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:31,400
know that the sine of theta is
equal to this opposite side

204
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,830
over the length of this vector,
which is just 1.

205
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,790
So it's just equal to
the opposite side.

206
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,970
So the opposite side is equal
to sine of theta.

207
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,246
But our new coordinate is to
the left of the z-axis, so

208
00:09:41,246 --> 00:09:42,500
this is going to be a
negative version.

209
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,695
We did this in the last video.

210
00:09:43,695 --> 00:09:45,780
So it's just going to be a
negative sine of theta.

211
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,340
   

212
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,630
This point right here,
that coordinate.

213
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:54,690
So it's minus sine of theta.

214
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,140
And then finally, what's its new
z-coordinate going to be?

215
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,310
That's going to be this
length right here.

216
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,850
And we know that this length,
if we call that adjacent, we

217
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:07,040
know that the cosine of
our theta is equal to

218
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,610
this divided by 1.

219
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:13,290
So it's equal to that adjacent
side, so just put a cosine of

220
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,990
theta right there.

221
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,970
And we get our transformation
matrix.

222
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,410
We're done.

223
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,680
Our transformation
matrix A is this.

224
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,070
So we can now say our new
transformation that

225
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,810
this video is about.

226
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:30,810
I call it a 3 because it's
a rotation in R3.

227
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,560
Maybe I should call it 3 sub X
because it's a rotation around

228
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,870
the x-axis, but I think
you get the idea.

229
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,850
It is equal to this matrix right
up here-- maybe I could

230
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,230
rewrite it.

231
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,420
Let me do it this way.

232
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:48,090
Let me delete all of this so
I don't have to rewrite.

233
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:54,250
So my transformation that this
videos is about, 3 rotation

234
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,500
theta of x, that transformation
is equal to

235
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,870
this matrix times whatever
vector x I have in R3.

236
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,030
And you might say, hey, Sal,
that looks exactly like what

237
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,220
you did in the second.

238
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,580
If you remember the last video
when we defined our rotation

239
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:13,260
in R2, we had a transformation
matrix that looked very

240
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,400
similar to this.

241
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,610
And that makes sense because
we're essentially just

242
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,010
rotating things

243
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,500
counterclockwise in the zy plane.

244
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,530
Now you might say, hey, Sal,
why is this even useful?

245
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:26,100
You extended it to three
dimensions or to R3, I saw

246
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:26,820
what you did in R2.

247
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,620
Why is this useful?

248
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,610
It's kind of a limited case
where you're just rotating

249
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,460
around the x-axis.

250
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,420
And I did it for two reasons.

251
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,860
One to show you that you
can generalize to R3.

252
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,860
But the other thing is, if you
think about it, a lot of the

253
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,260
rotations that you might want
to do in R3 can be described

254
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,340
by a rotation around the x-axis
first-- which we did in

255
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:48,080
this video-- then by rotation
around the y-axis and then

256
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,860
maybe some rotation
around the z-axis.

257
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:57,340
This is just a special case
where we're dealing with

258
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,820
rotation around the x-axis.

259
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,620
But you could do the exact
same process to define

260
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,560
transformation matrices for
rotations around the y-axis or

261
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,410
the z-axis, and then you can
apply them one after another.

262
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,460
And we'll talk a lot about that
in the future when we

263
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,780
start applying one

264
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,010
transformation after the other.

265
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,170
But anyway, hopefully you found
this slightly useful.

266
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,660
It's a slight extension
of what we did in R2.

267
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,910
