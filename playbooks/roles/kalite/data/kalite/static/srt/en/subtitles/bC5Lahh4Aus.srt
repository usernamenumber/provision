1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,930
   

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:01,560
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,860
So let's continue
where we left off.

4
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:07,120
So we had this intuition that i
must have something to do with

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,220
these sign changes, right?

6
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,330
The pattern of the sign changes
of i are very similar to the

7
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,340
pattern of the sign changes in
the Maclaurin representation of

8
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,020
cosine of x plus sine of x.

9
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,680
And then we also saw that the
i's, whether they're positive

10
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,720
i's or negative i's,
correspond to the sine terms.

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,310
So let's do a
little experiment.

12
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,050
And it's not an experiment
because I know where this

13
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,440
leads to, but it could
have been an experiment.

14
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,622
What is e to the i x?

15
00:00:31,622 --> 00:00:37,190
   

16
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,860
Well, raising anything to the
i power really isn't defined.

17
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,520
I mean, i, itself, was
created by a definition.

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,300
We said, "i squared is equal to
negative 1 by definition." So

19
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,490
i is a bit of a definition.

20
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,590
So if we haven't defined what
something to the i power is

21
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:56,910
yet, we really don't know
what to do with it.

22
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,370
But let's just say that
we can treat i just

23
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,820
like any other number.

24
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,840
And we do know what happens
with i when you put

25
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,740
it into a polynomial.

26
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,370
That's one thing we do know.

27
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,400
In fact, that's one of the
reasons why i was defined in

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,810
first place was so that people
could take roots of all

29
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,800
polynomials, even ones that
didn't have real roots.

30
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,170
So what happens if we
take e to the i x?

31
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,970
Well, I don't know what that is
but we know we could put that

32
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:24,030
into the Maclaurin
representation of e to the x

33
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,490
and actually, since you're
taking my leap of faith, that

34
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,050
that is equal to e of x and all
of its derivatives are equal to

35
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,870
e to the x's derivatives at x
equals 0, it's not

36
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:33,730
that hard to imagine.

37
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,490
And actually, you could plot
the graph of this and you'll

38
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,000
see that they're identical.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,420
So if we take the Maclaurin
representation of this,

40
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,060
everywhere we see an x we just
replace it with an i x, right?

41
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:56,430
So that will be 1 plus i x plus
-- let me just write it -- plus

42
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:01,460
i squared x squared
over 2 factorial.

43
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:10,110
Oops. i squared x squared plus
i to the third x to the third

44
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:18,760
over 3 factorial plus i to the
fourth x to the fourth over 4

45
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:25,280
factorial plus i to the fifth x
to the fifth over 5 factorial.

46
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,500
I don't have to keep going.

47
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,120
Plus, and it just
keeps going, right?

48
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,130
So what happens when
you simplify that?

49
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:38,520
So that equals 1 plus i
x -- What's i squared?

50
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,960
That's negative 1, right?
-- minus x squared

51
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,410
over 2 factorial.

52
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,250
What's i to the third?

53
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,160
That's minus i.

54
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:55,490
So it's minus i x to the
third over 3 factorial

55
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,310
plus i to the fourth.

56
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,140
So what's i to the fourth?

57
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:58,870
That's just 1 again.

58
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:05,910
So we get plus x to the
fourth over 4 factorial.

59
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,990
And then we have --
what's i to the fifth?

60
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:14,330
Plus i times x to the
fifth over 5 factorial.

61
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,270
It just keeps going.

62
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,740
We have something
interesting here.

63
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,000
Now, all of a sudden, we have
something extremely similar to

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,670
this except for only
one difference.

65
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,790
Compare that to e to the i x.

66
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:33,000
   

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,740
The dots on my i's
always get merged.

68
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,970
Compare these 2 things
that I'm circling.

69
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,710
What's the difference?

70
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,870
Let's see the 1, 1.

71
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,710
Well, here, I have an
x, I have an i x here.

72
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,410
Then minus x squared
over 2 fact -- so these

73
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,830
terms are the same.

74
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:53,330
Then on the x to the third, the
signs are right but have an i.

75
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,850
And then, x to the fourth over
4 factorial -- that's identical

76
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:59,850
-- but then on x to the
fifth, I have an i.

77
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,360
So the only difference between
this and this is on the terms

78
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,290
that involve sin of x, right?

79
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,030
So what are the terms
that involve sin of x?

80
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:15,690
This term corresponds
to that term, right?

81
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:20,140
This term corresponds
to that term.

82
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,430
These are the terms that
correspond to sin of x

83
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,720
in this representation.

84
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,070
That term corresponds
to that term.

85
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,750
And the only difference is --
so this has all of the terms

86
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,330
that the sin of x would have
but they all have an i in

87
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:33,880
front of them, right?

88
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,060
Even the sign is right.

89
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,150
This is negative,
that's negative.

90
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,600
But this just has an
i in front of it.

91
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,210
So it turns out, that you
could rewrite this, right?

92
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,080
You could rewrite
this representation.

93
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,160
Well, it doesn't turn out.

94
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,360
It's pretty obvious
you could rewrite it.

95
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:53,170
Let me clear this
just so we get a --

96
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,952
So we could actually
rewrite that e to the i x.

97
00:04:55,952 --> 00:05:01,280
   

98
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,600
And we could write it -- we
could separate out the

99
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,500
imaginary terms and we could
separate out the real terms.

100
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,240
What were the real terms?

101
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:19,020
Well, the real terms were 1
minus x squared over 2

102
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:27,390
factorial plus x to the fourth
over 4 factorial minus x to the

103
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,070
sixth over 6 factorial.

104
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,190
And it just kept going
to infinity, right?

105
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,210
Those were the real terms.

106
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,020
   

107
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,670
That's to infinity dot dot dot.

108
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,590
This pen tool looks
like minus signs.

109
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,280
I don't want to do that.

110
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,840
   

111
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,760
Oh, I can't undo it.

112
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,335
So this is just dot dot dot.

113
00:05:49,335 --> 00:05:52,320
   

114
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,030
So those are the real
terms, essentially.

115
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:01,310
And then, the imaginary terms
-- it was plus -- well, all of

116
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,810
these terms are going to
have i on them, right?

117
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,980
So let me just take the i out.

118
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:10,910
So, plus i times -- and we
figured out that those terms

119
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,535
were x minus -- well, I don't
want to give it away too fast

120
00:06:14,535 --> 00:06:18,740
-- x to the third
over 3 factorial.

121
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:25,070
Plus x to the fifth over 5
factorial minus x to the

122
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:29,170
seventh over 7 factorial and
it just kept going on, on,

123
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,600
and on to infinity, right?

124
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Well isn't this the Maclaurin
representation of cosine of x?

125
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,810
And similarly, isn't this the
Maclaurin representation

126
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,890
of sin of x?

127
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:43,610
Well yeah, sure.

128
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,640
And you probably realized it in
the previous screen where I

129
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,370
showed that all of the
imaginary terms corresponded

130
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,060
to the sin of x terms.

131
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,600
And all the real ones,
likewise, were the cosine of x

132
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,480
when we we compared it to sin
of x plus cosine of x.

133
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:02,895
So if you believe me, that the
Maclaurin representation of e

134
00:07:02,895 --> 00:07:06,160
to the x is equal to e to the x
and the Maclaurin

135
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,700
representation of cosine and
sin of x are equal to those

136
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:13,080
functions, then all of a
sudden, we come up with this

137
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:21,400
bizarre and amazing and
mystical idea that e to the i x

138
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:28,880
is equal to cosin of x plus i
times the sin of x.

139
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,160
And this is called
Euler's formula.

140
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,660
And actually e
stands for Euler.

141
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,890
That's where it comes from.

142
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,930
Euler starts with an E.

143
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,520
E U L E R.

144
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,480
But this is amazing.

145
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,640
Not only have we found a
relationship between this

146
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,980
bizarre, mystical, magical
number, e, and these

147
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,290
trigonometric functions that we
defined as a ratio of the sides

148
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:55,210
of right triangles, but now
we're involving this other

149
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:58,670
mystical, magical number that
we invented just so that all of

150
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:02,210
our polynomials would have some
root, whether or not

151
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,040
they're real or not.

152
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,240
We have this number, i, all
of a sudden showing up.

153
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,340
This by itself is amazing.

154
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,890
But now we can take it one
step further and this

155
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,540
should blow your mind.

156
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,850
If it doesn't, then
you have no emotion.

157
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,600
I will just judge you.

158
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,680
So if we take this and,
essentially, we're taking it

159
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,530
that when you take something to
the i power, that you can just

160
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,170
substitute it into this
Maclaurin repres -- but I

161
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,350
won't go into the details.

162
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,770
But I think you can say
that this is a pretty

163
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,980
reasonable proposition.

164
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:39,140
But what happens if we take
something to the pi power?

165
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,620
If e to the i pi power?

166
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,310
Before, we didn't have any
way of saying, "Well,

167
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:43,930
what does that mean?

168
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,910
Taking something to the i pi
power?" But now we do because

169
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,730
we're saying that these
2 sides of this are

170
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,490
equal to each other.

171
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,550
So what happens?

172
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,360
Let me do this in a bold color
because it deserves to be bold.

173
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:00,410
e to the i pi is equal to well,
where x is pi, is equal to

174
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:07,110
cosine of pi plus i sin of pi.

175
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,940
Well what's cosine of pi?

176
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,960
This is equal to negative 1.

177
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,090
And sin of pi, well
that's just equal to 0.

178
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:22,140
We get e to the i pi is
equal to negative 1.

179
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,690
This is amazing.

180
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:31,810
Or you could also write e to
the i pi plus 1 is equal to 0.

181
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,520
Once again, amazing.

182
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:38,100
Either of these should make you
question your take on reality

183
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,565
because we have the number pi,
which is a ratio of a

184
00:09:40,565 --> 00:09:42,260
circumference of a
circle to its diameter.

185
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:47,120
We have the number, e, that
comes from a continuous

186
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,030
compound interest.

187
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:51,750
And then we have the number, i,
which you can say the square

188
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,040
root of negative 1 or it
squared is negative 1.

189
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,530
And they all come together.

190
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:58,390
This formula right here
involves all the fundamental

191
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,370
numbers in mathematics but
they come from completely

192
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,640
different directions.

193
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,190
Completely different
directions.

194
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:07,190
And although we can prove this
and we can say this is true,

195
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,210
I'll tell you no one -- no one
-- probably in the history

196
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,210
of mankind, fully
understands why this is.

197
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,830
This is just a glimpse on some
type of order in the universe.

198
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:17,500
