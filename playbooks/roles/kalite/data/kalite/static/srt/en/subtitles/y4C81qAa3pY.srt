1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,350
We're asked to solve for x.

3
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,050
And we have this radical
equation.

4
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,800
1 is equal to the principal root
or the positive square

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,510
root of x divided
by 3 minus 2.

6
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,320
And the best way to solve these
is to just isolate the

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,129
radical and then square
both sides.

8
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,280
And then hopefully we'll
be able to solve for x.

9
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,420
This is a pretty straightforward
one.

10
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,650
But in general, once you solve
for your x, sometimes you get

11
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,060
more than one solution.

12
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,550
And then you always want to
substitute them back in to

13
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,070
make sure that they all work.

14
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,190
And in other videos, I've
actually explained why

15
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,110
sometimes you end up with a
solution that does not work.

16
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,940
But let's just do this.

17
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,640
It should be pretty
straightforward.

18
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,260
So the first thing to do if
we want to get rid of this

19
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:37,890
negative 2.

20
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,080
We could add 2 to both sides
of this equation.

21
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,380
Let's add 2 to both sides
of this equation.

22
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,900
The left-hand side becomes 1
plus 2 is 3 is equal to-- this

23
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,290
negative 2 and positive 2 cancel
out-- so we have the

24
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,800
square root of x over 3.

25
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,190
Then we could multiply both
sides of this equation by 3.

26
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,040
Let's multiply both
sides by 3.

27
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:09,890
And so we get 9 is equal to
the square root of x.

28
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:15,200
   

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,120
And then we can just square both
sides of this equation.

30
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:24,330
   

31
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,350
And if you square both sides of
this equation you get 81 is

32
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,350
equal to x.

33
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,770
Now, we only got one
solution here.

34
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,470
Let's just try it out.

35
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,530
Let's make sure that it works
for this equation.

36
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,380
So let's just evaluate the
right-hand side with x is

37
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,890
equal to 81 and make
sure it equals 1.

38
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:46,940
So if we take the square root of
81-- that's our x-- over 3.

39
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,730
This is our 81 right there.

40
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:49,470
Minus 2.

41
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,070
What is this?

42
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,340
Square root of 81.

43
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,440
We're taking the principal
root, the

44
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,680
positive square root.

45
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,455
So we're only going to think
about the positive square

46
00:01:55,455 --> 00:01:56,820
root, which is 9.

47
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,580
9 over 3 minus 2.

48
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,680
9 over 3 is clearly, 3.

49
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,900
3 minus 2 is indeed
equal to 1.

50
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:11,000
So x equals 81 is indeed
the solution for

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,250
this radical equation.

52
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,066
