1
00:00:06,501 --> 00:00:09,835
This is Steven Zucker and Beth Harris with Richard Bowen, art historian

2
00:00:09,835 --> 00:00:14,234
and or other historian in Rome at Santa Prassede

3
00:00:14,234 --> 00:00:17,190
So, we`re walking down the side street and what`s interesting is that

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,984
you have really no sense that you`re about to walk into a major church.

5
00:00:19,984 --> 00:00:26,091
We`ve come through a courtyard and we`ve come into a church and this is the thing that grabs our attention the most.

6
00:00:26,091 --> 00:00:30,122
It`s a beautiful 9th century mosaic which this church is rightly famous for.

7
00:00:30,122 --> 00:00:33,365
It`s completely laden with the decorative...

8
00:00:33,365 --> 00:00:37,383
The jewel-like colors in the apse are just stunning!

9
00:00:37,383 --> 00:00:42,551
And I think you`ll find that many medieval churches tend to have this way of trying to draw you to the high altar.

10
00:00:42,551 --> 00:00:45,815
Into the apse where you`d have a great theological moment happening.

11
00:00:45,815 --> 00:00:51,318
Saint Praxedes or Santa Prassede, she and her sister, Saint Pudentiana

12
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:56,765
were daughters of a gentleman here in Rome in the 1st century A.D. , Saint Pudens,

13
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:59,315
who is actually mentioned in the Bible.

14
00:00:59,315 --> 00:01:03,199
So they ascribed, if you like, to the earliest times of Christianity here in Rome.

15
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,943
According to tradition they are understood to be martyrs...

16
00:01:05,974 --> 00:01:09,333
Not only martyrs but also those that helped the Christian community here

17
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:11,815
from at least the second half of the 1st century A.D.

18
00:01:11,815 --> 00:01:13,895
I would imagine that the mosaics are actually quite old.

19
00:01:13,895 --> 00:01:17,789
Yes. Those are 9th century. So these are 9th century.

20
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:22,876
Maybe we ought to start with the apse mosaic. Shall we go closer to the mosaic so we don`t upset the...

21
00:01:22,876 --> 00:01:25,996
What we`ve got here in the apse is we`ve got a simple figure here of Jesus Christ

22
00:01:25,996 --> 00:01:31,266
and then we have the heavens at the top here with God`s hand coming down here with a crown

23
00:01:31,266 --> 00:01:33,178
...the hand of God...fabulous...

24
00:01:33,178 --> 00:01:36,363
then ve`ve got this river behind, which is the river Jordan,

25
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:37,966
in which Jesus Christ was baptized.

26
00:01:37,966 --> 00:01:41,129
And then here we`ve got some very interesting saints over here to our left.

27
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:44,952
We`ve got Saint Paul, who has his hand around Saint Praxedes, here,

28
00:01:44,952 --> 00:01:50,611
embracing her...and introducing her to Jesus..exactly, introducing her to Jesus.

29
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,465
And the bit that probably, the thing that is the crowning glory in many ways

30
00:01:53,465 --> 00:01:55,969
of this apse mosaic is we have Pascal I here.

31
00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:59,208
But is he representing the Church itself? He`s representing the Church himself but not only that.

32
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:05,392
He also, see, has a square halo. Yes. Now this is very very rare in Christian iconography

33
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:09,382
because what you see here is a saint still alive at the time of his depiction.

34
00:02:09,382 --> 00:02:12,897
Had he been canonized? He`s been canonized. It was one of the perks of the job.

35
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,948
Then we`ve got the palm here which can be a symbol of Paradise and also of martyrdom.

36
00:02:15,948 --> 00:02:20,428
Then we`ve got this little phoenix here which is obviously a symbol of the resurrection

37
00:02:20,428 --> 00:02:23,254
as well as also the peacock can be a symbol of resurrection as well.

38
00:02:23,254 --> 00:02:26,881
And resurrection is something that was in Christianity of the utmost importance. Absolutely.

39
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:29,652
Perhaps today, in the 21st century, we tend to forget the importance

40
00:02:29,652 --> 00:02:33,447
of the resurrection`s place, certainly within Christianity here, and if you think

41
00:02:33,447 --> 00:02:36,574
that probably people who came to this church in the ninth century A.D. may not

42
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:39,848
all live beyond the age of 40 or 45, then the idea of a better life

43
00:02:39,848 --> 00:02:45,548
afterwards is of the utmost importance. Death was a far more immediate experience.

44
00:02:45,548 --> 00:02:48,690
Exactly. And then this is marvelous row of lamb?

45
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,372
These are lambs here that are coming out to the two holy cities of Jerusalem and Bethlehem

46
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:56,846
and these are like a representative if you like of the...faithful?...all the apostles.

47
00:02:56,846 --> 00:02:59,722
And of course like Jesus, the lamb of God, if you like.

48
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:04,226
So we`ve got this symbolism here, Jesus not only being passed as the shepherd

49
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:05,889
but also the flock of the faithful, if you like.

50
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:09,971
And of course I noticed right above Pascal`s name. Yes, Pascal`s name there.

51
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:13,430
We have a lamb on an altar. That`s right. In a medallion above.

52
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,456
And the cross and almost like a chair waiting for the Second Coming.

53
00:03:17,456 --> 00:03:19,556
And then of course obviously you`ve got these angels here

54
00:03:19,556 --> 00:03:22,358
and then you`ve got the candles, the seven candles...

55
00:03:22,358 --> 00:03:24,834
And I see the Evangelists, in the corner as well...

56
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:26,218
The Evangelists, the symbols of the Evangelists..

57
00:03:26,218 --> 00:03:29,736
and then the Elders of the Apocalypse, here. This is the Byzantine style of art.

58
00:03:29,736 --> 00:03:33,256
In some ways, it`s quite flat, in some of the mosaics so we can see...

59
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:35,872
Oh, it`s incredibly flat!...Which I quite like to be honest with you.

60
00:03:35,872 --> 00:03:40,501
And the references for instance to the folds of the cloths are...lines...

61
00:03:40,501 --> 00:03:45,001
are really just lines. But my favorite part is always when I look at

62
00:03:45,001 --> 00:03:49,920
Byzantine mosaics like this or that are those feet that seem to sort of dangle down

63
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,328
and don`t really seem to have contact with the earth.

64
00:03:52,328 --> 00:03:56,467
These are kind of floating, ethereal figures. And that`s the critical issue.

65
00:03:56,467 --> 00:04:02,069
Here`s a really, a kind of, really direct rejection of so much of...

66
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:05,734
What`s around us...that`s right...of the classical...that`s right, of the pre-Christian..

67
00:04:05,734 --> 00:04:08,935
And to see it in this context really makes sense,

68
00:04:08,935 --> 00:04:12,889
the kind of reinvention and a kind of abstraction of the physical. Right.

69
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:16,945
The artificial lights went off just a moment ago and the ambient light

70
00:04:16,945 --> 00:04:18,900
from the sky coming in from the windows from the nave

71
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,645
were illuminating glass tiles beautifully and the gold was incredibly reflective

72
00:04:23,645 --> 00:04:27,034
and the spirituality is so powerful!
