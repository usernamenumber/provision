1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,750
   

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,270
Let's say we have the
indefinite integral of the

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,890
square root of 6x minus
x squared minus 5.

4
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,290
And obviously this is not
some simple integral.

5
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,350
I don't have just, you know,
this expression and its

6
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,540
derivative lying around, so
u-substitution won't work.

7
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,410
And so you can guess from just
the title of this video that

8
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,060
we're going to have to
do something fancier.

9
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,950
And we'll probably have to do
some type of trig substitution.

10
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,360
But this immediately doesn't
look kind of amenable

11
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,250
to trig substitution.

12
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,190
I like to do trig substitution
when I see kind of a 1 minus x

13
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,280
squared under a radical sign,
or maybe an x squared minus

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,590
1 under a radical sign, or
maybe a x squared plus 1.

15
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,030
These are the type of things
that get my brain thinking in

16
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,340
terms of trig substitution.

17
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,650
but that doesn't quite
look like that just yet.

18
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,600
I have a radical sign.

19
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,455
I have some x squared, but it
doesn't look like this form.

20
00:00:47,455 --> 00:00:50,810
So let's if we can get
it to be in this form.

21
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:55,000
Let me delete these guys
right there real fast.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,280
So let's see if we can maybe
complete the square down here.

23
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:00,920
So let's see.

24
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,029
If this is equal to,
let me rewrite this.

25
00:01:04,029 --> 00:01:06,110
And if this completing the
square doesn't look familiar

26
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,610
to you, I have a whole
bunch of videos on that.

27
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:15,740
Let me rewrite this as equal to
minus 5 minus-- I need more

28
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,530
space up here-- minus
5 minus x squared.

29
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,520
Now there's a plus 6x, but
I have a minus out here.

30
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,070
So minus 6 x, right?

31
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,730
A minus and a minus
will becomes plus 6x.

32
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:30,090
And then, I want to make
this into a perfect square.

33
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,430
So what number when I add it
to itself will be minus 6?

34
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,550
Well, it's minus 3
and minus 3 squared.

35
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,290
So you take half of this
number, you get minus

36
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,760
3, and you square it.

37
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,200
Then you put a 9 there.

38
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,220
Now, I can't just
arbitrarily add nines.

39
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,610
Or actually, I didn't
add a 9 here.

40
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:46,050
What did I do?

41
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,080
I subtracted a 9.

42
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,050
Because I threw a 9 there, but
it's really a minus 9, because

43
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,060
of this minus sign out there.

44
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,030
So in order to make this
neutral to my 9 that I

45
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,180
just threw in there,
this is a minus 9.

46
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,210
I have to add a 9.

47
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,240
So let me add a 9.

48
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,280
So plus 9, right there.

49
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,920
If this doesn't make complete
sense, what I just did, and

50
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,350
obviously you have the dx right
there, multiply this out.

51
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:11,560
You get minus x squared plus
6x, which are these two terms

52
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,155
right there, minus 9, and then
you'll have this plus 9, and

53
00:02:14,155 --> 00:02:16,790
these two will cancel out, and
you'll just get exactly back

54
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:17,750
to what we had before.

55
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,110
Because I want you to realize,
I didn't change the equation.

56
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,000
This is a minus 9
because of this.

57
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,570
So I added a 9, so I
really added 0 to it.

58
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,750
But what this does, it gets
it into a form that I like.

59
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,020
Obviously this, right here,
just becomes a 4, and then this

60
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,110
term right here becomes, what?

61
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,290
That is x minus 3 squared.

62
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,680
x minus 3 squared.

63
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,880
So my indefinite integral now
becomes the integral, I'm just

64
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,290
doing a little bit of algebra,
the integral of the square root

65
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:57,990
of 4 minus x minus
3 squared dx.

66
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,160
Now this is starting to look
like a form that I like, but

67
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,510
I like to have a 1 here.

68
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,220
So let's factor a 4 out.

69
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,410
So this is equal to, I'll
switch colors, that's equal to

70
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,720
the integral of the radical,
and we'll have the 4, times 1

71
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,520
minus x minus 3 squared over 4.

72
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,100
I just took a 4 out of
both of these terms.

73
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,270
If I multiply this out, I'll
just get back to that,

74
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,030
right there, dx.

75
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,790
And now this is starting to
look like a form that I like.

76
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,150
Let me simplify it even more.

77
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,630
So this is equal to the
integral, if I take the 4 out,

78
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:39,790
it becomes 2 times the square
root of 1 minus, and I can

79
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:45,800
rewrite this as x minus 3,
let me write this way.

80
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:51,310
1 minus x minus 3
over 2 squared dx.

81
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,680
And where did I
get that 2 from?

82
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,010
Well, if I just square both
of these, I get x minus 3

83
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,330
squared over 2 squared.

84
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,740
Which is x minus 3 over 4.

85
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,630
So I have done no
calculus so far.

86
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,370
I just algebraically rewrote
this indefinite integral as

87
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,420
this indefinite integral.

88
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,690
They are equivalent.

89
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,070
But this, all of a sudden,
looks like a form

90
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,290
that I recognize.

91
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,580
I showed you in the last video
that cosine squared of theta

92
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,290
is just equal to 1 minus
sine squared of theta.

93
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,490
You could actually do
it the other way.

94
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,260
You could do sine squared
is equal to 1 minus

95
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:20,890
cosine squared.

96
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,970
No difference.

97
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,360
But they both will work out.

98
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,120
But this looks an
awful lot like this.

99
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,200
In fact, it would look exactly
like this if I say that that is

100
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,670
equal to sine squared of theta.

101
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,170
So let me make that
substitution.

102
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:46,180
Let me write that x minus
3 over 2 squared is equal

103
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:51,620
to sine squared of theta.

104
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,840
Now, if we take the square root
of both sides of that equation,

105
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:01,230
I get x minus 3 over 2 is
equal to sine of theta.

106
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,410
Now we're eventually, you know
where this is going to go.

107
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:07,130
We're eventually going to have
to substitute back for theta.

108
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,050
So let's solve for
theta in terms of x.

109
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,980
So theta in terms of x, we
could just say, just take the

110
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,530
arc sine of both sides of this.

111
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,900
You get theta is equal to,
right, the arc sine of

112
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,030
the sine is just theta.

113
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:28,380
Theta is equal to the arc
sine of x minus 3 over 2.

114
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,340
Fair enough.

115
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,910
Now, to actually do the
substitution, though, we're

116
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,960
going to have figure out what
dx is, we're going to have to

117
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,290
solve for x in terms of theta.

118
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,360
So let me do that.

119
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,160
So we get, if we multiply both
sides of the equation by 2, we

120
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,340
get x minus 3 is equal to 2
times the sine of theta,

121
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:51,195
or that x is equal to 2
sine of theta plus 3.

122
00:05:51,195 --> 00:05:54,010
Now, if we take the derivative
of both sides with respect to

123
00:05:54,010 --> 00:06:00,030
theta, we get dx d theta, is
equal to 2 cosine of theta,

124
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,790
derivative of this is just 0.

125
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,460
Or we can multiply both sides
by d theta, and we get dx is

126
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,530
equal to 2 cosine
of theta d theta.

127
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,060
And we're ready to substitute
back into our original

128
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,950
indefinite integral.

129
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:19,050
So this thing will now be
rewritten as the integral of 2

130
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:25,680
times the radical, if I can get
some space, of 1 minus,

131
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,050
I'm replacing this with
sine squared of theta.

132
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,660
   

133
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,930
And all that times dx.

134
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,360
Well, I just said that dx is
equal to this, right here.

135
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:43,020
So dx is equal to 2
cosine of theta d theta.

136
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,460
What does this simplify to?

137
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:50,730
This action right here, this is
just cosine squared of theta.

138
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,880
And we're going to take
the square root of

139
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,390
cosine squared of theta.

140
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:56,950
So this, the square root of
cosine squared of data, this

141
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,960
whole term right here, right?

142
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,010
That becomes the square root of
cosine squared of theta, which

143
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,780
is just the same thing
as cosine of theta.

144
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:12,900
So our integral becomes, so our
integral is equal to, 2 times

145
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,120
the square root of cosine
squared of theta, so that's

146
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:22,720
just 2 times cosine of theta,
times 2 times cosine of theta.

147
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,490
That's that one, right there.

148
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:30,180
This is this, and all of
this radical sine, that's

149
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,040
this, right there.

150
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,370
1 minus sine squared was cosine
squared, take the radical,

151
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,800
you get cosine squared.

152
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,060
And then everything
times d theta.

153
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:46,390
Now this is obviously equal
to 4 times cosine squared

154
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,890
of theta d theta.

155
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:52,310
Which, by itself, is still not
an easy integral to solve.

156
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,160
I don't know, you know, I
can't do U-substitution or

157
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,240
anything like that, there.

158
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,480
So what do we do?

159
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:02,700
Well, we resort to our
good old trig identities.

160
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,110
Now, I don't know if you have
this one memorized, although it

161
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,140
tends to be in the inside cover
of most calculus books,

162
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,840
or inside cover of
most trig books.

163
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:19,040
But cosine squared of theta
can be rewritten as 1/2 times

164
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,330
1 plus cosine of 2 theta.

165
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,390
And I've proven this
in multiple videos.

166
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,330
So let's just make
this substitution.

167
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,890
Let me just replace this
thing with that thing.

168
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:35,010
So this integral becomes,
it equals, 4 times cosine

169
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,920
squared of theta, but cosine
squared of theta is this.

170
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:44,725
4 times 1/2 times 1 plus
cosine of 2 theta d theta.

171
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:48,520
   

172
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,910
Now, this looks
easier to deal with.

173
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,350
So what is it?

174
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,810
4 times 1/2, that's 2.

175
00:08:53,810 --> 00:09:00,250
So my integral becomes the
integral of 2 times 1, so it's

176
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:09,200
2, plus 2 times 2 cosine of 2
theta, all of that d theta.

177
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,030
Now, this antiderivative is
pretty straightforward.

178
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,240
What is this, right here?

179
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:20,150
This is the derivative
with respect of theta of

180
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:23,580
sine of 2 theta, right?

181
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,250
This whole thing.

182
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,340
What's the derivative
sine of 2 theta?

183
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,900
Take the derivative of the
inside, that's 2, times the

184
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,900
derivative of the outside,
cosine of 2 theta.

185
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,110
And this, of course, is the
derivative of 2 theta.

186
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,650
So this is equal to, the
antiderivative of 2 with

187
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:41,420
respect to theta, is just 2
theta, plus the antiderivative

188
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:51,740
of this, which is just sine of
2 theta, and then

189
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,080
we have a plus c.

190
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,330
And of course, we can't forget
that we defined theta, our

191
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,830
original antiderivative
was in terms of x.

192
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,230
So we can't just leave
it in terms of theta.

193
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,840
We're going to have to
do a back substitution.

194
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,020
So let's just remember,
theta was equal to arc

195
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,080
sine of x minus 3 over 2.

196
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,620
Let me write that
on the side here.

197
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:17,750
   

198
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,230
Now, if I immediately
substitute this theta straight

199
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,430
into this, I'm going to get a
sine of 2 times arc sine of x

200
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,710
minus 3 over 2, which
would be correct.

201
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,990
And I would have a 2 times arc
sine of x minus 3 over 2.

202
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,880
That would all be fine,
and we would be done.

203
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,060
But that's not satisfying.

204
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,480
It's not a nice clean answer.

205
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,090
So let's see if we can simplify
this, so it's only in

206
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,100
terms of sine of theta.

207
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,240
So when you take the sine of
the arc sine, then it just

208
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,150
simplifies to x minus 3 over 2.

209
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:49,210
Let me make that clear.

210
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,730
So if I can write all of this
in terms of sines of theta,

211
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:57,990
because the sine of theta is
equal to the sine of the arc

212
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:06,230
sine of x minus 3 over 2.

213
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,180
Which is just equal
to x minus 3 over 2.

214
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,250
So if I can write this in terms
of sines of theta, then I can

215
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,390
just make this substitution.

216
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,520
Sine of theta equals
that, and everything

217
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,700
simplifies a good bit.

218
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,610
So let's see if we can do that.

219
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:25,140
Well, you may or may not know
the other identity, and I've

220
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:30,200
proven this as well, that sine
of 2 theta, that's the same

221
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:42,485
thing as sine of theta plus
theta, which is equal to sine

222
00:11:42,485 --> 00:11:48,940
of theta cosine of theta plus,
the thetas get swapped around,

223
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:53,320
sine of theta plus cosine of
theta, which is equal to, this

224
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,740
is just the same thing written
twice, 2 sine of theta

225
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,760
cosine of theta.

226
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,540
Some people have this memorized
ahead of time, and if you have

227
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,600
to take an exam on trig
substitution, it doesn't hurt

228
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,310
to have this memorized
ahead of time.

229
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,180
But let's rewrite
this like this.

230
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,320
So our indefinite integral
in terms of theta, or our

231
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,870
antiderivative, became 2 theta,
plus, instead of sine of 2

232
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:18,490
theta, we could write, 2 sine
of theta cosine of theta, and

233
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,500
of course we have a plus c.

234
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,380
Now, I want to write everything
in terms of sines of theta, but

235
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,960
I have a cosine if theta there.

236
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,370
So what can we do?

237
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:30,440
Well, we know we know that
cosine squared of theta is

238
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:35,410
equal to 1 minus sine squared
of theta, or that cosine of

239
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:39,530
theta is equal to the square
root of 1 minus sine

240
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:40,990
squared of theta.

241
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,800
Which seems like we're adding
complexity to it, but the neat

242
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,800
thing is, it's in terms
of sine of theta.

243
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,480
So let's do that.

244
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,160
Let's make the substitution.

245
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,150
So our antiderivative, this is
the same thing as 2 data plus 2

246
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:57,920
sine of theta times cosine of
theta, which is equal to this,

247
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,400
times the square root of 1
minus sine squared of theta,

248
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,510
and all of that plus c.

249
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:08,030
Now we're in the home stretch.

250
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,930
This problem was probably
harder than you thought

251
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:10,980
it was going to be.

252
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,430
We know that sine theta is
equal to x minus 3 over 2.

253
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:18,190
So let's make that
reverse substitution.

254
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,690
So we have 2 times theta.

255
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:24,290
This first term is just 2
times theta, right there.

256
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:28,400
So that's 2 times, we can't
escape the arc sine.

257
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,170
If we just have a theta, we
have to say that theta is

258
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:37,270
equal to arc sine of
x minus 3 over 2.

259
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,280
And then we have plus,
let me switch colors,

260
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,500
plus 2 sine of theta.

261
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,710
Well, that's plus 2 times sine
of theta is x minus 3 over 2.

262
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:51,970
So 2 times x minus 3 over 2,
and then all of that times

263
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:59,460
the square root of 1 minus
sine of theta squared.

264
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,630
What's sine of theta?

265
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:05,706
It's x minus 3 over 2 squared.

266
00:14:05,706 --> 00:14:07,510
And of course we have a plus c.

267
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:10,040
Let's see if we can simplify
this even more, now that

268
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,350
we're at the home stretch.

269
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:19,410
So this is equal to 2 arc sine
of x minus 3 over 2, plus these

270
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:24,170
two terms, this 2 and this 2
cancel out, plus x minus 3,

271
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:29,280
times the square root of, what
happens if we multiply

272
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:35,090
everything here by, let's see,
if we take a, so this is equal

273
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:45,180
to 1 minus x minus 3 over 4. x
minus 3 squared over 4.

274
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,780
This simplification, I should
write that in quotes, is taking

275
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,280
me longer than I thought.

276
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,850
But let's see if we can
simplify this even more.

277
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,760
If we multiply, let me just
focus on this term right here,

278
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,180
if we multiply the outside,
or say, let's multiply

279
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,920
and divide this by 2.

280
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,460
So I'll write this as--
so let's just multiply

281
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:08,490
this times 2 over 2.

282
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,910
You might say, Sal, why
are you doing that?

283
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,940
Because I can rewrite this, let
me write my whole thing here.

284
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:21,000
So I have 2 arc sine of x
minus 3 over 2, and then

285
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,530
I have, I could take this
denominator 2 right here.

286
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:26,830
So I say, plus x
minus 3 over 2.

287
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,130
That 2 is that 2 right there.

288
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:32,010
And then I could write
this 2 right here as

289
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,470
a square root of 4.

290
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,330
Times the square root
of 4, times the square

291
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,100
root of all of this.

292
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:44,300
1 minus x minus 3
squared over 4.

293
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,350
I think you see
where I'm going.

294
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,090
I'm kind of reversing
everything that I did at the

295
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,260
beginning of this problem.

296
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,210
And maybe I'm getting a little
fixated on making this as

297
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,820
simple as possible, but I'm
so close, so let me finish.

298
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:59,390
So I get 2 times the arc sine
of x minus 3 over 2, which I'm

299
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:04,410
tired of writing, plus x minus
3 over 2, and if we bring this

300
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,780
4 in, right, the square root of
4 times the square root of that

301
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:11,380
is equal to the square root
of 4 times these things.

302
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:16,700
So it's 4 minus x minus
3 squared, all of

303
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,280
that that plus c.

304
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,790
And we're at the home stretch.

305
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:27,740
This is equal to 2 times the
arc sine of x minus 3 over 2

306
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:34,650
plus x minus 3 over 2 times the
radical of 4 minus, let's

307
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:41,260
expand this, x squared
minus 6x plus 9.

308
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:47,960
And then this expression right
here simplifies to minus minus,

309
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:53,270
it's 6x minus x squared, and
then you have a 4

310
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,050
minus 9 minus 5.

311
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,180
Which is our original
antiderivative.

312
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,940
   

313
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,000
So finally, we're
at the very end.

314
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:08,020
We get the antiderivative is 2
arc sine of x minus 3 over 2

315
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:16,430
plus x minus 3 over 2 times,
time the radical of 6x

316
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:19,340
minus x squared minus 5.

317
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:24,840
That right there is the
antiderivative of what this

318
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,170
thing that we had at the very
top of my little chalkboard,

319
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,820
which is right there.

320
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,620
So that is equal to the
antiderivative of the

321
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:39,050
square root of 6x minus
x squared minus 5 dx.

322
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:42,120
And I can imagine that you're
probably as tired as I am.

323
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,550
My hand actually hurts.

324
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,880
But hopefully you find that
to be vaguely satisfying.

325
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,960
Sometimes I get complaints
that I only do easy problems.

326
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,630
Well, this was quite a hairy
and not-so-easy problem.
