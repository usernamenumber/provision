1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,795
In the last video we talked a
little bit about, at least potentially, starting
a cupcake factory.

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,800
But this is a major investment
that I'm thinking about making,

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,950
so at minimum, I made
a spreadsheet here in Excel

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:21,163
and it's available at
khanacademy.org/downloads/cupcakes.xls.

5
00:00:21,163 --> 00:00:23,710
If you just click slash here,
you'll see everything in the download directory,

6
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,365
but I'm
going to start putting more stuff there.

7
00:00:26,365 --> 00:00:27,860
So I encourage you
to play with it.

8
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,760
But this is essentially-- it'll
do all the math for us

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,225
that we did in the
last video, --the investment in the factory.

10
00:00:35,225 --> 00:00:39,128
Let's say in the real world,
once I actually got bids from contractors and things
like that,

11
00:00:39,128 --> 00:00:41,459
it ends up costing $1.1 million.

12
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,450
The annual capacity is a million
cupcakes per year.

13
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:48,075
The cost per cupcake is-- let's
say, I don't know, input costs went up for
whatever reason.

14
00:00:48,075 --> 00:00:52,466
Now that I have a computer doing
the math for me, I can deal with a little bit
funnier numbers.

15
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:54,680
So let's say it's $1.05.

16
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,740
The price charged per
cupcake is $2.

17
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,820
Well, actually, it can
be anything, right?

18
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,762
And so this is going to
be an input field and right now it says $2.

19
00:01:04,762 --> 00:01:08,915
Let's say this is what
we assume is how many cupcakes we sell. In this scenario,

20
00:01:08,915 --> 00:01:13,649
this is the
income statement, at least as far as we get to the operating
income line.

21
00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:18,090
And so it calculates that you
have $2 million of revenue.

22
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,570
Notice what happens
when I change it.

23
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:26,052
If I sell my cupcakes for a
$1.50 per cupcake, then I only have $1.5 million.

24
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:28,760
So it actually computes what
we need it to compute.

25
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,340
It computes the cost
of goods sold.

26
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,040
If I change the number of
cupcakes, let's see,

27
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:40,150
if instead of a million, I sell 500,000, it calculates everything accordingly.

28
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,040
And in all these scenarios it
tells me my operating income.

29
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,857
And if you go a little bit
lower, it tells me capacity utilization.

30
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,725
That's just how many cupcakes I
sold, divided by how many I could make.

31
00:01:50,725 --> 00:01:53,914
So it's 50% utilization and
then,

32
00:01:53,914 --> 00:02:01,267
my return on asset is my operating income divided by my
initial investment, right?

33
00:02:01,267 --> 00:02:05,300
So this is 275,000 divided by
1.1, it was a minus 25.

34
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,610
So this is actually
a bad outcome.

35
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,919
So in the last one, I touched on
a little bit that

36
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:17,234
the real lever that I, as the owner
of my cupcake factory, can change is price.

37
00:02:17,234 --> 00:02:21,245
And then, obviously, if I charge
a lower price more people are going to want to
buy my cupcakes

38
00:02:21,245 --> 00:02:23,453
and if I charge a higher price,
fewer people.

39
00:02:23,453 --> 00:02:27,522
Although, there are some things
that when you charge a higher price people think it
must be better

40
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:31,230
so maybe they want it, or they want to show
off to their friends,

41
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,410
and look at this expensive cupcake that
I eat, and it's kind of a status symbol.

42
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:38,383
But for the most part
the lower the price, the more you sell.

43
00:02:38,383 --> 00:02:42,724
And now we can actually figure
out under what combinations am I going to make certain
amounts of money.

44
00:02:42,724 --> 00:02:47,493
So if I charge $1.50 per cupcake
and I'm only able to sell 500,000 cupcakes,

45
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:51,234
I'm going
to take a loss per year of $275,000.

46
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:57,100
If I sell them for $1.75 and
if I sell, I don't know, 700,000 cupcakes,

47
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,570
I'm almost
at break-even.

48
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,850
So, let's see, you
have to do $1.85.

49
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,790
Here in this situation,
I actually make money.

50
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,410
I have a 5% return on asset.

51
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:11,668
And, just so you know, this is
a major investment that I'm making, $1.1 million.

52
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,308
I actually want to make sure
I understand all of the scenarios of price and sales.

53
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:19,224
So what I did is actually
used Excel to do a sensitivity study.

54
00:03:19,224 --> 00:03:26,683
So what I did here is I put all
of the-- let me just go to that part of the spreadsheet.

55
00:03:26,683 --> 00:03:29,751
And I encourage you to play
with this, because it's interesting.

56
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:33,798
It shows you that even in a
fairly simple business, you can do a lot of analysis.

57
00:03:33,798 --> 00:03:37,000
And, if you're in high school
or in middle school, this could actually be a fun--

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,137
I don't know if they allow this type of thing for science
projects.

59
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,145
But go to a local business and
kind of analyze the business in a hundred different ways.

60
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,270
And actually, if you watch the
probability videos,

61
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,399
I do all those things on Poisson processes and things
like that.

62
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,720
You can analyze the business and
do Excel spreadsheets and

63
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,520
you'll probably end up winning
soon the state science fair.

64
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,740
Call it a math project or
engineering project.

65
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,561
But anyway, here I want
to figure out what is my return on asset?

66
00:04:00,561 --> 00:04:06,172
So essentially my operating
profit divided by my initial investment,

67
00:04:06,172 --> 00:04:10,013
depending on the
different prices I might charge and the different
quantities.

68
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:19,532
And here it's kind of hard to
visualize, so I graphed it as a three dimensional surface. 3D.

69
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:28,931
So as you see here, if I charge
$2.80 and I only sell 300,000, then this is my return
on asset right here.

70
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:32,070
This curve is actually the
zero curve, right?

71
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,900
So this is actually my
break-even right here.

72
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,360
So any point along this curve
right here I'm at break-even.

73
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:45,542
So if I'm at $2.80 per cupcake
and I only sell 300,000, I'm at break-even.

74
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,240
Let's see, what is
this right here?

75
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:55,855
If I sell $1.60 per cupcake and
if I sell 900,000, then I'm also at break-even.

76
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,487
So this is my break-even
curve. This is what I want to avoid.

77
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:05,850
Everything here is in the
negative, right, according to the legend, minus 50% to
zero percent return.

78
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:10,697
So here I'm losing money and I
would color it in if I wasn't in Excel mode.

79
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:15,505
If I charge $1.60 per cupcake
and I only sell 400,000 cupcakes,

80
00:05:15,505 --> 00:05:17,038
I'm going to have
a negative return.

81
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:19,692
And we can figure it
out in that little worksheet I just did.

82
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:24,026
But anyway this is fun to look
at and I encourage you to play with it.

83
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,264
And it actually shows you that
it's a fairly interesting and sophisticated thing,

84
00:05:27,264 --> 00:05:29,248
that
you have these two variables that change.

85
00:05:29,248 --> 00:05:32,430
And this is about as simple
as a business can get.

86
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,420
You can only imagine what
happens when you start varying the other parameters,

87
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,500
but these
are the two big ones.

88
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:43,362
So let's say, when I come out
the gate, I want everyone in town to taste my cupcakes.

89
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:48,842
Because I think, once they taste
it, they'll realize that they're delicious.

90
00:05:48,842 --> 00:05:51,800
And by the way, I've also
learned from the cigarette companies

91
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,574
and I put nicotine
in my cupcake, so I think people will become
addicted to it.

92
00:05:56,574 --> 00:05:59,258
So what I do is, I want
to charge a relatively low price for it.

93
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:04,130
Let's say I do come out the gate
at, I don't know, $1.75.

94
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,470
And that's a very cheap
price for cupcakes.

95
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,586
There's actually no cupcake
producers in this town right now.

96
00:06:09,586 --> 00:06:14,974
So I just sell out. I just sell out of cupcakes.

97
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:19,196
And so I'm making $200,000
per year, that's an 18% return on asset.

98
00:06:19,196 --> 00:06:21,800
And a lot of people would be
happy with that.

99
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,418
but I'm like, hey, I'm leaving money on the
table because I'm selling out of my cupcakes.

100
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,280
So what happens if I raise
my price a little bit?

101
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,412
I'm fully utilized, right? I have 100% utilization.

102
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:37,650
So it makes sense for me to
see if there's any-- maybe

103
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:41,608
there's some people who want
cupcakes, who can't get them because I can't produce
that many.

104
00:06:41,608 --> 00:06:43,520
So let me raise my price
a little bit.

105
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,580
Let me say I raise
it to $1.85.

106
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,838
At $1.85 it still turns out
that I'm selling a million cupcakes in a year.

107
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,502
Now, I was right. I was leaving money
on the table.

108
00:06:54,502 --> 00:06:58,395
Now I'm making $300,000
a year. This seems like a good idea.

109
00:06:58,395 --> 00:07:00,730
I want to see how much people
are willing to pay.

110
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,750
So, let's say, I raise
the price to $2.

111
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,119
But, in that scenario, $2, it
starts to get a little pricey for people.

112
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:10,250
It's just kind of a little
sticker shock. Maybe I should have
done $1.99.

113
00:07:10,255 --> 00:07:15,907
And so I don't sell a million. I sell 950,000.

114
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,580
There's maybe 50,000
people in the margin who said,

115
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:23,662
hey, you know, I'd buy it at
$1.85 but I'm not willing to buy it at $2.

116
00:07:23,662 --> 00:07:26,012
But this still works
out, right? I'm still making more money.

117
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,550
Even though I'm selling fewer
cupcakes,

118
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:33,700
because I'm charging so much more per cupcake, and
I'm making a 37% return.

119
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,360
Let's say I keep figuring
this out.

120
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,941
And let's say I figured out
the optimal point is me charging $3 per cupcake.

121
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:47,091
And at $3 per cupcake,
I'm able to sell you 750,000 cupcakes.

122
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:52,185
And I make $962,000 a year
and I have a huge return on asset, 88%.

123
00:07:52,185 --> 00:07:56,984
Imagine a business or some
investment where you get 88% of your money every year.

124
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:05,562
So that's all good and I'm
driving a Bentley and I have the biggest house on a hill
in town and all of that.

125
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,907
But other people say,
hey, all Sal's doing is making cupcakes.

126
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:13,271
I can make cupcakes too
and I have some money to build a factory.

127
00:08:13,271 --> 00:08:17,335
This is a better return on
investment than the stock market or anything else
that I know of.

128
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:24,950
So I'm also going to get into
the cupcake factory business.

129
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:32,062
And so, here, this is the
second worksheet in this spreadsheet.

130
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:38,804
So let's say, I was
at $1.1 million. I don't know if you
can see this.

131
00:08:38,804 --> 00:08:45,136
Maybe I should zoom
in a little bit. There you go.

132
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:50,602
So this is the same thing. So I said $3 and, 750,000
cupcakes and

133
00:08:50,602 --> 00:08:53,350
my cost was a $1.05.

134
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,370
So I was making $962,000.

135
00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:00,697
But then Imran-- and just if
you're curious why I wasn't recording videos for the last
two weeks,

136
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,350
actually Imran is the name of my son and he came
into the world two weeks ago,

137
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,824
and so, I think it makes
sense to name a cupcake store after him.

138
00:09:08,824 --> 00:09:13,441
But let's say he comes in, and
he's like, I'm tired of getting an allowance
from dad;

139
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,080
I also want to produce cupcakes.

140
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,800
And he actually has more money
because his grandma gave him more money

141
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,550
because she likes
him more than her son.

142
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,560
And so he has $1.5 million to
invest because he's like, wow,

143
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,555
this is such a good investment,
let me put more money into it. $1.5 million.

144
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:36,182
He builds a factory that
can produce two million cupcakes a year.

145
00:09:36,182 --> 00:09:41,604
And also, it's a more efficient
factory, so it actually uses a little less
electricity,

146
00:09:41,604 --> 00:09:47,422
and wastes less cream and frosting, and, I
guess, nicotine as well.

147
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:51,660
So the cost per cupcake
is less.

148
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:59,398
And he decides to undercut his
father, so he charges $2.90 per cupcake.

149
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:03,210
And when he charges $2.90 per--
everyone just kind of runs to him,

150
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,550
because his
cupcakes are just as good.

151
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,890
There really wasn't
much of a barrier.

152
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:13,250
So, let's say, he sells
500,000 cupcakes.

153
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:19,190
Then I'm only selling
250,000 at $3.

154
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,510
There's just some people
who like my cupcakes.

155
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:27,049
So I'm pretty much almost
break-even and I say, well, these are my die-hard fans.

156
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,300
And so, to benefit them-- these
guys aren't going to go anywhere else.

157
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,150
I'm going to
raise my prices a little bit.

158
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:34,180
Just because I know that
these guys like me.

159
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,560
At least in that situation,
I'm cutting a profit.

160
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,494
But then I say, well, you know,
this isn't a good state of affairs.

161
00:10:39,494 --> 00:10:40,800
He took all my business.

162
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,221
I actually want you to notice
something right here, what happened immediately.

163
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,620
I was making an 88% percent
return on my money, right?

164
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:56,335
And just when this Imran comes
in, and he enters into the space, all of a sudden,
what is the return?

165
00:10:56,335 --> 00:10:58,732
He's only running at
25% utilization.

166
00:10:58,732 --> 00:11:02,530
But his return on asset has gone
down to 20.

167
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:06,481
and, because he's at that utilization,
his return on asset has gone down to 20%.

168
00:11:06,481 --> 00:11:09,400
And then my return on asset
has gone down to 1%.

169
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,890
So there's a general
theme here.

170
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:16,502
When someone is doing really
well and getting a really great return, it attracts
competition.

171
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,250
It attracts capacity, right?

172
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:25,332
And if there's enough demand to
satiate that new capacity, maybe they will get
a better return.

173
00:11:25,332 --> 00:11:30,818
But in general, over time, if
there's a very favorable return, more and more will enter the market.

174
00:11:30,818 --> 00:11:32,370
Actually I've run out of
time in the studio.

175
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,451
In the next video, I'll talk
about more scenarios with competition.

176
00:11:35,451 --> 00:11:36,700
See you soon
