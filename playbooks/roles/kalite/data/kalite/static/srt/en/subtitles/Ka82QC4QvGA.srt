1
00:00:00,554 --> 00:00:05,404
What I wanna do in this video is give an overview of quadrilaterals.

2
00:00:05,404 --> 00:00:10,518
And you can imagine from this prefix, or I guess you could say from the beginning of this word - quad

3
00:00:10,518 --> 00:00:12,601
This involves four of something.

4
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:15,749
And quadrilaterals, as you can imagine, are, are shapes.

5
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:21,268
And we're gonna be talking about two-dimensional shapes that have four sides, and four vertices, and four angles.

6
00:00:21,268 --> 00:00:25,912
So, for example, one, two, three, four.

7
00:00:25,912 --> 00:00:26,996
That is a quadrilateral.

8
00:00:26,996 --> 00:00:29,109
Although that last side didn't look too straight.

9
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:33,829
One, two, three, four. That is a quadrilateral.

10
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:36,783
One, two, three, four. These are all quadrilaterals.

11
00:00:36,783 --> 00:00:40,976
They all have four sides, four vertices, and clearly four angles.

12
00:00:40,976 --> 00:00:45,178
One angle, two angles, three angles, and four angles.

13
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:49,116
Here you can measure. Here actually let me draw this one a little bit bigger 'cause it's interesting.

14
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:53,886
So in this one right over here you have one angle, two angles, three angles

15
00:00:53,886 --> 00:00:56,600
and then you have this really big angle right over there.

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,736
If you look at the, if you look at the interior angles of this quadrilateral.

17
00:00:59,736 --> 00:01:05,418
Now quadrilaterals, as you can imagine, can be subdivided into other groups

18
00:01:05,418 --> 00:01:07,773
based on the properties of the quadrilaterals.

19
00:01:07,773 --> 00:01:14,309
And the main subdivision of quadrilaterals is between concave and convex quadrilaterals

20
00:01:14,309 --> 00:01:19,039
So you have concave, and you have convex.

21
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:25,683
And the way I remember concave quadrilaterals, or really concave polygons of any number of shapes

22
00:01:25,683 --> 00:01:28,152
is that it looks like something has caved in.

23
00:01:28,152 --> 00:01:31,183
So, for example, this is a concave quadrilateral

24
00:01:31,183 --> 00:01:33,071
It looks like this side has been caved in.

25
00:01:33,071 --> 00:01:36,620
And one way to define concave quadrilaterals,

26
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,580
so let me draw it a little bit bigger,

27
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,454
so this right over here is a concave quadrilateral,

28
00:01:42,454 --> 00:01:49,002
is that it has an interior angle, it has an interior angle that is larger than 180 degrees.

29
00:01:49,002 --> 00:01:56,435
So, for example, this interior angle right over here is larger, is larger than 180 degrees.

30
00:01:56,435 --> 00:02:00,305
It's an interesting proof, maybe I'll do a video, it's actually a pretty simple proof,

31
00:02:00,305 --> 00:02:03,220
to show that if you have a concave quadrilateral

32
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,503
if at least one of the interior angles has a measure larger than 180 degrees

33
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:10,199
that none of the sides can be parallel to each other.

34
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,102
The other type of quadrilateral, you can imagine,

35
00:02:13,102 --> 00:02:17,066
is when all of the interior angles are less than 180 degrees.

36
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:19,318
And you might say, "Well, what happens at 180 degrees?"

37
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:22,553
Well, if this angle was 180 degrees then these wouldn't be two different sides

38
00:02:22,553 --> 00:02:24,720
it would just be one side and that would look like a triangle.

39
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,917
But if all of the interior angles are less than 180 degrees,

40
00:02:28,917 --> 00:02:31,746
then you are dealing with a convex quadrilateral.

41
00:02:31,746 --> 00:02:37,680
So this convex quadrilateral would involve that one and that one over there.

42
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,228
So this right over here is what a convex quadrilateral,

43
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:45,430
this is what a convex quadrilateral could look like.

44
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,025
Four points. Four sides. Four angles.

45
00:02:49,025 --> 00:02:54,472
Now within convex quadrilaterals there are some other interesting categorizations.

46
00:02:54,472 --> 00:02:59,241
So now we're just gonna focus on convex quadrilaterals

47
00:02:59,241 --> 00:03:01,427
so that's gonna be all of this space over here.

48
00:03:01,427 --> 00:03:05,041
So one type of convex quadrilateral is a trapezoid.

49
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:09,102
A trapezoid. And a trapezoid is a convex quadrilateral

50
00:03:09,102 --> 00:03:11,226
and sometimes the definition here is a little bit,

51
00:03:11,226 --> 00:03:13,590
different people will use different definitions,

52
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:21,624
so some people will say a trapezoid is a quadrilateral that has exactly two sides that are parallel to each other

53
00:03:21,624 --> 00:03:24,489
So, for example, they would say that this right over here

54
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:31,150
this right over here is a trapezoid, where this side is parallel to that side.

55
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:38,582
If I give it some letters here, if I call this trapezoid A, B, C, D,

56
00:03:38,582 --> 00:03:43,370
we could say that segment AB is parallel to segment DC

57
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:48,382
and because of that we know that this is, that this is a trapezoid

58
00:03:48,382 --> 00:03:51,893
Now I said that the definition is a little fuzzy because some people say

59
00:03:51,893 --> 00:03:55,333
you can have exactly one pair of parallel sides

60
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,871
but some people say at least one pair of parallel sides.

61
00:03:57,871 --> 00:04:00,856
So if you say, if you use the original definition,

62
00:04:00,856 --> 00:04:03,748
and that's the kind of thing that most people are referring to when they say a trapezoid,

63
00:04:03,748 --> 00:04:07,148
exactly one pair of parallel sides, it might be something like this,

64
00:04:07,148 --> 00:04:12,169
but if you use a broader definition of at least one pair of parallel sides,

65
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,948
then maybe this could also be considered a trapezoid.

66
00:04:15,948 --> 00:04:18,200
So you have one pair of parallel sides. Like that.

67
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,404
And then you have another pair of parallel sides. Like that.

68
00:04:21,404 --> 00:04:24,900
So this is a question mark where it comes to a trapezoid.

69
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,433
A trapezoid is definitely this thing here, where you have one pair of parallel sides.

70
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:32,795
Depending on people's definition, this may or may not be a trapezoid.

71
00:04:32,795 --> 00:04:37,840
If you say it's exactly one pair of parallel sides, this is not a trapezoid because it has two pairs.

72
00:04:37,886 --> 00:04:40,464
If you say at least one pair of parallel sides, then this is a trapezoid.

73
00:04:40,464 --> 00:04:42,977
So I'll put that as a little question mark there.

74
00:04:42,977 --> 00:04:46,944
But there is a name for this regardless of your definition of what a trapezoid is.

75
00:04:46,944 --> 00:04:50,384
If you have a quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides,

76
00:04:50,384 --> 00:04:53,250
you are then dealing with a parallelogram.

77
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,557
So the one thing that you definitely can call this is a parallelogram.

78
00:04:57,603 --> 00:04:59,528
Parallelo,

79
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:01,414
parallelo

80
00:05:01,506 --> 00:05:03,437
parallelogram

81
00:05:03,868 --> 00:05:06,198
Parallelogram.

82
00:05:06,198 --> 00:05:07,550
And I'll just draw it a little bit bigger.

83
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:13,692
So it's a quadrilateral. If I have a quadrilateral, and if I have two pairs of parallel sides

84
00:05:13,692 --> 00:05:16,425
So two of the opposite sides are parallel.

85
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:22,030
So that side is parallel to that side and then this side is parallel to that side there

86
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,483
You're dealing with a parallelogram.

87
00:05:23,483 --> 00:05:26,761
And then parallelograms can be subdivided even further.

88
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:33,846
They can be subdivided even further if the four angles in a parallelogram are all right angles,

89
00:05:33,846 --> 00:05:38,265
you're dealing with a rectangle. So let me draw one like that.

90
00:05:38,265 --> 00:05:45,030
So if the four sides, so from parallelograms, these are, this is all in the parallelogram universe.

91
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,458
What I'm drawing right over here, that is all the parallelogram universe.

92
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:51,975
This parallelogram tells me that opposite sides are parallel.

93
00:05:51,975 --> 00:05:56,120
And if we know that all four angles are 90 degrees

94
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,736
and we've proven in previous videos how to figure out the sum of the interior angles of any polygon

95
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:04,824
and using that same method, you could say that the sum of the interior angles of a rectangle,

96
00:06:04,824 --> 00:06:09,792
or of any, of any quadril, of any quadrilateral, is actually a hund- is actually 360 degrees,

97
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:13,673
and you see that in this special case as well, but maybe we'll prove it in a separate video.

98
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:16,236
But this right over here we would call a rectangle

99
00:06:16,236 --> 00:06:19,724
a parallelogram, opposite sides parallel,

100
00:06:19,724 --> 00:06:22,151
and we have four right angles.

101
00:06:22,151 --> 00:06:26,158
Now if we have a parallelogram, where we don't necessarily have four right angles,

102
00:06:26,158 --> 00:06:31,421
but we do have, where we do have the length of all the sides be equal,

103
00:06:31,421 --> 00:06:35,322
then we're dealing with a rhombus. So let me draw it like that.

104
00:06:35,322 --> 00:06:39,616
So it's a parallelogram. This is a parallelogram.

105
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:43,737
So that side is parallel to that side. This side is parallel to that side.

106
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:47,072
And we also know that all four sides have equal lengths.

107
00:06:47,072 --> 00:06:48,954
So this side's length is equal to that side's length.

108
00:06:48,954 --> 00:06:51,933
Which is equal to that side's length, which is equal to that side's length.

109
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:55,274
Then we are dealing with a rhombus.

110
00:06:55,274 --> 00:06:58,153
So one way to view it, all rhombi are parallelograms

111
00:06:58,153 --> 00:06:59,885
All rectangles are parallelograms

112
00:06:59,885 --> 00:07:02,944
All parallelograms you cannot assume to be rectangles.

113
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:06,451
All parallelograms you cannot assume to be rhombi.

114
00:07:06,451 --> 00:07:10,153
Now, something can be both a rectangle and a rhombus.

115
00:07:10,153 --> 00:07:12,528
So let's say this is the universe of rectangles

116
00:07:12,528 --> 00:07:16,947
So the universe of rectangles. Drawing a little of a venn diagram here.

117
00:07:16,947 --> 00:07:24,276
Is that set of shapes, and the universe of rhombi is this set of shapes right over here.

118
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:25,794
So what would it look like?

119
00:07:25,794 --> 00:07:30,609
Well, you would have four right angles, and they would all have the same length.

120
00:07:30,609 --> 00:07:32,606
So, it would look like this.

121
00:07:32,606 --> 00:07:34,510
So it would definitely be a parallelogram.

122
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,609
It would be a parallelogram. Four right angles.

123
00:07:37,609 --> 00:07:41,761
Four right angles, and all the sides would have the same length.

124
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:45,240
And you probably. This is probably the first of the shapes that you learned, or one of the first shapes.

125
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,858
This is clearly a square.

126
00:07:47,858 --> 00:07:53,993
So all squares are both rhombi, are are members of the, they can also be considered a rhombus

127
00:07:53,993 --> 00:07:55,422
and they can also be considered a rectangle,

128
00:07:55,422 --> 00:07:57,695
and they could also be considered a parallelogram.

129
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:00,238
But clearly, not all rectangles are squares

130
00:08:00,238 --> 00:08:03,470
and not all rhombi are squares

131
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,649
and definitely not all parallelograms are squares.

132
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:09,858
This one, clearly, right over here is neither a rectangle, nor a rhombi

133
00:08:09,858 --> 00:08:11,440
nor a square.

134
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,775
So that's an overview, just gives you a little bit of taxonomy of quadrilaterals.

135
00:08:15,775 --> 00:08:20,656
And then in the next few videos, we can start to explore them and find their interesting properties

136
00:08:20,656 --> 00:08:22,837
Or just do interesting problems involving them.
