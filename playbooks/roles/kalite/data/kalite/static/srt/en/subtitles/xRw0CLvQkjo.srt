1
00:00:02,264 --> 00:00:04,764
Okay, so in this video, we’re going to insert

2
00:00:04,764 --> 00:00:07,235
the AA batteries into our battery holder.

3
00:00:07,235 --> 00:00:08,549
The negative side goes against the spring,

4
00:00:08,565 --> 00:00:10,792
and the positive side goes away from it.

5
00:00:10,792 --> 00:00:13,083
This is going to allow us to

6
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:15,415
hold our battery holder in place a little better,

7
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:16,719
because it will add some mass to it.

8
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:18,372
And it will also give us the power we need

9
00:00:18,372 --> 00:00:20,768
to test our circuits, and eventually run our bot.

10
00:00:20,768 --> 00:00:22,158
So because power can now flow,

11
00:00:22,158 --> 00:00:23,741
we do want to separate those wires

12
00:00:23,741 --> 00:00:25,340
so they don't short out.

13
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,408
And now we're going to put

14
00:00:26,408 --> 00:00:28,524
a blob of hot glue down in the corner –

15
00:00:28,524 --> 00:00:29,774
the same corner as the red

16
00:00:29,774 --> 00:00:32,533
and black wires are close to.

17
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:35,923
And the blob should be about half the size of a dime.

18
00:00:35,923 --> 00:00:36,623
So we’re going to take our

19
00:00:36,623 --> 00:00:38,562
single-pole-double-throw switches,

20
00:00:38,562 --> 00:00:40,437
and we’re going to set them at about

21
00:00:40,437 --> 00:00:42,551
a 90° angle to one another,

22
00:00:42,551 --> 00:00:45,636
so that they’re lined up like so.

23
00:00:45,636 --> 00:00:48,794
And we want the contacts at the top of those

24
00:00:48,794 --> 00:00:50,094
single-pole-double-throw switches

25
00:00:50,094 --> 00:00:51,655
to be touching one another –

26
00:00:51,655 --> 00:00:54,166
the contacts that are on the inside there.

27
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:55,643
Now we're ready for the next step.
