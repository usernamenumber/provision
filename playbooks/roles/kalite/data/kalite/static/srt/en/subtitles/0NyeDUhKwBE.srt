1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620
   

2
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,780
And, in the last video, we had
this differential equation.

3
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,350
And it at least looked like
it could be exact.

4
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,690
But when we took the partial
derivative of this expression,

5
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,800
which we could call M with
respect to y, it was different

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,920
than the partial derivative of
this expression, which is N in

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,940
the exact differential
equations world.

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,610
It was different than
N with respect to x.

9
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,020
And we said, oh boy,
it's not exact.

10
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,810
But we said, what if we could
multiply both sides of this

11
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,010
equation by some function that
would make it exact?

12
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,030
And we called that mu.

13
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,800
And in the last video, we
actually solved for mu.

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,640
We said, well, if we multiply
both sides of this equation by

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:42,200
mu of x is equal to x, it should
make this into an exact

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,310
differential equation.

17
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,280
It's important to note, there
might have been a function of

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,340
y that if I multiplied by
both sides it would

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,490
also make it exact.

20
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,375
There might have been a function
of x and y that would

21
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:51,140
have done the trick.

22
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,280
But our whole goal is just
to make this exact.

23
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,760
It doesn't matter which one
we pick, which integrating

24
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,380
factor-- this is called the
integrating factor-- which

25
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,010
integrating factor we pick.

26
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,190
So anyway, let's do it now.

27
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,190
Let's solve the problem.

28
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:07,250
Let's multiply both sides of
this equation by mu, and mu of

29
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,150
x is just x.

30
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,060
We multiply both sides by x.

31
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:19,460
So see, if you multiply this
term by x, you get 3x squared

32
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:28,320
y plus xy squared, we're
multiplying these terms by x

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:36,060
now, plus x to the third
plus x squared y, y

34
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,910
prime is equal to 0.

35
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,890
Well now, first of all, just as
a reality check, let's make

36
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,850
sure that this is now
an exact equation.

37
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,580
So what's the partial of this
expression, or this kind of

38
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,160
sub-function, with
respect to y?

39
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,590
Well, it's 3x squared, that's
just kind of a constant

40
00:01:53,590 --> 00:02:00,370
coefficient of y, plus 2xy,
that's the partial with

41
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,860
respect to y of that
expression.

42
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,790
Now let's take the partial of
this with respect to x.

43
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:12,190
So we get 3x squared plus 2xy.

44
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,120
And there we have it.

45
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,760
The partial of this with respect
to y is equal to the

46
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,580
partial of this with
respect to N.

47
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,520
So we now have an exact equation
whose solution should

48
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,270
be the same as this.

49
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,762
All we did is we multiplied
both sides of

50
00:02:22,762 --> 00:02:24,650
this equation by x.

51
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,910
So it really shouldn't change
the solution of that equation,

52
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,610
or that differential equation.

53
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,830
So it's exact.

54
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,990
Let's solve it.

55
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,190
So how do we do that?

56
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,490
Well, what we say is, since
we've shown this exact, we

57
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,590
know that there's some function
psi where the partial

58
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:46,730
derivative of psi with respect
to x is equal to this

59
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,330
expression right here.

60
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:55,590
So it's equal to 3x squared
y plus xy squared.

61
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,720
Let's take the antiderivative of
both sides with respect to

62
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,220
x, and we'll get psi
is equal to what?

63
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:10,890
x to the third y plus,
we could write,

64
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,910
1/2 x squared y squared.

65
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:19,110
And of course, this psi is a
function of x and y, so when

66
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,180
you take the partial with
respect to x, when you go that

67
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,110
way, you might have lost some
function that's only a

68
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,880
function of y.

69
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,460
So instead of a plus c here,
it could've been a whole

70
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,250
function of y that we lost. So
we'll add that back when we

71
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,070
take the antiderivative.

72
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,950
So this is our psi.

73
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,880
But we're not completely done
yet, because we have to

74
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,620
somehow figure out what
this function of y is.

75
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,190
And the way we figure that out
is we use the information that

76
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,820
the partial of this
with respect to y

77
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,680
should be equal to this.

78
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,150
So let's set that up.

79
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,370
So what's the partial of this
expression with respect to y?

80
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:59,940
So I could write, the partial
of psi with respect to y is

81
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:08,490
equal to x to the third plus
2 times 1/2, so it's just x

82
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:14,160
squared y plus h prime of y.

83
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,560
That's the partial of a function
purely of y with

84
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,779
respect to y.

85
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:22,410
And then that has to equal our
new N, or the new expression

86
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,930
we got after multiplying by
the integrating factor.

87
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,530
So that's going to be equal
to this right here.

88
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:31,120
This is, hopefully, making sense
to you at this point.

89
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:38,170
And that should be equal to x to
the third plus x squared y.

90
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,420
And interesting enough,
both of these

91
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,350
terms are on this side.

92
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,400
So let's subtract both of those
terms from both sides.

93
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,330
So x to the third, x to
the third, x squared

94
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,480
y, x squared y.

95
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:54,560
And we're left with h prime
of y is equal to 0.

96
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:01,315
Or you could say that h of y
is equal to some constant.

97
00:05:01,315 --> 00:05:04,020
   

98
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,810
So there's really no y, the
extra function of y.

99
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,890
There's just some constant
left over.

100
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:15,840
So for our purposes, we
can just say that

101
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,190
psi is equal to this.

102
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,900
Because this is just a constant,
we're going to take

103
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,840
the antiderivative anyway,
and get a constant on

104
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,620
the right hand side.

105
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,960
And in the previous videos, the

106
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,760
constants all merged together.

107
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,910
So we'll just assume that
that is our psi.

108
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,250
And we know that this
differential equation, up

109
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:38,710
here, can be rewritten as, the
derivative of psi with respect

110
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,820
to x, and that just falls out
of the partial derivative

111
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,210
chain rule.

112
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,510
The derivative of psi with
respect to x is equal to 0.

113
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,370
If you took the derivative of
psi with respect to x, it

114
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,320
should be equal to this whole
thing, just using the partial

115
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,690
derivative chain rule.

116
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,240
And we know what psi is.

117
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,310
So we can write-- or actually
we don't even have to.

118
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,830
We could use this fact to say,
well, if we integrate both

119
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,770
sides, that a solution of this
differential equation is that

120
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,690
psi is equal to c.

121
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:07,170
I just took the antiderivative
of both sides.

122
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,960
So, a solution to the
differential equation is psi

123
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,840
is equal to c.

124
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:16,840
So psi is equal to x
to the third y plus

125
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,520
1/2 x squared y squared.

126
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,200
And we could have said plus c
here, but we know the solution

127
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,770
is that psi is equal to c, so
we'll just write that there.

128
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,840
I could have written a plus
c here, but then you

129
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,620
have a plus c here.

130
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,850
You have another
constant there.

131
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,860
And you can just subtract
them from both sides.

132
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,380
And they just merge into another
arbitrary constant.

133
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,140
But anyway, there we have it.

134
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:42,670
We had a differential equation
that, at least superficially,

135
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,750
looked exact.

136
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,970
It looked exact, but then, when
we tested the exactness

137
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,160
of it, it was not exact.

138
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,300
But we multiplied it by
an integrating factor.

139
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,140
And in the previous video, we
figured out that a possible

140
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,020
integrating factor is that
we could just multiply

141
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,700
both sides by x.

142
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,450
And when we did that,
we tested it.

143
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,570
And true enough, it was exact.

144
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,280
And so, given that it was exact,
we knew that a psi

145
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,050
would exist where the derivative
of psi with respect

146
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,300
to x would be equal to this
entire expression.

147
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,520
So we could rewrite
our differential

148
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,420
equation like this.

149
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,560
And we'd know that a solution
is psi is equal to c.

150
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,570
And to solve for psi, we just
say, OK, the partial

151
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,330
derivative of psi with
respect to x is

152
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,590
going to be this thing.

153
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:26,310
Antiderivative of both sides,
and there's some constant h of

154
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:29,230
y-- not constant, there's some
function of y-- h of y that we

155
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,950
might have lost when we took the
partial with respect to x.

156
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,350
So to figure that out, we
take this expression.

157
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:39,020
Take the partial with respect
to y, and set that equal to

158
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,180
our N expression.

159
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,680
And by doing that, we figured
out that that function of y is

160
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,480
really just some constant.

161
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,520
And we could have written
that here.

162
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,840
We could have written
that plus c.

163
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,320
We could call that
c1 or something.

164
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,000
But we know that the solution
of our original differential

165
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,250
equation is psi is equal to c.

166
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,553
So the solution of our
differential equation is psi x

167
00:08:00,553 --> 00:08:03,720
to the third y plus
1/2 x squared y

168
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,040
squared is equal to c.

169
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,540
We could have had this
plus c1 here, then

170
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,470
subtracted both sides.

171
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,930
But I think I've said it
so many times that you

172
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:15,440
understand, why if h of
y is just a c, you can

173
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,640
kind just ignore it.

174
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,950
Anyway, that's all for
now, and I will see

175
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,900
you in the next video.

176
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,670
You now know a little bit about
integrating factors.

177
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,230
See you soon.

178
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:25,400
