00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,580
Welcome to this presentation on logarithm properties.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,960
Now this is going to be a very hands-on presentation.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,570
If you don't believe that one of these properties are true

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,830
and you want them proved, I've made three or four videos

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,048
that actually prove these properties.

6
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:15,890
But what I'm going to do is I'm going to show the properties and then show you how they can be used.

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,510
It's going to be little more hands-on.

8
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:22,606
So let's just do a little bit of a review of just what a logarithm is.

9
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:28,725
So if I say that "a"... oh that's not the right...

10
00:00:28,725 --> 00:00:29,225
Let's see.

11
00:00:29,225 --> 00:00:31,930
I want to change-- There you go.

12
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,240
Let's say I say that a-- Let me start over.

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:41,700
a to the b is equal to c.

14
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,650
So if we-- a to the b power is equal to c.

15
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,410
So another way to write this exact same relationship instead

16
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,960
of writing the exponent, is to write it as a logarithm.

17
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:57,530
So we can say that the logarithm base a of

18
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:02,030
c is equal to b.

19
00:01:02,504 --> 00:01:06,963
So this are essentially saying the same thing, they just have different kind of results.

20
00:01:06,963 --> 00:01:09,700
In one, you know a and b and you're kind of getting c.

21
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,010
That's what exponentiation does for you.

22
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,240
And the second one, you know a and you know that when

23
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,340
you raise it to some power you get c.

24
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,040
And then you figure out what b is.

25
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,540
So they're the exact same relationship, just stated

26
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,080
in a different way.

27
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,900
Now I will introduce you to some interesting

28
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,960
logarithm properties.

29
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,470
And they actually just fall out of this relationship and

30
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,730
the regular exponent rules.

31
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,850
So the first is that the logarithm-- Let me do

32
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,340
a more cheerful color.

33
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:45,250
The logarithm, let's say, of any base-- So let's just call

34
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,180
the base-- Let's say b for base.

35
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:57,800
Logarithm base b of a plus logarithm base b of c-- and

36
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,760
this only works if we have the same bases.

37
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,790
So that's important to remember.

38
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:12,770
That equals the logarithm of base b of a times c.

39
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,650
Now what does this mean and how can we use it?

40
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,300
Or let's just even try it out with some,

41
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,620
well I don't know, examples.

42
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,850
So this is saying that-- I'll switch to another color.

43
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,380
Let's make mauve my-- Mauve-- I don't know.

44
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,720
I never know how to say that properly.

45
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,460
Let's make that my example color.

46
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:40,900
So let's say logarithm of base two of-- I don't know --of eight

47
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:51,160
plus logarithm base two of-- I don't know let's say --thirty-two.

48
00:02:53,022 --> 00:02:58,429
So, in theory, this should equal, if we believe this

49
00:02:58,429 --> 00:03:05,490
property, this should equal logarithm base two of what?

50
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,900
Well we say eight times thirty-two.

51
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:17,650
So eight times thirty-two is two hundred and forty plus sixteen, two hundred and fifty-six.

52
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,490
Well let's see if that's true.

53
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,730
Just trying out this number and this is really isn't a proof.

54
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,860
But it'll give you a little bit of an intuition, I think, for

55
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,980
what's going on around you.

56
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,330
So log-- So this is-- We just used our property.

57
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,470
This little property that I presented to you.

58
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,870
And let's just see if it works out.

59
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,850
So log base two of eight.

60
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,510
two to what power is equal to eight?

61
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,950
Well two to the third power is equal to eight, right?

62
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,300
So this term right here, that equals three, right?

63
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,810
Log base two of eight is equal to three.

64
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,400
two to what power is equal to thirty-two?

65
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:48,780
Let's see.

66
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,570
two to the fourth power is sixteen.

67
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,290
two to the fifth power is thirty-two.

68
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:58,400
So this right here is two to the-- This is five, right?

69
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,740
And two to the what power is equal to two hundred and fifty-six?

70
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,880
Well if you're a computer science major, you'll

71
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,200
know that immediately.

72
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:10,460
That a bite can have two hundred and fifty-six values in it.

73
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,420
So it's two to the eighth power.

74
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,510
But if you don't know that, you could multiply it out yourself.

75
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,700
But this is eight.

76
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,480
And I'm not doing it just because I knew that three

77
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,460
plus five is equal to eight.

78
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,220
I'm doing this independently.

79
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,290
So this is equal to eight.

80
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:28,520
But it does turn out that three plus five is equal to eight.

81
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,160
This may seem like magic to you or it may seem obvious.

82
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,550
And for those of you who it might seem a little obvious,

83
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:43,310
you're probably thinking, well two to the third times two to the

84
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:49,490
fifth is equal to two to the three plus five, right?

85
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,790
This is just an exponent rule.

86
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,670
What do they call this?

87
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,740
The additive exponent prop-- I don't know.

88
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,220
I don't know the names of things.

89
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,910
And that equals two to eight, two to the eighth.

90
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,160
And that's exactly what we did here, right?

91
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,062
On this side, we had two the third times two to fifth essentially,

92
00:05:07,062 --> 00:05:09,720
and on this side you have them added to each other.

93
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,840
And what makes the logarithms interesting is and why-- It's

94
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:13,970
a little confusing at first.

95
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,610
And you can watch the proofs if you really want kind of

96
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,440
a rigorous-- my proofs aren't rigorous.

97
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,930
But if you want kind of a better explanation

98
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,350
of how this works.

99
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,480
But this should hopefully give you an tuition for why this

100
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,320
property holds, right?

101
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,320
Because when you multiply two numbers of the

102
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,250
same base, right?

103
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,710
Two exponential expressions of the same base, you

104
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,550
can add their exponents.

105
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,050
Similarly, when you have the log of two numbers multiplied

106
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:41,700
by each other, that's equivalent to the log of each

107
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,510
of the numbers added to each other.

108
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,800
This is the same property.

109
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,930
If you don't believe me, watch the proof videos.

110
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:56,360
So let's do a-- Let me show you another log property.

111
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,220
It's pretty much the same one.

112
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,390
I almost view them the same.

113
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:10,440
So this is log base b of a minus log base b of c

114
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:17,030
is equal to log base b of-- well I ran out.

115
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,290
I'm running out of space --a divided by c.

116
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,540
That says a divided by c.

117
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:25,230
And we can, once again, try it out with some numbers.

118
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,610
I use two a lot just because two is an easy number to

119
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,790
figure out the powers.

120
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:30,740
But let's use a different number.

121
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:41,190
Let's say log base three of-- I don't know --log base three of--

122
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,810
well you know, let's make it interesting --log base three of

123
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:56,920
one / nine minus log base three of eighty-one.

124
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:02,490
So this property tells us-- This is the same thing as--

125
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,180
Well I'm ending up with a big number.

126
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:12,990
Log base three of one / nine divided by eighty-one.

127
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,880
So that's the same thing as one / nine times one / eighty-one.

128
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,690
I used two large numbers for my example, but

129
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,310
we'll move forward.

130
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:21,740
So let's see.

131
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,690
nine times eight is seven hundred and twenty, right?

132
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,180
nine times-- Right.

133
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,560
nine times eight is seven hundred and twenty.

134
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,020
So this is one / seven hundred and twenty-nine.

135
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:37,850
So this is log base three over one / seven hundred and twenty-nine.

136
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,160
So what-- What does-- three to what power is equal to one / nine?

137
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,330
Well three squared is equal to nine, right?

138
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:48,060
So three-- So we know that if three squared is equal to nine, then we

139
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,940
know that three to the negative two is equal to one / nine, right?

140
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,180
The negative just inverts it.

141
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,150
So this is equal to negative two, right?

142
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,110
And then minus-- three to what power is equal eighty-one?

143
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,870
three to the third power is twenty-seven.

144
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,380
So three to the fourth power.

145
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,860
So we have minus two minus four is equal to-- Well, we could

146
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,700
do it a couple of ways.

147
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:20,510
Minus two minus four is equal to minus six.

148
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,270
And now we just have to confirm that three to the minus sixth

149
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,070
power is equal to one / seven hundred and twenty-nine.

150
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,880
So that's my question.

151
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:34,410
Is three to the minus sixth power, is that equal to seven-- one / seven hundred and twenty-nine?

152
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,890
Well that's the same thing as saying three to sixth power is

153
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:40,100
equal to seven hundred and twenty-nine, because that's all the negative exponent

154
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,750
does is inverts it.

155
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,580
Let's see.

156
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,870
We could multiply that out, but that should be the case.

157
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,470
Because, well, we could look here.

158
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,320
But let's see.

159
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:52,620
three to the third power-- This would be three to the third power

160
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,440
times three to the third power is equal to twenty-seven times twenty-seven.

161
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,530
That looks pretty close.

162
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,890
You can confirm it with a calculator if you

163
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,330
don't believe me.

164
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,940
Anyway, that's all the time I have in this video.

165
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,490
In the next video, I'll introduce you to the last

166
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,670
two logarithm properties.

167
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:12,480
And, if we have time, maybe I'll do examples with

168
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,440
the leftover time.

169
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,110
I'll see you soon.
