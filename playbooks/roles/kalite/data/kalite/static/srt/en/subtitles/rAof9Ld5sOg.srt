00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
   

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,790
Welcome to the presentation
on derivatives.

3
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,290
I think you're going to find
that this is when math starts

4
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:10,530
to become a lot more fun than
it was just a few topics ago.

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:11,990
Well let's get started
with our derivatives.

6
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,150
I know it sounds
very complicated.

7
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,560
Well, in general, if I have a
straight line-- let me see if I

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,990
can draw a straight line
properly-- if I had a straight

9
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:28,020
line-- that's my coordinate
axes, which aren't straight--

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,120
this is a straight line.

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,700
   

12
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,630
But when I have a straight line
like that, and I ask you to

13
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,150
find the slope-- I think you
already know how to do this--

14
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,540
it's just the change in y
divided by the change in x.

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,800
If I wanted to find the slope--
really I mean the slope is the

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,140
same, because it is a straight
line, the slope is the same

17
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,040
across the whole line, but if I
want to find the slope at any

18
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,840
point in this line, what I
would do is I would pick a

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,000
point x-- say I'd
pick this point.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,280
We'd pick a different color--
I'd take this point, I'd pick

21
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,840
this point-- it's pretty
arbitrary, I could pick any two

22
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,990
points, and I would figure out
what the change in y is-- this

23
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,860
is the change in y, delta y,
that's just another way of

24
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:15,860
saying change in y-- and
this is the change in x.

25
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:16,920
delta x.

26
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,140
And we figured out that the
slope is defined really as

27
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:30,250
change in y divided
by change in x.

28
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,540
   

29
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,640
And another way of saying that
is delta-- it's that triangle--

30
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,180
delta y divided by delta x.

31
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,660
Very straightforward.

32
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,100
Now what happens, though,
if we're not dealing

33
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:45,860
with a straight line?

34
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,780
Let me see if I have
space to draw that.

35
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,920
Another coordinate axes.

36
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,780
Still pretty messy, but I
think you'll get the point.

37
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:00,073
   

38
00:02:00,073 --> 00:02:02,960
Now let's say, instead of just
a regular line like this, this

39
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,690
follows the standard
y equals mx plus b.

40
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:09,640
Let's just say I had the
curve y equals x squared.

41
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,150
Let me draw it in a
different color.

42
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,940
So y equals x squared looks
something like this.

43
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,320
It's a curve, you're probably
pretty familiar with it by now.

44
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,650
And what I'm going to
ask you is, what is the

45
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,180
slope of this curve?

46
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,440
And think about that.

47
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,930
What does it mean to take
the slope of a curve now?

48
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,150
Well, in this line, the slope
was the same throughout

49
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,400
the whole line.

50
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,780
But if you look at this
curve, doesn't the

51
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,960
slope change, right?

52
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,560
Here it's almost flat, and it
gets steeper steeper steeper

53
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,865
steeper steeper until
gets pretty steep.

54
00:02:38,865 --> 00:02:41,000
And if you go really far out,
it gets extremely steep.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,630
So you're probably saying,
well, how do you figure out

56
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,910
the slope of a curve whose
slope keeps changing?

57
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,170
Well there is no slope
for the entire curve.

58
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,900
For a line, there is a slope
for the entire line, because

59
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,250
the slope never changes.

60
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,380
But what we could try to
do is figure out what the

61
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,720
slope is at a given point.

62
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,540
And the slope at a given point
would be the same as the

63
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,890
slope of a tangent line.

64
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:08,260
For example-- let me pick a
green-- the slope at this point

65
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:17,970
right here would be the same
as the slope of this line.

66
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,180
Right?

67
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,550
Because this line
is tangent to it.

68
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:24,350
So it just touches that curve,
and at that exact point, they

69
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:27,820
would have-- this blue curve, y
equals x squared, would have

70
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,650
the same slope as
this green line.

71
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,050
But if we go to a point back
here, even though this is a

72
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:36,940
really badly drawn graph,
the slope would be

73
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,700
something like this.

74
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,015
The tangent slope.

75
00:03:40,015 --> 00:03:42,520
The slope would be a negative
slope, and here it's a positive

76
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,940
slope, but if we took a
point here, the slope would

77
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,630
be even more positive.

78
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,030
So how are we going
to figure this out?

79
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,900
How are we going to figure out
what the slope is at any point

80
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,850
along the curve y
equals x squared?

81
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,590
That's where the derivative
comes into use, and now for the

82
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,290
first time you'll actually see
why a limit is actually

83
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,010
a useful concept.

84
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,130
So let me try to
redraw the curve.

85
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:15,750
OK, I'll draw my axes, that's
the y-axis-- I'll just do it in

86
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:22,630
the first quadrant-- and this
is-- I really have to find a

87
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:29,470
better tool to do my-- this is
x coordinate, and then let

88
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,620
me draw my curve in yellow.

89
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,135
   

90
00:04:34,135 --> 00:04:37,790
So y equals x squared looks
something like this.

91
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,520
I'm really concentrating
to draw this at

92
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,700
least decently good.

93
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,800
OK.

94
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,890
So let's say we want to find
the slope at this point.

95
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:53,560
   

96
00:04:53,560 --> 00:05:00,040
Let's call this point a.

97
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,070
At this point, x equals a.

98
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:06,845
And of course this is f of a.

99
00:05:06,845 --> 00:05:11,340
   

100
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,190
So what we could try to do
is, we could try to find

101
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,410
the slope of a secant line.

102
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,920
A line between-- we take
another point, say, somewhat

103
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:26,550
close, to this point on the
graph, let's say here, and if

104
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,530
we could figure out the slope
of this line, it would be a

105
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:34,000
bit of an approximation of
the slope of the curve

106
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,090
exactly at this point.

107
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,740
So let me draw
that secant line.

108
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:44,460
   

109
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,100
Something like that.

110
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,690
Secant line looks
something like that.

111
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:56,050
And let's say that this point
right here is a plus h, where

112
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,860
this distance is just h, this
is a plus h, we're just going

113
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:05,160
h away from a, and then
this point right here

114
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,060
is f of a plus h.

115
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,640
   

116
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,103
My pen is malfunctioning.

117
00:06:13,103 --> 00:06:17,730
   

118
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,550
So this would be an
approximation for what the

119
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,220
slope is at this point.

120
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,980
And the closer that h gets,
the closer this point gets to

121
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,390
this point, the better our
approximation is going to be,

122
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:30,520
all the way to the point that
if we could actually get the

123
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,140
slope where h equals 0, that
would actually be the slope,

124
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,050
the instantaneous slope, at
that point in the curve.

125
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,440
But how can we figure out what
the slope is when h equals 0?

126
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,800
   

127
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,670
So right now, we're saying that
the slope between these two

128
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,900
points, it would be the
change in y, so what's

129
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,040
the change in y?

130
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:57,170
It's this, so that this point
right here is-- the x

131
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:00,710
coordinate is-- my thing just
keeps messing up-- the x

132
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:11,330
coordinate is a plus h, and the
y coordinate is f of a plus h.

133
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:15,180
   

134
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:22,050
And this point right here, the
coordinate is a and f of a.

135
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,370
So if we just use the standard
slope formula, like before, we

136
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,610
would say change in
y over change in x.

137
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,100
Well, what's the change in y?

138
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:37,680
It's f of a plus h-- this
y coordinate minus this y

139
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:46,850
coordinate-- minus f of
a over the change in x.

140
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:53,010
Well that change in x is this
x coordinate, a plus h, minus

141
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,720
this x coordinate, minus a.

142
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,480
And of course this a
and this a cancel out.

143
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,490
So it's f of a plus h,
minus f of a, all over h.

144
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:05,400
This is just the slope
of this secant line.

145
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,810
And if we want to get the slope
of the tangent line, we would

146
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,980
just have to find what happens
as h gets smaller and

147
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,780
smaller and smaller.

148
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,470
And I think you know
where I'm going.

149
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,840
Really, we just want to, if we
want to find the slope of this

150
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,140
tangent line, we just have
to find the limit of this

151
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:28,780
value as h approaches 0.

152
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,700
And then, as h approaches 0,
this secant line is going to

153
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,710
get closer and closer to the
slope of the tangent line.

154
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:40,590
And then we'll know the exact
slope at the instantaneous

155
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,900
point along the curve.

156
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,150
And actually, it turns out
that this is the definition

157
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,800
of the derivative.

158
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,780
And the derivative is nothing
more than the slope of a

159
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,010
curve at an exact point.

160
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:56,310
And this is super useful,
because for the first time,

161
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,570
everything we've talked
about to this point is

162
00:08:58,570 --> 00:08:59,560
the slope of a line.

163
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,050
But now we can take any
continuous curve, or most

164
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,800
continuous curves, and find
the slope of that curve

165
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,340
at an exact point.

166
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,940
So now that I've given you the
definition of what a derivative

167
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,690
is, and maybe hopefully a
little bit of intuition, in the

168
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:17,070
next presentation I'm going to
use this definition to actually

169
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,040
apply it to some functions,
like x squared and others, and

170
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,930
give you some more problems.

171
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,070
I'll see you in the
next presentation

172
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,000
