1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,830
This might be the last video
if I can squeeze in three

3
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,676
problems. So problem 14.

4
00:00:04,676 --> 00:00:07,650
The last video at least
for SAT prep.

5
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,915
Hopefully I will keep
doing videos.

6
00:00:08,915 --> 00:00:13,490
   

7
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,630
OK, it looks something
like this.

8
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,145
And then it comes back
down like this.

9
00:00:17,145 --> 00:00:18,640
And what are they telling us?

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:25,500
They're saying that this
is line l, line m.

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,110
This is x.

12
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,820
This is z degrees, this
is y degrees.

13
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,100
Looks like we're going to have
to play the angle game.

14
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:37,760
In the figure above, line
l is parallel to line m.

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,620
What does z equal in
terms of x and y?

16
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:41,930
OK.

17
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,270
So these two lines
are parallel.

18
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,510
If this is y degrees,
what other

19
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:47,810
angles are also y degrees?

20
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,840
Well, what's the corresponding
angle?

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,630
Right here.

22
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,540
Well, this is also going
to be y degrees, right?

23
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,530
These lines are parallel.

24
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,790
This is a transversal.

25
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,030
These are corresponding
angles.

26
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:56,840
This is going to be y.

27
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,740
And it makes sense too.

28
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,230
I mean, if you tilted this
angle, you would visually see

29
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,770
that these angles would
be the same.

30
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,850
If this is y, what
is this angle?

31
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,870
Well, they're opposite, so this
is also going to be y.

32
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:11,460
And then we have z plus x
plus y has to equal 180.

33
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,150
Because they're all in
the same triangle.

34
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,860
z plus x plus y is
equal to 180.

35
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,105
We want to solve for z.

36
00:01:18,105 --> 00:01:21,320
So subtract x and y from both
sides, and you get z is equal

37
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,000
to 180 minus x minus y.

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,380
And that is choice E.

39
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,170
   

40
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,420
Next problem.

41
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,150
   

42
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,650
Problem 15.

43
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:49,180
If n over n minus 1 times
1/n times n over n plus

44
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,420
1 is equal to 5/k.

45
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,290
For positive integers n and
k, what is the value of k?

46
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,050
So these are positive
integers.

47
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,140
So before multiplying all of
this out, we can simplify a

48
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:00,570
little bit.

49
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,620
This n can cancel
out with this n.

50
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,660
And now let's see if we can.

51
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,020
What does the top-- what does
this left-hand side become?

52
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,169
And the numerator always left--
this is just a 1 now.

53
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:11,180
This is a 1.

54
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,030
So we're left with 1
times 1 times n.

55
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:19,190
So that's n over n minus 1,
times 1-- I can ignore that

56
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,440
1-- times n plus 1.

57
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,110
   

58
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:28,570
Is equal to 5 over k.

59
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:29,540
So what are they asking?

60
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,010
Well, what is the value of k?

61
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,330
Well, we can say that
n is equal to 5.

62
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,520
Or let's assume that
n is equal to 5.

63
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,950
Because we don't know
definitely that

64
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:41,710
n is equal to 5.

65
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,860
It could be some multiple--
I'll show you.

66
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,260
Let's assume that
n is equal to 5.

67
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,560
If n is equal to 5,
then what is k?

68
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,000
Well, then k would be
this denominator.

69
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,420
Right?

70
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,710
If n is 5, then k is this.

71
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:04,700
Then k would be-- so this could
be 5 over 5 minus 1

72
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,900
times 5 plus 1.

73
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,720
And that equals 5 over
4 times 6, which is

74
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,160
equal to 5 over 24.

75
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,150
So this could be 5 over 24.

76
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,240
And they're all positive
integers so k is 24.

77
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,120
k is 24.

78
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,710
And that's choice C.

79
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,900
So the trick here is really once
again-- simplify a little

80
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,440
bit, multiply it out and
then pattern matching.

81
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,146
Let me just set n
is equal to 5.

82
00:03:30,146 --> 00:03:32,490
If n is equal to 5,
then what is k?

83
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,980
It's 5 minus 1 times 5 plus 1.

84
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,850
It's just pattern matching.

85
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,290
Next problem.

86
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,010
Problem 6.

87
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,530
I will do it in magenta because
this is the last

88
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,270
problem in the book.

89
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:49,170
To celebrate a colleague's
graduation the m coworkers in

90
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,530
an office agreed to contribute
equally to a catered lunch

91
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,810
that cost a total
of y dollars.

92
00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:00,070
So there's m workers, and
the total price is y

93
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,410
dollars for the lunch.

94
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,770
If p of the workers fail to
contribute, which of the

95
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,260
following represents the
additional amount in dollars

96
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,490
that each of the remaining
coworkers must contribute to

97
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,050
pay for the lunch?

98
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,620
The additional amount
in dollars.

99
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,670
So if everyone paid, how much
would we have to pay?

100
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,850
Well, the total lunch
is y, right?

101
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:24,730
So if everyone was a good
coworker, we would each have

102
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:28,820
to pay y divided by the
number of coworkers.

103
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,680
This is the ideal situation.

104
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,340
But we know some of the
coworkers didn't pay.

105
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,200
p didn't pay.

106
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,500
So how many are we going to have
to divvy it up by now?

107
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,260
So then that means only
m minus p paid.

108
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,120
These are the deadbeats that
did not pay for the lunch.

109
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,520
So only the m minus p paid.

110
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,320
So now we have to actually
divide the y dollars between a

111
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,610
smaller group of people
who actually paid.

112
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,140
And the smaller group of
people who actually

113
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,420
paid is m minus p.

114
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,220
So if you wanted to figure out--
and this is going to be

115
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:57,930
a larger number.

116
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:58,250
Why?

117
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,750
Because its denominator
is smaller.

118
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,140
When the denominator is smaller
and you have the same

119
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,180
numerator, there's going
to be a larger number.

120
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,120
So if you want to know what is
the additional amount you have

121
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,240
to pay-- well, this is how
much we're having to pay,

122
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,080
which is a larger amount than
how much we would have paid if

123
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,400
everyone paid.

124
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,750
So how much are we
paying extra?

125
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,000
Well, we subtract
this from this.

126
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,110
This is how much we
end up paying.

127
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,200
And we subtract how much
we should have paid.

128
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,560
And we'll get the additional
amount.

129
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,410
Let me draw a line so we
don't get confused.

130
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,960
   

131
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,390
That doesn't look like one of
the choices, so let's actually

132
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,400
get a common denominator.

133
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,580
Common denominator would
be m times m minus p.

134
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,720
I just multiply the
denominators.

135
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,140
So y over m minus p.

136
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:47,110
That's the same thing as m
y over m times m minus p.

137
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,040
I just multiply the numerator
and the denominator by m.

138
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:55,600
And this is minus--
m minus p times y.

139
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,610
   

140
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,100
For this one I just multiplied
the numerator and the

141
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,250
denominator by m minus p.

142
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,066
I just found a common
denominator and added the

143
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,090
fractions, or subtracted
the fractions.

144
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,240
And so, the denominator stays.

145
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,810
m times m minus p.

146
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,970
Let me see if I can simplify
the numerator.

147
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:25,250
That becomes m y minus
m y plus py.

148
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,270
Minus times a minus
here is a plus.

149
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,280
Plus py.

150
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,600
These cancel out.

151
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,800
So you get py over m
times m minus p.

152
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,680
And that is choice E.

153
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,470
py over m times m minus p.

154
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:49,240
And we have now done something
like, what, 8 tests.

155
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,170
8 tests and 54 problems per
test. So that's 54 times 8.

156
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,940
54 times 8.

157
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,300
That's, what?

158
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,180
432 SAT problems. And I think
you're ready to go take the

159
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,200
SAT and get a perfect score.

160
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,760
And let me know if you do.

161
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,100
That would be very exciting.

162
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,870
All right.

163
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,070
I'll see you in, I guess,
other videos

164
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,240
that are not SAT related.

165
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,820
Or maybe when a new book
comes out I'll

166
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,530
have to do this again.

167
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:12,833
