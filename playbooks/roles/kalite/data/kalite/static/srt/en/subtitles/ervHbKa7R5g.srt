1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,210
   

2
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:04,550
We've got a few more details
today from Geithner and the

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,310
Obama administration
about their plan

4
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,380
for saving the banks.

5
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,900
So I figured that this is a
good time to analyze what

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,860
they're proposing, and see
if we can come to any

7
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:13,800
conclusions.

8
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,960
So, just to simplify the
original problem,

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,880
you have some bank.

10
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,900
Maybe it's Citibank
or somebody else.

11
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,510
Let's say they have one big bad
asset that they originally

12
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,020
paid $100 for.

13
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,970
So that was the original book
value for the asset.

14
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,140
And they were able to do that.

15
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,130
And obviously these banks have
a bunch of assets, so I'm

16
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,110
oversimplifying it.

17
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,020
But I think it'll get you
the crux of the issue.

18
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:41,610
They did that by-- obviously a
lot of them leveraged much

19
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:47,530
more-- but let's say they
used $40 of equity.

20
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:48,950
And then they borrowed
the remaining

21
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:56,370
$60 to get that asset.

22
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,100
And now of course, this
asset right here is

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,640
backed by toxic mortgages.

24
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,890
And it's the equity tranche
on these mortgages.

25
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,710
And I encourage you to watch the
videos on collateralized

26
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,990
debt obligations, and mortgage
backed securities.

27
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,210
And even the whole thing, all
of the videos that we did on

28
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,770
Paulson's original
bailout plan.

29
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,020
Because I talk about all the
liquidity issues there.

30
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,820
The bottom line is that some of
these debts are coming due

31
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,760
for these banks.

32
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,390
So they need to offload these
assets to get cash.

33
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,040
And the whole problem here is,
if they offload these assets--

34
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,900
let's say they know it's not
worth $100, dollars, right?

35
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,200
Everyone knows it's really
not worth $100.

36
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,710
But these banks don't want to
offload these assets for

37
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:40,630
anything less than $60.

38
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,430
Because if they offload these
assets for anything less than

39
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,350
$60, then they have
negative equity.

40
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,880
That means that the books values
here-- let's say if

41
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,170
that was the only asset
they had, then you

42
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,130
would have this situation.

43
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:58,160
If they offloaded for 50 cents
on the dollar, then they're

44
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,110
offloading it for $50.

45
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,250
So you'd be with this reality.

46
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:05,320
You would have $50.

47
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,759
And you owe $60.

48
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,450
So there's nothing left for the
equity, and in fact you

49
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,730
would go into bankruptcy.

50
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,330
You would be an insolvent
bank.

51
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,130
So just to set the framework.

52
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,690
There's a huge incentive why the
bank doesn't want to sell

53
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,660
this asset for anything less
than 60 cents on the dollar.

54
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,910
The problem is, the most that
anyone's willing to pay for it

55
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,680
right now is not even the
60 cents on the dollar.

56
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,010
People are just willing to pay--
I've read reports and it

57
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,790
depends on what asset you're
looking at-- that people are

58
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:35,990
willing to pay 30 cents.

59
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,980
So let me write that down,
because it is important.

60
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,270
This is what banks want.

61
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:43,870
   

62
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,850
Greater than 60 cents
on the dollar.

63
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:55,640
And in this case, it's
$100, so $60.

64
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,440
My understanding is so far, for
the most part, without any

65
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,420
government intervention, the
investors are willing to pay

66
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,650
30 cents or less.

67
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,680
So there's this disconnect.

68
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,940
The bank's like, well I'm not
willing to sell this for

69
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,810
anything less than 60 cents,
because then I'm insolvent and

70
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:09,810
the gig's up.

71
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,850
And investors are saying, well
these are toxic assets.

72
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,620
Every day there's more
foreclosures.

73
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,440
It's even hard to get good
documentation on what backs up

74
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,100
these loans.

75
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,540
A lot of these were
these NINJA loans.

76
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,180
No income, no job loans.

77
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,800
Or these liar loans, or stated
income loans, where people can

78
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,460
just fill out with anything
they want.

79
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,490
And there's all this fraud.

80
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,070
So people are discounting a lot
of risk into these assets.

81
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,080
So essentially, the market
isn't functioning.

82
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,950
The buyer's willingness to pay
is much slower than the

83
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,145
seller's willingness to sell.

84
00:03:35,145 --> 00:03:36,220
And nothing happens.

85
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,820
And so, these toxic assets are,
you could say, clogging

86
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,470
up the system.

87
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,420
Because the banks, I won't say
that they can't sell them.

88
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,000
It's just they're not willing
to sell them.

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,330
Because if they were willing
to sell them at the market

90
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,140
price-- whether or not you agree
with this market price--

91
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,110
the banks will be bankrupt.

92
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,070
So the government all along
has been trying to come up

93
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:01,670
with different iterations of how
can we somehow get these

94
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,160
assets off the banks' balance
sheets without causing the

95
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,310
banks to get insolvent?

96
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,600
And the original version of TARP
1 is that the government

97
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,720
will essentially buy these
assets for, who knows, 70

98
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,630
cents on the dollar.

99
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,870
And in that reality, if you
bought those assets for 70

100
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,540
cents on the dollar,
then those assets,

101
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,350
you'd have $70 here.

102
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,810
The bank would owe $60.

103
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,800
And there would still be a
little bit left of equity.

104
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,110
There would be $10 left.

105
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,920
But the important thing is that
the bank would be able to

106
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,785
pay off its liabilities, stay
liquid, and then be around for

107
00:04:37,785 --> 00:04:39,730
a better day or a better
economy, where it could grow

108
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,180
the equity base again by
investing in all of that.

109
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,930
And everyone realized
that the TARP was a

110
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,090
fraud on some level.

111
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,950
Because when you do that, if the
market price really is 30

112
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,630
cents on the dollar, and
you're paying 70 cents.

113
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,890
Let me say, if this TARP 1.

114
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:56,760
   

115
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:02,040
And the government pays 70
cents on the dollar.

116
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,480
The government's overpaying
by 40 cents on the dollar.

117
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,790
In this case, the government
would be writing a $40 check

118
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,110
to the owners of this company.

119
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,920
In this case, the
stockholders.

120
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,590
And these are the very same
people the management and the

121
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,060
original investors in a lot
of these companies.

122
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,100
These are the very same people
who got us into this mess.

123
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,750
And why should we be rewriting
them billions of dollars of

124
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,740
checks to essentially
just bail them out.

125
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,610
Why don't you just
take them into

126
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,010
receivership and all that?

127
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,380
And I'll do other
videos on that.

128
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,560
So the new iteration that has
come about-- and let me scroll

129
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,710
down a little bit-- is, and
let me draw the original

130
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,960
circumstance.

131
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,900
   

132
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,020
So you have this item
here that was

133
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,490
originally paid for $100.

134
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:48,310
They borrowed $60 to
purchase them.

135
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,030
And then they have
$40 of equity.

136
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:57,040
The new plan is, the
government's saying, you're

137
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,660
right, taxpayer.

138
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,910
We as a government, we're not
in a position to decide what

139
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,180
things are worth.

140
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,790
We're not hedge fund managers
or mutual fund managers.

141
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,550
We're just bureaucrats.

142
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,580
And you're right.

143
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,930
We would probably just end
up overpaying for things.

144
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,420
Because these guys are smart.

145
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,810
And if they're not willing to
pay more than 30 cents, and

146
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,310
we're paying 70, we're
overpaying, and it's just a

147
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,280
big subsidy from the taxpayer.

148
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,610
So the new Geithner plan is
saying, hey we're going to

149
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:26,770
partner with the private
investors.

150
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:29,563
And the way they're suggesting
they do that, is that let's

151
00:06:29,563 --> 00:06:31,200
say a private investor-- and
these are numbers that I've

152
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,550
been reading in some of the
newspaper reports, and the

153
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,930
numbers might change over time
because they do tend to.

154
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:42,810
But private investors will
contribute, say, $7.

155
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,510
   

156
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:50,400
This is from private
investors.

157
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,660
The Treasury will contribute
another-- let me make another

158
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,980
box-- will kind of match
that investment

159
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,130
by the private investors.

160
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:02,170
So the Treasury will contribute
another $7.

161
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:07,310
   

162
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,850
And then the Fed is going
to lend the balance.

163
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,900
So the Fed-- let's see, if you
want to get to $100, that's

164
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,872
$14-- so the Fed has
to lend $86.

165
00:07:16,872 --> 00:07:18,440
Let me draw a box here.

166
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,600
   

167
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,040
It's going to look something
like that.

168
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,030
   

169
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,460
So that's $86.

170
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,710
from the Fed.

171
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,340
   

172
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,790
And of course, this entity,
when it's originally

173
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:42,150
capitalized, is going to be
sitting on $100 cash.

174
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,880
That's its assets.

175
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,100
Well I'm saying it
has $100 of cash.

176
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,090
It could be something less, but
let's say this is what it

177
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,590
originally sets out to be.

178
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,840
Fed lent $86.

179
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,640
This is a loan.

180
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,120
The Treasury made a direct
equity investment of $7.

181
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,030
And private investors make a
direct investment of $7.

182
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,630
And then this entity can then
go and buy these assets.

183
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,140
And what the government-- at
least my reading of it is-- is

184
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,170
that the private investors are
going to set the price.

185
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,730
So the private investors are
going to say, you know what?

186
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:18,870
I think that this thing right
here is worth, I don't know, I

187
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,740
think it's worth 70 cents
on the dollar.

188
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,510
And let's say that they
are the winning bid.

189
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,490
They are the people willing to
pay the most. Because that's

190
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,060
my reading.

191
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,100
Is that there will
be an auction.

192
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,010
And the private investor, in
partnership with the Treasury

193
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,230
that's willing to pay the most,
will get the assets.

194
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:39,789
So that in that case-- let's say
they decide to pay $100,

195
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:40,770
just to make the math easy.

196
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,790
So then this cash will
go to this bank.

197
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:49,350
So then they'll have
$100 of cash.

198
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,590
So then we'll have the toxic
asset sitting here.

199
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:56,530
   

200
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,850
And you might say, hey
Sal, that's crazy.

201
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,270
Why would a private
investor do that?

202
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,260
And you're right.

203
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,890
I mean, in a lot of
circumstances, they obviously

204
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:04,315
wouldn't pay.

205
00:09:04,315 --> 00:09:06,410
Actually, because of that, let
me not make $100 the number.

206
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:10,365
Let's say that they
pay $60 for it.

207
00:09:10,365 --> 00:09:13,180
Because, remember, the banks
weren't even willing to part

208
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,750
with them for less than $60.

209
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,100
So for this to even work,
someone's going to have to pay

210
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,900
at least $60 for this thing.

211
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,270
So let's say they
pay $60 for it.

212
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,520
And then they get the asset.

213
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,500
And they're going to
have $40 left over.

214
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,920
So they have toxic asset, and
then they're going to have $40

215
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,860
left over, because they only
paid $60 for the security.

216
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,740
The way I set it up.

217
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:38,940
Although, they probably designed
this thing so there

218
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,870
isn't any cash left over.

219
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,970
But let's just use these
numbers for the sake of

220
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,310
convenience.

221
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,200
So now, you might say,
well, this was good.

222
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,540
The private investors, they made
an educated decision, and

223
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,540
they've decided to price
these things at 60

224
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,130
cents on the dollar.

225
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:57,510
And my question to you is, why
would these same people who,

226
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,370
before this plan, weren't
willing to pay any more than

227
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:04,370
30 cents on the dollar, now
be willing to pay 60

228
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,320
cents on the dollar?

229
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,490
Now they're willing to pay
this much for the asset.

230
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,310
And there's a couple
of answers here.

231
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,980
I mean, the kind of naive answer
is that the government

232
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,060
takes the first hit.

233
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,710
Or if these things end
up being worth 30

234
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,480
cents on the dollar.

235
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,840
Let's say that we go to some
future state, and these really

236
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,080
are worth only 30 cents, the
most that the private investor

237
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,270
loses in this situation
is his $7.

238
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,910
The rest of the loss is
going to be borne by

239
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,200
the Fed and the Treasury.

240
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,090
This loan by the Federal
Reserve is a

241
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,710
non-recourse loan.

242
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:39,060
Which means that, if for
whatever reason this entity

243
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,030
can't pay back the loan, the
lender-- which is in this case

244
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,190
the Fed --can't go after
the equity holders.

245
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,480
All the lender can do
is take the asset.

246
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,460
So if this asset is worth
nothing, the Fed, all it can

247
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,590
do is just take the asset, and
essentially it's going to get

248
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,090
nothing back for its loan.

249
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,420
So in this situation, the
private investor would get all

250
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,070
of the upside.

251
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:01,870
If this thing that they paid $60
for ends up being worth,

252
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,410
let's say it ends up being
worth-- I'll draw it down here

253
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,850
because it's all going to the
equity holder-- if that asset

254
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:11,470
they paid $60 for, it if it ends
up being worth $80 then

255
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:16,200
that extra $20 of value is
going to be split by the

256
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,940
Treasury and the private
investor.

257
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,300
So let me give you
that situation.

258
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,020
So what would the balance
sheet look like?

259
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,150
They pay $60 now.

260
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:28,510
All of a sudden that
asset is worth $80.

261
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,345
So this is a good scenario,
an upside scenario.

262
00:11:30,345 --> 00:11:32,720
Remember, we had $40 left over
in cash, just based on the way

263
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,730
I had originally set it up.

264
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:44,160
You owe $86 to the Fed, the
Federal Reserve, which is

265
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,820
officially separate from the
Treasury, separate entity.

266
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,560
And then the equity is split
between the Treasury and the

267
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,230
private investor.

268
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,920
So how much equity is there?

269
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,920
You have $120 here minus
$86 So you have

270
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,560
$34 of equity, right?

271
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,740
Because you have $6 more here,
so this is $34 of equity.

272
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,310
And it's going to be split
50-50, so it's going to be $17

273
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,010
for the private investor.

274
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,450
And then you have $17
for the Treasury.

275
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,280
And this looks great.

276
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,860
In this situation, the private
investor's original

277
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,380
investment was $7.

278
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,630
And it went to $17.

279
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,900
So it's got a huge return
on investment.

280
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,490
So this is the positive
scenario.

281
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:30,780
And then the negative scenario,
where let's say that

282
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:37,050
original investment actually
ends up being worth $30.

283
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:42,720
Remember they had $40 of cash
in the way I set it up.

284
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,600
Now all of a sudden the Federal
Reserve, you had a

285
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,270
loan from the Fed for $86.

286
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,740
Now your assets are worth less
than your liabilities.

287
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,330
Your equity is wiped
out, right?

288
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:59,150
So in this bad situation, the
private investor invested $7,

289
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,930
and it went to zero.

290
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:04,070
So this doesn't actually look
like that bad of a scenario.

291
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:10,600
That in an up case, you go from
$7 to $17, And in a bad

292
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,920
case, you go from $7
to zero dollars.

293
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,690
And actually, this could be
magnified a lot more,

294
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,460
depending on how these
things work out.

295
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,310
But this still begs the
question, if an investor

296
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:26,690
really thinks that these things
are worth 30 cents, and

297
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:29,470
that there's no chance that
they're worth more than 60

298
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:33,260
cents, even though they
disproportionately can

299
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,210
participate in the upside,
relative to the downside,

300
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,250
which I think in of
itself is wrong.

301
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,215
That the government shouldn't be
subsidizing hedge funds and

302
00:13:40,215 --> 00:13:41,510
other private investors.

303
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:44,360
But if they really thought that
the value was closer to

304
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,120
30 than to 60, then the question
is, why would they

305
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,910
participate at all?

306
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,190
I mean, if you know you're
going to lose money, you

307
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,710
shouldn't do it to begin with.

308
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,140
And I realize I've
run out of time.

309
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,600
I'm going to cover that
in the next video.

310
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,140
And to some degree,
the next video
