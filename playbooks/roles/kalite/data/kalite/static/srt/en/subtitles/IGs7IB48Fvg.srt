1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,790
   

2
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:05,520
Write a polynomial to express
the total value of p $20

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:15,110
bills, q $10 bills,
and r $5 bills.

4
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,180
So what's the value
of p $20 bills?

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,090
Well if I have p $20 bills,
the value of each of those

6
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,890
dollar bills is going
to be $20.

7
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,590
So the value all p of them
is going to be 20p.

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,299
If I have one $20
bill, it's $20.

9
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:36,170
If I have three $20 bills, if p
is 3, it's going to be $60.

10
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,650
Actually, let me do that
in the same color as

11
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:38,420
I underlined it.

12
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,630
I underlined it in yellow.

13
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,040
So let me do the p $20 bills.

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,640
So 20p is the p $20 bills.

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,100
Then you have your
q $10 bills.

16
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,260
So what's the value of those?

17
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,490
Well it's going to be 10q.

18
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,100
If I have one $10 bill,
it's worth $10.

19
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,410
If I have ten $10 bills, if q
is 10, this is going to be

20
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,560
worth 10 times 10. $100.

21
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,480
And then finally you have your r
$5 bills, which are going to

22
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,830
be worth 5r dollars.

23
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,120
One $5 bill, worth $5.

24
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,790
Two $5 bills, worth $10.

25
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:10,610
And we're done.

26
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,240
We've expressed it
as a polynomial.

27
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,090
Polynomial just means that we
have multiple terms here and

28
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,760
this is three terms. We could
even call it a trinomial.

29
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,700
Polynomial is a more general
term for more than one term.

30
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,333
