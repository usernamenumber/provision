1
00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:07,731
In ancient Greece people did not use soap and water to wash.

2
00:00:07,731 --> 00:00:09,211
They used oil.

3
00:00:09,211 --> 00:00:14,674
And we're seeing a sculpture called "The Scraper", or The Apoxyomenos, by Lysippos,

4
00:00:14,674 --> 00:00:16,427
Which shows just that.

5
00:00:16,427 --> 00:00:20,175
This is an athlete whose body is now covered with perspiration and dust,

6
00:00:20,175 --> 00:00:22,428
And what he's doing is he's washing himself,

7
00:00:22,428 --> 00:00:25,906
First by covering his body with oil, and then using a strigil

8
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:29,761
To scrape all of the grime off with the oil.

9
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:34,873
Lysippos was one of the most famous sculptors from the 4th century BCE

10
00:00:34,873 --> 00:00:39,966
but of course we're not looking at the actual work by Lysippos of the Apoxyomenos.

11
00:00:39,966 --> 00:00:43,262
We're looking at an ancient Roman copy in marble

12
00:00:43,262 --> 00:00:45,759
Of what was a Greek bronze original.

13
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:49,066
But even though it's a copy it can give us a tremendous amount of information.

14
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:53,907
Lysippos is known for having changed the proportional canon

15
00:00:53,907 --> 00:00:56,631
That we associate with the high classical tradition in Greece.

16
00:00:56,631 --> 00:00:59,544
This is the 4th century, and what Lysippos has done

17
00:00:59,544 --> 00:01:03,600
Is to elongate the body and to reduce the size of the head.

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,011
And it's very obvious when you compare this with a 5th century sculpture from the classical period by Polykleitos.

19
00:01:10,011 --> 00:01:13,199
Who was the sculptor who established that canon.

20
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:17,352
In the Doryphoros, if you look at Polykleitos' sculpture and you measure the size of the head,

21
00:01:17,352 --> 00:01:20,423
The length of the body is seven heads tall.

22
00:01:20,423 --> 00:01:23,760
But Lysippos has added a full head's worth of length,

23
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,099
So if you were to measure this, this is eight head lengths tall,

24
00:01:27,099 --> 00:01:30,759
And because the head is smaller, and the body is taller,

25
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:34,470
It gives us a sense, as we look up at this sculpture on a podium,

26
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,067
That the figure is even taller than he is.

27
00:01:37,067 --> 00:01:39,300
And Lysippos has done some other new things.

28
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:44,865
He's reached the figure's arm into space, where the figure is scraping the oil from his body,

29
00:01:44,865 --> 00:01:50,808
And by doing that he breaks out of the frontal orientation of classical sculpture

30
00:01:50,808 --> 00:01:55,466
And makes us want to move around the figure so we can see it from different directions.

31
00:01:55,466 --> 00:02:00,643
That's right. There is perhaps a fairly ideal position to view this sculpture from.

32
00:02:00,643 --> 00:02:02,587
His front left.

33
00:02:02,587 --> 00:02:05,185
But nevertheless, I can't see his chest,

34
00:02:05,185 --> 00:02:06,715
And so I do want to move around.

35
00:02:06,715 --> 00:02:11,967
Now this was a bronze originally, so that tree trunk was not there in the original sculpture.

36
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:13,357
It wasn't necessary.

37
00:02:13,357 --> 00:02:15,968
Bronze has enough tensile strength so you don't need that.

38
00:02:15,968 --> 00:02:19,096
And you can see that there's actually a fragment of a couple of bridges

39
00:02:19,096 --> 00:02:22,344
That were meant to first support the marble arms,

40
00:02:22,344 --> 00:02:24,427
Which have broken and then been repaired.

41
00:02:24,427 --> 00:02:28,040
But nevertheless, even in the original bronze I would have wanted to walk around this.

42
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,297
No question.

43
00:02:29,297 --> 00:02:33,813
But even though Lysippos is introducing these very new innovations,

44
00:02:33,813 --> 00:02:36,908
Again this change of the proportion of the body,

45
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:39,529
This breaking of the frontal plane of the sculpture,

46
00:02:39,529 --> 00:02:43,243
He's still very much embedded in the great Greek tradition

47
00:02:43,243 --> 00:02:45,589
Of representing the nude athlete.

48
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:47,531
This idealized human body,

49
00:02:47,531 --> 00:02:54,759
And of course Lysippos' figure stands in contrapposto, which was invented by the Greeks in the classical period.

50
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:59,261
It's such a gorgeous example of contrapposto, and of the body as a whole.

51
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:00,875
Look at the musculature.

52
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,758
We really feel the power of this athlete,

53
00:03:02,758 --> 00:03:06,009
Even though it's presumably now after his exercises.

54
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:10,899
From sources we hear that Lysippos was associated with Alexander the Great,

55
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:15,592
The great military leader that conquered Greece and spread Greek ideas

56
00:03:15,592 --> 00:03:17,386
Throughout the Mediterranean.

57
00:03:17,386 --> 00:03:20,011
He's said to have sculpted Alexander.

58
00:03:20,011 --> 00:03:22,507
Too bad none of those sculptures survived.

59
00:03:22,507 --> 00:03:29,741
We're seeing this sculpture in the Vatican because antiquities were treasured by Renaissance popes and subsequently.

60
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:32,963
But, of course, we're looking at a sculpture that is pagan,

61
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:37,708
And pagan in its celebration of human achievement and human beauty

62
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,427
As opposed to the spiritual.

63
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:44,543
But it is striking to see this sculpture in such a religious institution.

64
00:03:44,543 --> 00:03:49,754
And so many ancient Greek and Roman sculptures all around us here in the Vatican museum.

65
00:03:49,754 --> 00:03:54,832
One last detail, which is the room in which the sculpture is displayed,

66
00:03:54,832 --> 00:03:58,431
apparently was a room that Leonardo DaVinci occupied briefly.

67
00:03:58,431 --> 00:04:03,757
Leonardo, of course, is stepping stone back to this reverence for the body,

68
00:04:03,757 --> 00:04:06,476
Even within the Catholic tradition.
