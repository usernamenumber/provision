1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,570
   

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,210
In the last video, we learned a
little bit about aldehydes.

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:07,420
And we saw that they have the
general structure where you

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:11,370
have a carbonyl group bonded to
some type of carbon chain,

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,180
or I guess in the simplest form,
this could just be a

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,170
hydrogen over here, and then
they definitely will have at

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,760
least one hydrogen bonded to
the carbon in the carbonyl

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,290
group, so this was
an aldehyde.

9
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:26,610
Now, very closely related to
an aldehyde is a type of

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,920
molecule called a ketone.

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,380
And let's draw a couple of
ketones just to make things

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,830
clear, and then we'll think
about what the difference is

13
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,840
between a ketone and
an aldehyde.

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:44,390
So this right here, CH3, CH3,
carbon right over here.

15
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,240
This right here is a ketone.

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,570
And you say, hey, Sal,
that looks very

17
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,670
similar to an aldehyde.

18
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,900
I have a carbonyl
group in both.

19
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,830
So this right here is
a carbonyl group.

20
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:55,800
This right here is
a carbonyl group.

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,050
Let me write this: carbonyl.

22
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,390
   

23
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,650
We have a carbonyl
group in both.

24
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,280
We have a carbon chain
over here.

25
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,110
This could be a general
carbon chain here.

26
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:07,540
We have a methyl group.

27
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,160
So how is this different?

28
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,260
And I think you'll see.

29
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,960
It's this part that I haven't
highlighted yet.

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,740
In an aldehyde, there's
two ways to

31
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,510
think about an aldehyde.

32
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,250
You could either say that, look,
the carbonyl group is at

33
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,810
the end of a carbon chain.

34
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,070
So the next thing over is
going to be a hydrogen.

35
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:25,590
Or you could say that in an
aldehyde, you have at least

36
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,830
one hydrogen bonded to
the carbonyl carbon.

37
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,050
And the way I remember that, so
you have a hydrogen there,

38
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,360
and in the ketone you don't.

39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,880
The carbonyl group is embedded
in a carbon chain.

40
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,700
It is bonded to-- at least it
is bonded to a carbon on

41
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,050
either side, so over here
you have a carbon.

42
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,890
And the way that I remember the
difference, and this is

43
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,030
really just a little bit of a
mnemonic just to memorize it,

44
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,780
is aldehyde has an "h" in it.

45
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,970
There's an "h" right over there,
and an aldehyde has a

46
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,710
hydrogen bonded to
this carbon.

47
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,430
So now that we at least have a
reasonable understanding of

48
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,480
what a ketone is, let's
name a few, just

49
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,040
to familiarize ourselves.

50
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,400
So this right here is the
simplest possible ketone.

51
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,440
And it's called acetone, or
that's its common name.

52
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,320
   

53
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,280
And actually, the word ketone
comes from the German word for

54
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,550
acetone, which was I think
instead of a "c" there, they

55
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,200
had a "k," so it's
like aketone.

56
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,090
And they said, oh,
this is a ketone.

57
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,290
So this is the common name.

58
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:33,000
Another kind of traditional or
common way of naming a ketone

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,460
is to name each of these groups,
and it's kind of

60
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,000
similar to the way that
we named ethers.

61
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,930
But instead of writing the
word ether at the end, we

62
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,390
write the word ketone.

63
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,460
So here we have a methyl group,
and we have another

64
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,310
methyl group, so we have two
methyl groups right over here.

65
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,560
So this would be dimethyl
ketone.

66
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:53,730
   

67
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,450
This right here is
dimethyl ketone.

68
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,470
And then if you wanted the
systematic way of naming it,

69
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,600
you just look at the longest
carbon chain, which is one,

70
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,860
two, three carbons,
so it's prop.

71
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,100
Propa-, and instead of calling
it propane, we get rid of that

72
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,950
"e" over there and we would
call it propanone.

73
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,690
   

74
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,120
That tells us that this right
here is a ketone.

75
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,060
And you have to know where
this double bond is.

76
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,130
And actually, for propanone, you
don't have to specify it,

77
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,490
because if you know it's a
ketone, you know that it has

78
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:29,020
to have a carbon on either side
of the carbonyl group, so

79
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,520
you actually don't even have
to specify where the

80
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,940
carbonyl group is.

81
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,120
But if you wanted to, you could
say, OK, that's going to

82
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,790
be on the two carbon.

83
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,160
No matter what direction you
start counting from, it's

84
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,750
going to be on the two carbon.

85
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,720
But the two is kind of optional
for propanone.

86
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,610
   

87
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,850
Let's do a couple
of other ones.

88
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:50,910
So let's say we had a molecule
that looks like this.

89
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:57,980
   

90
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,030
So the traditional way of naming
it, you'd say, OK, on

91
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:05,780
this end of the ketone, I have
one, two, three carbons.

92
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,460
So on that end, I have
three carbons.

93
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,843
That is a propyl group.

94
00:04:08,843 --> 00:04:11,360
   

95
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,580
And on this other side of the
ketone right over here, I have

96
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,520
only one carbon.

97
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,050
That is a methyl group.

98
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,390
So then you would
just name them.

99
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:25,650
And you name then in order
of increasing chain size,

100
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,290
molecule size, or group size.

101
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,610
So this one you'd write methyl
first. Methyl, because it's

102
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,500
only one carbon.

103
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:38,930
So this is methyl
propyl ketone.

104
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,740
   

105
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,440
This is kind of the traditional
or the common way,

106
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,500
often kind of the most used way,
of naming this molecule.

107
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,660
But the systematic way of naming
it, you look at the

108
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,590
longest carbon chain and you
say, OK, I have one, two,

109
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,920
three, four, five carbons.

110
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,470
So it's going to be pent-.

111
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,630
And then you want to start
numbering it so that the

112
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,585
carbonyl carbon has the lowest
possible number.

113
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:08,920
So you want to start numbering
on the right side: one, two,

114
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,080
three, four and five.

115
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,440
So this right here, so we said
the prefix would be pent-.

116
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,200
So it's penton, and instead of
saying it's pentane, you say

117
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,450
it's pentanone.

118
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,560
   

119
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,170
And to specify where the
carbonyl group is,

120
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,570
you say it's 2.

121
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,110
This is 2-pentanone.

122
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:33,180
And you might also see
it written like this:

123
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,430
pentan-2-one.

124
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:39,590
   

125
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,880
Either one of these right here
would be acceptable.

126
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,930
Let's do a slightly more
complicated example.

127
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,650
Let's say we had something
that looked like this.

128
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:52,400
So we have something,
a molecule,

129
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,390
that looks like this.

130
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,360
And let me stick some
chlorines over here.

131
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,600
So what would this be?

132
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,850
Well, our longest chain, once
again, is this cyclohexane:

133
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:06,360
one, two, three, four,
five, six carbons.

134
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,310
And I'll just name this
systematically right here.

135
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,870
And the more complicated
things get, the more

136
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,850
systematic people will
want to name it.

137
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,360
So if we have six carbons right
here, and they're in a

138
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,740
chain, so this is cyclohexane.

139
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,170
   

140
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,970
You'd put the "e" there
if this carbonyl

141
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,060
group wasn't there.

142
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:30,300
But since it is, we would call
this cyclohexanone, So this

143
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,360
right here tells us to name
it cyclohexanone.

144
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,340
And then in a ring like this,
this would implicitly be the

145
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,530
number one carbon.

146
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:42,660
So if this is the number one
carbon and we want to number

147
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,150
in the direction so that the
next groups have the lowest

148
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,060
possible number, so we want to
make this the two carbon.

149
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,310
So this is
2,2-dichlorocyclohexanone.

150
00:06:49,310 --> 00:07:03,310
   

151
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,825
Now, there's two more.

152
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:07,590
And I'll just show these to you
because these tend to be

153
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,170
referred to by their
common names.

154
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:13,630
So I just want to show them to
you real fast. One is this

155
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,580
molecule right here, where
we have a methyl group

156
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,450
on this side: CH3.

157
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,260
And over here, we have
a benzene ring.

158
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:26,740
   

159
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,940
Now, that first super simple
ketone that we saw, we called

160
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,440
this acetone.

161
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,570
And so the common name here is
actually derived from acetone.

162
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,630
Instead of calling it acetone,
because it doesn't have just a

163
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:44,040
methyl group here, this is
called aceto-, and instead of

164
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:49,170
acetone, it's acetophenone,
because we have this phenyl

165
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,610
group, that benzene
ring right there.

166
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:56,200
Acetophenone, which is a pretty
common molecule, and

167
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,480
you'll see it referred
to this way.

168
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,800
Now, the other one that you
might see every now and then,

169
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,120
and I just want to expose it
to you, is a molecule that

170
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,870
looks like this, that has
two benzene rings on it.

171
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:13,475
   

172
00:08:13,475 --> 00:08:15,840
It looks like that.

173
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,305
And this is benzophenone.

174
00:08:17,305 --> 00:08:22,780
   

175
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,290
These last two I just really
wanted to expose you to their

176
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:25,990
common names.

177
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,700
But, in general, I think you
have a decent idea at this

178
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:32,049
point of how to name at least
the simpler chains, either

179
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:35,400
with the common names, for
example, propyl, or methyl

180
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,059
propyl ketone, or 2-pentanone.

181
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,690
And these are the more
typical or maybe the

182
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,030
easier naming examples.

183
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:43,267
