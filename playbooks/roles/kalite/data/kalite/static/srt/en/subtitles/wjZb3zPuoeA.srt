1
00:00:01,267 --> 00:00:06,000
What I want to do in this video is show you a very cool video, then pose a question.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,667
But I want to make sure that everything is up and up,

3
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:10,867
in terms of the copyright laws.

4
00:00:10,867 --> 00:00:14,000
So the video I want to show you is from the show called the fifth gear,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
that appears on channel 5, I believe in the United Kingdom.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,667
I think I'm okay on good copyright grounds to claim

7
00:00:21,667 --> 00:00:23,159
fair use here, because

8
00:00:23,159 --> 00:00:26,164
obviously the point of this is I'm going to ask a math question

9
00:00:26,164 --> 00:00:28,185
about the vide were going to see

10
00:00:28,185 --> 00:00:28,685
and so fair use

11
00:00:28,685 --> 00:00:29,185
laws

12
00:00:29,185 --> 00:00:31,108
the purpose and character of use

13
00:00:31,108 --> 00:00:34,708
including whether such a commercial nature or non profit educational

14
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:36,933
purposes we're definitely the later

15
00:00:36,933 --> 00:00:39,067
non profit educational purposes

16
00:00:39,067 --> 00:00:40,533
we are actually

17
00:00:40,533 --> 00:00:43,667
we aren't trying to in any way replace the work being used

18
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:47,133
I'm just going to show a little snippet of it

19
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:49,836
so we can use it as the basis for a problem

20
00:00:49,836 --> 00:00:52,533
this is kinda the meat of fair use law

21
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:56,200
the viewer may fairly cite from the original work if it is

22
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,200
design if his design be really and truly to use the passages

23
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,600
for the purposes for fair and reasonable criticism

24
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,708
in this case

25
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:06,867
it's fair and reasonable math problem or physics problem

26
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:12,267
on the other hand it is as clear he thus cites the most important parts of the work. with the view not to criticize

27
00:01:12,267 --> 00:01:14,933
but to supercede the

28
00:01:14,933 --> 00:01:16,733
the use of the original work and substitute

29
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:18,333
the review for it

30
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:21,667
such a use will be deemed in law a piracy

31
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:26,333
so in no way do I want to supersede it. You should go look it up, go watch the show.

32
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:27,933
this is not good enough

33
00:01:27,933 --> 00:01:29,667
I don't even have the sound on

34
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:31,600
it's going to be a small window over here

35
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,400
where I'm just going to show this

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,533
really really

37
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:36,267
the part where they actually do a loop

38
00:01:36,267 --> 00:01:37,067
de loop.

39
00:01:37,067 --> 00:01:39,200
now with that out of the way

40
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,733
this is where you can find more about fifth gear

41
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:43,533
which is on channel 5

42
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:46,067
so now let me show you the video

43
00:01:46,067 --> 00:01:49,600
I'm going to have the sound down and so this is the video over here

44
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,800
this is a pretty neat video

45
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,067
this guy is going to try to do a loop de loop and he's actually going to succeed

46
00:01:55,067 --> 00:01:56,533
at doing the loop de loop

47
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,200
and what I want you to do, the question I want to pose

48
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,933
is look at this video

49
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:03,467
and get a stop watch out

50
00:02:03,467 --> 00:02:05,733
or whatever else you need out a ruler whatever else you might need to do

51
00:02:05,733 --> 00:02:07,200
and try to figure out what

52
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,067
we're going to try to figure out two things

53
00:02:10,067 --> 00:02:12,200
we're going to find out the minimum velocity the car needs to do the

54
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,467
loop de loop

55
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,667
and we're also going to try to figure out what his actual velocity was

56
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:19,133
over the course of the loop de loop

57
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:21,333
so let's actually just watch this video

58
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,267
so there he goes

59
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,333
he's starting

60
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:24,267
he's accelerating

61
00:02:24,267 --> 00:02:25,000
it looks like he's

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,600
just crossed

63
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,867
he's pushing almost forty miles an hour

64
00:02:28,867 --> 00:02:31,200
at least I'm assuming that's miles per hour

65
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,533
this is a British show

66
00:02:32,533 --> 00:02:34,133
and then he

67
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:35,667
hits

68
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:38,867
the loop de loop

69
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,400
and then he finishes it

70
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,800
and he's done

71
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,000
so let's think about for the next video

72
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,533
let's think about if we can figure out what the minimum

73
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:51,733
what the minimum velocity or i should say the magnitude of the velocity

74
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:53,267
or the speed had to be

75
00:02:53,267 --> 00:02:53,767
to actually

76
00:02:53,767 --> 00:02:57,533
complete the loop right over here and then we can actually get a stopwatch later on to

77
00:02:57,533 --> 99:59:59,999
see what his actall velocity was
