1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,750
   

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:04,250
Let's review what we went over
in the last video, and one of

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,010
you all actually commented that
it would be a good idea

4
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:06,950
to draw a timeline.

5
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,780
So I'll draw a timeline.

6
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,080
Short.

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,740
So we're learning about
short selling.

8
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,150
And in the last example-- let
me do the timeline where

9
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,060
things work out well for
the short seller.

10
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,910
So let me draw the stock
price of IBM.

11
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:27,410
Let me make this its--
OK, here we go.

12
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,970
So let's say that this is-- that
could be our timeline,

13
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,000
it's by day.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,170
Let me draw the stock of IBM, it
could look something like--

15
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,030
that's my y-axis.

16
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,800
Let's say the stock right now
is at $100, it's trading

17
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,260
someplace like that.

18
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,900
And let's say it does
that later, right?

19
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,910
But we're sitting at this
point right here-- we're

20
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,980
sitting at, let's
call this day 0.

21
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,600
   

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,130
So what does the short
seller do?

23
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,870
So let's say the short seller,
right now-- let me see if I

24
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,270
can draw his balance sheet.

25
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,959
So right now, the short seller,
he has assets and

26
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,209
liabilities.

27
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:13,130
   

28
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,100
His assets-- I won't worry about
collateral requirements

29
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,050
and all of that right now.

30
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,560
But usually he already has to
have some assets ahead of time

31
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,890
for him to be able
to borrow shares.

32
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,400
But, actually-- let
me give him some

33
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,250
collateral ahead of time.

34
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:32,430
So let's say that he already
has $60 in his account.

35
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,320
He has $60 of assets on day 0.

36
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,210
And then this is the day that
he says, you know what?

37
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,560
I've done my analysis and I
think IBM-- he doesn't see

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,400
this part of the stock price,
I mean, it would

39
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,200
be great if he did.

40
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,710
Then you could short
with conviction.

41
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,440
But all he sees is
the past, right?

42
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,450
If he did a stock chart he would
just see-- let me switch

43
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,220
colors-- he would just see this
green part right here.

44
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,000
He wouldn't see all the stuff
that's in the future.

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,480
But he has a lot of conviction
that IBM is going to go down.

46
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,230
So what he does is, he borrows
a share of IBM on that day.

47
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,690
So then on this day he
borrows one share.

48
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:11,480
So he has-- let's call
that IBM-- one IBM.

49
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,970
And he also owes one IBM.

50
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,160
   

51
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,890
Right?

52
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,070
Right after you borrow it,
before you do anything into

53
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,810
it, you have it as an asset,
and you also owe it back.

54
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,900
And if you wanted unwind the
borrowing of it, you could

55
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,070
just give it back.

56
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:31,440
But what he does at this point
is he sells this IBM.

57
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,530
He sells that share and
he gets $100 for it.

58
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,880
Because that was just
the market price.

59
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,010
That's what people were willing
to trade IBM shares

60
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,660
for at that point in time.

61
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,350
That's day 0.

62
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,690
Then let's say IBM reports
its earnings, and

63
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,880
they're really bad.

64
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,750
And that happened on, I
don't know, probably

65
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,230
happened on this day.

66
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,480
IBM reports.

67
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,460
   

68
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,710
And the stock tends to
go down, down, down.

69
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,300
People take a long time
to realize how

70
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,380
bad the report was.

71
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,200
And here at this day, once the
stock has reached $50, our

72
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,150
short seller says OK,
that's enough.

73
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,140
I don't think the stock's going
to drop a lot more.

74
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,640
So on day-- let's call
this day 10.

75
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,360
10 days have gone by.

76
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,740
Day 10, he decides to cover.

77
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,710
So going into day 10, this
is his balance sheet--

78
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,630
let me redraw it.

79
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,630
So going in to day 10,
what does he have?

80
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,900
He has $160.

81
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,290
The $60 he had before, just
by actually working.

82
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:37,330
And he owes-- this is his asset,
and his liabilities is

83
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:41,010
he owes one share of
IBM to the broker.

84
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,560
And the broker really owes it to
one of the shareholders of

85
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,760
IBM who happened to be keeping
the share with the broker.

86
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,170
And he wants to cover.

87
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:55,510
So what he does is, he takes
$100-- no, no sorry, he

88
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,360
doesn't take $100.

89
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,630
Now shares of IBM only
cost $50, right?

90
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:05,220
So he takes $50 to buy a
share, to buy one IBM.

91
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,730
   

92
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,200
So instead of $160, he
now has $110 and he

93
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,510
has a share of IBM.

94
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,650
And then what he does is, he
takes this share of IBM and

95
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,480
then gives it to the brokerage
to pay off his liability.

96
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,430
So then he's done.

97
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:24,090
He's left with no liabilities,
and just $110 of assets.

98
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,620
So he made $50.

99
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,730
So hopefully that clarifies it
up a little bit, in that he

100
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,530
sold here, and bought here.

101
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,770
It's the reverse of a lot of
stock, it's almost like you're

102
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,290
acting in reverse time.

103
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,020
But this was a very good
scenario for the short seller.

104
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,630
But he very easily could
have made a blunder.

105
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:45,790
Let's see what could have been
a blunderous scenario.

106
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,610
Let me draw a different
stock chart for IBM.

107
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,350
   

108
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,390
So let me draw the stock up to
the day in question, and we

109
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,570
said it was looking something
like this, where it was

110
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,640
trading right at around $100.

111
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,906
And this is the day that our
short seller decides to short

112
00:05:02,906 --> 00:05:04,280
it, and this happens.

113
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:04,820
Right?

114
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,380
He essentially borrows
a share of IBM.

115
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,730
So he has a one IBM
share liability.

116
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,980
He sells that share and
he collects $100.

117
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:20,805
And then let's say IBM reports
on this day, so this is day 0.

118
00:05:20,805 --> 00:05:23,010
Now IBM reports, and it's
actually great.

119
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,700
They did way better than anyone
could have expected.

120
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,370
So then the IBM shares
skyrocket, and

121
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,565
they go to this level.

122
00:05:29,565 --> 00:05:33,290
And at this point this-- and
I'll talk more about short

123
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,680
psychology and short squeezing,
and all that-- but

124
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,640
maybe here he's like, oh no,
this is just a temporary blip,

125
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,260
let me keep holding
my position.

126
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,680
But then the stock keeps going
up and up and he says oh, this

127
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,250
is just temporary, it's
going to go back down.

128
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,240
But at some point, his tolerance
for pain has been

129
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,060
tapped out.

130
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,790
And let's say IBM
gets to $150.

131
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,730
He says, I can't handle
this anymore.

132
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,820
And I think you're already
noticing a very negative

133
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,570
dynamic or a highly risky
dynamic that occurs with

134
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,630
shorts, is that you can lose an
arbitrary amount of money.

135
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,690
Because what's happening now?

136
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,450
Let's say he wants to
cover it right now.

137
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:08,090
This is day 10 in this
alternate universe.

138
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:12,690
So now, what are his assets
and his liabilities?

139
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:17,910
Going in to day 10, his asset,
we said, was $160.

140
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,690
Because he had short
sold, he had $160.

141
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,660
But he owes one share of IBM.

142
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,860
   

143
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,000
For him to unwind this, to pay
back the share of IBM, what

144
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,390
does he have to do?

145
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,670
He has to go out into the market
and buy a share of IBM

146
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,790
at this higher price, at $150.

147
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:41,000
So when he goes out, instead of
$160 he has to use 100-- so

148
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,640
he has $10-- and then he uses
$150 of that to go buy-- $150

149
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,520
of the $160 to buy
a share of IBM.

150
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,920
So then he gets a
share of IBM.

151
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,520
And then he can pay that share
back to the broker and cancel

152
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,600
out his position.

153
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,250
And he's left with just $10.

154
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,080
So in this scenario when
the stock price rose by

155
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,840
$50, he lost $50.

156
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:15,850
So he sold low and then
he bought high, right?

157
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,390
And the really risky thing that
maybe is apparent to you

158
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,640
now about short selling
is that his loss

159
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,280
could have been infinite.

160
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,030
What if IBM, instead of going to
$150, what if went to $200?

161
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:28,060
Then he would have lost $200--
if it went to $200, he would

162
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,900
have lost $100.

163
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,230
If it went to $300, he
would have lost $200.

164
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:36,220
So his loss isn't just
the amount of the

165
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,370
original short position.

166
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,620
It isn't just the $100 or
whatever the original

167
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,730
price of IBM was.

168
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:45,190
It can be an infinite amount,
so it really can kill your

169
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:45,730
balance sheet.

170
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,180
Or really make you broke.

171
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,190
While when you go in the long
side of things, if I were to

172
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,130
buy IBM here.

173
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:55,910
Let's say I'm the guy that
bought this share from the

174
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:56,900
short seller.

175
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,260
What's my worst case scenario?

176
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,740
Well the worst thing I can have
happen is that the share

177
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,890
of IBM goes to 0.

178
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,800
So my loss is really,
I can just go to 0.

179
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,480
I won't end up owing someone an
infinite amount of money.

180
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,870
So short selling, inherently,
because of this infinite, you

181
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,880
could say downside to the
short seller, right?

182
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,070
They can lose an infinite
amount of money.

183
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,370
They have to be really careful
about how they make their

184
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,760
positions and how they protect
themselves from this

185
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,740
eventuality.

186
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,610
And we'll talk a little bit
about things like margin

187
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,100
requirements and things like
that in the future, that

188
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:33,260
essentially make sure-- are
the broker's way of making

189
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:39,080
sure that the short seller can
actually-- is good to buy back

190
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,039
the shares.

191
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,419
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
