1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,940
   

2
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,310
After all the work we've been
doing with fluids, you

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,670
probably have a pretty good
sense of what pressure is.

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,110
Now let's think a little bit
about what it really means,

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,910
especially when we think
about it in terms

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,040
of a gas in a volume.

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,070
Remember, what was
the difference

8
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,440
between a gas and a liquid?

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,590
They're both fluids, they both
take the shape of their

10
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,070
containers, but a gas is
compressible, while a liquid

11
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,230
is incompressible.

12
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,680
Let's start focusing on gases.

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:39,120
Let's say I have a container,
and I have a

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,830
bunch of gas in it.

15
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,430
What is a gas made of?

16
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,190
It's just made up of a whole
bunch of the molecules of the

17
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,860
gas itself, and I'll draw each
of the molecules with a little

18
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,620
dot-- it's just going to have
a bunch of molecules in it.

19
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,770
There's many, many, many more
than what I've drawn, but

20
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,090
that's indicative, and they'll
all be going in random

21
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,440
directions-- this one might be
going really fast in that

22
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,349
direction, and that one might
be going a little bit slower

23
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,220
in that direction.

24
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,130
They all have their own little
velocity vectors, and they're

25
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,970
always constantly bumping into
each other, and bumping into

26
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,510
the sides of the container, and
ricocheting here and there

27
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,030
and changing velocity.

28
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,250
In general, especially at this
level of physics, we assume

29
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:26,410
that this is an ideal gas, that
all of the bumps that

30
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,040
occur, there's no
loss of energy.

31
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,710
Or essentially that they're all
elastic bumps between the

32
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,540
different molecules.

33
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,620
There's no loss of momentum.

34
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,280
Let's keep that in mind, and
everything you're going to see

35
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,280
in high school and on the AP
test is going to deal with

36
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,560
ideal gases.

37
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,400
Let's think about what pressure

38
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,740
means in this context.

39
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,530
   

40
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,350
A lot of what we think about
pressure is something pushing

41
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,110
on an area.

42
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,930
If we think about pressure
here-- let's pick

43
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:57,840
an arbitrary area.

44
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,770
Let's take this side.

45
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:05,295
Let's take this surface
of its container.

46
00:02:05,295 --> 00:02:09,870
   

47
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,940
Where's the pressure
going to be

48
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,540
generated onto this surface?

49
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,660
It's going to be generated by
just the millions and billions

50
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,040
and trillions of little
bumps every time-- let

51
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,850
me draw a side view.

52
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:27,160
If this is the side view of the
container, that same side,

53
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,590
every second there's always
these little molecules of gas

54
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,720
moving around.

55
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,930
If we pick an arbitrary period
of time, they're always

56
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,380
ricocheting off of the side.

57
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,200
   

58
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,000
We're looking at time over a
super-small fraction of time.

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,790
And over that period of time,
this one might end up here,

60
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:54,750
this one maybe bumped into it
right after it ricocheted and

61
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,400
came here, this one changes
momentum and goes like that.

62
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,140
This one might have already been
going in that direction,

63
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,640
and that one might ricochet.

64
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,280
But what's happening is, at
any given moment, since

65
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,760
there's so many molecules,
there's always going to be

66
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,190
some molecules that
are bumping into

67
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,960
the side of the wall.

68
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,275
When they bump, they have
a change in momentum.

69
00:03:18,275 --> 00:03:21,520
   

70
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,900
All force is change in
momentum over time.

71
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,960
   

72
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,410
What I'm saying is that in any
interval of time, over any

73
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,070
period or any change in time,
there's just going to be a

74
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:41,910
bunch of particles that are
changing their momentum on the

75
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,500
side of this wall.

76
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,250
That is going to generate force,
and so if we think

77
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,560
about how many on average--
because it's hard to keep

78
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,720
track of each particle
individually, and when we did

79
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,670
kinematics and stuff, we'd keep
track of the individual

80
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,460
object at play.

81
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,780
But when we're dealing with
gases and things on a macro

82
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,280
level, you can't keep track of
any individual one, unless you

83
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,830
have some kind of unbelievable
supercomputer.

84
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:14,490
We can say, on average, this
many particles are changing

85
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,240
momentum on this wall in
this amount of time.

86
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,890
And so the force exerted on this
wall or this surface is

87
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,670
going to be x.

88
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,910
If we know what that force is,
and we you know the area of

89
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:30,090
the wall, we can figure out
pressure, because pressure is

90
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:36,560
equal to force divided
by area.

91
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,110
What does this help us with?

92
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,150
I wanted to give you that
intuition first, and now I'm

93
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:49,710
just going to give you the one
formula that you really just

94
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,970
need to know in thermodynamics.

95
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:56,430
And then as we go into the next
few videos, I'll prove to

96
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,750
you why it works, and
hopefully give

97
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,700
you more of an intuition.

98
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,230
Now you understand, hopefully,
what pressure means in the

99
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,610
context of a gas
in a container.

100
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:09,910
With that out of the way, let
me give you a formula.

101
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,890
I hope by the end of this video
you have the intuition

102
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,520
for why this formula works.

103
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,490
In general, if I have an ideal
gas in a container, the

104
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:23,630
pressure exerted on the gas-- on
the side of the container,

105
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,910
or actually even at any point
within the gas, because it

106
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,000
will all become homogeneous at
some point-- and we'll talk

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,160
about entropy in future videos--
but the pressure in

108
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,920
the container and on its
surface, times the volume of

109
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,820
the container, is equal
to some constant.

110
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,230
We'll see in future videos that
that constant is actually

111
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:48,830
proportional to the average
kinetic energy of the

112
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,100
molecules bouncing around.

113
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,240
That should make sense to you.

114
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,495
If the molecules were moving
around a lot faster, then you

115
00:05:56,495 --> 00:05:58,400
would have more kinetic energy,
and then they would be

116
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,880
changing momentum on the sides
of the surface a lot more, so

117
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,930
you would have more pressure.

118
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,780
Let's see if we can get a little
bit more intuition onto

119
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,185
why pressure times volume
is a constant.

120
00:06:09,185 --> 00:06:18,900
   

121
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:24,180
Let's say I have a container
now, and it's got a bunch of

122
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,640
molecules of gas in it.

123
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,850
   

124
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:32,190
Just like I showed you in that
last bit right before I

125
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,260
erased, these are bouncing
off of the sides

126
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,510
at a certain rate.

127
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:41,390
   

128
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,950
Each of the molecules might
have a different kinetic

129
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,160
energy-- it's always changing,
because they're always

130
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,960
transferring momentum
to each other.

131
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,030
But on average, they all have
a given kinetic energy, they

132
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:52,420
keep bumping at a certain rate
into the wall, and that

133
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,880
determines the pressure.

134
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,920
What happens if I were able to
squeeze the box, and if I were

135
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:03,860
able to decrease the
volume of the box?

136
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,310
   

137
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,910
I just take that same box with
the same number of molecules

138
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,470
in it, but I squeeze.

139
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,460
I make the volume of
the box smaller--

140
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,940
what's going to happen?

141
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:22,110
I have the same number of
molecules in there, with the

142
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,890
same kinetic energy, and on
average, they're moving with

143
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:26,830
the same velocities.

144
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,300
So now what's going to happen?

145
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,150
They're going to be hitting the
sides more often-- at the

146
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:36,370
same time here that this
particle went bam, bam, now it

147
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,680
could go bam, bam, bam.

148
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,400
They're going to be hitting
the sides more often, so

149
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,280
you're going to have more
changes in momentum, and so

150
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,550
you're actually going to have
each particle exert more force

151
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,130
on each surface.

152
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,250
Because it's going to be hitting
them more often in a

153
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,510
given amount of time.

154
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,350
The surfaces themselves
are smaller.

155
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,540
You have more force on a
surface, and on a smaller

156
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,170
surface, you're going to
have higher pressure.

157
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,060
Hopefully, that gives you an
intuition that if I had some

158
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,900
amount of pressure in this
situation-- if I squeeze the

159
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,190
volume, the pressure
increases.

160
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,750
Another intuition-- if
I have a balloon,

161
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,940
what blows up a balloon?

162
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:18,830
It's the internal air pressure
of the helium, or your own

163
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,320
exhales that you put
into the balloon.

164
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,000
The more and more you try to
squeeze a balloon-- if you

165
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,580
squeeze it from all directions,
it gets harder and

166
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,040
harder to do it, and that's
because the pressure within

167
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:35,289
the balloon increases as you
decrease the volume.

168
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:41,480
If volume goes down, pressure
goes up, and that makes sense.

169
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,669
That follows that when they
multiply each other, you have

170
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:45,130
to have a constant.

171
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,050
Let's take the same example
again, and what happens if you

172
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,190
make the volume bigger?

173
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:56,340
Let's say I have-- it's huge
like that, and I should have

174
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,890
done it more proportionally, but
I think you get the idea.

175
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,090
You have the same number of
particles, and if I had a

176
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,740
particle here, in some period
of time it could have gone

177
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,930
bam, bam, bam-- it could have
hit the walls twice.

178
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,420
Now, in this situation, with
larger walls, it might just go

179
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,300
bam, and in that same amount
of time, it will maybe get

180
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,150
here and won't even hit
the other wall.

181
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,670
The particles, on average, are
going to be colliding with the

182
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,600
wall less often, and the walls
are going to have a larger

183
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,390
area, as well.

184
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:29,860
So in this case, when our volume
goes up, the average

185
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:35,520
pressure or the pressure in
the container goes down.

186
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,560
Hopefully, that gives you a
little intuition, and so

187
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,970
you'll never forget
that pressure

188
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,200
times volume is constant.

189
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,590
And then we can use that to do
some pretty common problems,

190
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,110
which I'll do in
the next video.

191
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:46,917
I'm about to run out of time.

192
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:48,167
See you soon.

193
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:48,900
