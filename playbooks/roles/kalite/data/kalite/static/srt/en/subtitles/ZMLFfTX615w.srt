1
00:00:00,933 --> 00:00:08,298
Multiply (3x+2) by (5x-7). So we are multiplying two binomials. I am actually going to show you

2
00:00:08,298 --> 00:00:13,600
two really equivalent ways of doing this. One that you might hear in a classroom and it is kind of a more mechanical

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,533
memorizing way of doing it which might be faster but you really don't know what you are doing

4
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:21,600
and then there is the one where you are essentially just applying something what you already know

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,933
and kind of a logical way. So I will first do the memorizing way that you might be exposed to and they'll use something called FOIL.

6
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:35,933
So let me write this down here. So you can immediately see that whenever someone gives you

7
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:41,200
a new mnemonic to memorize, that you are doing something pretty mechanical. So FOIL literally stands for

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:56,733
First Outside, let me write it this way.....F O I L where the F in FOIL stands for First, the O in FOIL stand for Outside,

9
00:00:56,733 --> 00:01:03,800
the I stands for Inside and then the L stands for Last. The reason why I don't like these things

10
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,067
is that when you are 35 years old, you are not going to remember what FOIL stood for and

11
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,733
then you are not going to remember how to multiply this binomial. But lets just apply FOIL.

12
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:20,333
So First says just multiply the first terms in each of these binomials. So just multiply the 3x times the 5x.

13
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:27,800
So (3x. 5x). The Outside part tells us to multiply the outside terms. So in this case, you have

14
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:38,533
3x on the outside and you have -7 on the outside. So that is +3x(-7). The inside,

15
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:53,800
well the inside terms here are 2 and 5x. So, (+2.5x) and then finally you have the last terms. You have the 2 and the -7.

16
00:01:53,800 --> 00:02:00,867
So the last terms are 2 times -7. 2(-7). So what you are essentially doing is just making sure

17
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:06,867
that you are multipying each term by every other term here. What we are essentially doing is multiplying,

18
00:02:06,867 --> 00:02:17,267
doing the distributive property twice. We are multiplying the 3x times (5x-7). So 3x times (5x-7) is (3x . 5x) plus (3x - 7).

19
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:20,933
And we are multiplying the 2 times (5x-7) to give us these terms.

20
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:28,600
But anyway, lets just multiply these out just to get our answer. 3x times 5x is same thing as (3 times 5) ( x times x)

21
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:34,867
which is the same thing as 15x square. You can just do this x to the first time to x to the first.

22
00:02:34,867 --> 00:02:43,533
You multiply the x to get x squared. 3 times 5 is 15. This term right here 3 times -7 is -21

23
00:02:43,533 --> 00:02:51,800
and then you have your x right over here. And then you have this term which is 2 times 5 which is 10 times x. So +10x.

24
00:02:52,046 --> 00:03:01,267
And then finally you have this term here in blue. 2 times -7 is -14. And we aren't done yet,

25
00:03:01,267 --> 00:03:08,667
we can simplify this a little bit. We have two like terms here. We have this...let me find a new color.

26
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:17,733
We have 2 terms with a x to the first power or just an x term right over here. So we have -21 of something and you add 10

27
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:24,600
or in another way, you have 10 of something and you subtract 21 of them, you are going to have -11 of that something.

28
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:34,800
We put the other terms here, you have 15... 15x squared and then you have your -14 and we are done.

29
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,000
Now I said I would show you another way to do it. I want to show you why the

30
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,267
distributive property can get us here without having to memorize FOIL.

31
00:03:42,267 --> 00:03:47,533
So the distributive property tells us that if we 're... look if we are multipying something times an expression, you just have to multiply

32
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:56,067
times every term in the expression. So we can distribute, we can distribute the 5x onto the 3...,

33
00:03:56,067 --> 00:04:05,733
or actually we could...well, let me view it this way... we could distribute the 5x-7, this whole thing onto the 3x+2.

34
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:10,200
Let me just change the order since we are used to distributing something from the left.

35
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:19,267
So this is the same thing as (5x-7)(3x+2). I just swapped the two expressions. And we can distribute this whole thing

36
00:04:19,267 --> 00:04:25,667
times each of these terms. Now what happens if I take (5x-7) times 3x? Well, thats just going

37
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:38,718
to be 3x times (5x-7). So I have just distributed the 5x-7 times 3x and to that I am going to add 2 times 5x-7.

38
00:04:38,718 --> 00:04:42,138
I have just distributed the 5x-7 onto the 2.

39
00:04:42,138 --> 00:04:46,600
Now, you can do the distributive property again. We can distribute the

40
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,667
3x onto the 5x. We can distribute the 3x onto the 5x.

41
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:55,400
And we can distribute the 3x onto the -7.

42
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,267
We can distribute the 2 onto the 5x, over here

43
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:04,267
and we can distribute the 2 on that -7.

44
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:08,000
Now if we do it like this what do we get ?

45
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:16,667
3x times 5x, that's this right over here. If we do 3x times -7, that's this term right over here.

46
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:25,600
If you do 2 times 5x, that's this term right over here. If you do 2 times -7, that is this term right

47
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,067
over here. So we got the exact same result that we got with FOIL.

48
00:05:29,067 --> 00:05:33,667
Now, FOIL can be faster if you just wanted to do it and kind of skip to this step.

49
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:37,667
I think its important that you know that this is how it actually works.

50
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:43,267
Just in case you do forget this when you are 35 or 45 years old and you are faced with multiplying binomial,

51
00:05:43,267 --> 99:59:59,999
you just have to remember the distributive property.
