00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,243
In the last video we studied a super simplified economy that only sold one good or service.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,668
But now let's think about things a little bit more generally a little bit, you know, more complex economies.

3
00:00:11,668 --> 00:00:17,319
And let's say that in year one economists have determined

4
00:00:17,319 --> 00:00:24,570
that the level of prices of goods and services produced in that economy is a 100.

5
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:28,660
So they've esencially just multiplied and divided it by right numbers

6
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,431
so that their index that they generate just says that is 100.

7
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:34,916
And they do this so that they can measure the prices

8
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:37,882
in other years relative to year one.

9
00:00:37,882 --> 00:00:43,325
So let's say in year two using their index,

10
00:00:43,325 --> 00:00:47,944
they realise that prices are now 110.

11
00:00:47,944 --> 00:00:50,280
Now this is not a simple thing to do.

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,475
This would have been a very simple thing to do if there was only one good

13
00:00:53,475 --> 00:00:56,848
or service in the economy, like our last example - apples.

14
00:00:56,848 --> 00:01:01,189
You could have just taken the price of apples that went from 50 cents to 55 cents.

15
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:05,808
In real world this is not a simple thing to do. You have gazillion goods and services.

16
00:01:05,808 --> 00:01:08,889
Some prices go up, some prices go down.

17
00:01:08,889 --> 00:01:11,569
The quantities of the goods and services change in fact.

18
00:01:11,569 --> 00:01:16,291
They might be goods and services that are offered in year one but don't exist any more in year two

19
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:19,816
There are goods and services in year two that didn't exist in year one.

20
00:01:19,816 --> 00:01:23,645
But for the sake of this video let's just assume that economists are able to say this

21
00:01:23,645 --> 00:01:26,854
If you call the generell level of prices a 100 in year one

22
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:32,991
it's now a 110 or in other way that think about there're things of gotten 10 % more expensive.

23
00:01:32,991 --> 00:01:37,655
Now if we assuming that we had we know this relationship it's one again it's an easy thing

24
00:01:37,655 --> 00:01:41,989
to figure out and it actually turns out there is no perfect way to do this

25
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:46,999
How can we figure out the relationship between real GDP and nominal GDP?

26
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:52,588
And remember whenever we talk about real GDP so we talk about real GDP in year two

27
00:01:52,588 --> 00:01:57,125
So real GDP in year two.

28
00:01:57,125 --> 00:02:03,227
Whatever you talk about real GDP you're talking about GDP in terms of the prices in some base year.

29
00:02:03,227 --> 00:02:11,498
So in this example we think about real GDP in year two in terms of year one dollars.

30
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:16,174
So whatever were goods and services that we produced in year two,

31
00:02:16,174 --> 00:02:20,448
we're going to think about, what if they were in the same prices as in year one.

32
00:02:20,448 --> 00:02:23,726
That would give us the real GDP in year two.

33
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:26,704
So one what we think about it really just a ratio

34
00:02:26,704 --> 00:02:30,693
So the ratio, so let's me write, nominal GDP,

35
00:02:30,693 --> 00:02:35,109
so this is GDP in year two measured in year two dollars,

36
00:02:35,109 --> 00:02:39,746
devided by, I guess we call this as proportion really,

37
00:02:39,746 --> 00:02:53,491
devided by a real GDP in year two and is measured in year one dollars.

38
00:02:53,524 --> 00:02:59,060
Well, that's going to be the same thing as the ratio of the prices between year two and year one.

39
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:08,337
This is going to be the ratio of, we use the syndicate right over here, 110 to 100.

40
00:03:08,352 --> 00:03:10,809
I want you to sitting thing about this for second.

41
00:03:10,809 --> 00:03:14,563
It's just saying "Look, the same goods, these are measuring the same goods and services

42
00:03:14,563 --> 00:03:22,522
The real GDP is mesauring them in year one prices. The nominal GDP is mesauring them in year two prices.

43
00:03:22,522 --> 00:03:26,257
So things got 10 % more expensive between year one and year two.

44
00:03:26,257 --> 00:03:29,724
The nominal GDP should be 10 % larger than real GDP.

45
00:03:29,724 --> 00:03:32,058
We should have in exactly same ratios.

46
00:03:32,058 --> 00:03:36,063
And now we can manipuliate this thing using any type of algebra that we want.

47
00:03:36,063 --> 00:03:44,474
For example we could say "Well, nominal GDP not that's right nominal now, but this is right a kind of specify that exaclly we're talking about

48
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,191
This is a nominal GDP of year two

49
00:03:47,191 --> 00:03:54,977
So now we could say nominal GDP is equal to we can multiplay boatsides times that's the real GDP.

50
00:03:54,977 --> 00:04:04,794
It's equal to 110 over 100 times the real GDP.

51
00:04:04,824 --> 00:04:12,724
Remember it's real GDP in year two measured in year one dollars.

52
00:04:12,724 --> 00:04:19,200
Or we can measure, we can devide, we can devide boatsides of this equation by this 110 over 100

53
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:40,270
and then we get nominal GDP in year two devided by 110 is egual to real GDP.

54
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:45,597
This is nominal GDP in year two.

55
00:04:45,597 --> 00:04:50,263
And writing in this way the kind of feels like you're taking nominal GDP in year two

56
00:04:50,263 --> 00:04:53,667
and prices have increased, there would be the generall increase in the level od prices

57
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:57,921
that's cold price infaltion. We see that right over here and now we're deflating it

58
00:04:57,921 --> 00:05:02,857
to get real GDP. We're dividing it by the ratio of the prices.

59
00:05:02,857 --> 00:05:05,789
We're dividing it esencially by how much the prices have gone.

60
00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:09,524
I guess that's say the ratio between the year two prices and year one prices.

61
00:05:09,524 --> 00:05:13,425
This quantity right over here is 1.1

62
00:05:13,425 --> 00:05:17,836
So another way you could think we're deflating the nominal GDP in year two

63
00:05:17,836 --> 00:05:26,009
to get the real GDP in year two or getting it in, remember this is in year one prices.

64
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:33,476
And because od that this number right over here, this number right over here is refered to as the deflator

65
00:05:33,476 --> 00:05:38,546
This is our GDP deflator.

66
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:47,318
You pick up base year and in this case was year one that base year could be 1985 it could be 2006, and also it could be anything.

67
00:05:47,318 --> 00:05:50,632
Your GDP deflator is going to be relative to that base year.

68
00:05:50,632 --> 00:05:56,145
Well, that base year was a 100, your deflator, was gonna say, how much things are now in this year?

69
00:05:56,145 --> 00:06:01,657
And you can even go backwords in time. Year 0 that deflator might be even 1985 because maybe things are going cheaper.

70
00:06:01,657 --> 00:06:04,528
Or you could actually had prices go down

71
00:06:04,528 --> 00:06:08,991
You could actually had deflation, so maybe in year two your deflator would be 98.

72
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:10,799
But the reason why it's called the deflator

73
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:13,924
it's because generally you have infaltion's time goes on

74
00:06:13,924 --> 00:06:16,797
and generally you're going to be defalting your nominal GDP

75
00:06:16,797 --> 00:06:20,141
You're going divideing it by value gradeor than one

76
00:06:20,141 --> 00:06:24,141
It's going to be something over 100 divided by 100, which is your base year to get your real GDP.
