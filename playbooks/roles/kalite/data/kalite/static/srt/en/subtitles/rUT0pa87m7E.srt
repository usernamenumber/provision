1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
   

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,950
Let's do a couple of example
problems where we use

3
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,190
information to set up equations
to solve our

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,690
problem, and then we'll actually
solve the equation.

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,660
So let's do problem number 1.

6
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:17,280
Write a mathematical equation
that describes the

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,380
relationship between the
variables in the table.

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,890
So you have your days
and your profit.

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,820
And if we look at them, on day
1 profit of 20, on day 2

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,290
profit of 40, day
3 profit of 60.

11
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,690
It looks like no matter what
happens the profit is always

12
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:41,370
going to be equal to-- let's
see, it's 20, 40, 60, 80.

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,300
It looks like every day
it increases by 20.

14
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,910
This is plus 20, to go from 20
to 40, then it's plus 20, plus

15
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:50,900
20, plus 20.

16
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,850
So every day it increases
by 20.

17
00:00:52,850 --> 00:01:00,810
So maybe the formula here is
that our profit is equal to

18
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:06,890
the day times 20, is equal
to 20 times the day.

19
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,460
Does that fit the data?

20
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,120
Let's see, you could try it with
all of them, but when the

21
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,670
day is 5, 20 times 5 is 100.

22
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,560
5 times 20 is 100.

23
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,140
Yeah, it looks like it actually
fits the data.

24
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,790
And if we wanted to write it a
little bit more algebraically,

25
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:26,630
we could say that profit is p
and day is d, and we would

26
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:32,260
write our equation as profit is
equal to 20 times d or 20d.

27
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,140
So that's part a.

28
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,840
I wrote a mathematical equation
that describes the

29
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,920
relationship.

30
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,290
And then part b, they say what
is the profit on day 10?

31
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,070
Well lucky for us we've written
our equation, so

32
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,370
they're essentially just saying
what happens to p,

33
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:50,640
profit, what happens to profit
when d or day is equal to 10?

34
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,780
So profit is going to be equal
to 20 times the day

35
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,630
we're on, day 10.

36
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,230
20 times 10, which
is equal to 200.

37
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,430
That's it.

38
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,420
Problem 3.

39
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,320
Write a mathematical equation
for the following

40
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,270
situations and solve.

41
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,500
All right, let's do part a.

42
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,400
7 times a number is 35.

43
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,610
What is the number?

44
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,500
So whenever someone says a
number, I'll just use the

45
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,350
variable x.

46
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,270
I could use any variable,
I could say y

47
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,640
or b or z or anything.

48
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,280
But I'll go with x because
that's what I'm most used to

49
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,310
and what's most typically
done unless you've

50
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,690
already used your x.

51
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:41,690
So 7 times a number, I'll say
7 times x is equal to 35.

52
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:42,990
So that's our equation.

53
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,980
We've written our mathematical
equation.

54
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,040
And now it's, what
is the number?

55
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,730
So to solve for x you could
it one of two ways.

56
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,950
You could divide both sides
of the equation by 7.

57
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,930
So if you divide that side by 7
and that side by 7-- And the

58
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,270
whole reason I'm doing that
is because I want this

59
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,080
coefficient to become 1.

60
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,600
And anything I do to one side
of the equation I have to do

61
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,780
to the other side.

62
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:10,360
So 7 divided by 7 is 1, so you
just have 1x or you just have

63
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,200
x is equal to 35 divided by 7.

64
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,980
x is equal to 5.

65
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,480
The other way you could have
thought about this, you could

66
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,670
have said that this is
multiplying both sides of the

67
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,140
equation times 1/7.

68
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:29,180
So 1/7 times 7x is equal
to 35 times 1/7.

69
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,830
These are equivalent
ways of doing it.

70
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,830
Either way these would
have canceled out.

71
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,420
You would have gotten
1x is equal to 5.

72
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,670
Part b.

73
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,040
   

74
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,690
One number is 25 more than
2 times another number.

75
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,330
All right, so let's say
that x is equal to a

76
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,220
number, the one number.

77
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,875
And let's say that y is equal
to the other number.

78
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:59,750
   

79
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,440
So they're introducing
more variables here.

80
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:08,250
So one number, let's say x,
is-- is, that's like equal

81
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:17,279
--it's equal to 25 more than
2 times another number.

82
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,760
Well, this is the
other number.

83
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,440
So 2 times our other number.

84
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,400
That's what I got out of this
first line right there.

85
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,310
One number is 25 more than
2 times another number.

86
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,580
2 times another number plus 25
is going to be equal to my

87
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,780
first number.

88
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,460
All right, now what is the
second [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

89
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:48,760
If each number is multiplied by
5, their sum would be 350.

90
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,900
So that means 5 times this plus
5 times that is going to

91
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,580
be equal to 350.

92
00:04:53,580 --> 00:05:05,500
So 5 times x plus 5 times y is
going to be equal to 350.

93
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,230
And they're asking what
are the numbers?

94
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,050
Well, here we can do something
called substitution.

95
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:15,230
We already see that x is equal
to this whole thing over here.

96
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,490
It's just like saying x is equal
to 5 or x is equal to 9

97
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,272
or whatever.

98
00:05:19,272 --> 00:05:20,830
x is equal to something.

99
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:24,050
So every time we see an
x, we can replace

100
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,940
it with this something.

101
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,640
So we see an x right here, so
we can replace it with this

102
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,550
something, and then we'll have
an equation that only has a y

103
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,670
in it and then we'll be
able to solve for y.

104
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:41,590
So this can be written as 5
times, instead of an x we have

105
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,650
all this business, 25 plus 2y.

106
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,310
I substituted for x, because
they told us x is equal to

107
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,440
this thing.

108
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:56,860
25 plus 2y plus 5y
is equal to 350.

109
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,110
Use the distributive property.

110
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:07,360
5 times 25 is 125 plus 5 times
2y is 10y, plus all of this,

111
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,670
5y is equal to 350.

112
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,940
10y plus 5y is 15y.

113
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:26,070
That's 15y plus 125
is equal to 350.

114
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:32,510
Now we can subtract 125 from
both sides, so minus 125--

115
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:36,900
Sorry, minus 125.

116
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,040
I'm doing that to get
rid of the 125 from

117
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,460
the left-hand side.

118
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,950
So our equation simplifies to--
I'll continue it up here.

119
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:51,700
We get 15y is equal
to 350 minus 125.

120
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,130
That is equal to 225.

121
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:59,120
And you may or may not already
know that 15 times 15 is 225,

122
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,210
so we already know what y is.

123
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,990
Let's divide both sides
by 15 just to make it

124
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,510
clear what I'm doing.

125
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:09,280
You divide both sides by 15 you
get y is equal to 225 over

126
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,730
15, which is equal to 15.

127
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,300
Now we're not completely
done yet.

128
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,860
We know what y is, but we still
have to solve for x.

129
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,260
So x is equal to 25
plus 2 times y.

130
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,720
y is equal to 15.

131
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:29,090
2 times 15, that
is equal to 30.

132
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:36,750
25 plus 30 is 55.

133
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,420
Let me do part c.

134
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,110
Let me clear this
out of the way.

135
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:47,150
   

136
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:51,170
Clear this out of
the way as well.

137
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,420
Part c.

138
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,620
   

139
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,490
The sum of two consecutive
integers is 35.

140
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,060
What are the numbers?

141
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,020
Well, let's say that x is equal
to the first integer.

142
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,540
   

143
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,690
Then what's the second
integer going to be?

144
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,710
Well the second integer's
just going to be

145
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,970
one more than that.

146
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,610
They're consecutive, they're
one after another.

147
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:17,730
So x plus 1 is equal to
the second integer.

148
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:22,280
And they're saying the sum of
both of these numbers is 35.

149
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,360
So x plus the number that comes
right after x, x plus 1,

150
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,490
is equal to 35.

151
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:35,440
Add these together, you get
2x plus 1 is equal to 35.

152
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,600
Subtract 1 from both sides of
the equation, you get 2x is

153
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,919
equal to 34-- just subtracted
1 from both sides.

154
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,560
Divide both sides by 2 and
you get x is equal to 17.

155
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,240
So the first number is 17, and
the second number is just one

156
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,140
more than that, it's 18.

157
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,270
And notice, two consecutive
integers, 17 then 18, add them

158
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,740
together, you get 35.

159
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,990
Part d.

160
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,580
   

161
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,050
Peter is 3 times as old
as he was 6 years ago.

162
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,690
How old is Peter?

163
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:15,130
So Peter-- I'll say p for
Peter's age --is equal to 3

164
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:19,540
times as old as he
was 6 years ago.

165
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,620
How old was he 6 years ago?

166
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,430
Well, if he's p years old
now, he was p minus 6

167
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,420
years old 3 years ago.

168
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,360
So let me write this as p minus
6-- that's as old as he

169
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,630
was 6 years ago.

170
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,120
That's what p minus 6 is.

171
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,020
This 3 times-- that's the
3 times as old as

172
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,980
he was 6 years ago.

173
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,010
And, of course, this is how
old he is right now.

174
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,710
So we just have to
solve for p.

175
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:50,350
So we get p is equal to,
distribute the 3, 3 times p is

176
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:56,140
3p minus 3 times 6 is 18.

177
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:00,310
Now we can subtract 3p from both
sides of the equation.

178
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:05,040
We get minus 2p, right? p
minus 3p is minus, or

179
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,240
negative, 2p is equal
to negative 18.

180
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,450
And divide both sides by
negative 2 and you get p is

181
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,050
equal to 9.

182
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,910
Just multiply both sides
by negative 2.

183
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,230
And you can verify it.

184
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,810
Right now he's 9.

185
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:27,120
6 years ago he was 3, and he
is 3 times as old as that.

186
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,690
Right, 6 years ago he was 3,
and at 9 years old he is 3

187
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,250
times as old as he
was 6 years ago.

188
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,820
So it definitely works out.

189
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,460
That's the cool thing about
algebra, you can

190
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,400
always check your work.

191
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,080
You always know when you
got the right answer.

192
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,010
Problem 6.

193
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,600
The price of an MP3 player
decreased by 20% from last

194
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,300
year to this year.

195
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,670
This year the price of
the player is $120.

196
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,820
What was the price last year?

197
00:10:53,820 --> 00:11:03,760
So let me say, p is equal
to the price last year.

198
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,420
And they're telling us that
the price of an MP3 player

199
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,910
decreased by 20% from last
year to this year.

200
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,240
So let's take 20%
away from this.

201
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:20,230
So price minus 20% of the
price-- this is decreasing by

202
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:23,880
20% --is equal to the price
this year, which they're

203
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:29,950
telling us is $120.

204
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:33,570
Well what's p minus 0.2
or minus 20% of p?

205
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,840
We decreased by 20%.

206
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,360
Well you're going to
be left with 80%.

207
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,560
So we could say 80% of the price
last year is equal to

208
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,950
the price this year.

209
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:50,180
Like we did before, we divide
both sides by the coefficient

210
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,510
on our variable.

211
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:57,485
Divide both sides by 0.8, or
0.80, depending how you want

212
00:11:57,485 --> 00:11:58,450
to view it.

213
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,460
0.80.

214
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,420
These cancel out.

215
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:11,980
So we have to divide
0.8 into $120.

216
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,870
A little exercise in
dividing decimals.

217
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:18,840
Let me put some zeroes there.

218
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,870
We could multiply the 0.8
and the 120 by 10.

219
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,460
That's essentially moving
the decimals over to

220
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,990
the right by one.

221
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:33,510
So this is the same as dividing
8 into 1,200.

222
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,520
So this decimal isn't there
anymore, it's over here.

223
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,810
This decimal is now over here.

224
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:42,060
8 goes into 12 one time,
1 times 8 is 8.

225
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:46,140
12 minus 8 is 4, bring
down the zero.

226
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,930
8 goes into 40 five times.

227
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:54,700
5 times 8 is 40, 40 minus 40
is 0, bring down another 0.

228
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,470
8 goes into 0 zero times, 0
times 8-- you get the idea.

229
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,430
0 times 8 is 0.

230
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,730
We have no remainder.

231
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:06,170
So our answer is $150.

232
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:09,810
So it was $150 last year,
it decreased by 20%.

233
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:13,720
20% of $150's $30, so it
decreased by $30, and it

234
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,960
definitely got us to $120.

235
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,466
