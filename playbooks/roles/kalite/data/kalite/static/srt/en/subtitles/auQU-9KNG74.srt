1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
   

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,320
Find the greatest common factor
of these monomials.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,680
And when they say monomials,
that's just a fancy word for

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,620
saying a one term expression.

5
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,660
Each of these only, obviously,
have one term in them.

6
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,885
Now to find the greatest common
factor of these, the

7
00:00:13,885 --> 00:00:16,650
way I think about it is, I like
to break up each of these

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,450
terms into their constituent
parts.

9
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,760
Make them a product of the
simplest things possible.

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,310
For regular numbers like 10, to
me that means break them up

11
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,110
into their prime factors, and
for these variable expressions

12
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,800
like cd squared, break it up
into the product of the most

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,040
simple variable, for example,
c times d times d.

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,030
So let's do that for each of
them and see what the greatest

15
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,690
common factor is.

16
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,280
Where do these overlap in
terms of their factor?

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,520
And we care about the
greatest overlap.

18
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,550
So let's do this first one.

19
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,620
10 cd squared, what
is that equal to?

20
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:56,840
Well 10 is equal to 2 times 5.

21
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,710
You could do a factoring tree
here, but these are pretty

22
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,910
straightforward numbers
to factor into.

23
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,190
They're prime factors.

24
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,650
So 10 is 2 times 5, c, all you
can do is break that, you

25
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,780
could just write that as
a c, you can't really

26
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,060
simplify that anymore.

27
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,820
And d squared can be written
as d times d.

28
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,030
   

29
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,080
So I have essentially broken
10cd squared into this, into

30
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,580
the product of kind of the
smallest constituents that I

31
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,060
could think of.

32
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,630
The prime factors of 10,
and then c, and then d.

33
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,530
Now let's do 5cd.

34
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,705
Well 5cd, 5 is prime, so its
prime factorization is

35
00:01:32,705 --> 00:01:33,960
literally just 5.

36
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,190
c you can't break that down
anymore, that's just a c, and

37
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,550
then times a d.

38
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,690
So we really didn't do anything
to this expression

39
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:41,560
right there.

40
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,750
And then finally you have 25c
to the third d squared.

41
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:51,710
Well 25 is 5 times 5, and then
we have times c times c times

42
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,930
c, that's what c to the third
is, and then we have times d

43
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,680
squared, times d times d.

44
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,150
Now, what is the greatest common
factor, or what is the

45
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,860
greatest common overlap between
these three things?

46
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,550
Well they all have a 5.

47
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,669
Let me circle them.

48
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:13,450
You have a 5 there, you have a
5 there, you have a 5 there.

49
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,690
They all have at least one c.

50
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,980
You have one c there,
one c there, and

51
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,760
then another c there.

52
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,590
And they all have
at least one d.

53
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,670
You have a d there, you have
a d there, and then

54
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,330
you have a d there.

55
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,960
Now they don't all have a second
d, only the first one

56
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,800
and the third one
have a second d.

57
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,210
And they all don't have a second
or third c, only this

58
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,540
last one has a second
or third c.

59
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,900
So we're essentially done.

60
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,600
The greatest common
factor is 5cd.

61
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,680
In fact you can't have a greater
number than 5cd be a

62
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,150
common factor, because the
largest factor of 5cd is 5cd.

63
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:52,800
So the greatest common factor
of these three monomials, or

64
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,130
these three expressions,
is 5cd.

65
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,990
The largest number of factors
that overlaps with all three

66
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:04,350
of these expressions is
a 5, one c, and one d.

67
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:04,733
