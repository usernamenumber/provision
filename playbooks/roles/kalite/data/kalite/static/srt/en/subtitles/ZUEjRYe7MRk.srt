1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,650
In the next series of videos,
I'm going to give my best

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,770
attempt at trying to get a
handle on the bailout and the

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:08,780
financial crisis.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,740
So I'm going to try to explain
different concepts in more

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:12,340
than one way.

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,900
Then I think hopefully
it'll all sink in.

7
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,260
But the big picture really is
that there's a lot of fancy

8
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,761
terminology being thrown around.

9
00:00:18,761 --> 00:00:22,860
But the underlyingconcepts 
really aren't that fancy.

10
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,700
So I think a good place to start
is just with the idea of

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,300
the balance sheet.

12
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,300
And you could watch some of the
videos that I did before

13
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,876
the whole financial mess 
on the balance sheet.

14
00:00:30,876 --> 00:00:31,976
And that'll give you good primer.

15
00:00:31,976 --> 00:00:33,650
But it doesn't hurt to review it here.

16
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,980
So a balance sheet is just a
snapshot of what you have,

17
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,051
and what you owe, and 
the difference between.

18
00:00:38,051 --> 00:00:40,720
And the difference between 
is kind of like your wealth.

19
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,910
So if I just had a personal
balance sheet,

20
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,160
I could write my assets.

21
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,410
They mean what you
think they mean.

22
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,270
These are things that will
give you future benefit.

23
00:00:53,270 --> 00:01:03,090
So let's say, my assets – 
I have $1,000 cash.

24
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:13,340
Let's say I have a
$100,000 house.

25
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:21,306
Let's say I have
a $10,000 car.

26
00:01:21,306 --> 00:01:26,440
And let's say everything 
else, I'll call it other,

27
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:34,689
my furniture, my TV, and everything
else, is another $5,000.

28
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:36,590
So those would be my assets.

29
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,203
And so what are my
total assets?

30
00:01:39,745 --> 00:01:47,730
It's $101,000, $111,000,
$116,000.

31
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,000
Well, it would be great
if we lived in a

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,310
world of only assets.

33
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,650
But, unfortunately, let's
say that I had

34
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,050
liabilities as well.

35
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,300
So liabilities.

36
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,740
And a liability is what
you think it means.

37
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,780
It means something that you have
to give future economic

38
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,770
benefit for.

39
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,620
You're kind of on the
hook for something.

40
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:13,860
And so let's say, my
liabilities, I have a $20,000

41
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,000
student loan.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,376
And let's say on that house –
unfortunately, I don't own it outright.

43
00:02:20,376 --> 00:02:23,546
Let's say that I have an $80,000
mortgage on that house.

44
00:02:23,546 --> 00:02:27,150
So essentially, I borrowed
$80,000 from the bank.

45
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,760
And let's throw some credit
card debt in there,

46
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,077
just to make this realistic
relative to, I think, a lot of

47
00:02:33,077 --> 00:02:34,126
households out there.

48
00:02:34,126 --> 00:02:37,285
Let's say that there's $5,000 
of credit card debt.

49
00:02:37,285 --> 00:02:38,520
Although for most 
households right now,

50
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,530
this house is a lot more, and
this mortgage is a lot more.

51
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,120
But anyway, I won't make
social commentary.

52
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,331
This is just to explain what
a balance sheet is.

53
00:02:47,331 --> 00:02:49,550
So what is left over for me?

54
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,530
What is my assets minus
my liability?

55
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,860
Let's calculate our
total liabilities.

56
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,800
So this is total assets.

57
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,970
I'll use an A colon.

58
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,960
So what are my total
liabilities?

59
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:06,390
20 plus 80 plus 5,
so it's $105,000.

60
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,740
$105,000 total liabilities.

61
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,720
So the difference between these
two, my assets minus my

62
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,960
liabilities, this is essentially
my net worth.

63
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,760
If I just liquidated everything
tomorrow, if I sold

64
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,260
all of this and paid off all
this, this is what I would be

65
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,260
left standing with.

66
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,440
That's my net worth.

67
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,030
Or you could view that
as that is my equity.

68
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,410
You often hear equity in
the context of a house.

69
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,450
In the context of a house, 
it's just the asset of the

70
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,030
house minus the liability, but
I'm talking about in the

71
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,024
context of my 
personal balance sheet.

72
00:03:35,024 --> 00:03:36,700
Not that these are the actual numbers.

73
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,280
I don't want to give away too
much about my life, just yet.

74
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,820
But anyway, so what is
that number here?

75
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:46,210
So my equity, and I'll do that –
I'll make it green, since, if it's

76
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,720
positive, it's a good number.

77
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,380
My equity is $116,000
minus is $105,000.

78
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:53,950
So what is that?

79
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:59,100
That's $11,000.

80
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,610
That's my equity.

81
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,146
So there's a couple of things
to think about here.

82
00:04:03,146 --> 00:04:07,540
You'll meet people with a
$100,000 house or a

83
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,450
$1 million house, and they 
say, "Oh, I am worth $1 million."

84
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,830
And you're like, "Well, you're
not really worth $1 million

85
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,160
unless you own that house
outright, and you could

86
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,630
actually sell that house
for $1 million.

87
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,670
It's not what you paid for it.

88
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,870
It's what the market is 
willing to give for it.

89
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,429
But your real net worth is your
assets minus all of your liabilities.

90
00:04:24,429 --> 00:04:26,130
So in this case, your net
worth is actually

91
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:30,300
$11,000, not $116,000.

92
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,910
And this is another important
thing to think about.

93
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,740
Assets are always equal to
liabilities plus equity.

94
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,540
That just comes out of the
definition of what equity is.

95
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,400
Equity was assets minus
liabilities.

96
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,910
If you take an MBA, they'll
write it down, and it looks

97
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,380
like an equation, but it's
assets is equal to liabilities

98
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,080
plus equity.

99
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,060
But that's almost by definition
that that's going

100
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,750
to be true.

101
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,040
So what can we do with this?

102
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,850
How does this help us?

103
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,670
Well, there's a couple of ways
that we can think about this.

104
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:03,590
First of all, what happens
if my liabilities are

105
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,910
larger than my assets?

106
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,770
So if I owe the world more
than the world owes me?

107
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,500
Well, then this number is
going to be negative.

108
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,640
And if this number is negative,
then there's no

109
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,410
really good reason for me, maybe
to preserve my credit

110
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,260
score, but other than that,
if we take that out of the

111
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,240
equation, there's no good reason
for me to continue

112
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,570
living this existence.

113
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:30,230
If my liabilities are greater
than my assets, let's think

114
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,950
about that situation.

115
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:34,240
Let's say that my house is only
worth $100,000, but for

116
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,750
whatever reason, I owe
$120,000 to the bank.

117
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,500
Let's say maybe I originally
bought the house with a

118
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,060
no-money down payment
for $120,000.

119
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,190
And now I'm honest
with myself.

120
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,580
I'm like the value
has gone down.

121
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,300
It's only worth $100,000 now.

122
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,325
So I'm in the situation where
you could say I'm upside down

123
00:05:52,325 --> 00:05:53,460
in my mortgage.

124
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,250
Well, one, you could say there's
no incentive for me to

125
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,600
continue paying this house.

126
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,690
An even bigger picture, if I now
look at my balance sheet,

127
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:04,200
what are my liabilities now?

128
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,660
My liabilities would
be $145,000.

129
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,660
And my equity would be my assets
minus my liabilities.

130
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,680
So $116,000 minus $45,000,
what is that?

131
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,825
Minus $29,000.

132
00:06:15,825 --> 00:06:17,110
I'll do that in red.

133
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,570
That's a bad number
for your equity.

134
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,790
So in this situation, there's
really no reason for me to

135
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:32,000
continue living like the way
I am, at least financially.

136
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,660
As long as you're breathing,
there's no reason not to

137
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,590
continue breathing.

138
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,690
But you wouldn't want to live
like this financially anymore,

139
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:40,210
so there's no reason not to go
seek bankruptcy protection.

140
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:45,340
And bankruptcy protection is
admitting I am insolvent,

141
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,880
which means that there's no way
that I'm going to be able

142
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,040
to unwind all of
my liabilities.

143
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,270
Courts protect me.

144
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,210
My lenders can't come
back after me.

145
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,340
Everything is going
to be erased.

146
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,890
They're going to take all my
assets, all my liabilities,

147
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,040
and they're essentially going to
take these and divide them

148
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,420
up amongst the people
that I owe stuff to.

149
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,330
So that's bankruptcy.

150
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,290
That's insolvency.

151
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:12,510
And I want to highlight the word
insolvency because that's

152
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,100
a word that we're going touch on
when we actually talk about

153
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,130
the credit crisis.

154
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,630
And that is opposed
illiquidity.

155
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:22,140
So what is illiquidity?

156
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,830
So insolvency means there's no
reason for you to continue

157
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,500
with this type of a financial
situation.

158
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,320
You're bankrupt.

159
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,820
You go get bankruptcy
protection.

160
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,480
That's insolvency.

161
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,140
Illiquidity is a different
situation.

162
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,200
Illiquidity says no,
I actually do

163
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,250
have positive equity.

164
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,850
So let me go back to the
original circumstance.

165
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,680
It really was I only owe $80,000
on the house, so my

166
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,690
liabilities really are
only $105,000.

167
00:07:53,690 --> 00:08:02,390
So I really do have a positive
equity of $11,000.

168
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,900
So this isn't insolvency
anymore.

169
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,010
So I'm going to describe what
illiquidity means to you.

170
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,340
Or to me, in this case,
because this

171
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,970
is my balance sheet.

172
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:19,120
So let's say that my wife comes
to me and says we need

173
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,260
to pay our child's tuition.

174
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,890
It is $5,000 for the
upcoming year.

175
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,630
I need to pay $5,000
in tuition.

176
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,990
Actually, let me take a better
situation because if I'm

177
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,620
talking about tuition, it
should have shown up on

178
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,450
liabilities.

179
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:40,080
Let's say that I have to
make a $5,000 payment

180
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,200
on my student loan.

181
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,040
So I have some kind of weird
student loan, where $5,000

182
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,200
comes due all of a sudden.

183
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,490
So I have to make a $5,000
payment on the student loan.

184
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,740
Let me do that in red.

185
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:57,120
Make $5,000 payment.

186
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,010
And it could be for anything,
but let's say it's to satisfy

187
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,100
part of one of these
liabilities.

188
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,690
So if you look at my equity, if
you look at my assets minus

189
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:09,210
my liabilities, I clearly
have $11,000.

190
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,190
I'm worth $11,000.

191
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,460
And if I could liquidate all
my assets and all my

192
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,840
liabilities overnight, I would
have $11,000 in cash, and then

193
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,920
I could pay that $5,000.

194
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,240
In fact, in the process of doing
it, I would have paid

195
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,920
that $5,000.

196
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,190
But in this circumstance, if I
just look at my situation,

197
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,340
let's say that student loan
payment is due tomorrow.

198
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,380
I only have $1,000 of cash.

199
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,920
I only have $1,000
maybe sitting

200
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,940
in my checking account.

201
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,400
So I can't make that $5,000
payment just with my cash.

202
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,510
And then I look at everything
else, and I'm like, boy, can

203
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,270
unload any of these
assets overnight?

204
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,560
Well, a house, absolutely not.

205
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,790
There's no way I'm going
to be able to

206
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,170
unload my house tomorrow.

207
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,460
Maybe I could find someone who
would buy it for $50,000

208
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,260
tomorrow, but that wouldn't
help my situation.

209
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,900
Then my equity would
go negative again.

210
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,680
So that won't help.

211
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,200
I can't sell my car overnight.

212
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,480
Maybe I could sell it at a super
low price for $4,000,

213
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,610
just to kind of make this
payment, but I don't want to

214
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:05,510
do that either.

215
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,660
And same thing, your furniture,
you'd have to go on

216
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,890
Craigslist and take
pictures of it.

217
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:10,930
You couldn't do it.

218
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,390
So this is a situation
where you are

219
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,800
having a liquidity crisis.

220
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,540
You are illiquid, but you're
not insolvent.

221
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:23,870
You have a positive net worth,
assuming that you're not lying

222
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,240
about what's going on in
your balance sheet.

223
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,240
And that's another issue.

224
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,650
So how do you get past a
liquidity crisis like this?

225
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,560
Well, someone has to give
you-- we could call it a

226
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,980
bridge loan because they're
giving you a financial bridge

227
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,980
from here to where
you need to go.

228
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,160
Or they're giving you
a bridge that

229
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,360
essentially buys you time.

230
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,860
Let's say your dad says, OK,
Sal, or my dad, I guess, I'll

231
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,800
give you a $5,000 loan for
the next two months.

232
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,190
And over the next two months,
I expect you to find some

233
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,160
other source of cash.

234
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,510
Maybe sell your car, buy a
cheaper car, sell some of your

235
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,640
furniture or something.

236
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,750
So that is a loan to prevent
a liquidity crisis.

237
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,250
And that loan wouldn't be a
bad idea because if this

238
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,640
person isn't lying about their
balance sheet, or I'm not

239
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,600
lying about my balance sheet,
then I actually am

240
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,610
good for the money.

241
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,200
On the other hand, that loan
be a bad idea if I had

242
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,730
insolvency because it would
just be throwing

243
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,330
good money after bad.

244
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,170
I'm not able to pay my current
loans, and you're just giving

245
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,430
me another loan that I wouldn't
be able to pay.

246
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,730
Anyway, I'm out of time.

247
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,890
I'll see you in the
next video.
