1
00:00:00,938 --> 00:00:03,353
I've been asked to calculate the probability of winning

2
00:00:03,353 --> 00:00:05,069
The Mega Millions Jackpot

3
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:07,270
So that's what I thought I'd do this video on.

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,353
So the first thing is to make sure we understand what winning the jackpot actually means.

5
00:00:11,353 --> 00:00:14,020
So there are going to be two bins of balls.

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:19,820
One of them is going to have 56 balls. So 56 balls in one bin.

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,987
And then another bin will have 45 balls in it.

8
00:00:22,987 --> 00:00:27,003
So 46 balls in this bin right here.

9
00:00:27,003 --> 00:00:32,121
So they are going to pick 5 balls from this bin right here, and you have

10
00:00:32,121 --> 00:00:36,020
to get the exact number of these five balls. It can be in any order, so let me just draw

11
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,270
So its one ball, all shaded so it looks like a ball.

12
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:45,371
two balls, three balls, four balls

13
00:00:45,371 --> 00:00:47,670
and five balls

14
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,653
And you just have to get the numbers in any order. And this is from the bin of 56

15
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:55,553
From a bin of 56.

16
00:00:55,553 --> 00:00:57,487
And then you have to get the megaball right.

17
00:00:57,487 --> 00:01:00,587
and they're just going to pick one ball from there, which they call the megaball.

18
00:01:00,587 --> 00:01:06,686
They're going to pick one ball from there. And obviously this is going to be one of 46

19
00:01:06,686 --> 00:01:08,604
So, from a bin of 46.

20
00:01:08,604 --> 00:01:14,469
So to figure out the probability of winning is going to be one of all the possible

21
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:17,836
all of the possibilites of the numbers you can pick

22
00:01:17,836 --> 00:01:24,138
Its essentially all the combination of the white balls times the 46 possibilites for the mega ball

23
00:01:24,138 --> 00:01:26,687
So, think about the combinations about the white balls

24
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:28,219
There are couple ways you could do it

25
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:30,138
if you are thinking in combinatorix terms

26
00:01:30,138 --> 00:01:32,686
it would essentially be like saying

27
00:01:32,686 --> 00:01:35,770
out of a set of 56 things, I am going to choose

28
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,820
I'm going to choose 5 of them

29
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,653
Literally, you could do this as

30
00:01:39,653 --> 00:01:41,353
56 choose 5

31
00:01:41,353 --> 00:01:44,853
Or, if you want to think of it in more conceptual terms

32
00:01:44,853 --> 00:01:48,652
the first ball I pick there is 56 possiblities

33
00:01:48,652 --> 00:01:50,552
Since we're not replacing the ball

34
00:01:50,552 --> 00:01:51,770
The next ball I pick

35
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,502
There are going to be 55 posibilites

36
00:01:53,502 --> 00:01:56,986
the ball after that there is going to be 54 possibilities.

37
00:01:56,986 --> 00:02:01,403
The ball after that there will be 53 possibilities

38
00:02:01,403 --> 00:02:04,386
The ball after that there is going to be 52 possiblites.

39
00:02:04,386 --> 00:02:07,953
52, because I've already picked 4 balls

40
00:02:07,953 --> 00:02:10,902
Now this number right over hre

41
00:02:10,902 --> 00:02:12,302
when you multiply it out is the number of permutations

42
00:02:12,302 --> 00:02:13,871
if I cared about order

43
00:02:13,871 --> 00:02:15,720
If I got that exact combination

44
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,442
But to win this, you don't have to write it down in the same order

45
00:02:19,442 --> 00:02:22,002
You just have to get those numbers in any order

46
00:02:22,002 --> 00:02:27,137
So what you want to do is want to divide this by the number of ways that five things can actually be

47
00:02:27,137 --> 00:02:28,220
ordered.

48
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:34,104
And if you're ordering five things

49
00:02:34,104 --> 00:02:36,787
The first of the five things could take five different positions

50
00:02:36,787 --> 00:02:39,091
And the next one will have 4 positions left

51
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:41,694
And the one after that will have 3 positions left

52
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:43,593
and the one after that will have two positions

53
00:02:43,593 --> 00:02:47,092
And the fifth one will be completely determined because we've already placed the other four.

54
00:02:47,092 --> 00:02:48,959
So it will only have one position

55
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,943
So when we calculate this part right over here

56
00:02:51,943 --> 00:02:55,142
This will tell us all of the combination of just the white balls

57
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:56,391
So let's calculate that

58
00:02:56,391 --> 00:02:59,726
So just the white balls, we have 55

59
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:09,643
sorry, 56 x 55 x 54 x 53 x 52

60
00:03:09,643 --> 00:03:11,226
and we're going to divide that

61
00:03:11,226 --> 00:03:17,993
by 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1

62
00:03:17,993 --> 00:03:19,894
but we don't have to mutiply by one, but I'll do that just to show what we're doing

63
00:03:19,894 --> 00:03:23,624
And that gives us about 3.8 million

64
00:03:23,624 --> 00:03:28,492
So let me put that off screen, and let me write that number down

65
00:03:28,492 --> 00:03:35,725
So this comes out to 3 million 8 hundred and 19 thousand

66
00:03:35,725 --> 00:03:38,678
3,819,816

67
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:40,262
So thats the number of possiblities here

68
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:42,161
So just your odds of just picking the white balls right

69
00:03:42,161 --> 00:03:43,778
are one out of this

70
00:03:43,778 --> 00:03:45,427
assuming you only have one entry

71
00:03:45,427 --> 00:03:49,345
and then there are 46 possibilities for the orange balls

72
00:03:49,345 --> 00:03:51,293
so you're going to multiply that by 46

73
00:03:51,293 --> 00:03:52,980
And so that's going to get you

74
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,827
So when you multiply it times 46

75
00:03:54,827 --> 00:03:56,627
Bring the calculator back

76
00:03:56,627 --> 00:03:59,578
so we're going to multiply our previous answer

77
00:03:59,578 --> 00:04:00,663
times 46

78
00:04:00,663 --> 00:04:02,279
Ans just means my previous answer

79
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:09,261
Times 46, I get a little under 176 million

80
00:04:09,261 --> 00:04:12,344
A little under 176 million

81
00:04:12,344 --> 00:04:17,161
So that is, let me write that number

82
00:04:17,161 --> 00:04:25,678
So that gives us 175,711,536

83
00:04:25,678 --> 00:04:28,311
So your odds of winning it, with one entry

84
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:30,477
because this is the number of possiblities

85
00:04:30,477 --> 00:04:32,894
And essentially for $1, you are getting one of those possibilities.

86
00:04:32,894 --> 00:04:36,028
Your odds of winning is going to be one over this

87
00:04:36,028 --> 00:04:38,394
And to put this into a little context

88
00:04:38,394 --> 00:04:42,812
I looked it up on the internet of what your odds are of actually getting struck by lightning in your

89
00:04:42,812 --> 00:04:43,778
lifetime

90
00:04:43,778 --> 00:04:47,150
And your odds of getting struck by lightning are 1 in 10,000

91
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:51,789
1 in 10,000 chance of getting struck by lightning in your lifetime

92
00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:55,748
And we could roughly say that the odds of getting struck twice in your life time

93
00:04:55,748 --> 00:04:59,207
Or another way of saying it, the odds of you and your best friend

94
00:04:59,207 --> 00:05:02,790
both independently getting struck by lightning when you're not around eachother

95
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:07,007
Is going to be 1 in 10,000 times 1 in 10,000

96
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:11,524
and so that will get you 1 in - I have now eight zeros

97
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:14,673
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

98
00:05:14,673 --> 00:05:17,441
So that gives you one in one hundred million

99
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:21,173
So you actually twice, almost this is very rough

100
00:05:21,173 --> 00:05:26,007
You're roughly twice as likely to get struck by lightning twice in your life

101
00:05:26,007 --> 00:05:30,000
than to win the MegaJackpot!
