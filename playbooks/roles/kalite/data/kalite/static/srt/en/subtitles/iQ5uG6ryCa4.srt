1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's as if he's saying,

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
"No, no more. I don't want to play

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
yet another song." [laughing]

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You imagine that he's been singing

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and playing the flute

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so beautifully that

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
his audience is asking for more

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well look at the pleasure on his face

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
he looks so self-satisfied

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
He's just turned away,

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
his hand is up

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The other hand is still on the flute

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
as if he's just stopped with his finger

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in one of its holes

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I can't possibly play another.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[laughs] Or, he could just be pausing

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and singing

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Which is a standard type

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that we see in 17th century Dutch paintings

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The thing, of course, that carries this painting

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is the brushwork

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
its sense of formality, its sense of the momentary

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the way in which the fluidity

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of the artist's hand moving through

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this canvas, and the motion

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of the figure himself

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
are so beautifully brought together.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I thought what you were going to say

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what carries this painting is the feather

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[chuckles] Okay. Because it's so wild,

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this giant white feather

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that completes this circular form

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that starts down by his mouth

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There's all that space above,

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so that his face is even

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
slightly lower than center

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
also the sense of the space to move in

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that the artist has only captured this one frame

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
there are plenty of other things

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that are going around outside of what

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we could see
