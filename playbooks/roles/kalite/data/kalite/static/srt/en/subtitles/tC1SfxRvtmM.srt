00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:08,267
Express twenty five degrees Celsius as a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit using the formula Fahrenheit

2
00:00:08,267 --> 00:00:16,400
or F is equal to nine fifths times the Celsius degrees plus thirty two, so they're telling us that we have twenty five degrees

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:27,933
Celsius. So, we can put that in for "C" here and we'll get the temperature in Fahrenheit degrees. So, lets do that! So, we get "F" is equal to nine over five

4
00:00:27,933 --> 00:00:36,267
times, now for "C" we are going to put in twenty five, times twenty five plus thirty two...and now we

5
00:00:36,267 --> 00:00:40,000
can simplify this before we multiply twenty five times nine. Now remember, that's the same thing as nine

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,467
fifths times twenty five over one. We can essentually devide the numerater and the denominator of our

7
00:00:46,467 --> 00:00:52,733
eventual product by five. If we devide twenty five by five we get five. If we devide five by five we

8
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:59,133
get one. So, this boils down to nine times five plus thirty two. So our Fahrenheit degrees are going to

9
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:07,713
be nine times five is forty five plus thirty two degrees or it's equal to forty five plus thirty two

10
00:01:07,713 --> 00:01:15,509
is seventy seven. So this is seventy seven degrees Fahrenhiet.
