1
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,121
We're in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.

2
00:00:07,121 --> 00:00:09,422
We're looking at really early Thomas Cole

3
00:00:09,457 --> 00:00:11,756
this is the Expulsion from Eden.

4
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:16,316
Normally when we think about that subject we may think about images from the Italian Renaissance

5
00:00:16,459 --> 00:00:19,828
like Masaccio - Expulsion from the Garden of Eden

6
00:00:19,828 --> 00:00:23,398
or the Expulsion by Michelangelo, on the ceiling of Sistine Chapel.

7
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:26,782
Those are paintings of Adam and Eve of the two figures

8
00:00:27,274 --> 00:00:30,059
but Cole has transformed this into a landscape painting.

9
00:00:30,228 --> 00:00:34,335
We can barely find Adam and Eve takes us a moment. In part because they are so small.

10
00:00:34,571 --> 00:00:37,601
But he is giving us up this over the top operatic,

11
00:00:37,918 --> 00:00:41,467
treatment that starkly contrasts

12
00:00:41,467 --> 00:00:43,954
the Garden that is Eden, Gods Paradise,

13
00:00:44,262 --> 00:00:47,044
with the Terror of the wilderness beyond.

14
00:00:47,139 --> 00:00:48,976
I read this painting from right to left

15
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,744
instead of from left to right .

16
00:00:50,888 --> 00:00:53,192
I'd begin in the brighter Eden

17
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,198
and Cole has given us this fantastic vista.

18
00:00:56,382 --> 00:01:00,981
We can see these crystalline mountains that reach up to heaven

19
00:01:01,138 --> 00:01:04,107
and then slope down to these lovely glades,

20
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:05,859
the tropical paradise.

21
00:01:05,897 --> 00:01:08,051
And as we moved towards to the foreground,

22
00:01:08,132 --> 00:01:10,718
we can just make out two swans in a pool.

23
00:01:10,725 --> 00:01:12,569
We even see waterfalls

24
00:01:12,591 --> 00:01:14,539
down this purplish mountains,

25
00:01:14,647 --> 00:01:18,708
and this whole area, of Eden, is flooded with light.

26
00:01:18,794 --> 00:01:25,546
And everything seems verdant and lush. But that's contrasting with the left side of the painting

27
00:01:25,672 --> 00:01:28,840
where we see Adam and Eve being cast out in the Garden of Eden

28
00:01:28,992 --> 00:01:31,423
and we feel a blast of light

29
00:01:31,576 --> 00:01:35,960
that expels them from the Garden of Eden that obviously represents a divine force.

30
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,839
Nature is much bleaker,

31
00:01:38,839 --> 00:01:42,491
trees have been struck by lighting and ravaged by time.

32
00:01:42,491 --> 00:01:44,298
The colours are browns

33
00:01:44,328 --> 00:01:47,416
and there's sharp contrast of light and dark.

34
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:51,600
You can actually see a storm in the sky that frames a volcano.

35
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:54,055
Adam holds his hand up to this forehead,

36
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,374
Eve clutches at his hand.

37
00:01:56,482 --> 00:01:57,921
They know they are in deep trouble.

38
00:01:59,271 --> 00:02:00,622
And is if to make that point even more clearly

39
00:02:00,645 --> 00:02:05,397
in a lower left we see a wild animal that's felled a deer

40
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,206
and is protecting it against an approaching vulture.

41
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:12,393
This new culture of this new American Nation did not have what Europe had.

42
00:02:12,516 --> 00:02:14,369
It did not have ancient ruins.

43
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,335
It did not have ancient cultures.

44
00:02:16,457 --> 00:02:17,892
But at the beginning of the 19th century,

45
00:02:18,032 --> 00:02:21,892
philosophers and writers and painters, began to recognize

46
00:02:22,023 --> 00:02:25,990
that it's wilderness was, in a sense, it's great heritage.

47
00:02:26,228 --> 00:02:27,081
That right.

48
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:32,432
But American painters knew that the landscape was a low kind of art

49
00:02:32,432 --> 00:02:36,189
in the hierarchy established by the Academies in Europe.

50
00:02:37,804 --> 00:02:39,420
The knew that landscape was looked down on

51
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,453
and one way you could ennoble a landscape

52
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:43,501
and raise it up to a higher level,

53
00:02:45,101 --> 00:02:47,651
to the level of a history painting,

54
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:51,898
was to, make it the setting for heroic human endeavor,

55
00:02:51,898 --> 00:02:55,641
for biblical stories.

56
00:02:56,491 --> 00:02:58,192
And that's exactly what Cole has done.

57
00:02:58,192 --> 00:03:01,907
American artists are always wanting to be taken seriously

58
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:06,925
but because of the artistic situation in America

59
00:03:07,017 --> 00:03:11,397
they're often forced to paint subjects that their clients want

60
00:03:11,504 --> 00:03:13,641
which are not the noblest subjects,

61
00:03:13,717 --> 00:03:18,425
simple landscapes and portraits. 

So this paintings in some ways might have been a challenge

62
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:19,578
to its American public

63
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:22,234
who were used to more prosaic images

64
00:03:22,234 --> 00:03:25,776
and here Cole is attempting something more ambitious.

65
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:28,007
Cole wants to be a serious painter

66
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:35,143
and he can't do that by simply painting the Catskills as he's going to later do.

67
00:03:36,044 --> 00:03:36,914
He returns again and again

68
00:03:36,914 --> 00:03:38,983
to these more serious subjects

69
00:03:39,014 --> 00:03:41,014
the voyage of life, the course of empire.

70
00:03:41,075 --> 00:03:45,244
But all stories then can be enacted in the landscape.
