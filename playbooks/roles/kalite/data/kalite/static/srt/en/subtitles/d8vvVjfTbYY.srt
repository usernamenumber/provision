1
00:00:00,764 --> 00:00:05,439
Odie the octopus swam home. 
He swam at a constant speed.

2
00:00:06,068 --> 00:00:09,146
He plotted how far he'd gone 
every 1/7th of a second.

3
00:00:09,353 --> 00:00:13,485
(This is a little typo here, it should be 
1/7th of a second on the graph below.)

4
00:00:13,872 --> 00:00:19,400
Not all octopi can create graphs, 
but Odie was no ordinary octopus.

5
00:00:19,536 --> 00:00:22,649
And actually, octopi are some of the 
smartest creatures on this planet.

6
00:00:23,417 --> 00:00:25,391
What was Odie's speed after...

7
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:32,509
(after probably dolphins, and and great apes and probably most primates, and, but, but they're still fairly smart, smarter than most fish)

8
00:00:32,813 --> 00:00:35,977
What was Odie's speed in meters per second?

9
00:00:36,285 --> 00:00:40,748
Note we use m/s to show the units 
of meters per second.

10
00:00:40,872 --> 00:00:42,705
Meters per second.

11
00:00:42,874 --> 00:00:48,946
Alright, so to figure out speed, 
to figure out speed in meters per second,

12
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:52,466
we essentially need to divide distance in meters,

13
00:00:52,728 --> 00:01:02,770
(distance in meters) divided by time in seconds 
(time in seconds).

14
00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:05,110
So let's see if we can pull that off.

15
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:11,703
So, the easiest thing - let's, let me find a point that I can clearly read how far Odie has traveled.

16
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:17,444
So it looks like this point right over here. It's clearly that the distance in meters is 4/7ths.

17
00:01:17,807 --> 00:01:23,839
(Let me do that.) So the distance in meters is 4/7ths, so I'll do that in the numerator, the distance in meters -

18
00:01:24,016 --> 00:01:28,903
Gee, I don't like that cont...well, let's just go with this color, even though the contrast with the white background is a little hard on the eye...

19
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:37,447
...and it took him, it took him 5/7ths of a second...5/7ths of a second to get there.

20
00:01:37,493 --> 00:01:39,814
So 4/7ths meters...

21
00:01:39,845 --> 00:01:47,874
...actually let me make sure I put the units here...
4/7ths meters in...in...5/7ths...

22
00:01:48,212 --> 00:01:50,273
5/7ths seconds.

23
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:57,611
And so literally we just need to divide 4/7ths by 5/7ths and we're going to get it in meters per second.

24
00:01:57,703 --> 00:02:05,905
So this is going to be the same thing as
4/7ths over 5/7ths

25
00:02:06,303 --> 00:02:13,070
...over 5/7ths meters per second. Meters per second.

26
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:18,395
And 4/7ths divided by 5/7ths 
is the same thing as 4/7ths times 7/5ths.

27
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:24,375
So let me write that down. So 4/7ths times 7/5ths.

28
00:02:24,805 --> 00:02:28,110
Dividing by fractions is the same thing as 
multiplying by it's reciprocal.

29
00:02:28,536 --> 00:02:34,870
So times 7/5ths, and we get...
we get this, well this 7...

30
00:02:35,777 --> 00:02:39,926
This 7 and this 7 cancel out and you get 4 over 5.

31
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:43,517
You could have also done that by multiplying the numerator and the denominator here by 7.

32
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:47,824
If you multiply by 7 and multiply by 7 
you would get 4/5ths.

33
00:02:47,885 --> 00:02:54,902
But either way, his speed in meters per second is 4/5ths meters per second.
