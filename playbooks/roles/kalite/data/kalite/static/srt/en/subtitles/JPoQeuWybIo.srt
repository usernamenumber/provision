00:00:08,319 --> 00:00:15,304
Abstract Expressionism is often <br/>divided into two classifications,

2
00:00:15,304 --> 00:00:21,705
one of which is 'action painting' – <br/>which is the work typified by Bill De Kooning,

3
00:00:21,705 --> 00:00:28,067
or Jackson Pollock – where you feel <br/>the action of the artist on the canvas.

4
00:00:28,067 --> 00:00:30,034
The other side doesn't really have a name.

5
00:00:30,034 --> 00:00:34,470
But you might call it 'still painting,' <br/>because, in fact, there's an absence

6
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:40,610
of gesture, or activity, <br/>or angst on the canvas.

7
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:46,380
Instead, what you have <br/>is quiet contemplation –

8
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,010
a mood of deep immersion in color.

9
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:56,048
In a Rothko painting, you have three <br/>or four zones of different thinly washed

10
00:00:56,048 --> 00:01:01,539
layers of color, all interacting <br/>with each other in a subtle way –

11
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:08,628
not like bold contrasts – but instead, <br/>of almost swimming into each other,

12
00:01:08,628 --> 00:01:16,426
to get your eye and your brain working <br/>optically to almost immerse your

13
00:01:16,426 --> 00:01:21,508
consciousness in these fields <br/>that Rothko has created.

14
00:01:21,508 --> 00:01:22,797
They may look simple.

15
00:01:22,797 --> 00:01:28,780
On the other hand, to really figure out how he 
created those effects is far more complicated.

16
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:35,752
And it's not easy to understand <br/>what colors are actually

17
00:01:35,752 --> 00:01:38,111
in which layers on the canvas.

18
00:01:38,111 --> 00:01:43,765
The mystery of the whole thing <br/>is actually appropriate to Rothko's goals.

19
00:01:43,765 --> 00:01:50,384
He's wanting to make a picture <br/>which advertises its own mystery,

20
00:01:50,384 --> 00:01:56,166
it's solitary quality, <br/>it's introspective quality.

21
00:01:56,166 --> 00:02:02,634
It's a quality that he felt was <br/>reflecting his own state while painting.

22
00:02:02,634 --> 00:02:08,570
And I think it's a quality that <br/>he wanted to inspire in the viewers

23
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:12,208
who were in the space of his paintings.

24
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:17,740
In the exhibition, we've installed <br/>an entire room only of Rothko –

25
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:25,548
and not only for the reason that we have 
many beautiful paintings to present,

26
00:02:25,548 --> 00:02:30,701
but because of this power they 
have to create an environment,

27
00:02:30,701 --> 00:02:36,225
you feel the intimacy of the atmosphere 
that he has made for you.

28
00:02:36,225 --> 00:02:43,072
The point of Rothko's art is to 
provide a universe for viewers

29
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:46,128
that they don't have in the real world.

30
00:02:46,128 --> 00:02:50,287
There is definitely a spiritual <br/>side to what Rothko was doing.

31
00:02:50,287 --> 00:02:55,167
It's not at all an ironic art, <br/>or a kind of calculated,

32
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:57,953
clever, sort of tactical art.

33
00:02:57,953 --> 00:03:02,019
In fact, one of the quotations <br/>of Rothko that's repeated often

34
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:04,499
is, "Silence is so accurate."

35
00:03:04,499 --> 00:03:07,445
What he was really doing <br/>was extolling the power

36
00:03:07,445 --> 00:03:11,321
of an abstract language <br/>to say so much more

37
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:14,659
than words could do.

38
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:17,434
I think when you look at 
a painting by Rothko,

39
00:03:17,434 --> 00:03:21,648
you also realize what is 
meant by the term 'all over,'

40
00:03:21,648 --> 00:03:26,150
which is often used in regard 
to Abstract Expressionist painting.

41
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:31,678
It's not like there is center point – <br/>and the edges, or the corners,

42
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:37,652
or the sides are of lesser <br/>importance than the core.

43
00:03:37,652 --> 00:03:43,924
In fact, the action of the painting – <br/>if there is action – is distributed equally

44
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:47,150
from top to bottom, and from side to side.

45
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,709
And there is no way that you
can complete your experience

46
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:53,921
of that picture without 
letting your eye wander –

47
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:59,059
or even your body wander – all 
over the surface of that canvas.

48
00:03:59,059 --> 00:04:02,483
You end up feeling like you're <br/>in a zone with no gravity –

49
00:04:02,483 --> 00:04:04,521
almost that there is not a weight.

50
00:04:04,521 --> 00:04:09,284
Rothko often said that he liked his paintings 
to be hung rather low to the floor.

51
00:04:09,284 --> 00:04:13,787
The reason for that is that <br/>he really saw these paintings

52
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:19,164
as something that mattered in terms <br/>of the physical presence of the viewer.

53
00:04:19,164 --> 00:04:23,394
The physical presence of the viewer <br/>starts with their feet being on the floor.

54
00:04:23,394 --> 00:04:28,227
And he wants the paintings to – <br/>not literally begin on the floor –

55
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:34,294
but as close to that as is reasonably possible,
so that you're almost standing in the painting,

56
00:04:34,294 --> 00:04:39,914
rather than admiring some kind
of separate object on the wall.

57
00:04:39,914 --> 00:04:43,087
Your space is the painting 
space – and vice versa.

58
00:04:43,087 --> 00:04:48,999
Like many of the artists <br/>in the Abstract Expressionist era,

59
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:52,676
Rothko did not want <br/>his paintings to be framed.

60
00:04:52,676 --> 00:04:57,739
Paintings that were made on easels <br/>and then put on frames were understood

61
00:04:57,739 --> 00:05:03,989
to be allusions of another 
scene – of an imagined place.

62
00:05:03,989 --> 00:05:08,326
Rothko and his peers did not feel <br/>that they were alluding to another space,

63
00:05:08,326 --> 00:05:11,882
or place, or time with what they were making.

64
00:05:11,893 --> 00:05:17,631
What they were making was the reality 
that they wanted to present to the viewer.

65
00:05:17,631 --> 00:05:25,120
And for that reason, it didn't need the borderline 
of a frame separating its reality from their reality.

66
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,755
What they wanted was the joint 
reality of spectator and painting.
