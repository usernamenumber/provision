1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
   

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,650
I've told you multiple times
that the derivative of a curve

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,170
at a point is the slope of the
tangent line, but our

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,670
friend [? Akosh ?]

5
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,880
sent me a problem where it
actually wants you to find the

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,940
equation of the tangent line.

7
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,550
And I realize, I've never
actually done that.

8
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:16,840
So it's worthwhile.

9
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,540
So let's do that.

10
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,370
So it says, find the equation
of the tangent line to the

11
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:34,950
function f of x is equal to x e
to the x at x is equal to 1.

12
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,130
So let's just get an intuition
of what we're even looking for.

13
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,550
So this function is going to
look something like, I actually

14
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,150
graphed it, because it's not
a trivial function to graph.

15
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,340
So this is x e to the x,
this is what it looks like.

16
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,120
I'm just using a graphing
calculator, and you can

17
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,910
see, I just typed it in.

18
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,680
And what this is
asking us, is ok.

19
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,310
At the point, x is equal to 1.

20
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,440
So this is the point
x is equal to one.

21
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,130
So f of x is going to be
someplace up here, and

22
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,540
actually, f of x is going
to be equal to e, right?

23
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:08,220
Because f of 1 is
equal to what?

24
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,630
1 times e to the 1.

25
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:10,950
So it equals e.

26
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,170
So we're saying at the point,
at the point 1 comma e, so at

27
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,220
the point 1 comma 2.71,
whatever, whatever.

28
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,420
So that's what point?

29
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,740
That's this point.

30
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,780
So it's right here.

31
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,370
2 point, this is e right
here, the point 1 comma e.

32
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,320
So we want to do is figure
out the equation of the

33
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,690
line tangent to this point.

34
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,810
So what we're going to do, is
we're going to solve it by

35
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,540
figuring out its slope, which
is just the derivative

36
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,310
at that point.

37
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,860
So we have to figure
out the derivative at

38
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,140
exactly this point.

39
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,410
And then we use what we learned
from algebra 1 to figure out

40
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,970
its equation, and we'll graph
it here, just to confirm that

41
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:48,010
we actually figured out the
equation of the tangent line.

42
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,730
So the first thing we want to
know is the slope of the

43
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:54,850
tangent line, and that's just
the derivative at this point.

44
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,840
When x is equal to 1, or
at the point 1 comma e.

45
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,900
So what's the
derivative of this?

46
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,030
So f prime of x.

47
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,370
f prime of x is equal to,
well, this looks like a

48
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,100
job for the product rule.

49
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,080
Because we know how to figure
out the derivative of x, we

50
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,940
know how to figure out the
derivative of e to the x, and

51
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,370
they're just multiplying
by each other.

52
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,140
So the product rules help us.

53
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,105
The derivative of this thing
is going to be equal to the

54
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:20,100
derivative of the first
expression of the

55
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,820
first function.

56
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,810
So the derivative of x is just
1, times the second function,

57
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:32,220
times e to the x, plus the
first function, x, times the

58
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,050
derivative of the
second function.

59
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,430
So what's the derivative
of e to the x?

60
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,280
And that's what I find so
amazing about the number e, or

61
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,015
the function e to the x, is
that the derivative of e

62
00:02:42,015 --> 00:02:43,710
to the x is e to the x.

63
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,840
The slope at any point of
this curve is equal to the

64
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,760
value of the function.

65
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,570
So this is the derivative.

66
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,385
So what is the derivative of
this function at the point x

67
00:02:53,385 --> 00:02:55,560
is equal to 1, or at
the point 1 comma e?

68
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,610
So we just evaluate it.

69
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:06,080
We say f prime of 1 is equal to
1 time e to the 1 plus 1 times

70
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,150
e to the 1, well, that's
just equal e plus e.

71
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,585
And that's just equal to 2 e.

72
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:17,220
And you know, we could figure
out what that number, e is just

73
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,880
a constant number, but we write
e because it's easier to write

74
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:24,060
e than 2.7 et cetera, and an
infinite number of digits,

75
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,170
so we just write 2e.

76
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,240
So this is the slope of the
equation, or this is the slope

77
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,090
of the curve when x is equal to
one, or at the point

78
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:35,440
1e, or 1 f of 1.

79
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,760
So what is the equation
of the tangent line?

80
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,350
So let's go ahead and take this
form, the equation's going to

81
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:45,460
be y is equal to, I'm just
writing it in the, you know,

82
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:49,090
not the point slope, the mx
plus b form that you

83
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:49,840
learned in algebra.

84
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,570
So the slope is going to be 2e.

85
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,430
We just learned that here.

86
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,300
That's the derivative
when x is equal to 1.

87
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:02,220
So 2e times x plus
the y-intercept.

88
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,120
So if we can figure out
the y-intercept of this

89
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,790
line, we are done.

90
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:09,230
We have figured out the
equation of the tangent line.

91
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,690
So how do we do that?

92
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:13,960
Well, if we knew a y or
an x where this equation

93
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,080
goes through, we could
then solve for b.

94
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,230
And we know a y and x that
satisfies this equation.

95
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,410
The point 1 comma e.

96
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,770
The point where we're trying to
find the tangent line, right?

97
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,360
So this point, 1 comma e,
this is where we want to

98
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,510
find the tangent line.

99
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,870
And by definition, the
tangent line is going to

100
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,080
go through that point.

101
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,002
So let's substitute those
points back in here, or this

102
00:04:37,002 --> 00:04:41,050
point back into this equation,
and then solve for b.

103
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:48,170
So y is equal to e, is equal to
2 e, that's just the slope at

104
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:52,040
that point, times x,
times 1, plus b.

105
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,620
It might confuse you, because
e, you'll say, oh, e,

106
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,030
is that a variable?

107
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,800
No, it's a number,
remember, it's like pi.

108
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,220
It's a number.

109
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,900
You can substitute 2.7 whatever
there, but we're not doing

110
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,340
that, because this is cleaner.

111
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,100
And let's solve.

112
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:08,000
So you get e is
equal to 2e plus b.

113
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,880
Let's subtract 2e
from both sides.

114
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,030
You get b is equal
to e minus 2e.

115
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,430
b is equal to minus e.

116
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,010
Now we're done.

117
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:21,940
What's the equation
of the tangent line?

118
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:29,670
It is y is equal to
2 times e x plus b.

119
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:33,000
But b is minus e,
so it's minus e.

120
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,950
So this is the equation
of the tangent line.

121
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,270
If you don't like these e's
there, you could replace that

122
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,920
with the number 2.7 et cetera,
and this would become 5 point

123
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,780
something, and this would
just be minus 2.7 something.

124
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,920
But this looks neater.

125
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,830
And let's confirm.

126
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:49,550
Let's use this little graphing
calculator to confirm that that

127
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,140
really is the equation
of the tangent line.

128
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,910
So let me type it in here.

129
00:05:54,910 --> 00:06:13,330
So it's 2, 2 times e times x,
right, that's 2ex minus e.

130
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:17,240
And let us graph this line.

131
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,200
There we go.

132
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,100
It graphed it.

133
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,860
And notice that that line, that
green line, I don't know if you

134
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,700
can, maybe I need to make this
bigger for it to

135
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,920
show up, bolder.

136
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,830
I don't know if that helps.

137
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,620
   

138
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,800
But if you look here, so this
red, this is our original

139
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,390
equation, x e to the
x, that's this curve.

140
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:40,810
We want to know equation
of the tangent line

141
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,530
at x is equal to 1.

142
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,035
So it's the point
x is equal to 1.

143
00:06:44,035 --> 00:06:47,990
And when x is equal to 1, f of
x is e, right, you can just

144
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,900
substitute back into the
original equation to get that.

145
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,710
So this is the
point, 1 comma e.

146
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,470
So the equation of the tangent
line, its slope is going to be

147
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,800
the derivative at this point.

148
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,410
So we solved the derivative of
this function, and evaluated

149
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,310
it at x is equal to 1.

150
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:03,910
That's what we did here.

151
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,970
We figured out the derivative,
evaluated x equals 1.

152
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,200
And so we said, OK, the slope.

153
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:15,970
The slope at when x is equal to
1 and y is equal to e, the

154
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,640
slope at that point
is equal to 2e.

155
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,630
And we figured that out
from the derivative.

156
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:23,840
And then we just used our
algebra 1 skills to figure out

157
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,230
the equation of that line.

158
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,160
And how did we do that?

159
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,450
We knew the slope, because
that's just the derivative

160
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,250
at that point.

161
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,590
And then we just have to
solve for the y-intercept.

162
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:36,100
And the way we did that is we
said, well, the point 1 comma e

163
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,250
is on this green line as well.

164
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,420
So we substituted that in, and
solve for our y-intercept,

165
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,930
which we got as minus e, and
notice that this line

166
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,200
intersects the y-axis at minus
e, that's about minus

167
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,420
2.7 something.

168
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,230
And there we have it.

169
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:52,700
We have shown that, and
visually, it shows that

170
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,890
this is the tangent line.

171
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:59,380
Anyway, hope you found
that vaguely useful.

172
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,400
If you did, you should
thank [? Akosh ?]

173
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,110
for being unusually persistent,
and having me do this problem.

174
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,000
See you in the next video.
