1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:02,850
Welcome back. We're on problem number 13.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,640
And actually, I started problem number 13 at the end of the

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,350
last video, and then I realized when I was going through

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,320
the choices that I wasn't explaining it perfectly correctly.

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,430
And I have to admit,this is the first problem that of any of

6
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,360
the problems we've seen on the SAT, this is probably the one

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,010
that--the wording is probably the most difficult to interpret

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,670
But I think I've figured it out now. So they're saying

9
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,740
Kyle's lock combination consists of three two digit numbers.

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,540
The combination satisfies three conditions below.

11
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:35,400
One number is odd, one number is a multiple of 5, so we'll

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,710
just write that as times 5, and then one number is a day

13
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,290
of the month of Kyle's birthday.

14
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,470
And actually, this is what confused me,

15
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,310
it actually matters that it's his birthday,

16
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,090
not that it's just a day of the month, and I'll show you why.

17
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:01,520
So let's say we have choice A.

18
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,180
And let me color code these conditions.

19
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,050
So odd I'll do in this blue color.

20
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:14,060
Let me see, and times 5 in this yellow color.

21
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,670
And then-- let me pick another good color-- brown, the day of

22
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:20,850
the month of his birthday.

23
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,650
So the first choice-- and now let me write these down in a

24
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,070
fairly neutral color,in this magenta.

25
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:37,030
So choice A says 14, 20, and 13.

26
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,850
So what we can do is, let's see,one of the numbers has to

27
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,060
be odd, and only one of the numbers, right?

28
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,620
So let's say this one.

29
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,810
This satisfies the odd condition, and actually only

30
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,030
satisfies the odd condition.

31
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,000
Then let's see, what number here is times 5, a multiple of 5?

32
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,010
Well, this number-- let me do it in the yellow-- this number

33
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,550
is a multiple of 5.

34
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,980
And then, finally, if that one is the multiple of 5, which

35
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,060
one has to be the day of the month of his birthday?

36
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,170
Well, it's this choice,right here. Now what confused me,

37
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,040
when I first did this problem, and probably confused you

38
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,270
as well,it says if each number satisfies exactly one of the

39
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,560
conditions exactly one, exactly one, right? So to me

40
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,880
that means that it can only satisfy one of the conditions.

41
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:31,690
And what confused me was that 20 satisfies multiple of five,

42
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:39,030
but to me 20 could just as easily be a day of a month, right?

43
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,000
But the problem that this encounters is here we have to

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,630
kind of assume that the 14th is his birthday.

45
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:51,280
Because--let's put it this way--if the 20th was his birthday,

46
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,740
this works if, and only if, the 14th is his birthday.

47
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,000
which it could be.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,230
And if the 14th is his birthday,then 20 doesn't

49
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,040
satisfy the day of the month of his birthday.

50
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,780
It satisfies a day of the month,

51
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,000
it wouldn't satisfy the day of the month of his birthday.

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,160
That might seem a little technical, but I think you'll see

53
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,060
why I have to make that distinction,as you go on to choice B.

54
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,830
Choice B says-- let me do it in that neutral color--

55
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:25,550
it's 14, 25, and 13.

56
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:32,410
So here,once again,13 satisfies the odd criteria.We could say

57
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:36,920
that 14-- we'll assume that his birthday is the 14th,

58
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,000
we don't know, they haven't told us, but it could be, right?

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,810
That's what they're asking, what could be the combination

60
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,070
of the lock.

61
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,450
So we'll say that the 14th could be his birthday.

62
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,280
And if the 14th is his birthday, what does 25 satisfy?

63
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,710
Well, 25 now satisfies the odd criteria, and it satisfies the

64
00:03:53,710 --> 00:04:01,000
multiple of 5 criteria. So this option, choice B, does not work.

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,010
Because 25 satisfies two of the criteria.

66
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,350
And I know what you're saying, well look, in choice A,

67
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,540
doesn't 20 satisfy two criteria?

68
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,880
Doesn't it satisfy that it could be a day of the month?

69
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,420
And what I'm saying is, if we assume that the 14th is his

70
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:19,260
birthday, then 20 does not satisfy the day of his birthday.

71
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,160
Right?

72
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,710
We're assuming the 14th is his birthday.

73
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:22,770
I want you to think that about it.

74
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,020
20 satisfies a potential day of the month, but if we assume

75
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,080
his birthday is the 14th,then obviously 20th is not the 14th.

76
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:34,570
And we could go through the other choices.

77
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:43,530
Choice C says 15--let me do it in a neutral color--15,18, 16.

78
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:47,540
And here, let's say one of them has to be odd.

79
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,030
There's only one odd option here, it's this one.

80
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,050
One of them has to be a multiple of 5.

81
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,010
Well, there's no multiples of 5 here, so we know that C is

82
00:04:54,010 --> 00:05:04,030
not the right answer. D-- 20, 15, 20.

83
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,510
Well here we have two of the same number,

84
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,000
so they're going to satisfy the same criteria.

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,840
So they're each either going to satisfy two criteria,

86
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,680
or they're each going to satisfy none.

87
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,050
And they actually both satisfy--you know, there's

88
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:19,510
only one odd one here, so one of the 20's has to satisfy the

89
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,030
day of the month of his birthday.

90
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:25,590
But if the day of the month of his birthday is 20th, and

91
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:30,060
then we used the multiple of five as being the 20th as well,

92
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,560
then both of these numbers satisfy the day of his birthday,

93
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,110
and a multiple of 5. So that can't be the choice. Then E,

94
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:47,060
choice E--let me do it in a neutral color again--is 34,30,21.

95
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,760
And see 34, it's not odd, it's not a multiple of 5, and it

96
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,640
can't be a day of the month of someone's birthday,

97
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,010
so that one doesn't work.

98
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,290
I think these three are obvious to you, why they don't work.

99
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:02,210
Here the subtlety is that this criteria isn't just

100
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,000
a day of the month.

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The criteria doesn't just say,any number between 1 and 31.

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,430
It has to be the day of the month of his birthday.

103
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,030
So we have to kind of pick, we have to say, let's assume that

104
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,020
his birthday is the 14th.

105
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,500
If his birthday is the 14th,and this is the day of the

106
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,500
month of his birthday,then 20 is of course not the day of the

107
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,000
month of his birthday.So it doesn't satisfy this criterion.

108
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It only satisfies times 5.

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,380
So that's how you have to think about it, and I have to

110
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:33,010
completely admit that I think that this is a little bit of a

111
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:36,430
too nuanced question. Out of the five tests we've done so far,

112
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,040
this is the first one that I had to take a little bit of

113
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,070
off time to figure out on my own.

114
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,130
Let's move on to the next problem,

115
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,000
now that we have that one out of the way.

116
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,690
Problem number 14.

117
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,030
Just hope you don't face that when you take the SAT.

118
00:06:54,030 --> 00:07:01,000
Square root of x plus 9 is equal to x minus 3.

119
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,870
And they say, for all values of x greater than 3,

120
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:10,070
the equation above is equivalent to which of the following?

121
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,630
Let's see where this goes.

122
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,020
So let's square both sides of this equation.

123
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,830
Let's square both sides,

124
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,050
just to get rid of the square root sign.

125
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,650
So the left hand side-- I'm going to switch colors--

126
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,090
becomes x plus 9.

127
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:27,280
And then we just have to multiply that out, so that becomes

128
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:33,400
x squared-- x times x-- and then minus 6x plus 9, right?

129
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,740
You have x times minus 3 is minus 3x,

130
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,630
and when you multiply it again, you get minus 3x again.

131
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,820
And if you don't remember how to do this,

132
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,000
you might want to just multiply it x minus 3 times x minus 3.

133
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,100
Going back to this, so this is the relation.

134
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,440
And they want us to write in terms of x.

135
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,020
So let's subtract 9 from both sides.

136
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,080
We get x is equal to x squared minus 6x.

137
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,970
And that is choice C. And we are done.

138
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:08,950
And the reason why they said x is greater than 3 is because

139
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,000
they actually-- well, they didn't want you to take the

140
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,020
negative square root, right? They wanted you to make sure

141
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,080
that this is the positive square root.

142
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,030
Next problem, problem 15.

143
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:31,120
How many integers in the set of all integers from 1 to 100

144
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,010
inclusive are not the square of an integer?

145
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:40,030
So it's 1 to 100 inclusive,so it includes 1 and 100.

146
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:43,230
So what we have to think about is how many squares are there

147
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:50,390
between 1 and 100? Well, 100 is 10 squared, 1 is 1 squared,

148
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,140
so every number between 1 and 10 squared is going to be

149
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,340
in this range, right? 2 squared- so these are the numbers

150
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:03,770
whose squares-- 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10-- and of course,

151
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,770
those are 10 numbers, right? So they're 10 numbers

152
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:10,770
you know,1 squared is 1,2 squared is 4 all of these numbers

153
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,730
are going to be between 1 and 100 inclusive.

154
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,730
So all of these numbers are there, there's 10 of them.

155
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,750
So how many of them are not a perfect square?

156
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:22,130
It's going to be 100 minus 10--minus these 10 numbers.

157
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:27,000
So it's 90. Which is choice E.

158
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,010
I'll see you in the next video.
