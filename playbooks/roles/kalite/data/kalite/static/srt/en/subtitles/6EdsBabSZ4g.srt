1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,276
Let's think a little bit about the different clues that have led us to conclude

2
00:00:04,276 --> 00:00:10,003
that we have these lithospheric plates moving relative to each other.

3
00:00:10,003 --> 00:00:19,296
Now, the first clue. This is something I think many students even in elementary school first experience when they first learn about geography,

4
00:00:19,296 --> 00:00:22,697
it looks like the continents could kind of fit into each other.

5
00:00:22,697 --> 00:00:27,383
The most obvious one of these is when you look at this kind of little pointy part of South America,

6
00:00:27,383 --> 00:00:35,373
if you have a more detailed map, it really is amazing how well it seems to fit into the Nigerian basin in Africa.

7
00:00:35,373 --> 00:00:41,712
It looks like at one time this little pointy part was nudged into this part of Africa that they were actually connected.

8
00:00:41,712 --> 00:00:45,739
And if you're a little bit more creative, there are other parts of the world that you can kind of start to see

9
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:49,923
how they might have fit in with each other in the past.

10
00:00:49,923 --> 00:00:55,868
That by itself is just a very small clue but kind of hints at,

11
00:00:55,884 --> 00:01:00,529
you know, if they at one time were fitting, were next to each other or were kind of connected,

12
00:01:00,529 --> 00:01:02,993
then they have had to move departed some time.

13
00:01:02,993 --> 00:01:07,003
Although it doesn't tell us that it is still moving or what might have caused the move.

14
00:01:07,003 --> 00:01:09,910
But it definitely doesn't tell us that they even moved.

15
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:18,006
Maybe this is just a coincidence that this coast of South America looks very similar to this coast of Africa.

16
00:01:18,006 --> 00:01:24,238
Now, the next clues we really came over I would say by the last 60 or 70 years.

17
00:01:24,238 --> 00:01:28,870
The first clue is that OK, if you go to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge right here, so if you look at the Atlantic Ocean,

18
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,482
let me look at this photograph right over here.

19
00:01:31,482 --> 00:01:37,153
So this is... you normally don't see the oceans highlighted like this, so let me make it very clear to you.

20
00:01:37,153 --> 00:01:41,149
This right here is South America.

21
00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:43,960
This right here is Africa.

22
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,239
This right here is North America.

23
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,867
And if you actually look at the elevations in the middle of the ocean,

24
00:01:49,867 --> 00:01:55,153
people noticed in the middle of the 20th century that there is a ridge in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean!

25
00:01:55,153 --> 00:02:00,507
There is kind of a mountain ridge that goes straight up the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

26
00:02:00,507 --> 00:02:05,869
So, that by itself doesn't tell you that these plates are moving apart,

27
00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:08,602
but it is kind of a curious thing to look at.

28
00:02:08,602 --> 00:02:12,499
And that all means that at these ridges are a lot of a underwater vulcanic activity.

29
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:17,866
You have magma and lava flowing into the water and it's kind of forming this ridge

30
00:02:17,866 --> 00:02:20,402
that really goes across the whole Atlantic Ocean.

31
00:02:20,402 --> 00:02:23,485
There are other ridges in the world like that - underwater ridges.

32
00:02:23,485 --> 00:02:26,070
You have one over here in the Pacific Ocean.

33
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,663
You have these here in the Indian Ocean.

34
00:02:29,663 --> 00:02:34,150
So that by itself is just a little clue, but that by itself doesn't explain,

35
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:40,153
doesn't tell you that these plates are actually moving apart at the ridge.

36
00:02:40,153 --> 00:02:46,400
The more conclusive, this is just the beginning of the clue, but what made this conclusive

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,403
is the separate discovery. And this is what's interesting,

38
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:55,549
because you had these separate discoveries in different domains that eventually led you to a pretty neat conclusion.

39
00:02:55,549 --> 00:03:00,239
So you've had a separate discovery that if you look at different errors of magnetic rock,

40
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,341
or maybe I should say different magnetic rock from different periods in geologic time,

41
00:03:05,341 --> 00:03:08,460
and you can tell where they are in geologic time by why they are layered,

42
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:13,280
so this would be newer rock,

43
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,911
and then this would be a little bit older,

44
00:03:16,911 --> 00:03:21,234
and then this would be even older.

45
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:28,233
Geologists noticed something interesting. If I would take magnetic rock and if it was molten lava,

46
00:03:28,233 --> 00:03:34,706
and remember, it's a magnetic rock, so it would align with the poles the same way a compass would.

47
00:03:34,706 --> 00:03:39,409
So if I had a bunch of mangetic.. so let's say this is a lava right here.

48
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:46,419
And so the molecules can align themselves when it's liquid,

49
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:50,942
they can align themselves, they go in a natural one align with the poles.

50
00:03:50,942 --> 00:04:00,565
So they naturally all want to align in one direction

51
00:04:00,565 --> 00:04:03,257
because of Earth's magnetic field.

52
00:04:03,301 --> 00:04:09,391
And so when that lava hardens into actual rock, that alignment would kind of be frozen.

53
00:04:09,391 --> 00:04:16,525
Now, if Earth's magnetic field was constat over time, then when you look at magnetic rocks from any period,

54
00:04:16,525 --> 00:04:20,257
you would expect them all to be aligned in the same direction.

55
00:04:20,257 --> 00:04:24,233
So it's as we are taking a cross-section of this rock,

56
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:29,166
let's say an alignment towards the north pole looks like this.

57
00:04:29,181 --> 00:04:32,989
I draw it like that, that's an arrow pointing into our screen.

58
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:35,637
Now, let say an alignment pointing to the south pole would look like this.

59
00:04:35,637 --> 00:04:38,429
This would be an arrow pointing out of our screen.

60
00:04:38,429 --> 00:04:46,191
So what you expect is that newer rock, that kind of the alignment of the rock would go into the screen.

61
00:04:46,191 --> 00:04:49,399
And then the older rock, it would still go into the screen.

62
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:53,682
It looks like a top view just so let me draw like this as so I make sure every one is on the same pace.

63
00:04:53,682 --> 00:04:55,460
Let my just draw a cross-section like this.

64
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,640
So we know what we are talking about.

65
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,194
Let my draw a cross-section like this.

66
00:05:03,194 --> 00:05:07,481
So this is the surfcace appear.

67
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:15,054
When I talk about going into the page that means that the magnetic rock would be aligned in that direction.

68
00:05:15,054 --> 00:05:19,288
And when I talk about going out of the page that means, so I would go to draw it like that,

69
00:05:19,288 --> 00:05:23,364
that means that the magnetic rock would be aligned in that direction.

70
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:27,062
Now, like I said, if the magnetic field of Earth never changes,

71
00:05:27,062 --> 00:05:34,456
then lava that essentially turns into hard, cools down into non-lava rock, you could say it freezes into rock,

72
00:05:34,456 --> 00:05:41,195
it would all point into the same direction regardless of when it hardened.

73
00:05:41,195 --> 00:05:44,258
This would be the situation in a constatn magnetic field.

74
00:05:44,258 --> 00:05:47,328
But what we've seen is that that's not the case.

75
00:05:47,328 --> 00:05:52,914
When you look at older magnetic rock, then, depending on how old you go,

76
00:05:52,914 --> 00:05:56,495
you have the newer rock that's aligned with our current magnetick field,

77
00:05:56,495 --> 00:06:00,923
you go a little bit older, and right now we think it's about 780,000 years ago roughly,

78
00:06:00,923 --> 00:06:04,326
you have to find magnetic rock that hardened at that time,

79
00:06:04,326 --> 00:06:07,857
it's actually in the opposite direction.

80
00:06:07,857 --> 00:06:17,791
So actually the magnetick rock is hardened in a way as if the north pole was at the south pole now, the magnetic north pole.

81
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:23,462
So it's aligned in the opposite direction. So it's kind of pointing out of the page here.

82
00:06:23,462 --> 00:06:29,191
And if you get even older rock, it's more aligned with our traditional direction. So it's more aligned than that.

83
00:06:29,191 --> 00:06:34,005
And so the only reasonable conclusion that we can draw from this

84
00:06:34,005 --> 00:06:38,455
is that Earth's magnetic field has actually fluctuated over time.

85
00:06:38,455 --> 00:06:50,268
Magnetic field fluctuates.

86
00:06:50,345 --> 00:06:55,990
Now you probably are thinking: 'Sal, how was this relevant to plate tectonics?'

87
00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:00,196
Well, once you accept that magnetic field fluctuates over the history of the Earth,

88
00:07:00,196 --> 00:07:07,656
there is another interesting observation you can make about the rock that's kind of at the basin of the ocean floor.

89
00:07:07,656 --> 00:07:17,877
So not only do have this Mid-Atlanic Ridge have these volcanoes spuming kind of new rock into the ocean

90
00:07:17,877 --> 00:07:20,472
creating this kind of underwater mountain ridge,

91
00:07:20,472 --> 00:07:29,328
but it also turns out that the rock that forms the seafloor also contains a lot of magnetit which is magnetic.

92
00:07:29,328 --> 00:07:32,725
And what's really interesting about that - so let me draw.

93
00:07:32,725 --> 00:07:36,597
So we have a top-view just like we have over here.

94
00:07:36,597 --> 00:07:50,490
So let's say this is the Mid-Atlantic Ridge right here.

95
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:54,723
And this is really cool. When they looked at rocks that are very close to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge,

96
00:07:54,723 --> 00:07:59,256
and once again, we're looking at rocks that are at the floor of the ocean,

97
00:07:59,256 --> 00:08:04,395
they're aligned in the way that you would expect with the current magnetic field.

98
00:08:04,395 --> 00:08:12,390
They're aligned just like that, the way you would expect when you look at the magnetic rock that's close to the ridge.

99
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:17,262
But if you go a little bit further, when I say a little bit, I'm talking about thousands of miles,

100
00:08:17,262 --> 00:08:27,342
but if you go further out of that, you have stripes of other magnetic rock that is going the opposite direction.

101
00:08:27,342 --> 00:08:31,922
It's going like this.

102
00:08:31,922 --> 00:08:38,799
And what's even cooler than the idea that it switches directions depending on how far you've gone from the rift,

103
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:45,568
is that there's a symetric stripe of magnetic rock on exactly the same distance,

104
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:53,330
or roughly the same distance away from the rift that's also pointing in that same direction.

105
00:08:53,330 --> 00:09:01,723
And you go a little bit further out and you'll find some rock that's pointing in the original direction.

106
00:09:01,723 --> 00:09:05,616
And even better, you go on the symetric other side of the actual ridge,

107
00:09:05,616 --> 00:09:11,974
and you find another set of rocks that's doing the exact same thing.

108
00:09:11,974 --> 00:09:17,621
So if you accept that Earth's magnetic field has kind of been flip-flopping over time,

109
00:09:17,621 --> 00:09:23,056
the only reasonable conlusion that at least I can think of or geologists can think of,

110
00:09:23,056 --> 00:09:31,124
is that all of this was formed at a similar period in time.

111
00:09:31,124 --> 00:09:36,858
This came out as lava, magnetic lava, and the all aligned with Earth's magnetic field and that's why it looks similar.

112
00:09:36,858 --> 00:09:43,334
You fast-forward in time some, or actually let's not fast-forward in time.

113
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:47,590
The only way that these could have formed and they could have been so similar,

114
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:56,130
so if we rewind in time, the only way that these purple magnetic rocks could have aligned this exactly same way in the same distances,

115
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,817
is that in some point they were much closer to each other and were actually connected.

116
00:09:59,817 --> 00:10:05,992
So if we rewind in time maybe at the Mid-Atlantic Rift you had all of the purple rock

117
00:10:05,992 --> 00:10:18,228
coming out from those underwater volcanoes and at that time Earth's magnetic field was the opposite as it's right now.

118
00:10:18,228 --> 00:10:25,323
And then of course you had this blue rock that is looking like that.

119
00:10:25,323 --> 00:10:30,563
And so this seems like a reasonable explanation. This rock and this rock were at some point touching,

120
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:34,225
they were actually formed at the exact place and at the same time.

121
00:10:34,225 --> 00:10:42,655
And so if this is the case that one point this purple rock was all together and they formed at the same time at the Mid-Atlantic Rift,

122
00:10:42,655 --> 00:10:45,466
we're assuming all the rock was, well, we don't have to make that assumption,

123
00:10:45,466 --> 00:10:50,590
but if you assume that they formed at the same time, and based on the pattern it does look like they do,

124
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:56,329
it's a symetric distace away from that rift, that the only reasonable conclusion I can think of

125
00:10:56,329 --> 00:11:02,056
is that the rift has had to move apart from this period to that period.

126
00:11:02,056 --> 00:11:05,552
And there was a time when all this blue rock was together.

127
00:11:05,552 --> 00:11:09,879
So that by itself frankly is the most affinitive evidence in the 1960s

128
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:16,967
when it kind of became conclusive that you did have these plate that were moving away from each other.

129
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:21,799
Now, obviously the plates are moving away from each other at some point,

130
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:27,633
and that means that based on how the map looks, at some point they're also going to move into each other,

131
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:32,392
we can talk more about that in future videos, but at certain point they're actually moving on,

132
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:37,214
one plate is moving under another. We'll talk about how that might partially explain,

133
00:11:37,214 --> 00:11:41,122
I won't talk about all of the explanations of why we think the plates might actually be moving.

134
00:11:41,122 --> 00:11:46,189
But if we fast-forward the more present time as now we have the GPS satellites and all the rest,

135
00:11:46,189 --> 00:11:48,965
we can actually measure the movement of the plates.

136
00:11:48,965 --> 00:11:57,055
This is an image from NASA showing the vectors of the movements at different points on the surface of the planet.

137
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:03,661
And you could see we've got a lot of vectors from the U.S., it's hard to read, it's so chock-full of vectors.

138
00:12:03,661 --> 00:12:12,795
We can see right over here why the Pacific Plate at that point is moving in this northwest direction. And it's measured by GPS satellites.

139
00:12:12,795 --> 00:12:18,589
And I wanna make clear - this movements is relatively slow, it's roughly the speed in which fingernails grow.

140
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:22,874
But if you do it over millions of years, that actually amounts to thousands of miles.

141
00:12:22,874 --> 00:12:27,392
We're talking on the order of about a centimetre a year for most of the plates,

142
00:12:27,392 --> 00:12:31,468
some of the plates might be moving a little bit faster, maybe close to 10 or 15 cm,

143
00:12:31,468 --> 00:12:35,656
but most of them are moving about a centimetre a year, at the same rate your fingernails are growing.

144
00:12:35,656 --> 00:12:39,129
But this is fantastic 'cause you can actually measure it because GPS is so accurate.

145
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:44,931
We can see that the North-American Plate is kind of rotating generally in that direction.

146
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:53,801
The Nazca Plate right here is moving roughly in that direction into the South-American Plate.

147
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:57,965
I'll leave you there right now... actually before I leave you there,

148
00:12:57,965 --> 00:13:03,524
this is another thing that I though to recap that shows that same magnetic strenght it's maybe a slightly neater drawn,

149
00:13:03,524 --> 00:13:06,464
I don't know which one might be more helpful for you.

150
00:13:06,464 --> 00:13:10,798
But I'll leave you there in this video. In the next video we'll think about some of the theories.

151
00:13:10,798 --> 00:13:18,089
We know now that the plates are moving. Let's about some of the theories as to why they might actually be moving.
