1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,190
   

2
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:04,980
Let's keep going with our
2008 Calculus BC free

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:05,780
answer questions.

4
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,250
So we're on problem number 2.

5
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,480
And I cut and pasted the table
that they gave for the problem.

6
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,790
And I'll read the
rest of the problem.

7
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,100
And let's see what we can do.

8
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:17,250
So it says concert tickets went
on sale at noon, t equals 0,

9
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,630
and were sold out
within 9 hours.

10
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,130
The number of people waiting in
line to purchase tickets at

11
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,780
time t, is modeled by a
twice differentiable

12
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,560
function L, L of t.

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,350
So this is the number of people
waiting in line at anytime.

14
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:38,180
And this is noon, 12:00
noon, 1:00 pm, 9:00 pm.

15
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,070
All the tickets are
sold by 9:00 pm.

16
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,710
And they tell us it's
twice differentiable.

17
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,900
So that means that whatever
function we're modeling this,

18
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,020
this L of t, that it's
continuous because

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,960
it's differentiable.

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,300
And since it's twice
differentiable, we also know

21
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,350
that its derivative is
continuous because the second

22
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,330
derivative exists
at all points.

23
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:04,140
So it says part a-- let me make
sure I'm not writing too

24
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:11,440
thickly-- use the data in the
table to estimate the rate--

25
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,740
let me actually just copy
and paste this, I've just

26
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,890
figured out how to do this.

27
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,350
So I figure it doesn't hurt.

28
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:24,310
   

29
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:24,700
There you go.

30
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,350
You probably can't read it.

31
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,690
But it says use the data in the
table to estimate the rate at

32
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,970
which the number of people
waiting in line was

33
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,030
changing at 5:30 pm.

34
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,370
So they don't give us
any data on 5:30 pm.

35
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:43,980
They give us 4:00 pm and
7:00 pm, or t equals 5.5.

36
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,710
Show the computations that
lead to your answer.

37
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,430
Indicate the units of measure.

38
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,280
So what do they want to know?

39
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,520
They want to know an estimate
of the rate at which the

40
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,220
number of people waiting
in line was changing.

41
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,830
So they don't give us a
continuous function definition.

42
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,200
They just give us a bunch
of sample points of

43
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,620
this function L of t.

44
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:08,700
So the best estimate I can do,
of the rate at which this L of

45
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,520
t is changing at time 5.5-- and
5.5 is in between these two--

46
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,840
is to just figure out the
average rate of change

47
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,770
between time 4 and time 7.

48
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:19,860
So how do we figure that out?

49
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,760
Well the average rate of
change is just the slope.

50
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,790
So let's write it.

51
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,810
   

52
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:35,760
So we could write average
rate of change or delta

53
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,770
L over delta t at 5.5.

54
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,790
You can write it however you
want, however you think that

55
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,770
the exam graders would
best like to see it.

56
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:48,130
We could say at time 5.5.

57
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,835
We could say approximately
equals, or whatever.

58
00:02:49,835 --> 00:02:52,140
But it's just going to be the
slope between these two points.

59
00:02:52,140 --> 00:03:00,400
So it's L of 7 minus L of 4,
all of that over 7 over 4.

60
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,210
Rise over run or change in
the value of the function

61
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,930
divided by change in the
independent variable.

62
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,520
L of 7 is 154.

63
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,250
They give us that.

64
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:16,930
L of 4 is 126.

65
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,790
And we divide it by 7 minus 4.

66
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:31,880
So that equals 54 minus
126 is 24 plus 26 is 50.

67
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,960
So it's equal to 28.

68
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,880
   

69
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,910
Right, if this was 2
less, it would be 30.

70
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,660
And 7 minus 4 is 3.

71
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,010
So you could say that
the average rate of

72
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,950
change is 28 over 3.

73
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:50,550
Or you could write
that as 9 1/3.

74
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,530
And they want us to use
the units of measure.

75
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,450
Indicate units of measure.

76
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,905
So the numerator,
this is people.

77
00:03:56,905 --> 00:04:01,850
   

78
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:02,570
And what's the denominator?

79
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,150
It's hours, people per hour.

80
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,290
So my best estimate, or our
best estimate of the rate at

81
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,580
which the number of people
waiting in line was changing at

82
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,410
5:30 pm, which is between these
two points, is the average

83
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,640
slope between these two points.

84
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,890
Which is 9 1/3 people per hour.

85
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,790
That's it.

86
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,180
Let's do part b.

87
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:29,055
Let me clear all of this so we
have enough space for part b.

88
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,370
And I'll copy and don't
know if you can read it.

89
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,770
But maybe you can.

90
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,735
So doesn't hurt to
just copy and paste.

91
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:42,510
   

92
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:48,060
OK part b says, use a
trapezoidal sum with

93
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,550
three subintervals.

94
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,780
Maybe I can make this
a little bit bigger.

95
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,930
Let me see if I can grow
that a little bit.

96
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,170
I don't want to take up
all the space though.

97
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,850
No that doesn't look good.

98
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:04,570
   

99
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,590
OK well I'll read it out loud
in case you can't see it.

100
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:11,670
Use a trapezoidal sum with
three subintervals to estimate

101
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,810
the average number of people
waiting in line during the

102
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,420
first 4 hours that the
tickets were on sale.

103
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,550
If you want to do this
really fast, you wouldn't

104
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,480
have to graph it.

105
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,500
But I'm about to graph it
because I want you to

106
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,250
understand how to
do this problem.

107
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,770
If you understand it, you
don't have to graph it.

108
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,930
So let's graph some
of these points.

109
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,770
And we really just have
to do the first 4 hours.

110
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,580
Actually let's graph all
of them, just because it

111
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:37,710
might be useful in future
parts of the problem.

112
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,023
If you weren't graphing it
while recording a video, it

113
00:05:40,023 --> 00:05:41,080
probably would be a
little bit faster.

114
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,470
   

115
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,305
That should be good enough.

116
00:05:45,305 --> 00:05:48,760
   

117
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,920
What are our data points?

118
00:05:49,920 --> 00:06:03,800
We have 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

119
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,930
You don't have do it so neatly.

120
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,690
Well it's good to do it neatly
when you're doing the exam,

121
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,600
because otherwise you'll
confuse yourself.

122
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,640
And let's see, how high
should my L values?

123
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,272
This is time right here.

124
00:06:14,272 --> 00:06:18,250
This is my L of t axis.

125
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,180
It goes up to about, 176
is a high point, at least

126
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,040
on the data we have.

127
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,270
Let's say this is 200.

128
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:33,410
So halfway up would be 100.

129
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:37,320
This would be 150.

130
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,770
This would be 50.

131
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,080
I don't know what
that sound was from.

132
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,370
But let's keep going forward.

133
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,570
Let's plot the points.

134
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,260
At t equals 0 there are
120 people in line.

135
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,910
That's about right there.

136
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,520
At t equals 1, 156.

137
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,630
I'm just approximating.

138
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,280
It's about right there.

139
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,180
At t equals 3-- they skip
2-- at t equals 3 it's

140
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,730
176 people in line.

141
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,640
So that's going to be
right about there,

142
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,520
just approximating it.

143
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,520
At t equals 4, we have
126 people in line.

144
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,870
It's a little bit more
than at t equals 0.

145
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:17,242
At t equals 7, we have
150 people in line.

146
00:07:17,242 --> 00:07:18,840
It's right about there.

147
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,480
At t equals 8 we have 80.

148
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,050
That's about right there.

149
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,500
And t equal 9, the
line is gone.

150
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,000
Everyone has gotten
their tickets, or maybe

151
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,220
they got sold out.

152
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,660
Let's connect those points.

153
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,681
Connect the dots.

154
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:36,850
So from here to there.

155
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,490
And from there to there.

156
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,890
There to there.

157
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:45,240
There to there, almost done.

158
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,570
OK so we've at least plotted
the sample points and

159
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,160
connected them with lines.

160
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,830
We know that the real L of t,
whatever we used to approximate

161
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,590
it, it's not going to have
these sharp edges because

162
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,660
it's differentiable.

163
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,660
It's actually twice
differentiable.

164
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,460
So it's actually going to be
a smoother curve, right?

165
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,790
Because we can take the
derivative of any point.

166
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,200
If this was the actual
function, you wouldn't be

167
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,950
able to take a derivative
at this point.

168
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:10,640
Because there's a positive
slope here and then it

169
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,190
immediately switches to a
negative slope like the

170
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,160
absolute value functions.

171
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,220
You actually wouldn't
be able to take the

172
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,660
derivative at that point.

173
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,090
But anyway back to the problem.

174
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,650
Use a trapezoidal sum with
three subintervals to estimate

175
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,390
the average number of people
waiting in line during

176
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,020
the first 4 hours.

177
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,600
So the first 4 hours,
that's right here.

178
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,210
Now this might seem
kind of daunting.

179
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,080
The trapezoidal sum
for the fourth.

180
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,860
Actually I just realized.

181
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,270
For some reason, YouTube used
to let me do longer videos

182
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,270
because I thought
I was a partner.

183
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,270
But now for some reason it's
been limiting me again.

184
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,380
So I will continue part
b in the next video.

185
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,882
See you soon.

186
00:08:44,882 --> 00:08:44,900
