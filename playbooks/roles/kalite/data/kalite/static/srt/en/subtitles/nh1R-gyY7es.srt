1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
I thought I would make a quick
video to clarify some points

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,610
on evolution and maybe clear up
some points of ambiguity in

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,000
some of my previous videos.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,730
So when you go to the natural
history museum and you see

6
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,390
these drawings where they start
with a primitive ape and

7
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,970
they show progressive species
that show some form of

8
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,430
progress, at least some form of
progress when it comes to

9
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:23,500
walking on two feet, it
culminates with Homo Sapiens--

10
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,940
us-- you imagine that evolution
is kind of this

11
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,570
process that creates better
and better things.

12
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,050
You imagine that there's this
notion of progress that, as

13
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,970
time goes on, each successive
species is better than its

14
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:39,880
first.

15
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,240
And I want to be very clear
that this notion of better

16
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,380
really makes no sense in an
evolutionary or natural

17
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,000
selection context.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,340
That all that matters is fitness
to your environment or

19
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,910
the frequency with which you're
able to reproduce in an

20
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,030
environment, which doesn't
really match to

21
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,840
our notion of better.

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,780
So some people kind of think of,
well, what's going to be

23
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,210
the next step in human
evolution?

24
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:11,890
And they imagine some human with
a big brain that can move

25
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:16,360
things with mental energy and
all of that and can see

26
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,680
through things or
whatever else.

27
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,660
They imagine some kind of
progress, that, look, we're

28
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,440
more intelligent.

29
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,620
We can do all of these things
that an ape couldn't do.

30
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,160
Maybe the next stage in
evolution somehow will be some

31
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,630
type of superhuman.

32
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,090
And I don't know what the next
stage of evolution, if there

33
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,150
is any next stage for-- I can't
go into that debate, but

34
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,380
the idea is that that's not
necessarily the case.

35
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,950
Even if you take our current
human population, success in

36
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:47,340
evolutionary terms is very
different than success in our

37
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,210
kind of societal definition.

38
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:53,620
For example, let's say that
you have two people.

39
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:59,890
You know, this guy, some dude
here, he's got a Ph.D, he's

40
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:05,120
got an MD, he's got a lot of
money, I mean, just everything

41
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,920
that society says is a success,
but because he did

42
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,000
his MD, Ph.D, he's been in
school a long time, and he

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,790
decides not to have children,
or if he wants to be very

44
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,930
responsible, he looks at how
many people there are in the

45
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,650
world and the overcrowding and
the environmental impact.

46
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,010
So let's say him and his wife,
who is also an MD, Ph.D, and

47
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,750
has all this money and degrees
and have spent a lot of their

48
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:28,800
time in school, they decide
to have one child.

49
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,750
Let me see, this is his wife,
who has kind of similarly--

50
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,470
she's similarly educated, and
from our point of view is a

51
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,250
very successful, very
responsible couple.

52
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,940
Now let's say that there's some
other guy over here, and

53
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,750
he's just kind of-- for the
sake of it, let's say he's

54
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:49,050
just nuts, that from the
get-go he was very

55
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,160
irresponsible.

56
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,260
He produced one child
after another.

57
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:58,750
Let's say by the time he's 30
years old, he has 10 children,

58
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,600
all with different mothers,
maybe some of the children had

59
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,160
to go up for adoption.

60
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,640
Who knows the situation
with this guy's life?

61
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,910
I don't want to be judgmental of
it, but the general idea is

62
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,040
that in society, we would say,
oh, this guy is less

63
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,080
successful.

64
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,880
But from an evolutionary point
of view, this guy was far more

65
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,770
successful.

66
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,390
In fact, people like this guy,
the frequency of their genes

67
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:24,620
is increasing much faster than
the frequency of these

68
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,930
people's genes.

69
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,840
So when we talk about fitness
from an evolutionary point of

70
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,810
view, it's not necessarily
fitness from the point of view

71
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,590
that we like to think of it in
our regular kind of value

72
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,110
system that we have
in society.

73
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:40,200
These people looked very fit,
intellectually and, who knows,

74
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,730
maybe physically as well, but
they weren't reproducing.

75
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,140
Their genes aren't being passed
on with the frequency

76
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,130
of these guys.

77
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:51,170
I forgot the statistic, but
there's something like 80% of

78
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:56,790
people in Asia have genes from
either one man or some small

79
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,160
collection of men who date--
actually, I think it's from

80
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,180
one man-- from the 1200s.

81
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,810
And it's either probably one
of the Mongol warriors,

82
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,520
whether it's Genghis or Kublai
Khan, but it just shows you

83
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,420
that there are some very-- and
I'm not going to make any

84
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,230
judgments here, but you could
have very kind of aggressive

85
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,899
people who may have raped and
pillaged whole societies, and

86
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:20,260
they were very successful from
an evolutionary point of view,

87
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,870
even though we might think
that their actions are

88
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,790
despicable.

89
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,470
So I want to give you the
sense that there's not

90
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,670
necessarily the sense
of progress.

91
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:31,440
If this pattern I described
keeps happening, then this

92
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,630
type of person will become less
and less frequent in the

93
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,150
gene pool and this person will
become more and more frequent

94
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,000
in the gene pool.

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,160
So we might end up with
eventually a more aggressive

96
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,220
human population or a less
quote-unquote responsible one.

97
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,640
So I want to make that one
clarification that evolution,

98
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,740
or natural selection, is not
just a series of progressive

99
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,050
steps where we'll slowly and
slowly become-- or any

100
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,740
organism becomes kind of a
better and more intelligent

101
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,730
and faster animal.

102
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,890
It just depends on its
environment and what it's

103
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,460
being selected for.

104
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,410
Now the other thing I want to
clarify is, really, some of

105
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:14,130
the points I made on the video
regarding intelligent design.

106
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,360
In that video, my intention
was not to really make a

107
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,700
comparison between intelligent
design and evolution.

108
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,360
So you have evolution on this
side and you have intelligent

109
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,720
design on this side.

110
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,830
And I want to be clear, and I
didn't maybe make it clear

111
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,870
enough in that video,
that this debate is

112
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,170
an artificial one.

113
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:34,800
Evolution really is the basis
of modern biology.

114
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:43,600
If you want to understand how
the flu works, or if you

115
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,520
wanted to understand the human
genome, or if you wanted to

116
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,530
understand heredity, evolution
is the cornerstone of that.

117
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,920
And it's not complete.

118
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,490
Every day, every year, we're
discovering more and more

119
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,070
about how the process of natural
selection works.

120
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,450
There are still open debates.

121
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:02,460
People aren't sure the pace at
which evolution occurs, other

122
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,410
factors that might make it occur
faster or slower, but I

123
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,880
want to be clear.

124
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,520
This does explain all
of our observations.

125
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,180
Or let me put it this way: All
of our observations in modern

126
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,190
science are backing up

127
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,710
evolution and natural selection.

128
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,990
And if anything, it is the
basis of modern biology.

129
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:24,420
So if one were to deny natural
selection and evolution,

130
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,010
they're really denying our

131
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,590
understanding of modern biology.

132
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:32,390
Intelligent design is a belief
system, and my whole point

133
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:36,540
behind making that is to try to
maybe reconcile the parties

134
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:42,480
that favor this with the idea
of evolution, so that they

135
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,840
could reconcile one's religious
beliefs while not

136
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,540
having to deny what is the
cornerstone of modern biology.

137
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,480
And when I talk about design,
I make the point that, look,

138
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,690
you know, rather than looking
at the particular design,

139
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:58,340
whether it's the eye or a
particular organism, and I

140
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,330
even make the point that there
is no particular design.

141
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,850
Even if you were to point to the
human eye, there's not one

142
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:04,880
version of the human eye.

143
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,140
There's an infinite variation in
the human eye, so it would

144
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,020
even have to be intelligent
designs,

145
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,530
not intelligent design.

146
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:16,040
But my whole point behind the
video was to say if you are

147
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,240
inclined to believe in a
designer, then the more

148
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,130
elegant design is at
the system level,

149
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,190
which really is evolution.

150
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,600
Now, I wasn't trying to say
there is a designer or there

151
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,510
isn't a designer.

152
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:31,170
I was just saying if you are
inclined to believe in one,

153
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:34,850
this is more profound and gives
more justice to the

154
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,610
designer that you are inclined
to believe in.

155
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,750
This is not science at all.

156
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:45,900
Intelligent design is a denial
of what all of modern science

157
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,160
is telling us today.

158
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:52,030
And it's not a theory, as some
proponents of it put it, and

159
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:55,750
they kind of surround it with
scientific-sounding terms, but

160
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,550
it's not a theory.

161
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,670
You cannot test intelligent
design.

162
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:02,410
There's no data point that will
confirm or deny whether

163
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:05,540
somehow something was
designed by some

164
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,580
type of sentient creator.

165
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,950
This is just a belief
system that is

166
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,240
essentially rejecting this.

167
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,200
But I don't want to be
disrespectful of those who

168
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,460
believe in this belief system,
because it comes out of

169
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,840
closely held beliefs.

170
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,720
My goal really is to
reconcile that.

171
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:30,520
And if you do want to give your
belief in a creator due

172
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,870
credit, you're better looking
at the system

173
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,700
rather than the design.

174
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,110
So I just wanted to make
those two points, two

175
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:35,850
clarifications.

176
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,390
One on the evolution/intelligent
design--

177
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,860
quote-unquote-- debate.

178
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,010
But it's not really a debate.

179
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,820
This is kind of the cornerstone
of modern biology.

180
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,210
This is something that
just rejects that.

181
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,710
It isn't a provable or
disprovable theory.

182
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,640
And I wanted to make the point
that evolution doesn't

183
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,350
necessarily mean a
straightforward line of

184
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,250
progress in evermore
intelligent

185
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,890
and impressive creatures.

186
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:00,533
