1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,810
   

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,230
Where we left off in the last
video, we were trying to

3
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,340
figure out if there's a
meaningful difference between

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,850
the proportion of men voting
for a candidate and the

5
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,080
proportion of women.

6
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,740
We sampled 1,000 men, sampled
1,000 women, and we got a

7
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,140
sample proportion for
each of them.

8
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,650
We got 0.642 for the men and
0.591 for the women.

9
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:24,530
But our goal is to get a 95%
confidence interval.

10
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:29,610
So just based on our actual
sample, we got-- let me write

11
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,180
it over here.

12
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,110
We got our sample proportion for
the men minus-- let me do

13
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,040
this in a neutral color.

14
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,750
We got our sample proportion for
the men minus our sample

15
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:46,060
proportion for the women
being 0.642 minus

16
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:52,400
0.591, that's 0.051.

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,680
I just subtracted
this from that.

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,600
So what we want to do when we
want a confidence interval, we

19
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,600
want to be confident.

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,160
I'll always have to say that
because it's not going to be

21
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,310
super precise.

22
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:15,050
We want to be confident that
there's a 95% chance that this

23
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:20,610
thing right here-- remember,
when we took the two sample

24
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,630
proportions and took their
difference, it's like taking a

25
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,930
sample from the sampling
distribution of the statistic.

26
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,300
So we want a 95% chance that
the true mean or the true

27
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:37,360
value of this, that P1 minus P2
is within some range, let's

28
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:46,430
say is within d, I'll say d for
distance, of the actual

29
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,020
difference that we got
with our samples.

30
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,470
Within d of 0.051.

31
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,330
And I write this multiple
times, but I always

32
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:56,890
write it this way.

33
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,220
I don't just give the
formula that you

34
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,230
normally see in books.

35
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,490
It's very easy to memorize if
you do, but this way, you

36
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,410
actually see why
this confidence

37
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,270
interval makes sense.

38
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,960
If there's a 95% chance that P1
minus P2, the actual true

39
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,650
proportions, the difference of
the true proportions, is

40
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:15,950
within d of the difference
between our sample

41
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:21,230
proportions, this statement
right here is the same thing

42
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:38,120
that there's a 95% chance that
0.051 is within d of this

43
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,730
actual parameter, P1 minus
P2, which is the same

44
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,830
thing as the mean.

45
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:51,070
So we need to figure out some
distance around this mean,

46
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,140
where if we take a random sample
from this, and this is

47
00:02:54,140 --> 00:03:01,740
a random sample from this
distribution, it has a 95%

48
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,050
chance of being within d of
this mean, because if it's

49
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,100
within d of the mean, then
there's also a 95% chance that

50
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,890
the mean is within d of our
sample, and then we'll have

51
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,310
our confidence interval.

52
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,540
Our confidence interval would be
this value plus d and this

53
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,000
value minus d.

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,100
So what are these?

55
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,960
What is the distance d?

56
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,980
Well, in a normalized normal
distribution, I got a Z-table

57
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,440
right over here, and we can
assume everything is normal,

58
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,520
especially the sampling
distributions because our n is

59
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,170
so big and also our proportion
is not close to zero or one.

60
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,460
It's nice and close to the
middle, so we don't end up

61
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,820
with all these weird cases
near the edges.

62
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,400
We say, OK, how do we contain
the middle 95%?

63
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,000
How many standard deviations in
a normal distribution do we

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,060
need to be away from the mean in
order to contain 95% of the

65
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,000
probability?

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,460
Now these Z-tables, and we've
done it multiple times, give

67
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,730
you cumulative distribution.

68
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:59,090
We're looking for this Z-value
right over here.

69
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,810
If it's containing 95%, you're
going to have 2.5% over here

70
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,710
and you're going to have
2.5% over here.

71
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:10,180
So from a Z-table's point of
view, this Z-table gives you

72
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:15,630
the cumulative probability
up to that Z-value.

73
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,850
So what we're looking for
is actually 97.5%.

74
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,920
We're looking for something
that contains all

75
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,170
of this over here.

76
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:28,050
   

77
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,420
If we get the Z-value and then
apply it on both sides, then

78
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,930
we're going to have something
that contains 95%.

79
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,880
So let's look up the 97.5.

80
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:42,170
97.5 is right over there, and
that is 1.96 standard

81
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,450
deviations.

82
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:49,040
So this is 1.96 for a normalized
standard deviation,

83
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,460
or a Z-score of 1.96.

84
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,140
So if we looked to this normal
distribution right over here,

85
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:02,740
this distance that we care
about is going to be 1.96

86
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,650
times the standard deviation of
this distribution, so it's

87
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:09,710
going to be 1.96 times
all of this business.

88
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:13,650
1.96 times the standard
deviation of this

89
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,300
distribution.

90
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,450
And so we just need to
calculate this and

91
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,870
multiply it by 1.96.

92
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,440
Now, we have a problem.

93
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,410
We don't know the true
parameters P1 and P2.

94
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,990
We don't know the true
population parameters.

95
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,610
We don't know P1 and P2.

96
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,990
That's part of the problem.

97
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,170
We're trying to figure out
if there's a meaningful

98
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,110
difference between P1 and P2.

99
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,770
But we've seen it
multiple times.

100
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:43,830
Since our sample size is a
large, we can estimate P1 and

101
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,760
P2 with our sample
proportions.

102
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:52,210
   

103
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:57,800
So we could change this to
approximately and we can use

104
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,540
our sample proportions.

105
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,710
And we know what those
values are.

106
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:06,870
And actually this n over
here was 1,000.

107
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,680
So let's figure that out.

108
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,150
Let's just get the
calculator out.

109
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,360
It's just going to be one
big calculation here.

110
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:20,260
So what we have is the square
root, and then in parentheses,

111
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:28,816
our sample proportion for the
men is 0.642, and then we're

112
00:06:28,816 --> 00:06:39,310
going to multiply that times
1 minus 0.642, close

113
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,990
parentheses.

114
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:46,020
That's that over there
divided by 1,000.

115
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,710
And then we're going to add to
that plus-- do the same thing

116
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,930
for the women.

117
00:06:50,930 --> 00:07:06,300
Our sample proportion is 0.591
times 1 minus 0.591.

118
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,810
So that's this term right over
here divided by 1,000.

119
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,520
Once again, I need to get
the parentheses right.

120
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,480
   

121
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,010
And then we just need to close
the parentheses, this original

122
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,770
parentheses, because we're
taking the square root of

123
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,020
everything.

124
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,130
   

125
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:33,540
So we get 0.021, or maybe
we'll say 0.022.

126
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:44,040
So this value right here
is approximately 0.022.

127
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,550
So going back to our question,
or this distance that we care

128
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,180
about, this value is going to be
approximately, or our best

129
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,080
estimate of it, is 0.022.

130
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,640
So let's just multiply that.

131
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:10,880
0.022 times 1.96 gives 0.043.

132
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,180
I'll just round it.

133
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:21,860
So this right here is
equal to 0.043.

134
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,690
And just like that, we have
our confidence interval.

135
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:32,900
We know that there's a 95%
chance that the true

136
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:43,559
difference of the proportions is
within 0.043 of the actual

137
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,240
difference of our sample
proportions that we got.

138
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,100
Or if we actually want to get
an interval, we take this

139
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,200
value minus 0.043.

140
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,590
So let's do that.

141
00:08:51,590 --> 00:09:01,910
So we could have 0.051
minus 0.043 is

142
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,320
going to give us 0.008.

143
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,130
And then if we add
it, so 0.051 plus

144
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:14,550
0.043, it gives us 0.094.

145
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:20,480
So the 95% confidence interval
between the proportions of men

146
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,390
and the proportion of women who
are going to vote for the

147
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:45,450
candidate for P1 minus
P2 is 0.008 to 0.094.

148
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,720
I have it right here
on the calculator.

149
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,310
And we're done.

150
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:53,290
So it does seem we're confident
that there's a 95%

151
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:57,150
chance that men are more
likely to vote for the

152
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,460
candidate than women.

153
00:09:59,460 --> 00:09:59,934
