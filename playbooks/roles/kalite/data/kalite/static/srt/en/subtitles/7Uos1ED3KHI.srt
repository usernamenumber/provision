1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,540
   

2
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,570
When we first started learning
about fractions or rational

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,600
numbers, we learned about the
idea of putting things in

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,790
lowest terms. So if we saw
something like 3, 6, we knew

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,490
that 3 and 6 share
a common factor.

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,940
We know that the numerator,
well, 3 is just 3, but that 6

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,250
could be written as 2 times 3.

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,650
And since they share a common
factor, the 3 in this case, we

9
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:30,920
could divide the numerator by 3
and the denominator by 3, or

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,330
we could say that this
is just 3/3, and they

11
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,480
would cancel out.

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,880
And in lowest terms, this
fraction would be 1/2.

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:48,050
Or just to kind of hit the point
home, if we had 8/24,

14
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:52,270
once again, we know that this is
the same thing as 8 over 3

15
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:56,380
times 8, or this is the
same thing as 1 over 3

16
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,240
times 8 over 8.

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:04,090
The 8's cancel out and we get
this in lowest terms as 1/3.

18
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:09,470
The same exact idea applies
to rational expressions.

19
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,790
These are rational numbers.

20
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:14,090
Rational expressions are
essentially the same thing,

21
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,360
but instead of the numerator
being an actual number and the

22
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,980
denominator be an actual number,
they're expressions

23
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,670
involving variables.

24
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,200
So let me show you what
I'm talking about.

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:37,030
Let's say that I had 9x plus
3 over 12x plus 4.

26
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,100
Now, this numerator up here,
we can factor it.

27
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,950
We can factor out a 3.

28
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:47,420
This is equal to 3
times 3x plus 1.

29
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,590
That's what our numerator
is equal to.

30
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,720
And our denominator, we
can factor out a 4.

31
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,380
This is the same thing
as 4 times 3x.

32
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,710
12 divided by 4 is 3.

33
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,760
12x over 4 is 3x.

34
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,380
Plus 4 divided by 4 is 1.

35
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,810
So here, just like there, the
numerator and the denominator

36
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,620
have a common factor.

37
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,370
In this case, it's 3x plus 1.

38
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,220
In this case, it's a variable
expression.

39
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,870
It's not an actual number,
but we can do

40
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,440
the exact same thing.

41
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,150
They cancel out.

42
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,160
So if we were to write this
rational expression in lowest

43
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,260
terms, we could say that
this is equal to 3/4.

44
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:31,290
   

45
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,230
Let's do another one.

46
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:40,020
Let's say that we had
x squared-- let

47
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:40,740
me see a good one.

48
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:53,820
So let's say we had x squared
minus 9 over 5x plus 15.

49
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,230
So what is this going
to be equal to?

50
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,910
   

51
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,875
So the numerator
we can factor.

52
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,210
It's a difference of squares.

53
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:06,750
We have x plus 3 times
x minus 3.

54
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,210
And in the denominator we
can factor a 5 out.

55
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,680
This is 5 times x plus 3.

56
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,360
So once again, a common factor
in the numerator and in the

57
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,970
denonminator, we can
cancel them out.

58
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,070
But we touched on this a
couple of videos ago.

59
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,750
We have to be very careful.

60
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,010
We can cancel them out.

61
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:28,230
We can say that this is going to
be equal to x minus 3 over

62
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:33,240
5, but we have to exclude the
values of x that would have

63
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,620
made this denominator equal to
0, that would have made the

64
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,170
entire expression undefined.

65
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:42,730
So we could write this as being
equal to x minus 3 over

66
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,880
5, but x cannot be equal
to negative 3.

67
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,190
Negative 3 would make this zero
or would make this whole

68
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,340
thing zero.

69
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,200
So this and this whole
thing are equivalent.

70
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,970
This is not equivalent to this
right here, because this is

71
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:03,630
defined that x is equal to
negative 3, while this isn't

72
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,590
defined that x is equal
to negative 3.

73
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:10,540
So to make them the same, I
also have to add the extra

74
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,680
condition that x cannot
equal negative 3.

75
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,990
So likewise, over here, if this
was a function, let's say

76
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:23,840
we wrote y is equal to 9x plus
3 over 12x plus 4 and we

77
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,360
wanted to graph it, when we
simplify it, the temptation is

78
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,230
oh, well, we factored out a 3x
plus 1 in the numerator and

79
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,960
the denonminator.

80
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,960
They cancel out.

81
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,030
The temptation is to say, well,
this is the same graph

82
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:38,840
as y is equal to the constant
3/4, which is just a

83
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,010
horizontal line at y
is equal to 3/4.

84
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,760
But we have to add
one condition.

85
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,080
We have to eliminate-- we have
to exclude the x-values that

86
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,110
would have made this thing right
here equal to zero, and

87
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:55,660
that would have been zero if
x is equal to negative 1/3.

88
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,930
If x is equal to negative 1/3,
this or this denominator would

89
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,140
be equal to zero.

90
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:03,650
So even over here, we'd have
to say x cannot be equal to

91
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,260
negative 1/3.

92
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:14,100
That condition is what really
makes that equal to that, that

93
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,830
x cannot be equal
to negative 1/3.

94
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,330
Let's do a couple
more of these.

95
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,770
And I'll do these in pink.

96
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:35,380
Let's say that I had x squared
plus 6x plus 8 over x

97
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,830
squared plus 4x.

98
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,460
Or actually, even better, let
me do this a little bit. x

99
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:52,220
squared plus 6x plus 5 over
x squared minus x minus 2.

100
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,540
So once again, we want to factor
the numerator and the

101
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,640
denonminator, just like we did
with traditional numbers when

102
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,380
we first learned about fractions
and lowest terms. So

103
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,330
if we factor the numerator,
what two numbers when I

104
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,980
multiply them equal 5 and
I add them equal 6?

105
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,370
Well, the numbers that pop
in my head are 5 and 1.

106
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:14,960
So the numerator is x plus
5 times x minus 1.

107
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,280
And then our denonminator,
two numbers.

108
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,940
Multiply negative 2,
add a negative 1.

109
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,830
Negative 2 and positive
1 pop out of my head.

110
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,210
So this is a positive
1, right? x plus 5

111
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,050
times x plus 1, right?

112
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,600
1 times 5 is 5.

113
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,250
5x plus 1x is 6x.

114
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:38,410
So here we have a positive
1 and a negative 2.

115
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:43,635
So x minus 2 times x plus 1.

116
00:06:43,635 --> 00:06:46,760
   

117
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,970
So we have a common factor
in the numerator and the

118
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:50,350
denonminator.

119
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,820
These cancel out.

120
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:56,120
So you could say that this
is equal to x plus 5

121
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,940
over x minus 2.

122
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,630
But for them to really
be equal, we

123
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,950
have to add the condition.

124
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:04,970
We have to add the condition
that x cannot be equal to

125
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,025
negative 1 because
if x is equal to

126
00:07:08,025 --> 00:07:09,910
negative 1, this is undefined.

127
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:13,390
We have to add that condition
because this by itself is

128
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,940
defined at x is equal
to negative 1.

129
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,250
You could put negative
1 here and you're

130
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,360
going to get a number.

131
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,350
But this is not defined at x is
equal to negative 1, so we

132
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:23,820
have to add this condition
for this to

133
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,710
truly be equal to that.

134
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,090
Let's do a harder one here.

135
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:40,810
Let's say we have 3x squared
plus 3x minus 18, all of that

136
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:49,390
over 2x squared plus
5x minus 3.

137
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:52,840
So it's always a little bit more
painful to factor things

138
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,490
that have a non-one coefficient
out here, but

139
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,500
we've learned how to do that.

140
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,155
We can do it by grouping, and
this is a good practice for

141
00:08:00,155 --> 00:08:01,980
our grouping, so let's do it.

142
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:08,500
So remember, let's factor 3x
squared plus 3x minus 18.

143
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,840
So you need to think
of two numbers.

144
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,010
This is just a review
of grouping.

145
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:14,310
You need to think of two numbers
that when we multiply

146
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:18,330
them are equal to 3 times
negative 18, or it's equal to

147
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,990
negative 54, right?

148
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,920
That's 3 times negative 18.

149
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,960
And when we add them, a plus
b, needs to be equal to 3x

150
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,930
because we're going to split up
the 3x into an ax and a bx.

151
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,929
Or even better, not
3x, equal to 3.

152
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:36,620
So what two numbers
could there be?

153
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,100
Let's see, our times tables.

154
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,280
Let's see, they are
three apart.

155
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,510
One's going to have to be
positive and one's negative.

156
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,940
9 times 6 is 54.

157
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,650
If we make the 9 positive
and we make the b

158
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:48,970
negative 6, it works.

159
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,770
9 minus 6 is 3.

160
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:54,520
9 times negative 6
is negative 54.

161
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,620
So we can rewrite
this up here.

162
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:03,050
We can rewrite this as 3x
squared, and I'm going to say

163
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:11,900
plus 9x minus 6x minus 18.

164
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:16,300
Notice, all I did here
is I split this 3x

165
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,200
into a 9x minus 6x.

166
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,610
The only difference between
this expression and this

167
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,910
expression is that I split the
3x into a 9x minus 6x.

168
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,670
You add these two together,
you get 3x.

169
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,360
The way I wrote it right here
you can actually ignore the

170
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,460
parentheses.

171
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:35,350
And the whole reason why I did
that is so I can now group it.

172
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,510
And normally, I decide which
term goes with which based on

173
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,920
what's positive or negative or
which has common factors.

174
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,430
They both have a common
factor with 3.

175
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:48,150
Actually, it probably wouldn't
matter in this situation, but

176
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,920
I like the 9 on this side
because they're both positive.

177
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,400
So let's factor out
a 3x out of this

178
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,280
expression on the left.

179
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,780
If we factor out a 3x out of
this expression this becomes

180
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:02,920
3x times x plus 3.

181
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,140
And then on this expression, if
we factor out a negative 6,

182
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:12,260
we get negative 6
times x plus 3.

183
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,640
And now this is very clear our
grouping was successful.

184
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,990
This is the same thing as-- we
can kind of undistribute this

185
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:29,260
as 3x minus 6 times x plus 3.

186
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:33,580
If we were to multiply this
times each of these terms, you

187
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,120
get that right there.

188
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:42,950
So the top term, we can rewrite
it as 3x minus 6-- let

189
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,012
me do it in the same color.

190
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:52,720
So we can rewrite it as 3x
minus 6 times x plus 3.

191
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,750
That's this term right here.

192
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,920
I don't want to make it look
like a negative sign.

193
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,350
That's that term right there.

194
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:00,000
Now let's factor this bottom
part over here.

195
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,210
Scroll to the left
a little bit.

196
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:09,600
So if I want to factor 2x
squared plus 5x plus 3, I need

197
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,410
to think of two numbers that
when I take their product, I

198
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,630
get 2 times 3, which is equal
to 6, and they need to

199
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,840
add up to be 5.

200
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:25,110
And the two obvious numbers
here are 2 and 3.

201
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:32,900
I can rewrite this up here as
2x squared plus 2x plus 3x

202
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,290
plus 3, just like that.

203
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:40,050
And then if I put parentheses
over here, and I decided to

204
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,220
group the 2 with the 2 because
they have a common factor of

205
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,930
2, and I grouped the 3 with
the 3 because they have a

206
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,200
common factor of 3.

207
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,000
This right here is 2 and a 3.

208
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,270
So here we can factor
out a 2x.

209
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:58,870
If you factor out a 2x, you get
2x times x plus 1 plus--

210
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:02,880
you factor out a 3 here--
plus 3 times x plus 1.

211
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,950
And our grouping
was successful.

212
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,110
This is clearly-- let me switch
colors-- this is the

213
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:16,325
same thing as 2x plus
3 times x plus 1.

214
00:12:16,325 --> 00:12:20,900
   

215
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,990
So here we've been able
to factor it as well.

216
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:30,940
We were able to factor out
the denominator as well.

217
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,340
Actually, I just realized
that I made a mistake.

218
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,540
I wrote here minus 3.

219
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,040
I wrote a plus 3 over here.

220
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,085
Let me backtrack this.

221
00:12:38,085 --> 00:12:42,080
   

222
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,320
That would have been
a horrible mistake.

223
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,330
I would have had to
redo the video.

224
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:50,670
Let me clear all of this, all
of this business over here.

225
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,220
Let me clear that.

226
00:12:53,220 --> 00:13:00,150
This is 2x squared
plus 5x minus 3.

227
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:05,830
So once again, a times b needs
to be equal to negative 3

228
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,330
times 2, which is negative 6.

229
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:12,960
And a plus b needs
to be equal to 5.

230
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,430
So in this situation, it looks
like if we went with 6 and

231
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:22,680
negative 1, that seems to
be a better situation.

232
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,830
6 minus 1 is 5.

233
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,800
6 times negative 1
is negative 6.

234
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,890
So that would have been
a horrible mistake.

235
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:34,790
So we can rewrite this up here
as 2x squared, and I'll group

236
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,800
the 6 with the 2x squared
because they

237
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,880
share a common factor.

238
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:46,190
So plus 6x minus x, this is the
same thing as 5x minus 3.

239
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:50,200
I just had to find the numbers
to split this 5x into.

240
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,190
But 6x minus x is 5x.

241
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:57,420
And if I put some parentheses
here, I can factor out of 2x

242
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,530
out of this first term.

243
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:02,780
I get 2x times x plus 3.

244
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,870
And here I can factor out
a negative 1, so minus 1

245
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,540
times x plus 3.

246
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,330
And then our grouping
was successful.

247
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:18,880
We get 2-- let me do this in a
different color-- we get 2x

248
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:25,590
minus 1 times x plus 3.

249
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,870
   

250
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:37,720
So our denominator here
is equal to 2x minus 1

251
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,750
times x plus 3.

252
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,080
And once again, we have a common
factor in our numerator

253
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,200
and our denonminator,
the x plus 3.

254
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,550
But we have to add the condition
that x cannot be

255
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,880
equal to negative 3, because
that would make this whole

256
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,670
thing equal to zero.

257
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,810
Or not equal to zero, it would
make us divide by zero, which

258
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,020
is undefined.

259
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:02,960
So we have to say that x cannot
be equal to negative 3.

260
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:09,850
So this expression up here is
the same thing as 3x minus 6

261
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:14,560
over 2x minus 1, granted that we
also imposed the condition

262
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,750
that x does not equal
negative 3.

263
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,220
Hopefully, you found
that interesting.
