1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,050
We're on problem 240.

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:09,800
Seed mixture x is 40% rye grass and 60% bluegrass.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:17,020
Let's see, x is 40% rye grass and 60% bluegrass.

4
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,000
Fair enough.

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,440
Seed mixture y is 25% rye grass--

6
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:31,120
so it's 0.25 rye grass-- and 75% fescue.

7
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,950
So I should look up what that is.

8
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,750
75% fescue.

9
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:40,510
If a mixture of x and y contain 30% rye grass,

10
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,060
what percent of the weight of the mixture is x?

11
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,240
OK. Well, let's say that

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:54,700
A is equal to the percent of weight of mixture that is x,

13
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,020
what they're asking for.

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,810
So how much rye grass-- what percentage of that mixture

15
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,040
will be rye grass that comes from x?

16
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:10,260
Well, we have A%, or you know, we could call that--

17
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,770
A is, fraction A of the mixture is from x.

18
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,040
And then x is 40% rye grass.

19
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,050
So if we multiply the amount that

20
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:23,520
we're getting from x times 40%, times 0.4,

21
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,550
this'll tell us the amount of rye grass from x.

22
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,600
So r from x, or the proportion of rye grass from x.

23
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,310
And now, how much rye grass are we going to get from y?

24
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,850
So first of all, what's our proportion of y?

25
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:43,040
If this mixture is A of x, there's going to be 1 minus A of y

26
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,360
If this is 1/4, this is going to be 3/4, right?

27
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,030
Makes sense.

28
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:53,020
So this is how much y we have, and y is 25% rye grass.

29
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,910
So our rye grass from y will be the amount of y

30
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,510
we have times how much y is rye grass.

31
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:05,670
So this is rye grass from y.

32
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,770
And they tell us that this is equal to a mixture.

33
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,340
The mixture should have 30% rye grass.

34
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,030
So let's just solve for A.

35
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:19,240
We get 0.4 times A plus-- let's see, multiply--

36
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,710
0.25 minus 0.25A-- just distributed the 0.25--

37
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:30,050
is equal to 0.30. 0.4A minus 0.25A--

38
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,050
40 minus 25-- that's 0.15A.

39
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:39,020
And then subtract 0.25 from both sides, is equal to 0.05.

40
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:44,290
So A is equal to 0.05 divided by 0.15,

41
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,540
is the same thing as 5 over 15,

42
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,600
which is equal to 1/3,

43
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:56,060
which is equal to 33 and 1/3%, Which is choice B.

44
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,140
Next problem.

45
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,250
Problem 241.

46
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,790
If the integer n has exactly three positive divisors,

47
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,840
including 1 and n-- so it's divisors are, I don't know,

48
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,590
1, some number, and n--

49
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,320
how many positive divisors does n squared have?

50
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,390
So one thing, I don't know if you've ever thought about this,

51
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,210
but how can any number have an odd number of divisors? Right?

52
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,230
Because normally, if you take a number,

53
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,590
let's take the number 6ŁŹand you shouldn't do this on the GMAT

54
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,520
it's a waste of time.

55
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,180
But its divisors are 1 times 6, or 2 times 3.

56
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,000
So every divisor tends to have a corresponding divisor.

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So how can you have an odd number of divisors?

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,630
Well,

59
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:43,000
only if one of the divisor's corresponding divisors is itself

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,030
If it's 1 times n, and x times x,

61
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,270
which implies that if you have an odd number of divisors,

62
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,750
you're dealing with a perfect square.

63
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,770
Anyway, I just wanted to point that out.

64
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,730
But that's actually not that relevant to that problem.

65
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:01,030
It's just something, you know, it is useful sometimes.

66
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,080
But anyway.

67
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,680
They just want to know how many divisors n squared has.

68
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,330
Let's just find a number that has this property.

69
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,890
Well, we know any perfect square--

70
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,620
well, a small perfect square will have this property.

71
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,050
So let's see.

72
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,610
Number 4, it has its property.

73
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,540
It's factors are 1, 2, and 4.

74
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,020
So how many factors does 4 squared have?

75
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,640
Well, 4 squared is 16.

76
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:27,020
Its factors are 1 and 16, 2 and 8, and 4 and 4.

77
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,080
So it has five factors, and that is choice B.

78
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,530
And you could do it mathematically.

79
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,750
You could say all the combinations of

80
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:39,010
when I multiply all the factors of this times itself,

81
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,300
and you could say, oh, they have five combinations.

82
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,360
But in this case, it's just way easier to think of,

83
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,950
OK, let me think of a small perfect square

84
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,990
that's going to have three factors.

85
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,120
A perfect square just tells you

86
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,260
it has an odd number of factors,

87
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,490
but a small one will have three.

88
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,940
And let me just square it and just count its factors.

89
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,710
Fastest way to do that problem, I think.

90
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,500
Unless there is-- I don't know, maybe there is a faster one.

91
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,830
242.

92
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:04,930
If n is a positive integer, then n times n plus 1,

93
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:09,980
times n plus 2 is-- OK, they have a bunch of things.

94
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,110
What happens when n-- let's see, even when n is even,

95
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,560
the even only one is odd, only one is odd.

96
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,980
OK, so they want us to see what happens when n is even or odd

97
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,190
So let's see what happens when n is even.

98
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,270
Let's say that n--

99
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,850
if n is even, that means it's equal to 2 times some integer k

100
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,010
We don't know, some positive integer k.

101
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,290
So let's substitute that in.

102
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:34,040
So then this breaks down to 2k times 2k plus 1,

103
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,030
times 2k plus 2.

104
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,290
Interesting.

105
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,350
And let's see,

106
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,750
it looks like this is saying that e should be-- right.

107
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,510
Because let's see, we could factor 2 out of this one.

108
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:55,050
So this becomes 2k times 2k plus 1, times 2, times k plus 1.

109
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:55,780
Right?

110
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,030
I just factored the 2 out of there.

111
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,830
And let's multiply these two.

112
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:05,090
So you get 4k times 2k plus 1, times k plus 1.

113
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,590
So this one is divisible by 4.

114
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,000
And I just glanced at statement e,

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,010
they talk about divisibility by 4, so I think we're done.

116
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,730
This simplifies to this if we can assume that n is even.

117
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:20,530
So if n is even, then we are definitely divisible by 4.

118
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,420
4 can definitely go into the number evenly.

119
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,470
So statement E is right.

120
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,930
Divisible by 4 when n is even.

121
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,830
Statement E.

122
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,220
Next problem.

123
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:37,010
We're on the last page, 243.

124
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,710
A straight pipe 1 yard in length was marked off

125
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,090
in fourths and also in thirds.

126
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,010
Maybe I'll give some dimensionality to our straight pipe.

127
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,850
So let's say the pipe looks something like that.

128
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,400
It's a straight pipe, and it was marked off

129
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,600
in fourths and thirds.

130
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,240
So if I mark it off in fourths, let's see, that's the middle,

131
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,360
and that's a fourth, and that's another fourth, roughly.

132
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,010
And if I mark it off in thirds, it looks something like this.

133
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,000
Right?

134
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,070
All right.

135
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,330
If the pipe was then cut into separate pieces

136
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,900
at each of these markings, which of the following gives

137
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,670
all the different lengths of the pieces in fraction of a yard?

138
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,020
Fascinating.

139
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,490
OK, so we're going to cut it, actually, at here, and here,

140
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,990
and here, and here, and at here.

141
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,580
And actually, if we go halfway,

142
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,120
then we can just use symmetry to say,

143
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,920
OK, this piece is going to be the same as this piece,

144
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,210
and this piece is going to be the same as this piece,

145
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,000
and that piece is going to be the same as that piece.

146
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,990
So we really just have to

147
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,030
figure out up until the halfway point.

148
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,000
So let's think about it.

149
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,980
So this whole thing is 1 yard, so this distance right here,

150
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,490
that distance right here is 1/4.

151
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,690
That distance is 1/4.

152
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,950
We know that this whole distance is 1/3.

153
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,040
This distance is 1/4,

154
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,940
so this distance right here is going to be 1/3,

155
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,520
because that's 1/3, minus 1/4.

156
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,830
Common denominator over 12.

157
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:07,630
1/3 is 4/12, minus 3/12 is equal to 1/12.

158
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,020
So this distance is going to be 1/12.

159
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:15,030
And then what's going to be this length?

160
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,500
Let me get a different color.

161
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,050
I want to make sure that you see that 1/12.

162
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:22,930
Well, this distance is 1/2, and this distance is 1/3,

163
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:26,160
so it's going to be 1/2 minus 1/3

164
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,960
is equal to common denominator of 6,

165
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,020
is equal to 3/6 minus 2/6, is equal to 1/6.

166
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,000
So this piece is 1/4.

167
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
This piece is 1/12.

168
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,990
This piece is 1/6.

169
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,930
And then you could just say,

170
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,690
Well, it's going to happen the same thing on the other side.

171
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:46,050
This is 1/6, 1/12, and then this is 1/4.

172
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:51,060
And so if I say-- let's see, 1/6, 1/12, and 1/4.

173
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,640
Right, that is choice D.

174
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,380
1/6, 1/12, and 1/4.

175
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,070
Choice D.

176
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:01,050
Those are the different piece sizes we have.

177
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:09,100
Problem 245. 245.

178
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:25,060
If 0.0015 times 10 to the m, over 0.03 times 10 to the k,

179
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:34,210
is equal to 5 times 10 to the seventh,

180
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:38,020
then what does m minus k equal to?

181
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,110
And that's important to read,

182
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,970
I was about to solve-- m minus k.

183
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,590
So they want to know what m minus k.

184
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,580
So if we immediately divide these,

185
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,560
we should be able to come up with something interesting.

186
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:56,580
Because this is the same thing as 0.0015/0.03

187
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,840
times 10 to the m divided by 10 to the k.

188
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,350
Well, that's just times 10 to the m minus k,

189
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:09,040
is equal to 5 times 10 to the seventh.

190
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,180
And I don't know, let's see if we can do anything interesting

191
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,670
to this decimal number.

192
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,010
Let's see, if we were to-- let's just divide it.

193
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:21,980
So if we just say 0.03, instead of multiplying by 10

194
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,670
and doing-- going into 0.0015.

195
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,220
Let's add some 0's.

196
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,930
OK. If we take this decimal two to the right,

197
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,900
we're going to take this decimal two to the right.

198
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,220
So then we get 3 goes into 1 zero times,

199
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,980
3 goes into 15 five times.

200
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,490
So we get 0.05.

201
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,690
So this whole thing simplifies to--

202
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,620
and I'll write it in magenta--

203
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:54,630
so that simplifies to 0.05 times 10 to the m minus k,

204
00:10:54,630 --> 00:11:00,050
is equal to 5 times 10 to the seventh.

205
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:04,080
So let's divide both sides by this 0.05.

206
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,650
What is 0.05 goes into 5?

207
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,560
Let's add some decimal points here.

208
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,270
So if I push this to the right two,

209
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,530
I push this to the right two,

210
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,020
and this is my new decimal point.

211
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,190
So 5 goes into 5--

212
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:22,000
well, 5 goes into 5 one time, so it's 100. Right?

213
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,860
So 5 divided by 0.05 is 100.

214
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:30,820
So we get 10 to the m minus k, is equal to 100--

215
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,620
what's 100? That's the same thing as 10 squared.

216
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,560
Times 10 to the 7th.

217
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:41,630
So 10 to the m minus k is equal to 10 to the ninth.

218
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:45,050
So m minus k must be equal to 9.

219
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,020
And that is choice A.

220
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,030
See you in the next video.
