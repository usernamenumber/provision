1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,300
   

2
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,570
Divide.

3
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:07,440
Simplify the answer and write
as a mixed number.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,720
So we have 4 divided by 2/3, and
we've seen when you divide

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,900
by the fraction, it's the same
thing as multiplying by its

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,940
reciprocal.

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:21,260
So this is going to be the
same thing as 4 times the

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,840
reciprocal of 2/3, which is 3/2,
just swapping the bottom

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,050
and the top number, the
denominator and the numerator.

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,220
Now, 4, we've seen this before,
where we're saying,

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,330
OK, well, we know how to
multiply fractions.

12
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,660
You multiply the numerators
times each other and the

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,170
denominators times
each other, but 4

14
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,410
doesn't look like a fraction.

15
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,880
Well, you always have to
remember: a whole number can

16
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,650
be written as that same
whole number over one.

17
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,610
4 is the same thing as 4/1.

18
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,740
And now this becomes kind of
a plain vanilla multiplying

19
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,140
fractions problem.

20
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,710
And so we can just
multiply it out.

21
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,900
We could just say this is 4
times 3, which would be 12

22
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,040
over 1 times 2, which
would be 2.

23
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,390
Or we could divide right now.

24
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,190
Well, let's do it both
ways, actually.

25
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,320
So we could say this is 4 times
3 in the numerator,

26
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,800
which is 12, over 1 times 2 in
the denominator, which is 2.

27
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,150
Now, what is 12 divided by 2?

28
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,780
12/2 is the same thing
as 12 divided by 2.

29
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,310
Well, this is equal to 6.

30
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,740
Or another way we could think
about it is divide the

31
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,230
numerator by 2.

32
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,420
Well, that would give you 6.

33
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,310
And divide the denominator
by 2.

34
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,340
That'll give you 1.

35
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,900
6/1, which is the
same thing as 6.

36
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,720
Now, the other thing we could've
done at this stage

37
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,870
right here is say, well, look,
we have things in the

38
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,570
numerator divisible by 2, we
have things in the denominator

39
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,480
divisible by 2, so let's
divide both by 2.

40
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,960
So 4 divided by 2 is 2.

41
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,770
2 divided by 2 is 1.

42
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:53,930
So it becomes 2 times 3, which
is 6, over 1 times 1 over 1,

43
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,220
or this is equal to 6.

44
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,520
Now, this could be a fun one
to visualize so let's think

45
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,490
about what this is.

46
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,780
4 divided by 2/3.

47
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,270
Let's draw four boxes here.

48
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,890
Let me do this.

49
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:10,979
So let's say I have one,
two-- let me separate

50
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:11,460
them a little bit.

51
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:17,090
One, two, three, and four.

52
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,120
And you can view 4 divided by
2/3 as let's divide these four

53
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,570
boxes into groups of 2/3 of a
box and figure out how many

54
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,910
groups do we have.

55
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,390
So where are our groups?

56
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:29,800
So let's see the first group is
going to have 2/3 of a box

57
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,320
in it, so the first group is
going to look like this.

58
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,140
It's going to have
2/3 of a box.

59
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,670
Now, the next group is going to
have 2/3 of a box, so it'll

60
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,560
have 1/3 from here and
then it'll have 1/3

61
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,090
from the next box.

62
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,160
The next group is going to
have 2/3 of the box.

63
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,770
There's 2/3 left right
over here.

64
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,520
Then the group after that will
have another 2/3 of a box.

65
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,870
That is that right over there.

66
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,450
Then the next will have 1/3 from
here and 1/3 from here,

67
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,510
so it'll have 1/3 from here
and 1/3 from here.

68
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,630
That'll be 2/3.

69
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,170
And then the last group will
have 2/3, the leftover on this

70
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,500
box right here.

71
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,150
Now, how many groups
of 2/3 do we have?

72
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:13,190
We have one, two, three, four,
five, six, so we have six.

73
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,190
Four can be divided into
six groups of 2/3.

74
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,290
So it's just like regular
division, sometimes a little

75
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,970
harder to visualize because
we're dealing with fractions.

76
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:21,599
