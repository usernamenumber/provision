1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,480
We now have a respectable
understanding of the periodic

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,840
table itself and the
atoms in them.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,070
And now we're ready to deal
with molecules themselves.

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,080
And to deal with molecules, we
have to have some way of

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:12,690
representing them.

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,380
And you represent them
with formulas.

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,690
And there's two major--
actually, three major ways to

8
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:17,650
represent a molecule.

9
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,135
One is the molecular formula.

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,930
And the other is the
empirical formula.

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,729
And I'll do it in a different
color to differentiate it.

12
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,610
And the difference is, well,
let's just talk about what the

13
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,660
word empirical means.

14
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,120
I remember when I first took
chemistry the teacher kept

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,080
using the word empirical.

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,390
Well, what does empirical
really mean?

17
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,310
I clearly did not have a
very deep vocabulary.

18
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,720
I forgot what age I was.

19
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:58,470
But it means achieved through
observation or experiment, or

20
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,780
based on experience.

21
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:04,180
So if someone said that they
empirically figured out x, y,

22
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,300
or z, it means that they figured
it out through an

23
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,150
experiment or they
observed it.

24
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,440
The molecular formula is
essentially the actual number

25
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,810
of atoms in that molecule.

26
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:14,790
Let me show you what
I'm talking about.

27
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,330
So the empirical formula tells
you what people have observed.

28
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,730
Maybe before they even knew that
there was such a thing as

29
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,620
atoms, what they would have
observed is the ratio of the

30
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,910
atoms to one another in a
molecule without knowing in

31
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,500
the exact molecule how many
of that atom there are.

32
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,330
Let me show you what
I'm talking about.

33
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:42,790
So if I were to give you, I
don't know, a benzene, the

34
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:47,240
molecular formula of benzene,
you have 6 carbon atoms and

35
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:53,240
you have 6 hydrogen atoms. Now,
if you were some chemist

36
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,710
in the 1800's and you didn't
know about the actual atoms,

37
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,280
but if you had a big bag of
benzene and you were to

38
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,360
measure the ratio of the carbon
to the hydrogen that

39
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,870
you had in that bag, you would
find out that for every one

40
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,560
carbon you have one hydrogen.

41
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,400
So your empirical formula
is the ratio of the two.

42
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,060
You don't know that each atom
actually has 6 of these, but

43
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,480
you know that for every carbon,
there's a hydrogen.

44
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,150
And for every hydrogen
there's a carbon.

45
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,030
And the way to go back, you
can go from the molecular

46
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,160
formula to the empirical
formula very easily.

47
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,870
You just find the greatest
common divisor of the number

48
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,640
of atoms in the molecule.

49
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,570
So the greatest common divisor
is six, and six is obviously

50
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,590
six, you divide both of these
by six and you get the

51
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,710
empirical formula.

52
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,730
It's not easy.

53
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,090
You pretty much can't go back
from the empirical formula to

54
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:39,880
the molecular formula.

55
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,290
You've lost information.

56
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,300
I don't know whether
this was C6H6.

57
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,870
Was it C2H2?

58
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,190
You just don't know.

59
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,070
And I mentioned right at the
beginning of the video that

60
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:51,750
there's a third way to
represent molecules.

61
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,100
And that's the structural
formula.

62
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,880
And we'll do that, off and on,
and we've already done it a

63
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,720
little bit.

64
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,250
Let me show you.

65
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,760
The structural formula for
benzene would actually say how

66
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,490
the molecular formula atoms
are configured.

67
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,470
So benzene in particular
is very interesting.

68
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,270
It looks like this.

69
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,290
It's often drawn like this.

70
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,220
And you'll see this a lot when
you take organic chemistry.

71
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,380
But it looks like a little
hexagon, where the vertices of

72
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,310
the hexagon are carbon atoms.
So let me draw the carbon

73
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,000
atoms in yellow.

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,720
So this is carbon,
carbon, carbon,

75
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,730
carbon, carbon, carbon.

76
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,690
They have double bonds,
every other carbon.

77
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,920
Double bonds.

78
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,200
And then they have single
bonds to hydrogen.

79
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,075
Let me just do the hydrogen
in another color.

80
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,370
Let me do it in magenta.

81
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,620
Hydrogen.

82
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,450
And obviously, the structural
formula gives you the most

83
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,940
information.

84
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,200
Right?

85
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,270
Then you can start to think
about, gee, how will this

86
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,890
interact with other things?

87
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,310
While the molecular formula just
tells you what's in the

88
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,310
molecule, the empirical formula
really gives you the

89
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,470
least information.

90
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,300
It just tells you the ratio
of the different

91
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,890
items in the molecule.

92
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,420
Structural formula.

93
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,390
Let's do a couple more.

94
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:18,269
OK, what if we're dealing with,
let's say we're dealing

95
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:20,250
with water.

96
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,280
I think you know the molecular
formula for water.

97
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,870
H2O.

98
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,940
Now what would be the empirical
formula for this?

99
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,510
Well we want to know the ratio,
so for every oxygen

100
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,390
there's two hydrogens.

101
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,000
Or I guess you could say
for every hydrogen

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,900
there's a half of oxygen.

103
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,230
So you can't reduce this.

104
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:42,280
If I wrote this as H2O1, what's
the greatest common

105
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,490
divisor of 2 and 1?

106
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,480
Well, it's 1, so you just have
to divide them by 1.

107
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,410
So in this case, the empirical
and the molecular formula are

108
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,760
the exact same thing.

109
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,390
It's H2O.

110
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,570
What about sulfur?

111
00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:00,940
And an interesting molecule,
because obviously,

112
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,630
it's just one atom.

113
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,560
Sulfur.

114
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,450
Sorry, no, I'm spelling
it wrong.

115
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,620
No.

116
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,660
No, it's not a p h, it's f.

117
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,460
Clearly, I shouldn't be making
spelling videos.

118
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,710
So sulfur.

119
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,790
So the molecular formula S8.

120
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,420
So it forms this neat kind of

121
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,270
octagon-looking chain of sulfurs.

122
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,120
And if I were to draw that,
you would see that.

123
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,490
And you could look it up on
Wikipedia, if you like.

124
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,320
But its empirical formula, if
you had just a bag of sulfur,

125
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,080
you don't know that each
atom has eight sulfurs.

126
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,430
You just have a big
bag of sulfur.

127
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,050
So, in the empirical formula,
there's only one

128
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,060
atom in this molecule.

129
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,520
You divide by eight
and you get S.

130
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,670
So you just know that all you've
got there is sulfur.

131
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,050
So let's just do one more.

132
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,300
Glucose.

133
00:05:57,555 --> 00:05:59,490
I'll pick a new color.

134
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,250
Glucose.

135
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:11,760
The molecular formula
is C6H12O6.

136
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,930
So for every carbon,
there are how many?

137
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,240
For every 6 carbons, there's
12 hydrogen and 1 oxygen.

138
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,320
So if you kind of reduce this
formula to its empirical form,

139
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,270
what do you get?

140
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:28,930
Let's see, you can divide all
these numbers by 6, so we get

141
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:33,180
1 carbon, 2 hydrogens,
and 1 oxygen.

142
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,720
So this just tells you the ratio
that they exist in a big

143
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,540
bag of this molecule.

144
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,400
This tells you the
exact number of

145
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,390
atoms in that molecule.

146
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,020
Fair enough.

147
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,280
So now we know a little bit
of the difference between

148
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,120
molecular formula, and empirical
formula, and

149
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,760
structural formula.

150
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,400
Now let's see if we can use
what we know about the

151
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,780
formulas and the periodic table
to think a little bit

152
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:59,330
about the composition, the mass
composition, of some of

153
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,440
these molecules.

154
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,460
So the first thing to even think
about is, how do you

155
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,500
figure out the molecular mass?

156
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,560
Right?

157
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,050
I have my little periodic
table down there.

158
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,300
So molecular mass.

159
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,540
So the first question is, how
do you figure out-- I mean,

160
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,850
the molecular mass is going to
be the sum of all of the atoms

161
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,610
in that molecule, right?

162
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:30,960
So if you wanted to know the
molecular mass of-- let's say

163
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,340
you wanted to know
how much does one

164
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,380
molecule of benzene mass?

165
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,700
I don't want to say weight,
because it should be

166
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,970
independent of what
planet you're on.

167
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:45,160
So what is the mass of one
molecule of benzene?

168
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:49,890
Well, all you do is you add up
the masses of the different

169
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:50,570
constituents.

170
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,110
So you have 6 carbons
and 6 hydrogens.

171
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,360
So let's do benzene.

172
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:01,570
You have 6 carbons
and 6 hydrogens.

173
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,680
So what's the mass
of each carbon?

174
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,470
So let's go back down to
the periodic table.

175
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,290
Just to give proper credit, I
got this off of the Los Alamos

176
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,690
National Laboratories website.

177
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,680
So let's see, the atomic
mass of carbon.

178
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,520
The reason why I used this one
instead of my previous one is

179
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,040
my previous periodic table that
I got off Wikipedia only

180
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,490
had atomic numbers on them.

181
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,200
But now that we're actually
going to start talking about

182
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,260
the mass composition
of different atoms

183
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:26,995
or different molecules.

184
00:08:26,995 --> 00:08:28,210
We're going to have to
start looking at the

185
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,860
atomic mass, right?

186
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,270
Remember, the atomic mass, when
you think about atomic

187
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:36,809
mass units, it's just the number
of protons plus the

188
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:37,280
number of neutrons.

189
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,400
So you have six protons
in carbon

190
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,850
and roughly six neutrons.

191
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,890
And why is there this decimal?

192
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,060
Because, as we said before, this
is an average of all of

193
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:49,360
the masses of the isotopes
you'll find of carbon.

194
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,670
So there's a little bit of
carbon 14 on the planet, very

195
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,100
little, but most of the
carbon is carbon 12.

196
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,200
When you proportionately average
them, you get 12.01.

197
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,280
But let's say we're dealing with
carbon 12, just because

198
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,530
that's the most common
element.

199
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,410
Carbon is 12 atomic
mass units.

200
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:13,870
Right?

201
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,040
And atomic mass units
is a unit of mass.

202
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,100
And we'll talk about
how small it is.

203
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,040
It's a very, very, very,
very small fraction

204
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,330
of a gram or kilogram.

205
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,120
And we'll talk about that,
probably in the next video.

206
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,490
So carbon is 12 atomic
mass units.

207
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,590
What about hydrogen?

208
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,190
Let's see.

209
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,250
We go to our periodic table.

210
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,980
Hydrogen is here in
this dark blue.

211
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,600
And I don't know if you can
read it, but this is

212
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,550
interesting, the atomic number
of hydrogen is 1.

213
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:45,270
The atomic mass of hydrogen
is 1.0008.

214
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,190
So that tells us that most of
the hydrogen on this planet

215
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,850
has an atomic mass of 1.

216
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,850
Which tells us that it
essentially has no neutrons.

217
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:56,970
That hydrogen is a kind of an
interesting nucleus there,

218
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,520
where there is really
just a proton.

219
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,580
Just a proton sitting
in that nucleus.

220
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,670
And so if you were to
ionize hydrogen.

221
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,930
If you were to turn into a
cation and take one of its

222
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,240
electrons away, what
are you left with?

223
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,880
You just have a proton.

224
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,790
A proton sitting by itself, just
a single proton, really

225
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:17,540
is no different than
a hydrogen ion.

226
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,220
And that to me is kind
of interesting.

227
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,600
That hydrogen is that simple.

228
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,050
It's really just a proton.

229
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,490
So hydrogen has an
atomic mass of 1.

230
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,580
Right?

231
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,210
If it had any neutrons in it, it
would have been at least an

232
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,230
atomic mass of 2.

233
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:35,350
But hydrogen has atomic
mass of 1.

234
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,770
One atomic mass unit.

235
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:43,330
So what is the mass of one
molecule of benzene?

236
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,620
Well it's 6 times
the carbon mass.

237
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:51,610
6 times 12 plus 6 times
the mass of hydrogen.

238
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,770
Plus 6 times 1.

239
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:59,635
So that is 6 times 12, is 72,
plus 6 times 1, plus 6, is

240
00:10:59,635 --> 00:11:01,980
equal to 78.

241
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,950
Now, what if someone
said, what percent

242
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:08,470
of benzene is carbon?

243
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,450
Well then you say, OK, this
is the piece that's

244
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,370
carbon, right here.

245
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:17,730
The carbon piece of benzene
is 72 atomic mass units.

246
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,890
Right, that's carbon.

247
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,670
So what percentage of
benzene is carbon?

248
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,770
Well it's 72 over 78.

249
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:24,950
The whole thing is 78.

250
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:28,450
So it's 72 over 78.

251
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,730
And what does that equal?

252
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,110
Let me get a calculator going.

253
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,650
I should've had my calculator
open ahead of time.

254
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,680
All right.

255
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:51,820
So 72 divided by 78
is equal to 92.3%.

256
00:11:51,820 --> 00:12:00,510
So benzene is 92.3%
carbon by mass.

257
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,950
And of course, the remainder,
the 7.7%,

258
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,790
is going to be hydrogen.

259
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,880
Let's do that for a couple of
these other guys down here.

260
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,820
So let's say we wanted to
know what is the mass of

261
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,490
a molecule of water?

262
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,120
Fair enough.

263
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,280
There's enough water on the
planet, if you want to know

264
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:16,780
what that is.

265
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,980
Well we already know what the
mass of a hydrogen is.

266
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,950
It's 1.

267
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:21,180
Right?

268
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,250
Hydrogen is 1.

269
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,840
One atomic mass unit.

270
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,880
Oxygen is what?

271
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,640
Oxygen is 16.

272
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,930
Notice, it's exactly 16.

273
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:37,170
So on most of the planet, you
pretty much have, in an oxygen

274
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:41,890
atom, you have 8 protons
and exactly 8 neutrons.

275
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:45,050
So you get an atomic
mass of 16.

276
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:49,540
So oxygen has an atomic mass
of 16 atomic mass units.

277
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,580
So the atomic mass of the entire
molecule, you have 2

278
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:57,970
hydrogens, so you have 2 times
the mass of hydrogen plus 1

279
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:03,100
oxygen-- plus 16-- so that
equals 18 atomic

280
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,520
mass units for water.

281
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,970
And once again, if you want to
say, what percent by mass of

282
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,510
water is oxygen?

283
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,530
Well it's 16 out of
the 18, right?

284
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,330
Is oxygen.

285
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:19,360
So if we get the calculator
back, you get 16

286
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,710
divided by 18 is water.

287
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:26,630
So, let's say you round
it, 88.9% water.

288
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:34,280
Sorry, 88.9% oxygen.

289
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,700
So most of water is oxygen.

290
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,720
And this is interesting, even
though you have two hydrogens

291
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:45,550
here, two hydrogens for every
one oxygen, oxygen's mass is

292
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,490
so much larger-- it's 16
times larger-- that

293
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:51,665
most of water is oxygen.

294
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,540
Well, I'm probably running out
of time, so the next video I'm

295
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,960
going to talk about how
do we go backwards.

296
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,380
If someone gives you the
composition, how can you get

297
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,710
the empirical formula.

298
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,950
Actually on a side note,
slightly unrelated to what I

299
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:09,140
just talked about, I was doing
some research last night about

300
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,020
metals, because they're actually
interesting, about

301
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,805
why some metals conduct more
and some conduct less.

302
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,480
Because when I first talked
about, you know, these were

303
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,870
obviously the transition
metals.

304
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:22,160
They're backfilling
their d orbitals.

305
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:28,580
And I said, hey, the periodic
table that was in-- I think I

306
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,930
was looking in a Princeton
Review book that described

307
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,950
these as metals and described
these as transition metals.

308
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,350
And I was like, hey, you know,
that's kind of not fair,

309
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:41,470
because I consider iron and
copper and gold and silver to

310
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,150
be as metallic as anything.

311
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,120
Why should these be called
transition metals and these be

312
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,380
just called regular metals.

313
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,310
And it actually turns out that
a common name for these are

314
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,340
poor metals.

315
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,570
Poor metals.

316
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:57,580
Because, to a large degree,
they're softer, they have

317
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,780
lower melting points, so the
intuition was right.

318
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:05,580
To a large degree, when we think
of metals, these are the

319
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,610
metals I think of.

320
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:10,560
And when we think of metallic
nature in a chemistry sense--

321
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,140
we talked a lot about that,
who wants to donate their

322
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,490
electrons the most, that's
metallic nature.

323
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,000
They're the guys down here.

324
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,180
And as you go to the top right,
these want to donate

325
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,540
their electrons the least.
These are the most

326
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,190
electronegative.

327
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,690
They like electrons the most, so
they actually have some of

328
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,210
the worst metallic nature, so
it actually makes sense to

329
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:30,320
call them poor metals.

330
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,170
And there's some debate on
whether these should even be

331
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,800
called poor metals.

332
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,080
If you look up a bunch of
periodic tables, some will

333
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,460
call these metals.

334
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,830
Some will call these
poor metals.

335
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,830
But I just wanted to throw that
out there just so you're

336
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:41,800
exposed to it.

337
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,200
And so, you know, for me, it is
a little bit more intuitive

338
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,790
to call these poor metals,
because they have less

339
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,330
metallic nature than the stuff,
especially down here,

340
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,970
the alkali and the alkaline
earth metals.

341
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:54,060
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
