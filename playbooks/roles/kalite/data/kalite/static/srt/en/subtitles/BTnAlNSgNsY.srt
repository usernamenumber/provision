1
00:00:00,627 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's say I have an angle ABC, and it looks somethings like this, so its vertex is going to be at 'B',

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,600
Maybe 'A' sits right over here, and 'C' sits right over there.

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:23,800
And then also let's say we have another angle called DAB, actually let me call it DBA,

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,333
I want to have the vertex once again at 'B'.

5
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:34,000
So let's say it looks like this, so this right over here is our point 'D'.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,733
And let's say we know the measure of angle DBA, let's say we know that that's equal to 40 degrees.

7
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:45,867
So this angle right over here, its measure is equal to 40 degrees,

8
00:00:45,867 --> 00:00:56,600
And let's say we know that the measure of angle ABC is equal to 50 degrees.

9
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,733
Right, so there's a bunch of interesting things happening over here,

10
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:02,667
the first interesting thing that you might realize is that both of these angles

11
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:06,133
share a side, if you view these as rays, they could be lines,

12
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:08,400
line segments or rays, but if you view them as rays,

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,267
then they both share the ray BA, and when you have two angles

14
00:01:13,267 --> 00:01:16,933
like this that share the same side, these are called adjacent angles

15
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:20,667
because the word adjacent literally means 'next to'.

16
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:26,933
Adjacent, these are adjacent angles.

17
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:29,933
Now there's something else you might notice that's interesting here,

18
00:01:29,933 --> 00:01:33,067
we know that the measure of angle DBA is 40 degreees

19
00:01:33,067 --> 00:01:35,933
and the measure of angle ABC is 50 degrees

20
00:01:35,933 --> 00:01:42,133
and you might be able to guess what the measure of angle DBC is,

21
00:01:42,133 --> 00:01:47,067
the measure of angle DBC, if we drew a protractor over here

22
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:49,800
I'm not going to draw it, it will make my drawing all messy,

23
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,867
but if we, well I'll draw it really fast,

24
00:01:51,867 --> 00:01:55,800
So, if we had a protractor over here, clearly this is opening up to 50 degrees,

25
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,133
and this is going another 40 degrees, so if you wanted to say

26
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:01,467
what the measure of angle DBC is,

27
00:02:01,467 --> 00:02:05,800
it would be, it would essentially be the the sum of 40 degrees and 50 degrees.

28
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,467
And let me delete all this stuff right here, to keep things clean,

29
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:13,933
So the measure of angle DBC would be equal to 90 degrees

30
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:16,600
and we already know that 90 degrees is a special angle,

31
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:22,667
this is a right angle, this is a right angle.

32
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:30,000
There's also a word for two angles whose sum add to 90 degrees,

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,600
and that is complementary.

34
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:43,733
So we can also say that angle DBA and angles ABC are complementary.

35
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:51,067
And that is because their measures add up to 90 degrees,

36
00:02:51,067 --> 00:02:57,333
So the measure of angle DBA plus the measure of angle ABC,

37
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:03,867
is equal to 90 degrees, they form a right angle when you add them up.

38
00:03:03,867 --> 00:03:08,000
And just as another point of terminology, that's kind of related to right angles,

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,400
when you form, when a right angle is formed, the two rays that form the right angle,

40
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,600
or the two lines that form that right angle, or the two line segments,

41
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,200
are called perpendicular.

42
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,200
So because we know the measure of angle DBC is 90 degrees,

43
00:03:23,908 --> 00:03:27,362
or that angle DBC is a right angle, this tells us

44
00:03:31,362 --> 00:03:36,169
that DB, if I call them, maybe the line segment DB is

45
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:47,400
perpendicular, is perpendicular to line segment BC,

46
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:55,400
or we could even say that ray BD, is instead of using the word perpendicular

47
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,533
there is sometimes this symbol right here, which just shows two perpendicular lines,

48
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:03,533
DB is perpendicular to BC

49
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:07,000
So all of these are true statements here,

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,800
and these come out of the fact that the angle formed between DB and BC

51
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,933
that is a 90 degree angle.

52
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:19,667
Now we have other words when our two angles add up to other things,

53
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:24,600
so let's say for example I have one angle over here,

54
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:31,133
that is, I'll just make up, let's just call this angle,

55
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:38,267
let me just put some letters here to specify, 'X', 'Y' and 'Z'.

56
00:04:38,267 --> 00:04:45,800
Let's say that the measure of angle XYZ is equal to 60 degrees,

57
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:53,667
and let's say you have another angle, that looks like this,

58
00:04:53,667 --> 00:05:01,933
and I'll call this, maybe 'M', 'N', 'O',

59
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:08,133
and let's say that the measure of angle MNO is 120 degrees.

60
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:12,333
So if you were to add the two measures of these, so let me write this down,

61
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:24,667
the measure of angle MNO plus the measure of angle XYZ,

62
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:30,933
is equal to, this is going to be equal to 120 degrees plus 60 degrees.

63
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:35,800
Which is equal to 180 degrees, so if you add these two things up,

64
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,200
you're essentially able to go halfway around the circle.

65
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:44,333
Or throughout the entire half circle, or a semi-circle for a protractor.

66
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:50,067
And when you have two angles that add up to 180 degrees, we call them supplementary angles

67
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:53,667
I know it's a little hard to remember sometimes, 90 degrees is complementary,

68
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:55,400
there are two angles complementing each other,

69
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:04,333
and then if you add up to 180 degrees, you have supplementary angles,

70
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:07,267
and if you have two supplementary angles that are adjacent,

71
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:12,200
so they share a common side, so let me draw that over here,

72
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,933
So let's say you have one angle that looks like this,

73
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:19,133
And that you have another angle, so so let me put some letters here again,

74
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:20,667
and I'll start re-using letters,

75
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:28,333
so this is 'A', 'B', 'C', and you have another angle that looks like this,

76
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:36,000
that looks like this, I already used 'C', that looks like this

77
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,667
notice and let's say once again that this is 50 degrees,

78
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,733
and this right over here is 130 degrees,

79
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:49,600
clearly angle DBA plus angle ABC, if you add them together,

80
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,333
you get 180 degrees.

81
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:56,133
So they are supplementary, let me write that down,

82
00:06:56,133 --> 00:07:05,333
Angle DBA and angle ABC are supplementary,

83
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:09,225
they add up to 180 degrees, but they are also adjacent angles,

84
00:07:09,575 --> 00:07:17,185
they are also adjacent, and because they are supplementary and they're adjacent,

85
00:07:17,892 --> 00:07:22,377
if you look at the broader angle, the angle formed from the sides they don't have in common,

86
00:07:22,454 --> 00:07:31,867
if you look at angle DBC, this is going to be essentially a straight line,

87
00:07:31,867 --> 00:07:36,733
which we can call a straight angle.

88
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:40,733
So I've introduced you to a bunch of words here and now I think

89
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:45,800
we have all of the tools we need to start doing some interesting proofs,

90
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,867
and just to review here we talked about adjacent angles, and I guess any angles

91
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:55,867
that add up to 90 degrees are considered to be complementary,

92
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:57,533
this is adding up to 90 degrees.

93
00:07:57,533 --> 00:08:03,267
If they happen to be adjacent then the two outside sides will form a right angle,

94
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:08,133
when you have a right angle the two sides of a right angle are considered to be

95
00:08:08,133 --> 00:08:10,133
perpendicular.

96
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:13,400
And then if you have two angles that add up 180 degrees,

97
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,267
they are considered supplementary, and then if they happen to be adjacent,

98
00:08:17,267 --> 00:08:19,856
they will form a straight angle.

99
00:08:20,025 --> 00:08:22,944
Or another way of saying itis that if you have a straight angle,

100
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:26,267
and you have one of the angles, the other angle

101
00:08:26,267 --> 00:08:29,267
is going to be supplementary to it, they're going to add up to 180 degrees.

102
00:08:29,267 --> 99:59:59,999
So I'll leave you there.
