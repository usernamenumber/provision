1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,533
Part d: Find the total distance traveled by the particle over the time interval between

2
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:11,159
time t = 0 and t = 3, or 0 <= t <= 3.

3
00:00:11,159 --> 00:00:14,267
So let's draw some axes here to just make sure

4
00:00:14,267 --> 00:00:18,462
and you wouldn't obviously have to do this if you were doing it under time pressure during the actual

5
00:00:18,462 --> 00:00:23,185
AP exam but my point here to make sure we all are understanding what's going on.

6
00:00:23,185 --> 00:00:25,867
So when t = 0, where are we?

7
00:00:25,867 --> 00:00:29,129
Well they tell us; x(0) is 0 so x is 0

8
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:35,298
and y(0) is -4 so we're at the point (0, -4).

9
00:00:35,298 --> 00:00:42,913
That's when t = 0 and in the last problem we figured out what happens when t = 3;

10
00:00:42,913 --> 00:00:45,133
we figured out that x is at 21.

11
00:00:45,133 --> 00:00:48,600
I'll just say that's 21 right over there.

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,221
x(3) is 21 and y(3) was like -3 point something,

13
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:57,287
so that puts us right over here.

14
00:00:57,287 --> 00:01:04,708
So this is 21 and we figured this out in the last problem, I think it was -3.226,

15
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:07,800
and so this is what happens when t = 3.

16
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,482
And between these point who knows what the path is.

17
00:01:10,482 --> 00:01:16,267
We could plot it if we wanted but it might look something like this, so who knows what it does, and we go like that.

18
00:01:16,267 --> 00:01:21,246
And so in are part d right here they're asking us "What is the total distance traveled?",

19
00:01:21,246 --> 00:01:28,267
or another way to think about it is "What is the length of this path?"

20
00:01:28,267 --> 00:01:35,000
And we could, there is a formula for arc length and if you know it, you could just apply it.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,508
It's not a bad thing to know going into the AP exam, especially under time pressure,

22
00:01:39,508 --> 00:01:43,010
but I always forget what it is, I'm almost 35 now,

23
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,852
so I always like to re-derive it and there's always something a little bit satisfying about

24
00:01:46,852 --> 00:01:52,031
that too because we remind ourselves why the formula works.

25
00:01:52,031 --> 00:01:56,533
Well how do we figure a little bit of that arc length?

26
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,687
So actually let me do a little other part; I like this part more.

27
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:03,969
So let's say, "How do we figure out a little bit of that arc length right over there?"

28
00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:07,538
So let's say you have a little bit of that arc length that...

29
00:02:07,538 --> 00:02:09,918
I'm going to zoom in on that.

30
00:02:09,918 --> 00:02:18,600
Well you have a little bit of a small change in x over that arc length that I've blown up,

31
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:26,379
so call that dx, and you have a small change in y as well, dy,

32
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:29,631
and we know from the Pythagorean theorem,

33
00:02:29,631 --> 00:02:32,662
if we get small enough you can approximate this as just the hypotenuse

34
00:02:32,662 --> 00:02:36,000
as this is the base, this is the height, and this is the hypotenuse.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,933
And so this is going to be, especially if you get these small enough, a line is going to be a pretty -

36
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:47,985
you could really approximate this arc by the hypotenuse

37
00:02:47,985 --> 00:02:51,769
right over here.

38
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:53,031
We know what this is from the Pythagorean theorem.

39
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:59,298
This is going to be the square root of dx squared plus dy squared,

40
00:02:59,298 --> 00:03:02,157
straight up from the Pythagorean theorem.

41
00:03:02,157 --> 00:03:05,415
Now, how do we write these as functions of t?

42
00:03:05,415 --> 00:03:14,067
Well we know that dx/dt is equal to x'(t)

43
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:18,590
or if we treat differentials kind of like numbers, and you can most of the time, this is not very rigorous,

44
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:29,185
but you that that dx is equal to x'(t) dt and we know that dy of t or dy/dt,

45
00:03:29,185 --> 00:03:32,677
we know this is the same thing at the derivative of y with respect to t;

46
00:03:32,677 --> 00:03:39,754
y'(t) multiply both sides by dt you get dy = y'(t) dt.

47
00:03:39,754 --> 00:03:45,154
And all I'm doing here is essentially reproving or re-deriving the arc length formula.

48
00:03:45,154 --> 00:03:55,418
So we know that this right over here is just a small little arc length so we could call that dL or da for small arc length.

49
00:03:55,418 --> 00:03:58,682
Or actually we don't have to worry about what we call that right now.

50
00:03:58,682 --> 00:04:02,298
But this expression for that very little small arc length right over there;

51
00:04:02,298 --> 00:04:08,529
if I rewrite it in terms of this and this, what I have on the right-hand side,

52
00:04:08,529 --> 00:04:10,825
and I want to do that so that I can get everything in terms of t,

53
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:15,890
I get it is equal to the square root of dx squared...

54
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:25,052
Well dx squared is the same thing as (I'll do it in that magenta color) x'(t) dt squared

55
00:04:25,052 --> 00:04:37,682
and then you have plus dy squared, and dy squared is just this stuff: y'(t) dt squared.

56
00:04:37,682 --> 00:04:45,529
And so this little arc length is this right over here, and then you can actually factor out a dt squared,

57
00:04:45,529 --> 00:05:03,369
so this is going to be equal to dt squared times x'(t) squared plus (I'll do this in green) y'(t) squared.

58
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:07,067
And then of course you can factor out the dt out of the radical sign now.

59
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:09,805
The square root of dt squared is just dt

60
00:05:09,805 --> 00:05:14,638
so all of this simplifies to (I'll write it in yellow)

61
00:05:14,638 --> 00:05:20,041
this part right over here is x'(t) squared

62
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:24,766
and this part right over here is y'(t) squared,

63
00:05:24,766 --> 00:05:28,291
and then we factor out the dt.

64
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:34,723
Now this is all just a way to derive what this little small d-arc or this little small arc length is

65
00:05:34,723 --> 00:05:38,333
but we don't want to find just a small arc length, we want to sum over all of them,

66
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,975
so what we want to do is integrate the dt's,

67
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:45,836
take the infinite sum of these infinitely small pieces right over here,

68
00:05:45,836 --> 00:05:53,667
these infinitely small arc lengths from t = 0 to t = 3.

69
00:05:53,671 --> 00:05:56,364
And so now we just do it.

70
00:05:56,364 --> 00:06:01,344
And so they tell us what x'(t) is and y'(t) is.

71
00:06:01,344 --> 00:06:02,692
Let me just rewrite the expression.

72
00:06:02,692 --> 00:06:13,926
This is going to be equal to the integral from 0 to 3 of the square root of x'(t) squared;

73
00:06:13,926 --> 00:06:20,867
the problem they give us what x'(t) is, its 4t + 1.

74
00:06:20,867 --> 00:06:32,933
So its 4t + 1 squared plus y'(t) squared...

75
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:42,148
the derivative of y with respect to t is sine of t squared

76
00:06:42,148 --> 00:06:47,177
and we need to square that as well and then dt.

77
00:06:47,177 --> 00:06:51,271
And this is not a simple thing to find the antiderivative of,

78
00:06:51,271 --> 00:06:56,169
but lucky for us we are allowed to use our calculators in this part of the AP exam.

79
00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:01,067
And so all you have to do at this point, we've already done really the hard work,

80
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:03,856
is use this definite integral function.

81
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:14,164
It's in our catalog right over here and you can go straight to the 'f's and go a page down.

82
00:07:14,164 --> 00:07:21,123
We need to find the definite integral, we have to punch this into our calculator, of the square root of,

83
00:07:21,123 --> 00:07:26,405
(and I'll write it as x's just because the x button is much easier to get to than trying to put a variable t in there),

84
00:07:26,421 --> 00:07:44,215
so the square root of 4x plus 1 squared plus sine of x squared

85
00:07:44,215 --> 00:07:49,437
(instead of writing a t here, I'm just writing an x here, just to clarify what I'm doing)

86
00:07:49,437 --> 00:07:52,443
and then we want to square that,

87
00:07:52,443 --> 00:07:54,557
let's see, that closes that parentheses,

88
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,533
and then I need to close the radical parentheses right over there.

89
00:07:57,533 --> 00:08:00,225
I want to say that my variable of integration is x

90
00:08:00,225 --> 00:08:04,298
I could have put t's here and set up my variable of integration as t, there's not any difference there

91
00:08:04,298 --> 00:08:09,877
and then I'm going between 0 and 3.

92
00:08:09,877 --> 00:08:17,892
And so, let's let the calculator do all the work here and we get...

93
00:08:17,892 --> 00:08:20,933
its taking a little time.

94
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:24,067
We get 21.091.

95
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:29,292
So this is equal to 21.091 and that's the entire arc length.

96
00:08:29,292 --> 99:59:59,999
That's the distance that this particle traveled.
