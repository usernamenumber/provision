1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,390
   

2
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,490
In the last video, I showed you
that if someone were to walk

3
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:10,010
up to you and ask you what
is the arcsine-- Whoops.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,190
--arcsine of x?

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,360
And so this is going to be
equal to who knows what.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,100
This is just the same thing
as saying that the sine of

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,470
some angle is equal to x.

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,520
And we solved it in a couple
of cases in the last example.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,230
So using the same pattern--
Let me show you this.

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,810
I could have also rewritten
this as the inverse sine

11
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,540
of x is equal to what.

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,140
These are equivalent
statements.

13
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,480
Two ways of writing the
inverse sine function.

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,790
This is more-- This is the
inverse sine function.

15
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,460
You're not taking this to
the negative 1 power.

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,340
You're just saying the sine of
what-- So what question mark--

17
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,920
What angle is equal to x?

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,470
And we did this in
the last video.

19
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:52,020
So by the same pattern, if I
were to walk up to you on the

20
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:58,770
street and I were to say the
tangent of-- the inverse

21
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,010
tangent of x is equal to what?

22
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,140
You should immediately in your
head say, oh he's just asking

23
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,080
me-- He's just saying the
tangent of some angle

24
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,440
is equal to x.

25
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,380
And I just need to figure
out what that angle is.

26
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,840
So let's do an example.

27
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,060
So let's say I were walk
up to you on the street.

28
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,150
There's a lot of a walking
up on a lot of streets.

29
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,790
I would write -- And I were
to say you what is the

30
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,970
arctangent of minus 1?

31
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,190
Or I could have equivalently
asked you, what is the

32
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,510
inverse tangent of minus 1?

33
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,190
These are equivalent questions.

34
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,430
And what you should do is you
should, in your head-- If you

35
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,200
don't have this memorized, you
should draw the unit circle.

36
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,640
Actually let me just do a
refresher of what tangent

37
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,330
is even asking us.

38
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:48,890
The tangent of theta-- this is
just the straight-up, vanilla,

39
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:52,630
non-inverse function tangent
--that's equal to the sine of

40
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:56,690
theta over the cosine of theta.

41
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:00,670
And the sine of theta is the
y-value on the unit function--

42
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,010
on the unit circle.

43
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,730
And the cosine of
theta is the x-value.

44
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,600
And so if you draw a line--
Let me draw a little

45
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,110
unit circle here.

46
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:14,770
So if I have a unit
circle like that.

47
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,980
And let's say I'm
at some angle.

48
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,940
Let's say that's
my angle theta.

49
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,640
And this is my y-- my
coordinates x, y.

50
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,380
We know already that
the y-value, this is

51
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,880
the sine of theta.

52
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,780
Let me scroll over here.

53
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,210
Sine of theta.

54
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:38,730
And we already know that this
x-value is the cosine of theta.

55
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,200
So what's the tangent
going to be?

56
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:46,670
It's going to be this distance
divided by this distance.

57
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,970
Or from your algebra I, this
might ring a bell, because

58
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,520
we're starting at the origin
from the point 0, 0.

59
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,250
This is our change in y
over our change in x.

60
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,700
Or it's our rise over run.

61
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,950
Or you can kind of view the
tangent of theta, or it really

62
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,570
is, as the slope of this line.

63
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:05,730
The slope.

64
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:11,660
So you could write slope is
equal to the tangent of theta.

65
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,350
So let's just bear that in mind
when we go to our example.

66
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:19,550
If I'm asking you-- and I'll
rewrite it here --what is the

67
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,600
inverse tangent of minus 1?

68
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,880
And I'll keep rewriting it.

69
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,440
Or the arctangent of minus 1?

70
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,830
I'm saying what angle gives
me a slope of minus 1

71
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,320
on the unit circle?

72
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,830
So let's draw the unit circle.

73
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,960
Let's draw the unit
circle like that.

74
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,880
Then I have my axes like that.

75
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,440
And I want a slope of minus 1.

76
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,450
A slope of minus 1
looks like this.

77
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,995
   

78
00:03:49,995 --> 00:03:52,430
If it was like that, it
would be slope of plus 1.

79
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,580
So what angle is this?

80
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,710
So in order to have a slope
of minus 1, this distance is

81
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,580
the same as this distance.

82
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,940
And you might already recognize
that this is a right angle.

83
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,410
So these angles have
to be the same.

84
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,250
So this has to be a
45 45 90 triangle.

85
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,630
This is an isosceles triangle.

86
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,880
These two have to add up to 90
and they have to be the same.

87
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,120
So this is 45 45 90.

88
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,680
And if you know your 45 45 90--
Actually, you don't even have

89
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,250
to know the sides of it.

90
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,440
In the previous video, we
saw that this is going

91
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,810
to be-- Right here.

92
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:28,040
This distance is going to be
square root of 2 over 2.

93
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,610
So this coordinate in the
y-direction is minus

94
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,380
square root of 2 over 2.

95
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,210
And then this coordinate right
here on the x-direction is

96
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,500
square root of 2 over 2 because
this length right

97
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,960
there is that.

98
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,430
So the square root of 2 over 2
squared plus the square root of

99
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,170
2 over 2 squared is
equal to 1 squared.

100
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,806
But the important thing
to realize is this is

101
00:04:47,806 --> 00:04:50,690
a 45 45 90 triangle.

102
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,700
So this angle right here is--
Well if you're just looking at

103
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,670
the triangle by itself, you
would say that this is

104
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,360
a 45 degree angle.

105
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,060
But since we're going clockwise
below the x-axis, we'll call

106
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,980
this a minus 45 degree angle.

107
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,220
   

108
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:13,710
So the tangent of minus 40--
Let me write that down.

109
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,250
So if I'm in degrees.

110
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,910
And that tends to
be how I think.

111
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:25,160
So I could write the tangent of
minus 45 degrees it equals this

112
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,167
negative value-- minus square
root of 2 over 2 over square

113
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:31,200
root of 2 over 2, which
is equal to minus 1.

114
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,670
Or I could write the arctangent
of minus 1 is equal

115
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,110
to minus 45 degrees.

116
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,920
Now if we're dealing with
radians, we just have to

117
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,350
convert this to radians.

118
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:47,530
So we multiply that times--
We get pi radians for

119
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,880
every 180 degrees.

120
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,890
The degrees cancel out.

121
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,960
So you have a 45 over 180.

122
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,160
This goes four times.

123
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,570
So this is equal to-- you
have the minus sign--

124
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:01,710
minus pi over 4 radians.

125
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:06,450
So the arctangent of minus 1 is
equal to minus pi over 4 or the

126
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:13,850
inverse tangent of minus 1 is
also equal to minus pi over 4.

127
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,350
Now you could say, look.

128
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,930
If I'm at minus pi
over 4, that's there.

129
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:18,540
That's fine.

130
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,360
This gives me a value of
minus 1 because the slope

131
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,320
of this line is minus 1.

132
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,120
But I can keep going
around the unit circle.

133
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,880
I could add 2 pi to this.

134
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,890
Maybe I could add 2 pi to this
and that would also give me--

135
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,090
If I took the tangent of that
angle, it would also

136
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,640
give me minus 1.

137
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,170
Or I could add 2 pi again and
it'll, again, give me minus 1.

138
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,100
In fact I could go to
this point right here.

139
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,420
And the tangent would also
give me minus 1 because

140
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,790
the slope is right there.

141
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:49,460
And like I said in the sine--
in the inverse sine video, you

142
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,960
can't have a function that
has a 1 to many mapping.

143
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:58,190
You can't-- Tangent inverse
of x can't map to a bunch

144
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,830
of different values.

145
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:03,280
It can't map to
minus pi over 4.

146
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,270
It can't map to 3-- what it
would be? --3 pi over 4.

147
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,730
I don't know.

148
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:14,310
It would be-- I'll just
say 2 pi minus pi over 4.

149
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,200
Or 4 pi minus pi.

150
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,550
It can't map to all of
these different things.

151
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,740
So I have to constrict
the range on the

152
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,270
inverse tan function.

153
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,570
And we'll restrict it very
similarly to the way we

154
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,100
restricted the sine--
the inverse sine range.

155
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,510
We're going to restrict it to
the first and fourth quadrants.

156
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:36,010
So the answer to your inverse
tangent is always going to be

157
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,470
something in these quadrants.

158
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,950
But it can't be this
point and that point.

159
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:44,810
Because a tangent function
becomes undefined at pi over

160
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,350
2 and at minus pi ever 2.

161
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,110
Because your slope
goes vertical.

162
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,260
You start dividing--
Your change in x is 0.

163
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,890
You're dividing-- Your
cosine of theta goes to 0.

164
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,560
So if you divide by
that, it's undefined.

165
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,730
So your range-- So if I--
Let me write this down.

166
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:03,430
So if I have an inverse tangent
of x, I'm going to-- Well,

167
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:06,330
what are all the values that
the tangent can take on?

168
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:11,800
So if I have the tangent of
theta is equal to x, what are

169
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,810
all the different values
that x could take on?

170
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,900
These are all the possible
values for the slope.

171
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,810
And that slope can
take on anything.

172
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:22,700
So x could be anywhere
between minus infinity

173
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,870
and positive infinity.

174
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,250
x could pretty much
take on any value.

175
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,050
But what about theta?

176
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:29,950
Well I just said it.

177
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,910
Theta, you can only go
from minus pi over 2 all

178
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,260
the way to pi over 2.

179
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,680
And you can't even include pi
over 2 or minus pi over 2

180
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,790
because then you'd be vertical.

181
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,910
So then you say your--
So if I'm just dealing

182
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,310
with vanilla tangent.

183
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:44,470
Not the inverse.

184
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:50,940
The domain-- Well the domain of
tangent can go multiple times

185
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,410
around, so let me not
make that statement.

186
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,580
But if I want to do inverse
tangent so I don't have

187
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,610
a 1 to many mapping.

188
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,870
I want to cross
out all of these.

189
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:04,180
I'm going to restrict theta, or
my range, to be greater than

190
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:10,160
the minus pi over 2 and less
than positive pi over 2.

191
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,710
And so if I restrict my range
to this right here and I

192
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,190
exclude that point
and that point.

193
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,720
Then I can only get one answer.

194
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,670
When I say tangent of what
gives me a slope of minus 1?

195
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,360
And that's the question
I'm asking right there.

196
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,320
There's only one answer.

197
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,320
Because if I keep-- This
one falls out of it.

198
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,440
And obviously as I go around
and around, those fall out of

199
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,680
that valid range for theta
that I was giving you.

200
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,270
And then just to kind of
make sure we did it right.

201
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,700
Our answer was pi over 4.

202
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,430
Let's see if we get that
when we use our calculator.

203
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:50,340
So the inverse tangent of
minus 1 is equal to that.

204
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,460
Let's see if that's the same
thing as minus pi over 4.

205
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,760
Minus pi over 4 is
equal to that.

206
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,100
So it is minus pi over 4.

207
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,280
But it was good that we solved
it without a calculator because

208
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,160
it's hard to recognize
this as minus pi over 4.
