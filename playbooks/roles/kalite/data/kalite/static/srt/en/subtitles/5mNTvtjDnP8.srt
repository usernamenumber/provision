1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If we want to understand where we come from

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the stories that have led us to our present condition

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if we want to understand our history

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
one of the prerequisites is to have a good sense of

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
chronometry. Chronometry is a fancy word

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but its really just the science of the passage of time

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
chrono relating to time

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
metry, time measurement

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we take many things forgranted these days

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we assume we know what happen the last fifty years

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the last hundred years

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and now we're starting to assume what happened

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to ten thousand years ago

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or what happened to our planet a hundred million years ago

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or a billion years ago

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but these are all very very new phenomena

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this ability to kind of shine a light on the past

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and even the traditional notions of history

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the traditional stories of what lead to what

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the political nations that formed the migrations of people

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and when they happened

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that tradition notion of history is fairly new

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
when you think about just the scope of how long

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
humans have been on this planet

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that first traditional notion of history

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you can kind of view as the first chronometric revolution

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that first chronometric revolution that gives us

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this kind of tradition notion of history really just

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
come out of humanities ability to write

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so writing gives us our first chronometric revolution

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because this was the first time

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
even through we think that humans or human like creatures

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
have been around for hundreds or hundreds of years

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
at this point

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they weren't able to keep their stories in a very exact way

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they might have had an oral tradition

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that might have gone from one generation to another

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but those oral traditions things would get lost

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the most important information that would get lost

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is how long ago did these stories stories start up

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we weren't able as a species to understand

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
when things happened and how long ago things happened

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
until writing became mainstream

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and until writing became permanent

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and our best sense of when this happened

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the first time is by the sumarians with cuneiform

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this happened right around the third millenia b.c.

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so around five thousand years before the present time

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this is what some of the writing looked like

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is actually a letter from a king

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you can see its just highly symbolic carvings

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is what we more traditionally associate with cuneiform

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and it was symbolic based as opposed to now

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
most of our language most of our language

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is based on phonetics which has fewer symbols

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so you can have more meanings

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but this was a huge technological revolution for humanity

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because now with the advent of cuneiform you had writing

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that someone could look at a thousand years later

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
two thousand years later

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and if they can decipher the cuneiform

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they can get a written testimony of what was

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
happening at that time

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and they didn't have to rely on an oral story

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or guess when that oral story started

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but writing since it only happened five thousand

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
years ago

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this is five thousand years before the present

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or you could say three thousand B.C.

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that was a start but this only gave us stories about

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
five thousand years old

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but even then it was a very spotty historical record

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we didn't get really deep, depending on where you are

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in the world until really the last few thousand years

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but it was a start

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this was the first chronometric revolution

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but what you may, or may not, realize is that frankly

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we are I believe at the start of another chonometric

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
revolution that has really just begun to accelerate

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in the last fifty, sixty, seventy years

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this second chonometric revolution

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
2nd chonometric revolution

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I should write revolution up here too

84
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this was a revolution, it allowed us to keep time in a

85
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
permanent way to understand things

86
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to not have to talk to the people to whom something

87
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
happened we can see their written testimony of it

88
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but the second revolution really comes out of our

89
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
understanding of modern science

90
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so in the late eighteen hundreds you have radio activity

91
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
discovered by Marie Curie

92
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this is nineteen hundred here

93
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this is relatively recent here

94
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
remember we're talking about a species that has been

95
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
around for several hundreds of thousands of years

96
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and proto-humans have been around for millions of years

97
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and now only five thousand years ago

98
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
at least as far as we know was the first writing

99
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then only a little over a hundred years ago

100
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
was the discovery of radio-activity, so radio-activity

101
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then the ability to use radio activity

102
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so radio activity is interesting

103
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
its the idea that elements can change

104
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
from one variation to another variation over a long

105
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
periods of time through radio activity

106
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they become kind of this natural clock

107
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
no one had to go there and set up a time piece for it

108
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that luckily there are these things that decay at a very

109
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
predictable rate

110
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we discover radio activity a little over a hundred

111
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
years ago and then over the course of the twentieth century

112
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we got better and better, more sophisticated

113
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
at understanding radio activity to be able

114
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to use it to measure the times of things

115
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and if you fast forward to second half of the twentieth

116
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
century, so now we're at 1950, this is where

117
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the second chronomentric revolution really took hold

118
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where we started to understand carbon-14 dating

119
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we started to understand other techniques that we

120
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
talk as we can start to date older and older things

121
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I want to be clear, radio activity, the understanding of

122
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
radio activity was just the beginning of the second

123
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
chronometric revolution, the second chronometric revolution

124
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which frankly we're still a part of isn't just radio activity

125
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
its also understanding the expansion of the universe

126
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the constancy, the speed limit of light, that allows us

127
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to figure out that, wow, that background radiation that

128
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we're getting that must have be traveling for

129
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
13.7 billion years ago, so now we can look at evidence

130
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
from our environment and our environment isnt just

131
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
earth it's self its radion bombarding us from space

132
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that allows us to make -- that gives us clues as to not just

133
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the age of us, the age of species, the age of the planet

134
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but the age of the universe it's self, so it isn't just about

135
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
radio activity, radio activity is a big part of the chronometric

136
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
revolution, this is what allowed us for the first time

137
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if we have layers on the earth

138
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
people have known for a long time that if we assume

139
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
these layers haven't been jostled

140
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that something at a lower layer down here is probably

141
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
going to be older than an upper layer

142
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because year after year you have deposits

143
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if it hasn't been messed up in some way

144
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but no one knew, they said ok

145
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
well this is relative dating this is older, this is younger

146
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but we had no way of knowing is this a hundred years old

147
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is this a billion years old

148
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but now with radio activity we can start to say hey

149
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we can date some of the rocks here that are a 150 million

150
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
years old and some of the rocks here are 100 million

151
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
years old

152
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so maybe this fossil of a fish we're finding

153
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or this primitive fish like creature over here would be

154
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
between 100 - 150 million years old

155
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the only way we're able to do this is with being able

156
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to date things using radio activity

157
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but radio acitivity is just the start as I mentioned

158
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we're getting better and better understanding of cosmology

159
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we're getting better measurements of the universe it's self

160
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we're understanding physics and a deeper level

161
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
now we can start to look at the genome

162
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and think about how the genome diverges
