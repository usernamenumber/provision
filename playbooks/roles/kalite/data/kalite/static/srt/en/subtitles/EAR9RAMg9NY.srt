99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
(piano music)

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What is perfect?

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, the Ancient Greeks thought the human body was perfect,

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but for them, it was not an individual that was perfect,

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it was like almost mathematical precision

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where the proportions of every part of the body

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
were perfect in relationship to others

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We're looking at an ancient Roman copy of a Greek bronze original

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
by the great artist Polykleitos who thought out to demonstrate just that.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What would perfect, ideal beauty be thinking about the mathematical relationship

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of each part of the human body to the other and relationship to the whole

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is a sculpture called the Doryphoros.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Doryphoros means a "spear-bearer"

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and he would have originally been holding a bronze spear.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We call it the Doryphoros.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Polykleitos apparently called it "canon"

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
not to mean a piece of armament

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but a kind of idealized form that could be studied and replicated

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that is, a set of ideas that you followed

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The idea that you could create a perfect human form

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
based on math was really part of a bigger set of ideas for the Greeks

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If we think about Pythagoras for example

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Pythagoras discovered that harmony and music

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
was based on the mathematical relationship between the notes

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In fact, Pythagoras tried to understand the origin of all beauty through ratio

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so it follows that the Greeks would be looking for that

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in one of the forms that they felt were most beautiful, that is the human body

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the Greeks would perform their athletics nude

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
celebrating the body and its physical abilities

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but even when they represented figures in noble pursuits like this figure

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We have a figure whose clothes have been taken off

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is not because soldiers went into battle nude in Ancient Greece

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but because this sculpture is not about warfare

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's not a portrait of an individual

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is a sculpture that is about the perfection of the human form

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This was found in a paleastra in Pompeii

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a place where athletes would work out

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
perhaps as a kind of inspiration for them

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So that's another layer of meaning

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the Romans loved Greek art

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and had it copied in marble very often

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and even in a city like Pompeii

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we have found thousands of sculptures that are copies of Greek originals

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is based on a sculpture that is at the very beginning of the Classical period

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
before the Parthenon sculptures

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but after the Archaic figures

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's after the standing figure we know as the Kouros

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Here the Greeks have turned away from

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the stiff renderings that had been so characteristic of the Archaic

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and have instead begun to examine the human body

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and understand its physiognomy
