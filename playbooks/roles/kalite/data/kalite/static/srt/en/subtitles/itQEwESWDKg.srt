1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660
   

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,480
Never hurts to get a
bit more practice.

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,550
So this is problem number 5
from the Normal Distribution

4
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:11,350
chapter from ck12.org's
AP Statistics FlexBook.

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:15,960
So they're saying the 2007 AP
Statistics examination scores

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,920
were not normally distributed
with a mean of 2.8 and a

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,010
standard deviation of 1.34.

8
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,510
They cite some College
Board stuff here.

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,110
I didn't copy and paste that.

10
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,050
What is the
approximate z-score?

11
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,360
Remember, z-score is just how
many standard deviations

12
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,780
you are away from the mean.

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,570
What is the approximate
z-score that corresponds

14
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,410
to an exam score of 5?

15
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,410
So we really just have to
figure out-- this is a pretty

16
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,790
straightforward problem-- we
just have to figure out how

17
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:48,260
many standard deviations
is 5 from the mean?

18
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:53,220
Well, you just take
5 minus 2.8, right?

19
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,370
The mean is 2.8.

20
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,200
Let me be very clear.

21
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,160
Mean is 2.8.

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,820
They give us that.

23
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,555
We didn't even have to
calculate it, right?

24
00:00:58,555 --> 00:01:03,670
So the mean is 2.8, so 5
minus 2.8 is equal to 2.2.

25
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:07,320
So we're 2.2 above the mean,
and if we want that in terms

26
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,620
of standard deviations,
we just divide by our

27
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,740
standard deviation.

28
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,850
Divide by 1.34.

29
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,230
Divide by 1.34.

30
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,630
I'll take out the
calculator for this.

31
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:30,950
So we have 2.2 divided by
1.34 is equal to 1.64.

32
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,940
This is equal to 1.64,
and that's choice c.

33
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,550
So this was actually
very straightforward.

34
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,800
We just had to see how far away
we are from the mean if we get

35
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,830
a score of 5, which hopefully
you will get if you're taking

36
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,895
the AP Statistics exam after
watching these videos, and then

37
00:01:46,895 --> 00:01:48,750
you divide by the standard
deviation to say how many

38
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,060
standard deviations away from
the mean is the score of 5.

39
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,680
It's 1.64.

40
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,710
I think the only tricky thing
here might have been-- you

41
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,720
might have been tempted to pick
choice e, which says the

42
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,870
z-score cannot be calculated
because the distribution

43
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,750
is not normal.

44
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,660
I think the reason why you
might have had that temptation

45
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,350
is because we've been using
z-scores within the context

46
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,160
of a normal distribution.

47
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,210
But a z-score literally just
means how many standard

48
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,910
deviations you are
away from the mean.

49
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,720
It could apply to any
distribution that you can

50
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,720
calculate a mean and a
standard deviation for.

51
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,760
So e is not the correct answer.

52
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,320
A z-score can apply to a
non-normal distribution, so the

53
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,980
answer is c, and I guess that's
a good point of clarification

54
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,580
to get out of the way.

55
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,370
I thought I would do two
problems in this video, just

56
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,330
because that was pretty short.

57
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,580
So problem number 6: The
heights of fifth grade boys in

58
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,680
the United States is
approximately normally

59
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,140
distributed-- that's good to
know-- with a mean height of

60
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:53,330
143.5, so it's a mean of 143.5
centimeters, and a standard

61
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:56,980
deviation of about
7.1 centimeters.

62
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,570
Standard deviation
of 7.1 centimeters.

63
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,360
What is the probability that
our randomly chosen fifth

64
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,850
grade boys would be taller
than 157.7 centimeters?

65
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,740
So let's just draw out this
distribution like we've done in

66
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,180
a bunch of problems so far.

67
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,550
They're just asking us one
question, so you can mark this

68
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,430
distribution up a good bit.

69
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,720
Let's say that's our
distribution-- and the

70
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:28,220
mean here, the mean
they told us is 143.5.

71
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,106
They're asking us taller
than 157.7, so we go in

72
00:03:31,106 --> 00:03:31,990
the upwards directions.

73
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:36,950
So one standard deviation above
the mean will take us right

74
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,460
there, and we just have to add
7.1 to this number right here.

75
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,560
We're going up by 7.1.

76
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,940
So 143.5 plus 7.1 is what?

77
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,410
150.6.

78
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,040
That's one standard deviation.

79
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,750
If we were to go another
standard deviation,

80
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,910
we go 7.1 more.

81
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,480
What's 7.1 plus 150.6?

82
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:03,430
It's 157.7, which just
happens to be the exact

83
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,200
number they ask for.

84
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,440
They're asking for heights,
the probability of getting

85
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,580
a height higher than that.

86
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,460
So they want to know what's the
probability that we fall under

87
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,300
this area right here, or
essentially more than two

88
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,700
standard deviations from
the mean, or above two

89
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,630
standard deviations.

90
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,975
We can't count this
left tail right there.

91
00:04:20,975 --> 00:04:23,220
So we can use the
empirical rule.

92
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,320
We can use the empirical rule.

93
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,660
If we do our standard
deviations, to the left that's

94
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,740
one standard deviation,
two standard deviations.

95
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,860
We know what this
whole area is.

96
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,530
Let me pick a different color.

97
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:39,730
So we know what this area
is, the area within two

98
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,445
standard deviations.

99
00:04:40,445 --> 00:04:41,980
The empirical rule tells us.

100
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:48,340
Or even better, the 68-95-99.7
rule tells us that this area,

101
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:54,390
because it's within two
standard deviations, is 95%, or

102
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:59,570
0.95, or it's 95% of the area
under the normal distribution,

103
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,820
which tells us that what's left
over, this tail that we care

104
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,390
about and this left tail
right here, has to make

105
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:08,200
up the rest of it, or 5%.

106
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:13,520
So those two combined have to
be 5%, and these symmetrical.

107
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,460
We've done this before.

108
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,950
This is actually a little
redundant from other

109
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,110
problems we've done.

110
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,250
But if these are combined 5%,
then they're saying that each

111
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,520
of these are 2 and
a half percent.

112
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,880
Each of these are 2
and a half percent.

113
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,400
So to answer their question,
what is the probability that a

114
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,800
randomly chosen fifth grade boy
would be taller than 157.7

115
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,550
centimeters, well, that's
literally just the area under

116
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,170
this right green part.

117
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,450
Maybe I'll do it in
a different color.

118
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,820
This magenta part that I'm
coloring right now, that's

119
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,480
just that area, we just
figured out it's 2.5%.

120
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,810
So there's a 2 and a half
percent chance we randomly find

121
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:51,190
a fifth grade boy who's taller
than 157.7 centimeters,

122
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,030
assuming this is the mean, the
standard deviation, and we are

123
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,370
dealing with a normal
distribution.

124
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:56,622
