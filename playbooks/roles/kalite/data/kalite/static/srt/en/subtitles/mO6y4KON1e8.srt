1
00:00:08,287 --> 00:00:09,513
Let's say I'm an economist

2
00:00:09,513 --> 00:00:12,317
and I'm curious about whether in general

3
00:00:12,317 --> 00:00:14,613
things are getting more expensive or not

4
00:00:14,613 --> 00:00:16,990
and if they are getting expensive, by how much?

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,278
So the way I'd approach that is I would think of

6
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:22,217
well what are just a bunch of goods and services

7
00:00:22,217 --> 00:00:24,608
that the average person would buy

8
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:31,118
So I would think up some type of basket of goods

9
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:33,904
goods and services

10
00:00:33,904 --> 00:00:34,988
And I would try to weight that basket based on

11
00:00:34,988 --> 00:00:36,916
how people actually spend their money.

12
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:39,522
So I'd say, okay, 40% of peoples' money on average

13
00:00:39,522 --> 00:00:41,762
is spent on housing.

14
00:00:41,762 --> 00:00:44,556
Maybe another 10% is spent on transportation,

15
00:00:44,556 --> 00:00:46,905
maybe another 10% is spent on food

16
00:00:46,905 --> 00:00:48,988
and I would go out into the market

17
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:50,829
and I would see, I would try to take an average

18
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:52,534
of what these things cost. And I would sample

19
00:00:52,534 --> 00:00:55,249
a bunch of products, a bunch of services,

20
00:00:55,249 --> 00:00:57,485
so that I get a decent average of that

21
00:00:57,485 --> 00:01:01,178
So this is not a simple thing to do,

22
00:01:01,178 --> 00:01:03,776
but I'm an economist and I'm serious about trying to calculate that

23
00:01:03,776 --> 00:01:05,743
And let's say that when I take that weighted average

24
00:01:05,743 --> 00:01:08,743
of all of this stuff, I just come up with a number.

25
00:01:08,743 --> 00:01:10,573
And this is, I'm not giving you the details

26
00:01:10,573 --> 00:01:12,541
of how it's actually calculated,

27
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:15,191
but to give you the idea of what they are doing.

28
00:01:15,191 --> 00:01:17,045
So I get a number, so I just, you know...

29
00:01:17,045 --> 00:01:19,845
to rent, to buy or lease your average automobile

30
00:01:19,845 --> 00:01:22,611
to lease your average apartment

31
00:01:22,611 --> 00:01:25,330
to buy your average servings of food

32
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:28,309
for a given family, all the rest...

33
00:01:28,309 --> 00:01:31,255
let's say I come up with that costs

34
00:01:31,255 --> 00:01:32,854
and I'm making up a number here,

35
00:01:32,854 --> 00:01:35,375
let's say that it costs $20,000

36
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:37,776
my basket of services,

37
00:01:37,776 --> 00:01:39,566
just based on the way that I've weighted it.

38
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:43,321
And this is all happening in year 1.

39
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:46,256
So this is in year 1.

40
00:01:46,256 --> 00:01:49,419
Now I'm curious whether between year 1

41
00:01:49,419 --> 00:01:54,716
and let's say year 5,

42
00:01:54,716 --> 00:01:56,686
whether things got more expensive

43
00:01:56,686 --> 00:02:00,135
So I'll take that same basket of goods and services

44
00:02:00,135 --> 00:02:05,750
So basket of goods and services

45
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,052
and I'll try to figure out what is their weighted average cost in year 5

46
00:02:10,052 --> 00:02:12,015
and this is a lot harder than it sounds right now

47
00:02:12,015 --> 00:02:15,034
because the basket of goods and services change

48
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:18,097
If computers get faster, do you use the same computer?

49
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:20,995
Or do you think about what the average computer is

50
00:02:20,995 --> 00:02:22,271
which would now be a better computer.

51
00:02:22,271 --> 00:02:25,167
If most people's TVs got bigger, do you use the same TV

52
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:28,681
in year 1 and year 5? Or do you adjust now the average TV

53
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:31,644
which has now gotten bigger.

54
00:02:31,644 --> 00:02:33,685
If houses have gotten bigger on average, do you use the same house?

55
00:02:33,685 --> 00:02:35,413
Or do you use the average house?

56
00:02:35,413 --> 00:02:37,389
So there's a whole bunch of areas here

57
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:39,154
that you could really tweak (change),

58
00:02:39,154 --> 00:02:41,184
and these are actually huge subjects of debate

59
00:02:41,184 --> 00:02:43,764
on what is the actual increase in cost.

60
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:45,196
But let's say that you're able to do this

61
00:02:45,196 --> 00:02:47,034
in what you think is a pretty reasonable way

62
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:50,576
and you find that the same basket of goods

63
00:02:50,576 --> 00:02:52,593
adjusted for things like technology and all of the rest,

64
00:02:52,593 --> 00:02:57,693
Now costs $22,000. So your takeaway

65
00:02:57,693 --> 00:03:02,189
from here is the same things that cost $20,000

66
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:05,358
the things that give you the same standard of living in year 1

67
00:03:05,358 --> 00:03:07,992
to get that same standard of living in year 5

68
00:03:07,992 --> 00:03:10,775
you now need to spend 10% more

69
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:13,013
it's gotten $2,000 more expensive off of $20,000

70
00:03:13,013 --> 00:03:16,934
so it's gotten 10% more expensive

71
00:03:16,934 --> 00:03:19,363
So you as the economist

72
00:03:19,363 --> 00:03:21,451
what you would say is, as the way you've defined it

73
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:25,309
your consumer price index, and this is abbreviated with CPI

74
00:03:25,309 --> 00:03:32,530
Your consumer price index is up by 10%

75
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,467
Another way, based on the way you measured it

76
00:03:35,467 --> 00:03:37,842
and it change from country to country

77
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,147
even within countries, they change the way

78
00:03:39,147 --> 00:03:42,275
that they do these baskets of goods,

79
00:03:42,275 --> 00:03:43,672
but by the way you've measured it,

80
00:03:43,672 --> 00:03:54,151
you would say that the price inflation has been

81
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:56,627
10% between year 1 and year 5

82
00:03:56,627 --> 00:04:01,373
or in general, everything got 10% more expensive

83
00:04:01,373 --> 00:04:03,001
or you would 10% more money to have the same standard of living

84
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:08,744
and in general, when people are just refering to

85
00:04:08,744 --> 00:04:13,026
inflation, so if you just see the word inflation being referred to

86
00:04:13,026 --> 00:04:16,249
they are referring to price inflation,

87
00:04:16,249 --> 00:04:18,860
this general increase in the price of goods and services

88
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,855
measured by some type of basket of goods.

89
00:04:21,855 --> 00:04:25,170
There is another type of inflation, and that is

90
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:29,092
monetary inflation

91
00:04:29,092 --> 00:04:30,625
and they are related,

92
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:36,158
monetary inflation is inflation due to purely the increase of the money supply

93
00:04:36,158 --> 00:04:41,843
So this is increase in money supply.

94
00:04:41,843 --> 00:04:46,380
And in general, if this increase in the money supply

95
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,519
does outstrip kind of the productive capacity of the country

96
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:54,382
it could very well lead to price inflation

97
00:04:54,382 --> 00:04:56,714
but in general, what people measure,

98
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:58,337
when they talk about inflation from one year to the next

99
00:04:58,337 --> 00:05:00,439
they're talking about this basket of goods

100
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:02,297
they're talking about price inflation.

101
00:05:02,297 --> 00:05:03,804
The other thing that you'll sometimes see

102
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:07,976
maybe in year 5, someone says, "hey!"

103
00:05:07,976 --> 00:05:10,662
"I could sell you this house"

104
00:05:10,662 --> 00:05:12,176
this house is in year 5

105
00:05:12,176 --> 00:05:14,823
"I could sell you a house"

106
00:05:14,823 --> 00:05:24,081
and this house in year 5 is $660,000

107
00:05:24,081 --> 00:05:25,825
and someone might ask, well

108
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:31,806
"What would be that price if we adjusted it for inflation in year 1 dollars?"

109
00:05:31,806 --> 00:05:35,986
So what they're saying is, you adjust for how much value

110
00:05:35,986 --> 00:05:38,365
your money has lost.

111
00:05:38,365 --> 00:05:40,396
Because if things are getting more expensive that means

112
00:05:40,396 --> 00:05:41,997
each dollar is being worth less.

113
00:05:41,997 --> 00:05:44,749
You can buy less with each dollar.

114
00:05:44,749 --> 00:05:48,660
So when people say, "How much is that adjusted to inflation in year 1 money?"

115
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,639
You're essentially saying,

116
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,103
What amount of money would that house have had to have cost in year 1,

117
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:57,107
that when you adjust it for inflation

118
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,595
you increase it by 10%, so that's the same thing

119
00:05:59,595 --> 00:06:04,968
increasing by 10% is the same thing as multiplying by 110%

120
00:06:04,968 --> 00:06:06,913
or multiplying by 1.1

121
00:06:06,913 --> 00:06:11,400
So what amount of money would that house have had to have cost in year 1

122
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:17,141
that if I multiply it by 1.1, I get $660,000?

123
00:06:17,141 --> 00:06:19,589
Now we can do a little quick math here to figure that out

124
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:22,642
So if we say, let's say that, I don't know

125
00:06:22,642 --> 00:06:25,363
that P, P is the price of the house in year 1

126
00:06:25,363 --> 00:06:31,909
I'll call it P1, that times 1.1

127
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:34,805
is going to be equal to $660,000

128
00:06:34,805 --> 00:06:37,910
When you factor in the 10% inflation over these years

129
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,303
Now this is simple algebra right here

130
00:06:41,303 --> 00:06:44,378
You could divide both sides by 1.1

131
00:06:44,378 --> 00:06:51,206
and we get, these cancel out

132
00:06:51,206 --> 00:06:55,696
you get the price of that house in year 1

133
00:06:55,696 --> 00:06:59,443
66 divided by 11 would be 6

134
00:06:59,443 --> 00:07:01,129
now you can work it out with a calculator if you don't feel comfortable enough

135
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,812
with what I'm about to do.

136
00:07:02,812 --> 00:07:08,768
This would give you $600,000, if you work this math right out here

137
00:07:08,768 --> 00:07:10,246
And you could figure out the decimals,

138
00:07:10,246 --> 00:07:13,584
what we could do, well, I think you get the general idea here

139
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:16,409
you can use your calculator. I kind of did this in my head

140
00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:24,115
But the general idea is a house in year 1 that is $600,000

141
00:07:24,161 --> 00:07:27,334
if you factor in the devaluing of the current year

142
00:07:27,334 --> 00:07:29,884
or how much more expensive everything got in year 5

143
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:32,650
will cost you $660,000.

144
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,253
So you might hear someone say

145
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:36,370
when they're talking about inflation or they're talking about price increases

146
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:39,768
This house in year 5 is $660,000

147
00:07:39,768 --> 00:07:53,388
which is equal to $600,000 in year 1 money.

148
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:54,997
And as an example of that,

149
00:07:54,997 --> 00:07:57,078
you know I live in neighborhood where

150
00:07:57,078 --> 00:07:59,259
the houses have gotten all of a sudden

151
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:00,785
because I live in the heart of Silicon Valley

152
00:08:00,785 --> 00:08:03,126
it's not a fancy neighborhood by any stretch of the imagination

153
00:08:03,126 --> 00:08:05,836
but the house are now quite expensive

154
00:08:05,836 --> 00:08:08,903
and we have neighbors now that moved in in the 1950s,

155
00:08:08,903 --> 00:08:12,161
and they say, "My god, I bought my house for $10,000 and now people are selling these houses for

156
00:08:12,161 --> 00:08:14,827
so much more!"

157
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,438
And the reality is is that it is true,

158
00:08:16,438 --> 00:08:18,770
the house has appreciated,

159
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,097
but $10,000 in 1950 was actually a lot

160
00:08:21,097 --> 00:08:22,924
a lot of money.

161
00:08:22,924 --> 00:08:25,055
Doctors and engineers did not make that much more

162
00:08:25,055 --> 00:08:27,890
than that much per year.

163
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,058
I don't know the exact amount.

164
00:08:29,058 --> 00:08:31,145
So the reality is, is that you actually have to

165
00:08:31,145 --> 00:08:33,571
adjust money for the year you are talking about

166
00:08:33,571 --> 00:08:35,646
and you have to adjust it for inflation

167
00:08:35,646 --> 00:08:38,484
So if you believe this 10% inflation number

168
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:42,742
Hopefully people's incomes also increased by the same amount

169
00:08:42,742 --> 00:08:45,599
So the same person, maybe with the same skills

170
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:46,910
and the same job, who could afford

171
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:50,601
the house for $600,000 in year 1,

172
00:08:50,601 --> 00:08:53,742
could now pay $660,000 for it, and it won't take

173
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:56,342
an unusually large chunk of their expenditures

174
00:08:56,342 --> 00:08:59,386
it would take the same chunk that it did in year 1.

175
00:08:59,386 --> 00:09:02,518
So hopefully that clarifies things a little bit,

176
00:09:02,518 --> 00:09:04,347
and I'll in the future do more videos

177
00:09:04,347 --> 00:09:06,280
going into the details of inflation
