2
00:00:04,774 --> 00:00:07,468
We're standing in St. Peter's Basilica, in the Vatican City, in Rome;

3
00:00:07,468 --> 00:00:11,569
and it is one of the largest, most ornate spaces I've ever been in.

4
00:00:11,569 --> 00:00:13,960
I shouldn't say one of the most. It is THE most.

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,152
And that was the idea. Pope Julius II [the Second],

6
00:00:16,152 --> 00:00:21,718
who commissioned the rebuilding of this church in the early 16th century,

7
00:00:21,718 --> 00:00:24,586
said to Bramante, the first architect, said

8
00:00:24,586 --> 00:00:27,884
"Make me the most magnificent, biggest, church in all of Christendom,"

9
00:00:27,884 --> 00:00:28,835
and so that's what he did.

10
00:00:28,835 --> 00:00:30,402
Ultimately, yes. That's what we have.

11
00:00:30,402 --> 00:00:32,736
But that's not what this place was originally.

12
00:00:32,736 --> 00:00:36,707
If you go back to the ancient Roman era, this was Nero's circus:

13
00:00:36,707 --> 00:00:40,198
a place where games were performed, sporting events were performed;

14
00:00:40,198 --> 00:00:43,742
this was a place where Nero himself apparently actually rode a chariot.

15
00:00:43,742 --> 00:00:48,569
And it was also a place where there was an ancient necropolis, a burial ground;

16
00:00:48,569 --> 00:00:54,941
and by tradition, the place where St. Peter himself was crucified and then buried.

17
00:00:54,941 --> 00:00:59,388
The early Christians created a monument on that site -

18
00:00:59,388 --> 00:01:00,875
- apparently quite small and humble -

19
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:05,206
- and then Constantine builds a church on this site,

20
00:01:05,206 --> 00:01:07,771
because after all, St. Peter is the first pope,

21
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:11,210
the first leader of the Church, given that job by Christ himself.

22
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,378
And that would have been the fourth century, so actually very early;

23
00:01:14,378 --> 00:01:19,942
that church, Constantine's St. Peter's, lasted for a thousand years, a little more.

24
00:01:19,942 --> 00:01:23,971
Early 1500's, Pope Julius II, a very ambitious pope.

25
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:26,223
Julius had this extraordinary vision,

26
00:01:26,223 --> 00:01:31,272
and he brought together some of the most talented artists to develop this extraordinary space.

27
00:01:31,272 --> 00:01:35,005
Beginning with the great High Renaissance artist Bramante,

28
00:01:35,005 --> 00:01:37,650
who did the initial plans for the rebuilding of St. Peter's,

29
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,476
through the great artists Raphael and Michelangelo of the High Renaissance,

30
00:01:42,476 --> 00:01:45,446
as you said, the greatest minds of the Renaissance

31
00:01:45,446 --> 00:01:49,613
and then later, the Baroque in the early and mid 1600's,

32
00:01:49,613 --> 00:01:51,671
worked on this building.

33
00:01:51,671 --> 00:01:57,415
Bramante understood this church as distinct from the way most churches had been built,

34
00:01:57,415 --> 00:02:00,314
that is, borrowing from the ancient Roman basilica plan.

35
00:02:00,314 --> 00:02:04,710
And most churches that anyone probably knows are basilica plan.

36
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,707
It's a very practical kind of plan for a church.

37
00:02:07,707 --> 00:02:09,475
It's got a long central area,

38
00:02:09,475 --> 00:02:12,643
it allows for easy passage of large numbers of people,

39
00:02:12,643 --> 00:02:15,172
it focuses on the altar, and so it -

40
00:02:15,172 --> 00:02:16,071
And it just worked well.

41
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:17,010
It works really well.

42
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,116
But that's not what Bramante wanted.

43
00:02:18,116 --> 00:02:20,145
No, and that makes sense,

44
00:02:20,145 --> 00:02:22,667
if you understand the mindset of the High Renaissance,

45
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:26,305
where there was an enormous interest in mathematics

46
00:02:26,305 --> 00:02:32,141
and in ideal, perfect beauty and finding perfect proportions.

47
00:02:32,141 --> 00:02:38,210
Bramante's first design for St. Peter's was very much based on those ideas.

48
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:42,569
It was a Greek cross, with equal arms instead of one longer arm,

49
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:44,669
and it was inscribed within a square,

50
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:48,141
with a dome over the center and smaller domes -

51
00:02:48,141 --> 00:02:52,165
In essence, it really was a series of perfect circles and perfect squares.

52
00:02:52,165 --> 00:02:54,274
But Bramante's design didn't survive.

53
00:02:54,417 --> 00:02:57,132
No, people went back and forth to it.

54
00:02:57,132 --> 00:02:59,662
But ultimately what we ended up with in the end

55
00:02:59,662 --> 00:03:03,029
is an extension of one of the arms of the cross,

56
00:03:03,029 --> 00:03:07,566
and so the plan ultimately does follow a basilica format.

57
00:03:07,566 --> 00:03:12,935
That perfect geometric form gave way to the practical needs of the church

58
00:03:12,935 --> 00:03:17,790
to hold large numbers of people, and to focus attention on the altar.

59
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,661
So after Bramante, Raphael has a hand in the design,

60
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:23,473
and ultimately it passes to Michelangelo.

61
00:03:23,473 --> 00:03:27,546
What Michelangelo was able to do before the later Baroque additions

62
00:03:27,546 --> 00:03:33,330
was to expand on, simplify, and clarify Bramante's original ideas;

63
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:37,068
and his work can be seen in the dome

64
00:03:37,068 --> 00:03:42,305
and in the exterior of the three sides of the church that were not extended.

65
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:46,361
And then of course Mandorno [sic] will add his baroque facade.

66
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:51,196
And Bernini will decorate the interior of the church during the Baroque Era as well,

67
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:53,566
with the baldacchino, the Cathedra Petri,

68
00:03:53,566 --> 00:04:00,333
and will also extend the front of the church creating the piazza, the St. Peter's Square.

69
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,924
That's right, those extraordinary arms, that double colonnade.

70
00:04:02,924 --> 00:04:07,568
Right. So there's a century and a half or so of work on this church,

71
00:04:07,568 --> 00:04:11,669
a series of great architects and sculptors who work on it;

72
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:13,053
it all works in the end.

73
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,060
It really comes together,

74
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,636
and it is one of the most magnificent spaces on the face of the earth.

75
00:04:17,727 --> 99:59:59,999
