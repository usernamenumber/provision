2
00:00:03,592 --> 00:00:09,797
Dr. Steven Zucker: We wanted to look at a late Medieval Byzantine painting

3
00:00:09,797 --> 00:00:14,151
Dr. Beth Harris: You just used a lot of words--Medieval and Byzantine

4
00:00:14,151 --> 00:00:16,868
Dr. Zucker: I did! Sometimes it's even call the Italo-Byzantine

5
00:00:16,868 --> 00:00:21,464
Dr. Harris: Ayy! We're in Italy--we see influence of Byzantine art here

6
00:00:21,464 --> 00:00:24,317
--referring to the Byzantine Empire and the East

7
00:00:24,317 --> 00:00:28,247
Dr. Zucker: And it's the end of the Middle Ages--right at the cusp when the Renaissance is going to begin

8
00:00:28,247 --> 00:00:32,630
Dr. Harris: And so this is Berlinghieri's panel of Saint Francis

9
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:37,679
Dr. Zucker: St. Francis is really important--he had only just died--and already he is being commemorated

10
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,063
--with this very important altar painting

11
00:00:40,063 --> 00:00:43,379
Dr. Harris: Yes--well he established the whole order of the Franciscans--right?

12
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:47,148
Dr. Zucker: But there was a whole controversy about whether or not he should be canonized

13
00:00:47,148 --> 00:00:50,617
--and at one point I think the church was actually thinking about excommunicating him

14
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:53,046
--because he was really quite radical

15
00:00:53,046 --> 00:00:59,228
Dr. Harris: He was a bit of a renegade--but this painting leaves not doubt that he should be canonized--right?

16
00:00:59,228 --> 00:01:02,714
Dr. Zucker: Why I think that's right--I think some art historians have suggested

17
00:01:02,714 --> 00:01:08,999
that this was actually produced in order to establish his importance--and to actually support his canonization

18
00:01:08,999 --> 00:01:10,968
Dr. Harris: Yeah because we see Francis here

19
00:01:10,968 --> 00:01:15,725
--and he is so clearly showing us the miracle of the stigmata--right?

20
00:01:15,725 --> 00:01:18,234
Dr. Zucker: That's right--his direct affiliation with Christ

21
00:01:18,234 --> 00:01:22,510
Dr. Harris: The idea is that he received the miracle of the wounds of Christ

22
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:28,797
---Christ's crucifixion directly on his own body--so the wounds from the nails in his hands and feet

23
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,595
Dr. Zucker: He's displaying it to us

24
00:01:30,595 --> 00:01:33,129
Dr. Harris: And he is showing us very clearly--and we can also see it in his feet

25
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:36,558
Dr. Zucker: And in the apron scenes--those six small little scenes on either side

26
00:01:36,558 --> 00:01:40,598
are scenes from Francis' life--but they're very much meant to parallel Christ's life

27
00:01:40,598 --> 00:01:45,680
Dr. Harris: And Francis himself modeled his own life on Christ's poverty

28
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,966
Dr. Zucker: A little to directly for the church to actually feel a little uncomfortable

29
00:01:49,966 --> 00:01:52,831
--you know there was that story of Francis when he was a young man

30
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:58,050
--growing up in a very prosperous household that he actually had this spiritual awakening

31
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:02,112
--and determined that he would live the life of poverty that Christ had

32
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:07,766
--and actually ripped the clothing off his own back and apparently--in a bit of a fit--threw them at his father

33
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:14,013
Dr. Harris: He's shown performing these miracles in the scenes on either side--preaching to the birds

34
00:02:14,013 --> 00:02:19,044
--well in the top left we have St. Francis receiving the stigmata

35
00:02:19,044 --> 00:02:21,862
Dr. Zucker: And who is he receiving it from though?

36
00:02:21,862 --> 00:02:24,891
--because if you look very closely there are those little gold lines

37
00:02:24,891 --> 00:02:29,314
--and there's that sort of curious little cruciform up at the top

38
00:02:29,314 --> 00:02:31,244
Dr. Harris: I think that's the Holy Spirit

39
00:02:31,244 --> 00:02:35,060
Dr. Zucker: But it's such an interesting--I mean so clearly coming out of the Medieval tradition

40
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,277
Dr. Harris: Yup--represented so symbolically

41
00:02:37,277 --> 00:02:40,742
Dr. Zucker: Yeah--and so oddly--I mean there's no concern in this painting for scale

42
00:02:40,742 --> 00:02:43,194
--you have the little Francis next to the gigantic Francis

43
00:02:43,194 --> 00:02:46,199
Dr. Harris: Right--and little building next to big people

44
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:50,280
Dr. Zucker: It's actually beautiful and perfect here that Francis is represented this way

45
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:56,065
because even the way Francis is known to have dressed--with the shaved head which is symbolic

46
00:02:56,065 --> 00:02:59,397
--the brown sack cloth which is symbolic--his barefoot-ness

47
00:02:59,397 --> 00:03:04,410
--all of those things are symbols that refer to the way in which he lived his life

48
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:10,616
--to be closer to Christ in way that was humble--that was close to nature--that was without artifice

49
00:03:10,616 --> 00:03:14,649
Dr. Harris: So it makes sense that in the visual imagery around Francis--and of representing Francis

50
00:03:14,649 --> 00:03:18,627
--that we wouldn't have an embrace of the physical material world

51
00:03:18,627 --> 00:03:23,234
Dr. Zucker: It really does--and in some sense it makes me think later representations

52
00:03:23,234 --> 00:03:26,949
--which are much more polished--much more naturalistic--much more sort of traditionally beautiful

53
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:34,377
--are in some ways more at odds with what Francis actually represents--maybe this is a truer representation

54
00:03:34,377 --> 00:03:51,192
