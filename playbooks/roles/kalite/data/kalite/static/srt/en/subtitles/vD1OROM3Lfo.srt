1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,150
All right we're on problem 113 on page 287.

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:11,050
So they've drawn this thing. Let me see if I could draw it.

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:16,500
So we have a right triangle in the center. So that's the side.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:24,080
That's the other side, and then the base. Right triangle.

5
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,740
And then they drew some squares on every side of

6
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,500
that triangle.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:35,540
Let me see if I can do that. That's one square.

8
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,230
Well, I don't know how I'm going to draw the other square

9
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,740
because I don't know how to draw an angled one.

10
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:47,010
I'll just draw the lines. That's the other square.

11
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,700
And the last one.

12
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,530
I'll just draw in some lines something like this.

13
00:00:52,530 --> 00:01:00,880
It comes up like that, like that and like that.

14
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,010
So that's what they have.

15
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:09,140
And they call this A, this B, C, D, and they tell us that

16
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:14,080
this is a right angle. They say, in the figure above,

17
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:21,310
if the area of triangular region D is 4,

18
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:27,580
what is the length of a side of square region A?

19
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:37,000
So all of these are-- well, they don't tell us that this

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,690
and this are a square region just yet,

21
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:41,020
but they tell us this is a square region.

22
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,410
So the length of this side-- if we know the length of this

23
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:49,000
side and that side, then we can figure out the length of

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,570
the hypotenuse of this right triangle, so that's all we need.

25
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:57,450
And let's see, let's call this length right here little b.

26
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,430
And let's call this length little c.

27
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:04,290
So we already know that, if we know the area of this triangle

28
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,840
is 4, we know that little b times little c,

29
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,150
so height times base times 1/2, is equal to 4.

30
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,080
But that also tells us that b be times little c is equal to 8

31
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,040
I don't know that does for us. Let's read the statements.

32
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,010
Statement number 1. The area of square region B is 9.

33
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,040
So B is equal to 9. Well, that's useful.

34
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,330
If the area of this region, and it's a square, is 9,

35
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,020
what's each of the sides going to be?

36
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,720
The sides are going to be the square root of that.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,050
Little b is going to be equal to 3.

38
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:45,370
If little b is equal to 3,then the area of this is 3 times 3.

39
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,530
We can do that because it's a square, which would be 9.

40
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:51,760
So if little b is 3, then what is C? Well,

41
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:59,020
then we get that C is equal to 8/3 using this information.

42
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,760
And we got that, remember, just based on the fact that

43
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,050
the area of this triangle right here is 4.

44
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,020
So little b times little c times 1/2 would equal to 4.

45
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,870
So, if we know what little b and we know what little c is,

46
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,200
then we can solve for-- let's call that little a.

47
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,450
And little a is what the whole point was about.

48
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,400
What is the length of a side of the square region A?

49
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,410
So we could just solve for b squared plus c squared is

50
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,500
equal to a squared, right?

51
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,680
This squared soon. plus this squared is equal to the

52
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,970
hypotenuse squared.

53
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,170
And we just solve for a and we'd be done.

54
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,420
So statement one alone is sufficient.

55
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,860
And this is really messy, especially taking an 8/3

56
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,490
squared and all that, so I'm not going to do it.

57
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,930
And it would be a waste of time on the GMAT anyway.

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,030
Let's look at statement number two.

59
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:52,210
The area of square region C is 64/9,

60
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,020
so C is equal to 64 over 9.

61
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,890
So this is kind of very similar to the information

62
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:58,710
they gave us in statement one.

63
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,440
If the area of this is 64/9 and this is a square region,

64
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,700
then the length of each of its sides, or in this case, little

65
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,660
c, the length of little c is just going to be the square

66
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,080
root of that. So little c is going to be 8/3,

67
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,570
which is exactly what we figured out here.

68
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,790
And then we could use this information that we got from

69
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,560
the problem statement that b times c is going to be equal

70
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,080
to 8, and we got that from the fact that the area of this

71
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,390
triangle is 4.

72
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:29,620
So we use that and we can figure out that b times 8/3 is

73
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,380
equal to 8. And then you get b is equal to 3,

74
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,010
and then you apply this again to solve for a.

75
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,040
So each of the statements one and two are each individually

76
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,070
sufficient to answer this question.

77
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,050
Next problem. 114.

78
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,460
If x is to be selected at random from set T, what is the

79
00:04:54,460 --> 00:05:04,040
probability that 1/4x minus 5 is less than or equal to 0?

80
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,690
Let's simplify this real fast. That means that what's the

81
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:11,030
probably that 1/4x is less than 5?

82
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,000
And that means what's the probability?

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,490
Let's multiply both sides by 4.

84
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,440
I just added 5 to both sides here.

85
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,370
And let's multiply both sides by 4.

86
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,800
And we don't have to change the inequality since 4 is a

87
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,640
positive number.

88
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,740
So it's the same thing as what's the probability that x

89
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,060
is less than 20?

90
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,990
And I like this a lot more because it's just simple and

91
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,530
it lets my brain grasp the problem better.

92
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,090
Now, what are the statements they give us?

93
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:41,430
Statement one: T is a set of 8 integers. T has 8 integers.

94
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,650
That by itself doesn't help me because I don't know what

95
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:49,730
those eight integers look like.

96
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:54,220
I mean, maybe all eight could be larger than 20,

97
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,000
in which case, it would be impossible to find one that's

98
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,390
less than or equal to 20, or maybe all 8 are less than 20,

99
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,010
in which case, you would have 100% chance.

100
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:06,440
So statement one by itself is fairly useless. Statement two.

101
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:21,080
T is contained in the set of integers from 1 to 25.

102
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:29,890
So that also doesn't help me. So T within 1 to 25.

103
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,630
So they're essentially telling us that every number in T is

104
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,920
between this range.

105
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,780
But if we just take statement two alone, they're not telling

106
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,480
us, first of all, how many numbers are in T.

107
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,750
Statement one tells us that,but statement two doesn't tell us

108
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,600
And then even if we knew how many numbers were in T,

109
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,400
we don't know where they're distributed.

110
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,740
Maybe all of the numbers in T are less than 20,

111
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,190
in which case, there is 100% chance that you would select one

112
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:57,490
that was less than 20.But maybe 4 of them are greater than 20

113
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,590
you Maybe you have 21, 22, 23, 24.

114
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,480
And four of them are less than 20,

115
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,810
or maybe something in between. So given that,

116
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,890
you still don't know where T is distributed relative to 20.

117
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:12,850
So I say that we still don't have enough information, even

118
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:16,030
with both of these statements, to solve this problem.

119
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:20,160
Next question. 115.

120
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,240
It takes the most confidence to choose that E,

121
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,000
to say that one cannot solve this problem.

122
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,500
115. I'm always second-guessing myself. I'm like, well,

123
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,530
let me make sure I haven't missed some piece of information.

124
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,050
No, but I'm pretty confident here. All right.

125
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:42,980
115. If Sarah's age is exactly twice Bill's age,

126
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,060
what is Sarah's age? They want to know Sarah's age.

127
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,040
S for Sarah's age. Let me scroll down a little bit.

128
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,130
Problem statement number one says four years ago,

129
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:59,410
Sarah's age was exactly three times Bill's age.

130
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:03,570
So Sarah's age four years ago, so Sarah minus 4.

131
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,810
S is Sarah's age today.

132
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:11,890
So Sarah minus 4 was exactly three times Bill's age,

133
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:18,670
so was three times Bill's age then, so B minus 4, right?

134
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,890
Sarah's age four years ago was three times Bill's

135
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,000
age four years ago. Fair enough.

136
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,820
So just with this and this, can I solve for S? Well, sure.

137
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,840
I have two linear equations and two unknowns,

138
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,570
so I can solve for either variable.

139
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:36,180
And to prove it to you,I'll do it, although this, once again,

140
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:41,010
is a waste of time from the point of view of the GMAT.

141
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:46,380
S is equal to 3B minus 8.

142
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:50,430
And then B-- from there we get B is equal to S/2,

143
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:56,010
so S is equal to 3, right? I just divide 2 into both sides.

144
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:05,900
So 3S/2 minus 8. What can I do here? So I have 1 and 1/2 S.

145
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,240
I could subtract it from both sides. I'll have minus--

146
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,020
I'm doing it fast just to-- minus 1/2S is equal to minus 8.

147
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,080
And then multiply both sides by minus 2,

148
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,320
and you get Sarah is 16 years old. And you're done.

149
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,890
But you didn't have to do any of this.

150
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,530
That was all a waste of time.

151
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,610
You just had to see that you had two linear equations and two

152
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,010
unknowns,which is enough to solve for either of the variables

153
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:35,800
Statement two tells us, eight years from now, Sarah's age

154
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,030
will be exactly 1.5 times Bill's age. So, same thing.

155
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:46,080
Sarah's age eight years from now is going to be equal to 1

156
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:53,800
and 1/2 times Bill's age eight years from now. Same thing.

157
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,370
We have two linear equations, one that they gave in the

158
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,370
problem statement and one they gave in statement two,

159
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,460
and two unknowns.

160
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,340
No reason why you can't solve for both variables.

161
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,890
And you might want to do it for yourself just as an exercise.

162
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,010
But you'd do it the same way you did it right here.

163
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,430
I always find substitution to be the easiest, especially

164
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:14,080
when one of the equations is really easy to manipulate.

165
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,490
So each statement individually is sufficient

166
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,010
to solve this problem.

167
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:24,810
Next problem. 116. Oh, I just realized I'm out of time.

168
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:27,020
I'll do 116 in the next video. See you soon.
