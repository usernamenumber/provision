99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We divide x to the third plus five x minus four by x minus x, Actually I think this is supposed to be

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
x squared, let me correct it. So we are gonna to divide, x to the third plus five x minus four by x squared

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
minus x plus 1 and just to see the different ways we can rewrite this, we could rewrite this as , x to

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the third plus five x minus four divided by x squared minus x plus 1

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or may be the best way to write in this circumstance is we are going to write algebric long division

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is to write it as x squared minus x plus one

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
divided into x to the third plus

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and actually I am going to leave some blank spaces we dont have an x degree an x squared term

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but I am gonna leave some space for it just so that we can align everything in the proper space

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
when we actually do the division

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so, x to the third plus nothing to the x squared power plus five x minus four

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we have a place for the third power, the second power, the first power

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the zero'th power, so now lets do a little bit of algebraic long division

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
lets look at the highest degree term,

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
x squared goes into the x to the third, how many times?

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well it goes into it x times, x to the third divided by x squared

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is equal to x to the three minus two which is equal to x to the one

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which is equal to x, so it goes x times

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I will write the x right over here and we multiply x times this entire thing

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
x times, x square is x to the third,

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
x times, negative x is negative x squared,

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
x times one is , positive x

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and now we want to subtract this whole expression from that whole expression

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and thats the same thing as adding the opposite or

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
multiplying each of these terms by negative one and adding into these terms

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so lets do that

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we have negative x to the third,

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
negative one times negative x squared is positive x squared
