1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,630
   

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,970
We're asked to factor 4y squared
plus 4y, minus 15.

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,500
And whenever you have an
expression like this, where

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,610
you have a non-one coefficient
on the y squared, or on the

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,980
second degree term-- it could
have been an x squared-- the

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,059
best way to do this
is by grouping.

7
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:18,600
And to factor by grouping we
need to look for two numbers

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,300
whose product is equal to
4 times negative 15.

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,740
So we're looking for two numbers
whose product-- let's

10
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,560
call those a and b-- is going
to be equal to 4 times

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,659
negative 15, or negative 60.

12
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:36,420
And the sum of those two
numbers, a plus b, needs to be

13
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,630
equal to this 4 right there.

14
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,490
   

15
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,310
So let's think about all the
factors of negative 60, or 60.

16
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,130
And we're looking for ones that
are essentially 4 apart,

17
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,460
because the numbers are going
to be of different signs,

18
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,660
because their product is
negative, so when you take two

19
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,730
numbers of different signs and
you sum them, you kind of view

20
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,620
it as the difference of
their absolute values.

21
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,360
If that confuses you, don't
worry about it.

22
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,900
But this tells you that the
numbers, since they're going

23
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,830
to be of different size, their
absolute values are going to

24
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,670
be roughly 4 apart.

25
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:08,360
So we could try out things like
5 and 12, 5 and negative

26
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,100
12, because one has
to be negative.

27
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,920
If you add these two you get
negative 7, if you did

28
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,930
negative 5 and 12 you'd
get positive 7.

29
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,530
They're just still
too far apart.

30
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:22,390
What if we tried 6
and negative 10?

31
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,960
Then you get a negative 4,
if you added these two.

32
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,170
But we want a positive 4, so
let's do negative 6 and 10.

33
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,920
Negative 6 plus 10
is positive 4.

34
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,610
So those will be our two
numbers, negative 6 and

35
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:36,360
positive 10.

36
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,480
Now, what we want to do
is we want to break up

37
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,360
this middle term here.

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,880
The whole point of figuring out
the negative 6 and the 10

39
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,180
is to break up the 4y into
a negative 6y and a 10y.

40
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:46,830
So let's do that.

41
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:52,790
So this 4y can be rewritten as
negative 6y plus 10y, right?

42
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,630
Because if you add
those you get 4y.

43
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,055
And then the other sides of it,
you have your 4y squared,

44
00:01:58,055 --> 00:02:01,580
your 4y squared and then
you have your minus 15.

45
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,060
All I did is expand this into
these two numbers as being the

46
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,240
coefficients on the y.

47
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,370
If you add these, you
get the 4y again.

48
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,900
Now, this is where the
grouping comes in.

49
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,250
You group the term.

50
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,300
Let me do it in a
different color.

51
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,760
So if I take these two guys,
what can I factor out

52
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,670
of those two guys?

53
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,350
Well, there's a common factor,
it looks like there's a common

54
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,040
factor of 2y.

55
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,060
So if we factor out 2y, we get
2y times 4y squared, divided

56
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,160
by 2y is 2y.

57
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,820
And then negative 6y divided
by 2y is negative 3.

58
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:44,130
So this group gets factored
into 2y times 2y, minus 3.

59
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,810
Now, let's look at this other
group right here.

60
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,300
This was the whole point about
breaking it up like this.

61
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,070
And in other videos I've
explained why this works.

62
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:56,380
Now here, the greatest
common factor is a 5.

63
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,790
So we can factor out a 5, so
this is equal to plus 5 times

64
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,300
10y, divided by 5 is 2y.

65
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,370
Negative 15 divided
by five is 3.

66
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,420
And so we have 2y times
2y minus 3, plus 5

67
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,910
times 2y minus 3.

68
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:16,900
So now you have two terms,
and 2y minus 3 is a

69
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,400
common factor to both.

70
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,970
So let's factor out a 2y minus
3, so this is equal to 2y

71
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:33,650
minus 3, times 2y, times
that 2y, plus that 5.

72
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,760
There's no magic happening
here, all I did is

73
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,900
undistribute the 2y minus 3.

74
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,480
I factored it out of
both of these guys.

75
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,760
I took it out of the
parentheses.

76
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,420
If I distribute it in, you'd get
back to this expression.

77
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,630
But we're done, we
factored it.

78
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,130
We factored it into two
binomial expressions.

79
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,050
4y squared plus 4y, minus
15 is 2y minus 3,

80
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:54,220
times 2y plus 5.

81
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:54,800
