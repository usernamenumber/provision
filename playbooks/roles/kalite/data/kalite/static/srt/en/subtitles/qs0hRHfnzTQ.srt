1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:04,929
Let's revisit the line integral F.n ds

2
00:00:04,929 --> 00:00:07,792
right over here because I want to make sure we have the proper conception

3
00:00:07,792 --> 00:00:10,090
and I was little "loosey goosey" with it in the last video

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,775
and in this video I want to get a little bit more exacting and actually use units

5
00:00:13,775 --> 00:00:16,557
so that we really understand what's going on here

6
00:00:16,557 --> 00:00:18,654
So I've drawn our path "C"

7
00:00:18,654 --> 00:00:22,119
and we're traversing it in the positive counterclockwise direction

8
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:24,939
and then I've taken a few sample points for F

9
00:00:24,939 --> 00:00:26,559
at any point in the x-y plane

10
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:29,113
that associates a 2-dimensional vector

11
00:00:29,113 --> 00:00:31,110
maybe at that point the 2-dimensional vector looks like that,

12
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,822
maybe at that point the 2-dimensional vector looks like that

13
00:00:33,822 --> 00:00:41,992
and then n is of course the unit normal vector at any point on our curve

14
00:00:41,992 --> 00:00:47,409
the outward pointing unit vector at any point on our curve

15
00:00:47,409 --> 00:00:52,119
Now in the last video, I talked about F as being some type of a velocity function

16
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:54,574
that at any point it gives you the velocity of the particles there

17
00:00:54,574 --> 00:00:56,518
and that wasn't exactly right

18
00:00:56,518 --> 00:00:58,289
in order to really understand what's happening here

19
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,339
in order to really conceptualize this as kind of flux through the boundary

20
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:05,984
the rate of mass exiting this boundary here

21
00:01:05,984 --> 00:01:08,953
we actually have to introduce a density aspect to F

22
00:01:08,953 --> 00:01:15,219
So right over here, I've rewritten F, and I've rewritten it as of a product of a scalar function and a vector function

23
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:17,986
so the scalar part right over here Rho of x,y

24
00:01:17,986 --> 00:01:22,736
Rho is a Greek letter often used to represent density of some kind

25
00:01:22,736 --> 00:01:24,604
in this case its mass density

26
00:01:24,604 --> 00:01:30,590
so at any given x,y point this tells us what the mass density is

27
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,680
mass density will be some mass in a 2-dimensional world

28
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,754
so it's mass per area

29
00:01:36,754 --> 00:01:39,212
and if we want particular units for our example-

30
00:01:39,212 --> 00:01:41,718
once again, this isn't the only way that this can be conceived of

31
00:01:41,718 --> 00:01:45,536
there's other applications, but this is the easiest way for my brain to process it

32
00:01:45,536 --> 00:01:51,907
we can imagine this as kilogram per square meter

33
00:01:51,907 --> 00:01:53,857
and this right over here is the velocity vector

34
00:01:53,857 --> 00:01:57,399
it tells us what is the velocity of the particles of that point

35
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:00,726
so this is kind of saying, "How much particles do you have at a kind of a point?

36
00:02:00,726 --> 00:02:05,615
How dense are they?" and this is "How fast are they going and in what direction?"

37
00:02:05,615 --> 00:02:09,864
and this whole thing is a vector, it's a velocity vector

38
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:11,276
but the components right over here

39
00:02:11,276 --> 00:02:15,290
M of x,y is just a number and you multiply that times a vector

40
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:19,231
so M of x,y right over here is going to be a scalar function

41
00:02:19,231 --> 00:02:21,074
when you multiply by i it becomes a vector

42
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,460
that's going to give you a speed

43
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,879
and then N of x,y is also going to give you a speed

44
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,330
and it tells you a speed in a j direction

45
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,628
so it becomes a vector and a speed in the i direction becomes a vector as well

46
00:02:32,628 --> 00:02:39,646
but these speeds, the units of speed (let me write this over here)

47
00:02:39,646 --> 00:02:41,887
so now we're talking about in particular M of x,y and N of x,y

48
00:02:41,887 --> 00:02:49,877
that would be in units of distance per time and so maybe for this example we'll say

49
00:02:49,877 --> 00:02:52,285
the units are meters per second

50
00:02:52,285 --> 00:02:55,442
So let's think about the units will be for this function

51
00:02:55,442 --> 00:03:01,347
if we distribute the Rho, because really at any given x,y, it really is just a number

52
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:08,253
so if we do that, we're going to get F- I'm not going to keep writing F of x,y

53
00:03:08,253 --> 00:03:12,692
we'll just understand that F, Rho, M and N are functions of x,y

54
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:22,469
F is going to be equal to Rho times M times the unit vector i

55
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:31,267
plus Rho times N times the unit vector j

56
00:03:31,267 --> 00:03:36,143
now what are the units here? what's Rho times M- what units are we going to get there?

57
00:03:36,143 --> 00:03:38,803
and we're gonna get the same units when we do Rho times N

58
00:03:38,803 --> 00:03:42,801
we'll we're gonna have, if we pick these particular units, we're going to have

59
00:03:42,801 --> 00:03:51,482
kilograms per meter squared times meters per second

60
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:53,780
so a little bit of dimensional analysis here

61
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,634
this meter in the numerator will cancel out with one of the meters in the denominator

62
00:03:57,634 --> 00:04:00,566
and we are left with something kind of strange

63
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:05,163
kilograms per meter second

64
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:11,445
which is essentially what the- if you view this vector has a magnitude in some direction

65
00:04:11,445 --> 00:04:16,266
the magnitude component is going to have these units right over here

66
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:19,999
and then we're going to take this and we're dotting it with N

67
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:22,211
N just only gives us a direction

68
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:26,610
it is a unit-less vector- it's only specifying a direction at any point in the curve

69
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:34,978
so when I take a dot product with this, it's going to give us essentially what is the magnitude of F

70
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:43,240
going in the direction of N. So this right over here, when you take the dot, it's essentially

71
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,291
a part of the magnitude of F going in N's direction

72
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:50,058
and it's going to have the same exact units as F

73
00:04:50,058 --> 00:04:56,323
so the units of this part, you're going to have kilograms per meter second

74
00:04:56,323 --> 00:04:58,648
and let me make this very clear-

75
00:04:58,648 --> 00:05:01,918
So let's say we're focusing on this point over here

76
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:08,803
F looks like that, its magnitude, the length of that vector is going to be in kilograms per meter second

77
00:05:08,803 --> 00:05:11,914
then we have a normal vector right over there

78
00:05:11,914 --> 00:05:13,579
and when you take the dot product, you're essentially saying

79
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:16,953
"What's the magnitude that's going in the normal direction?"

80
00:05:16,953 --> 00:05:21,317
so essentially, what's the magnitude of that vector right over there

81
00:05:21,317 --> 00:05:23,568
it's going to be in kilograms per meter second

82
00:05:23,568 --> 00:05:25,752
and we're multiplying it times ds

83
00:05:25,752 --> 00:05:30,717
we're multiplying it times this infinitesimally small segment of the curve

84
00:05:30,717 --> 00:05:32,584
we're going to multiply that times ds

85
00:05:32,584 --> 00:05:35,769
well, what are the units of ds? it's going to be unit of length

86
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,464
we'll just go with meters

87
00:05:37,464 --> 00:05:39,650
so this right over here is going to be meters

88
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:44,830
there's this whole integral, you're going to have kilogram per meter second times meters

89
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:54,994
so if you have kilograms per meter second and you were to multiply that times meters, what do you get?

90
00:05:54,994 --> 00:05:59,191
well this meters is going to cancel out that meters and then you get something that kinda starts to make sense

91
00:05:59,191 --> 00:06:01,955
you have kilogram per second

92
00:06:01,955 --> 00:06:05,308
and so this hopefully this makes it clear what's going on here

93
00:06:05,308 --> 00:06:09,602
this is telling us how much mass is crossing that little ds

94
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:12,439
that little section of the curve per second

95
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:15,022
and if you were to add up- and that's what integrals are all about,

96
00:06:15,022 --> 00:06:19,086
adding up an infinite number of these infinitesimally small ds's

97
00:06:19,086 --> 00:06:21,179
if you add all of that up

98
00:06:21,179 --> 00:06:24,854
you're going to get- the value of this entire integral is going to be in kilograms

99
00:06:24,854 --> 00:06:27,945
and kilograms per second, and it's essentially going to say,

100
00:06:27,945 --> 00:06:34,446
"How much mass is exiting this this curve at any given point? Or at any given time?"

101
00:06:34,446 --> 00:06:46,128
So this whole integral (let me rewrite it) of F.n ds tells us

102
00:06:46,128 --> 00:06:57,493
the mass exiting the curve per second

103
00:06:57,493 --> 00:06:59,402
and this should also be consistent in the last video

104
00:06:59,402 --> 00:07:04,772
we saw that this is equivalent to- and this is where we kinda view it as a 2-dimensional divergence theorem

105
00:07:04,772 --> 00:07:11,753
in the last video, we saw that this is equivalent to the double integral over the area of the divergence of f

106
00:07:11,753 --> 00:07:13,900
which is essentially just- well, I could write it 2 ways

107
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:28,521
the divergence of f and this right over here, that's just the partial of the i component with respect to x

108
00:07:28,521 --> 00:07:32,213
(let me write it over here, I don't want to do this too fast and loose)

109
00:07:32,213 --> 00:07:40,699
so this right over here is going to be the partial of Rho M (let me write it like this), Rho M

110
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:47,360
with respect to x plus the partial of the y component

111
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:58,856
Rho N with respect to y times each little chunk of area

112
00:07:58,856 --> 00:08:02,843
Well, what are the units of this going to be right over here?

113
00:08:02,843 --> 00:08:08,638
we know what Rho M is- Rho M gives us kilogram per meter second

114
00:08:08,638 --> 00:08:12,555
but if we take the derivative with respect to meters again,

115
00:08:12,555 --> 00:08:18,950
the units for either of these characters

116
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:25,170
are going to be kilograms per meter second per second

117
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:29,356
because we're taking the derivative with respect - sorry per METER, we're taking the derivative

118
00:08:29,356 --> 00:08:33,692
with respect to another unit of distance so you're going to take per meter

119
00:08:33,692 --> 00:08:36,856
so you're going to have another meter right in the denominator

120
00:08:36,856 --> 00:08:38,637
that's going to be the units here

121
00:08:38,637 --> 00:08:44,649
and then you're multiplying it times an area

122
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:49,994
so that would be meters squared, this right over here is square meters

123
00:08:49,994 --> 00:08:51,941
they cancel it out, and once again

124
00:08:51,941 --> 00:08:54,156
this whole part here that you're summing up

125
00:08:54,156 --> 00:08:59,167
gives us kilograms per second, so you're having a bunch of kilograms per second

126
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:07,966
and you're just adding them up throughout the entire area right over here

127
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:13,395
So hopefully this makes a little more sense, about how kinda how to conceptualize this vector function F

128
00:09:13,395 --> 00:09:18,830
if it confuses you, try your best to ignore it I guess

129
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:26,988
for me at least, this helped me out having a stronger conception of what vector F could kind of represent
