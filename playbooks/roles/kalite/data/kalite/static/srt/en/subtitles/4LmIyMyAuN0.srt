1
00:00:00,232 --> 00:00:01,867
What I wanna do in this video

2
00:00:01,867 --> 00:00:04,322
is talk a little bit about quasars.

3
00:00:06,153 --> 00:00:14,871
And that’s the short form for quasi-stellar radio sources.

4
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:19,000
And this name is just a by-product

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,867
of the first observations of quasars.

6
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:24,000
Because all they’d look like were these kind of point-like

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,489
sources of electromagnatic radiation, mainly in the radio part of the spectrum

8
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:33,067
so that’s why we called them quasi-stellar radio sources.

9
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:36,200
Now it turns out that they are neither stars

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,067
or even quasi-stellar, and they’re actually not even—

11
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:42,333
their main energy isn’t even being released in the radio frequency—

12
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:45,232
in the radio band of the electromagnetic spectrum.

13
00:00:45,232 --> 00:00:47,600
They’re far more energetic than that.

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,333
What they really are are the active nucleuses of galaxies.

15
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,067
So let’s think about that a little bit.

16
00:00:55,067 --> 00:00:57,237
So if we have a supermassive black hole

17
00:00:57,237 --> 00:00:58,733
at the center of a galaxy.

18
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:00,927
So let me draw that right over here.

19
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:03,158
That’s our supermassive black hole.

20
00:01:03,158 --> 00:01:04,969
And maybe that’s the surface of the event horizon

21
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:06,316
of the supermassive black hole

22
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:11,467
The actual mass of the black hole is in the center of that event horizon.

23
00:01:11,467 --> 00:01:15,067
If there’s material that’s passing by this black hole

24
00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:16,667
it’s going to get attracted to it,

25
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:19,067
and it’s going to form an accretion disk around it.

26
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:23,067
This material is going to start rotating around this black hole

27
00:01:23,067 --> 00:01:25,333
and some of it, if it doesn’t have enough velocity,

28
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:28,073
is going to actually fall into the black hole.

29
00:01:28,073 --> 00:01:30,933
So you have all of this material going around the black hole.

30
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:33,739
And some of it,

31
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:36,000
if it doesn’t have enough angular velocity,

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,569
not enough to orbit around the black hole,

33
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:40,467
it’s actually going to fall in.

34
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:41,564
Now while things—

35
00:01:41,564 --> 00:01:44,795
let me label this; this is the accretion disk.

36
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:51,267
So as things are getting faster and faster

37
00:01:51,267 --> 00:01:53,569
as they fall closer and closer to this black hole

38
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:55,667
and bumping into each other more and more

39
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:58,667
that gravitational potential energy from things falling into it

40
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:01,069
is being turned into actual energy

41
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:03,400
actual temperature

42
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,333
so what you have is things start to get really, unbelievably

43
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:10,867
unbelievably hot near the surface

44
00:02:13,236 --> 00:02:15,814
they get hotter and hotter as they fall closer and closer

45
00:02:15,814 --> 00:02:17,400
to that event horizon.

46
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,320
And so near the event horizon itself,

47
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,667
things are so intense that they’re actually releasing

48
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:23,559
electromagnetic

49
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:26,067
they’re actually releasing high-frequency

50
00:02:26,067 --> 00:02:27,493
electromagnetic radiation

51
00:02:27,493 --> 00:02:30,933
mainly in the x-ray part of the spectrum.

52
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:32,723
Now I want to be very clear.

53
00:02:32,723 --> 00:02:34,467
So there’s two things here.

54
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:38,244
One is, when you learn about quasars—

55
00:02:38,244 --> 00:02:40,318
or, when I was first exposed to quasars,

56
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:41,667
in, like, a Nova special—

57
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:44,933
they make you think that the radiation

58
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:48,000
is somehow being released by the black hole itself

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,200
and I would scratch my head.

60
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,667
Because I was just told that nothing can escape

61
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:54,150
the event horizon of a black hole,

62
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,667
including electromagnetic radiation.

63
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:59,133
So how could that be being emitted by the black hole?

64
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:01,641
The answer is, it’s not being emitted by the black hole.

65
00:03:01,641 --> 00:03:04,552
It’s being emitted by the matter

66
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:05,933
in the accretion disk

67
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:09,067
that hasn’t quite gotten to the event horizon yet

68
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:11,000
Once it’s inside of the event horizon,

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,733
any electromagnetic radiation that it might emit

70
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:17,880
will not be able to escape the black hole any more;

71
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,600
will not be able to escape the actual event horizon.

72
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,733
So all of this is from the accretion disk

73
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:27,867
around the supermassive black hole.

74
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:28,964
And the other question that used to

75
00:03:28,964 --> 00:03:30,108
pop in my mind

76
00:03:30,108 --> 00:03:33,833
is why does this kind of come out at these

77
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:37,533
kind of perpendicular, kind of orthogonal to the plane

78
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:40,629
of the actual accretion disk.

79
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:43,400
At least my logic tells me, well things are not going to

80
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,667
pop out along the direction of the accretion disk,

81
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:48,800
because then they’re going to be absorbed by other things

82
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,333
in fact that’s what’s going to cause other things

83
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,642
to get heated up

84
00:03:51,642 --> 00:03:55,400
closer to the actual event horizon,

85
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,133
so any energy that’s going out in that direction

86
00:03:58,133 --> 00:03:59,733
is just going to be absorbed

87
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:01,200
and make other things hotter,

88
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,600
and only when you go roughly perpendicular

89
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,067
to the plane of the accretion disk

90
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:10,800
is that energy aloud to kind of go transmit freely into space

91
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,333
Now I want to be very clear:

92
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:16,882
quasars are the most luminous things that we know of

93
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,298
in the universe.

94
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:30,133
The brightest, or actually, many quasars

95
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:32,852
are on the order of a trillion suns in luminosity,

96
00:04:32,913 --> 00:04:35,467
so they can be brighter than an entire galaxy,

97
00:04:35,467 --> 00:04:39,231
and that’s just coming from material around a fairly small

98
00:04:39,231 --> 00:04:40,733
region of space,

99
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:43,818
much, much, much smaller than an actual galaxy.

100
00:04:43,818 --> 00:04:47,000
It’s the very center, it’s kind of just the galactic core.

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,333
Now another interesting thing about quasars

102
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,153
and this kind of gives credence to this notion

103
00:04:52,153 --> 00:04:54,441
of a constantly changing universe,

104
00:04:54,441 --> 00:04:57,220
and even to some degree the Bing Bang itself,

105
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,600
is you have these supermassive black holes

106
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,200
that may be formed shortly after the Big Bang.

107
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,733
Now you can imagine, at an early stage

108
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:06,387
in the universe’s development,

109
00:05:06,387 --> 00:05:09,313
there would’ve been a lot of mass that would’ve been near

110
00:05:09,313 --> 00:05:12,333
these black holes that didn’t have quite the velocities

111
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,667
to be able to escape them or be able to orbit around them,

112
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:18,800
and so these would actually start falling into the black hole.

113
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,067
And then, over time, all of the mass

114
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:23,533
that had to fall into the black hole, the supermassive black hole

115
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:26,067
will have fallen into the supermassive black hole,

116
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:27,819
and if you imagine some future period of time,

117
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:31,333
you should still have the supermassive black hole,

118
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:34,667
but all you should see is mostly things orbiting around it.

119
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,133
Anything that had to fall into it

120
00:05:36,133 --> 00:05:38,600
would’ve already fallen into it.

121
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,566
So you’re just going to see things orbiting around it.

122
00:05:41,566 --> 00:05:43,067
And this is actually what we see.

123
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:44,667
If we look around us. If we look at our Milky Way Galaxy.

124
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:47,400
We don’t observe a lot of things falling in.

125
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:54,151
For example, the Milky Way does not have an active nucleus.

126
00:05:54,151 --> 00:05:55,637
An active core.

127
00:05:55,637 --> 00:05:58,067
It is not currently a quasar,

128
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:59,667
the center of the Milky Way Galaxy.

129
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:01,267
The supermassive black hole there

130
00:06:01,267 --> 00:06:04,133
is not, I guess we could say, is not digesting

131
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:06,933
or consuming material.

132
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,800
But you could imagine that sometime in the Milky Way’s past

133
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,634
there might’ve been a lot of material that didn’t have

134
00:06:12,634 --> 00:06:16,303
quite the velocity to be able to orbit, and so that was consumed,

135
00:06:16,303 --> 00:06:19,667
and when it was consumed, it would emit

136
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:24,733
all of this x-ray radiation, and could be observed as a quasar.

137
00:06:24,733 --> 00:06:26,667
And that’s actually what we observe.

138
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:28,723
The closest quasars, and we’ve observed more

139
00:06:28,723 --> 00:06:30,885
than 200,000 quasars.

140
00:06:30,885 --> 00:06:33,133
The closest quasars are on the order of

141
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:39,667
780 million—million!—light-years away.

142
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:40,567
So what does that mean?

143
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,667
We don’t observe quasars closer than 700 million light-years

144
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:48,400
So what that tells us is, at least in our region of the universe

145
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:54,267
the most recent quasars were 780 million years in the past.

146
00:06:54,267 --> 00:06:56,867
When we look at closer parts of the universe—

147
00:06:56,867 --> 00:06:58,133
so let me draw—

148
00:06:58,133 --> 00:07:01,333
let’s say this is the observable universe; this is us—

149
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,600
so we only start to observe quasars

150
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,552
at a certain distance away from us,

151
00:07:05,552 --> 00:07:08,933
and this distance is actually at a certain time in the past.

152
00:07:08,933 --> 00:07:11,333
because it took the light 780 million years to get to us.

153
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:16,000
And most of the quasars are more than 3 billion light years away,

154
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,133
which tells us that they only existed more than

155
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:23,533
3 billion years in the past, at a younger stage

156
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:25,467
of the actual universe,

157
00:07:25,467 --> 00:07:27,890
when there was actual material for these

158
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,333
supermassive black holes to consume

159
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,638
at the center of galaxies.

160
00:07:31,638 --> 00:07:34,733
As you move closer in time to us, and most of that material

161
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:36,737
has actually been consumed.

162
00:07:36,737 --> 00:07:39,267
And we just have material orbiting around

163
00:07:39,267 --> 00:07:40,986
these supermassive black holes,

164
00:07:40,986 --> 00:07:42,652
which we call galaxies,

165
00:07:42,652 --> 00:07:45,333
and so we don’t observe quasars anymore.

166
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,800
And just to give an idea—

167
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,933
I mean, you know, as with everything we learn in cosmology,

168
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:50,933
there’s kind of these mind-bending concepts,

169
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:54,639
unbelievable distances, unbelievable masses,

170
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,400
unbelievable brightnesses, I guess you could think about it,

171
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,333
but just to give a sense, the brightest known quasars

172
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:11,533
devour on the order of 1000 solar masses per year.

173
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:16,837
So that’s on the order of 10 earths per second,

174
00:08:16,837 --> 00:08:18,467
if I did my math right.

175
00:08:18,467 --> 00:08:25,916
Ten earths per second are being devoured by the brightest quasars.

176
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,823
And it’s that energy of that mass

177
00:08:27,823 --> 00:08:30,003
that’s accreting around it that’s generating

178
00:08:30,003 --> 00:08:33,467
that’s generating all of that energy.

179
00:08:33,467 --> 00:08:34,698
And actually I should say,

180
00:08:34,698 --> 00:08:36,050
I shouldn’t even talk about it in the present tense.

181
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,249
These brightest quasars, this happened in the past,

182
00:08:38,249 --> 00:08:39,702
we’re just observing it now.

183
00:08:39,702 --> 00:08:41,687
There are no—as—for all we know,

184
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,446
the rest of the universe looks fairly similar

185
00:08:43,446 --> 00:08:45,015
to the way our universe does,

186
00:08:45,015 --> 00:08:47,400
so there really aren’t that many quasars around.

187
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,019
Although you know, the other side of the coin might be

188
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:52,689
even though most of the material has already been consumed,

189
00:08:52,689 --> 00:08:54,585
maybe even by our own supermassive black hole

190
00:08:54,585 --> 00:08:56,995
in the center of the Milky Way,

191
00:08:56,995 --> 00:09:00,333
at some point in the future, maybe it will be able to consume

192
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:05,067
on some more stellar material, some more, well,

193
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:06,533
any type of material in the future,

194
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:09,200
and that might happen about 4, 5 billion years in the future

195
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,933
when we actually collide with the Andromeda Galaxy.

196
00:09:11,933 --> 99:59:59,999
So, anyway, hopefully that gave you some food for thought.
