1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:01,667
After being done with glycolysis and the Kreb's Cycle,

2
00:00:01,667 --> 00:00:14,267
we're left with 10 NADHs and 2 FADH2s

3
00:00:14,267 --> 00:00:15,139
and I told you that these are going to be used in the Electron Transport Chain

4
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:20,267
and they're all sitting in the matrix of our mitochondria

5
00:00:20,267 --> 00:00:20,767
and I said that they're going to be used in the

6
00:00:20,767 --> 00:00:26,667
Electron Transport Chain in order to actually generate ATP.

7
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:38,467
So that's what I'm going to focus on in this video--the Electron Transport Chain.

8
00:00:38,467 --> 00:00:42,000
And just so you know, a lot of this stuff is known,

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,933
but some of the details are actually current areas of research.

10
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:47,133
People have models and they're trying to substantiate

11
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:50,067
the models, but things are happening at such a small

12
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:50,567
scale here, that people can just look at the evidence, some

13
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:55,148
of it of which is indirect, and say this is probably

14
00:00:55,148 --> 00:00:58,000
what's happening. Most of this is very well established,

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,733
but some of the exact mechanisms--for example--how exactly some of the proteins work--

16
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:08,067
aren't completely understood. So I think it's very important

17
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:10,533
for you to understand that this is kind of at the cutting edge.

18
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:12,133
You're already there.

19
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:16,067
So the basic idea here is that the NADHs--and that's where

20
00:01:16,067 --> 00:01:18,933
I'll focus--FADH2 is kind of the same idea, although

21
00:01:18,933 --> 00:01:22,267
it's electrons are at a slightly lower energy state, so they

22
00:01:22,267 --> 00:01:26,600
won't produce quite as many ATPs. Each NADH--maybe I'll write it here--

23
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:34,200
each NADH is going to be, as you'll see, indirectly responsible

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,733
for the production of three ATPs, and each

25
00:01:37,733 --> 00:01:43,600
FADH2, in a very efficient cell, in both of these cases,

26
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,467
will be indirectly responsible for the production of 2 ATPs.

27
00:01:49,467 --> 00:01:52,200
And the reason why this guy produces fewer ATPs

28
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,067
is because the electrons that he has going into the Electron

29
00:01:56,067 --> 00:01:59,200
Transport Chain are at a slightly lower energy level

30
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,333
than the ones from NADH.

31
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:05,533
So in general, I just said indirectly, how does this whole business work?

32
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,200
Well in general, NADH when it gets oxidized

33
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,000
So, NADH... remember Oxidation is the losing of electrons

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,600
or the losing of Hydrogens that happen to have electrons

35
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,200
we can write its half reaction like this

36
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,867
its oxidation reaction like this

37
00:02:22,867 --> 00:02:25,133
you'll have some NAD plus which you can then go and use

38
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:29,800
back in the Kreb cycle and in glycolysis

39
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,400
you have some NAD plus, you'll have a proton right

40
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,533
a positive hydrogen ion is just a proton

41
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:39,133
and then you'll have two electrons

42
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:41,933
This is the oxidation of NADH

43
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:45,200
Oxidation of NADH

44
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,533
It's losing these two electrons

45
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:50,620
Oxidation is losing electrons. OIL RIG

46
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,133
Oxidation is losing electrons or you can imagine

47
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:55,933
it's losing Hydrogens from which it can hog electrons

48
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:57,800
Either one of those is the case

49
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,200
Now, this is really the first step of the electron transport chain

50
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,400
These electrons are transported out of the NADH

51
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,733
Now, the last step of the Electron Transport Chain is you have 2 electrons

52
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,533
and you can use the same 2 electrons if you'd like

53
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:18,800
2 electrons plus 2 Hydrogen protons

54
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,667
now obviously if you just add these two together

55
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,800
you're gonna have 2 Hydrogen atoms

56
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,933
which is just a proton and an electron

57
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:27,733
plus one Oxygen atom or so I could say

58
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:29,800
one half of molecular oxygen

59
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,667
that's the same thing as saying one Oxygen atom

60
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:34,933
and you're going to produce

61
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:36,533
If I have one Oxygen and two complete Hydrogens

62
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:38,800
I'm left with water

63
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:44,400
and you can view this we're adding electrons or we're gaining electrons

64
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,867
to Oxygen. OIL RIG - Reduction Is Gaining electrons

65
00:03:48,867 --> 00:03:54,940
So, this is the reduction of Oxygen to water

66
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:59,667
This is the oxidation of NADH to NAD+

67
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:04,800
Now, these electrons that are popping out of--these electrons right here

68
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,896
that are popping out of this NADH

69
00:04:07,896 --> 00:04:11,983
When they're in NADH, they're in a very high energy state

70
00:04:11,983 --> 00:04:14,733
and what happens over the course of the Electron Transport Chain

71
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:19,467
is that these electrons get transported to a series of--I guess you could call them--

72
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,333
transition molecules

73
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,733
but these transition molecules -

74
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:26,800
as the electrons go from one to the other, they go into slightly lower energy states

75
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,000
and I won't even go into the details of these molecules

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,441
Coenzyme Q, Cytochrome C

77
00:04:31,441 --> 00:04:39,800
and then they eventually end up right here

78
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,333
and they're used to reduce your Oxygen into water

79
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:48,733
Now, everytime an electron goes from a higher energy state

80
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:52,933
to a lower energy state--and that's what it's doing over the course of this electron transport chain

81
00:04:52,933 --> 00:05:02,000
it's releasing energy

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,321
so, energy is released from when you go from a higher state to a lower state

83
00:05:04,321 --> 00:05:09,800
with these electrons in NADH, they were in a higher state than they are when they bond to

84
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,191
Coenzyme Q so they release energy then they go to Cytochrome C

85
00:05:13,191 --> 00:05:14,400
release energy

86
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:21,667
now that energy is used to pump protons across the inner membrane of the mitochondria

87
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:23,933
this is all very complicated sounding and you know, this is the cutting edge

88
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:26,400
this is the cutting edge so it may be should sound a little complicated

89
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:35,946
so, let me draw a mitochondria just so you know where we're operating

90
00:05:35,946 --> 00:05:38,000
that's its outer membrane

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,400
and then its inner membrane will look like that

92
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,606
maybe it looks just like that

93
00:05:45,606 --> 00:05:48,667
now let me zoom in on the membrane

94
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:52,667
so let's say if I were to take-if I were to zoom in right there

95
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:56,467
so if I were to zoomed that out, that box will look like this

96
00:05:56,467 --> 00:06:00,513
you have your cristae here--now I'm gonna draw it thick

97
00:06:00,513 --> 00:06:04,600
right, so I'm zooming in--this green line right here--I'm gonna draw it really thick

98
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,154
colour it in with green just like that

99
00:06:07,154 --> 00:06:10,000
and then you have your outer membrane

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,933
and this outer membrane, I could do it up here

101
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:18,300
I'll just colour it in. You don't even have to see the outside of the outer membrane

102
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,400
right here, this base right here, this is the outer compartment

103
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,400
and then we learned in the last video, this base right here is the matrix

104
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,516
this is the matrix

105
00:06:28,516 --> 00:06:33,400
this is where our Krebs cycle occurred and where a lot of our NADH

106
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,504
or really all of our NADH is sitting

107
00:06:36,504 --> 00:06:39,200
so what happens is, everytime, NADH gets oxidized

108
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,867
to NAD+ or each of the and the electrons keep transferring from one molecule to another

109
00:06:43,867 --> 00:06:45,867
it's occurring in these big protein complexes

110
00:06:45,867 --> 99:59:59,999
and I'm not going into details on this
