1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,650
   

2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,940
The average male drinks 2 liters
of water when active

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:10,220
outdoors with the standard
deviation of 0.7 liters.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:16,160
You are planning a full day
nature trip for 50 men and

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,780
will bring 110 liters
of water.

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:24,020
What is the probability that
you will run out of water?

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,540
So let's think about what's
happening here.

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,690
So there's some distribution of
how many liters an average

9
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,590
man needs when they're
active outdoors.

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,660
And let me just draw
an example.

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,010
It might look something
like this.

12
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:40,530
So they're all going to need at
least more than 0 liters,

13
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,740
so this would be 0
liters over here.

14
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:47,140
The average male, so the mean
of the amount of water a man

15
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,400
needs when active outdoors
is 2 liters.

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,070
So 2 liters would be
right over here.

17
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,990
So the mean is equal
to 2 liters.

18
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:59,680
It has a standard deviation of
0.7 liters or 0.7 liters.

19
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,420
So the standard deviation--
maybe I'll draw it this way.

20
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,629
So this distribution, once
again, we don't know whether

21
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:05,930
it's a normal distribution
or not.

22
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,520
It could just be some type
of crazy distribution.

23
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,870
So maybe some people need
almost close to-- well,

24
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,680
everyone needs a little bit of
water, but maybe some people

25
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,580
need very, very little water.

26
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,400
Then you have a lot of people
who need that, maybe some

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,380
people who need more, and no one
can drink more than maybe

28
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,060
this is like 4 liters
of water.

29
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,660
So maybe this is the actual
distribution.

30
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,750
And then one standard deviation
is going to be 0.7

31
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:30,460
liters away.

32
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,870
So this is 1, 0.7 liters is--
so this would be 1 liter, 2

33
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,060
liters, 3 liters.

34
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,790
So one standard deviation is
going to be about that far

35
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,340
away from the mean.

36
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,360
If you go above it it'll
be about that far, if

37
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,215
you go below it.

38
00:01:43,215 --> 00:01:44,020
So let me draw.

39
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,630
This is the standard
deviation.

40
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,450
That right there is the standard
deviation to the

41
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,040
right, that's the standard
deviation to the left.

42
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,040
And we know that the standard
deviation is equal to-- I'll

43
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,110
write the 0 in front,
0.7 liters.

44
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,110
So that's the actual
distribution of how much water

45
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,620
the average man needs
when active.

46
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,210
Now what's interesting about
this problem, we are planning

47
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,330
a full day nature trip for
50 men and will bring

48
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,270
110 liters of water.

49
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,360
What is the probability
that you will run out?

50
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,250
So the probability that
you will run out-- let

51
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,040
me write this down.

52
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:26,180
The probability that I will or
that you will run out is equal

53
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,960
or is the same thing as the
probability that we use more

54
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:42,200
than 110 liters on our
outdoor nature day,

55
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,270
whatever we're doing.

56
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,170
Which is the same thing as the
probability, if we use more

57
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,620
than 110 liters, that means that
on average, because we

58
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,350
had 50 men, so 110 divided
by 50 is what?

59
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,620
That's 2.-- let me get the
calculator out just so we

60
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,140
don't make any mistakes here.

61
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,215
So this is going to be,
the calculator out.

62
00:03:03,215 --> 00:03:07,860
So on average, if we have 110
liters that's going to be

63
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,640
drunk by 50 men, including
ourselves I guess, that means

64
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,160
that it's the-- so we would
run out if on average more

65
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,770
than 2.2 liters is
used per man.

66
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,390
So this is the same thing as
the probability of the

67
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,410
average, or maybe we should say
the sample mean-- Or let

68
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:36,620
me write it this way, that the
average water use per man of

69
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,870
our 50 men is greater than, or
we could say greater than or

70
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,190
equal to, greater-- well I'll
say greater than because if

71
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,530
we're right on the money then we
won't run out of water-- is

72
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:55,960
greater than 2.2
liters per man.

73
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,150
So let's think about this.

74
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,110
We are essentially taking 50 men
out of a universal sample.

75
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,540
We got this data, who knows
where we got this data from

76
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,590
that the average man drinks 2
liters and that the standard

77
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,500
deviation is this.

78
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,450
Maybe there's some huge study
and this was the best estimate

79
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,750
of what the population
parameters are.

80
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,310
That this is the mean and this
is the standard deviation.

81
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,660
Now we're sampling 50 men.

82
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,899
And what we need to do is figure
out essentially what is

83
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:23,250
the probability that the mean of
the sample, that the sample

84
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,270
mean, is going to be greater
than 2.2 liters.

85
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,290
And to do that we have to figure
out the distribution of

86
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,270
the sampling mean.

87
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,150
And we know what
that's called.

88
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,390
It's the sampling distribution
of the sample mean.

89
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,960
And we know that that is going
to be a normal distribution.

90
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,480
And we know a few of the
properties of that normal

91
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,090
distribution.

92
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,390
So this is a distribution
of just all men.

93
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,420
And then if you take samples of,
say, 50 men, so this will

94
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,820
be-- let me write this down.

95
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:58,860
So down here I'm going to draw
the sampling distribution of

96
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:08,010
the sample mean when n,
so when our sample

97
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:12,110
size is equal to 50.

98
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,980
So this is essentially telling
us the likelihood of the

99
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,750
different means when we are
sampling 50 men from this

100
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,420
population and taking their
average water use.

101
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,470
So let me draw that.

102
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:26,190
So let's say that this is the
frequency and then here are

103
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,740
the different values.

104
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,755
Now the mean value of this, the
mean-- let me write it--

105
00:05:32,755 --> 00:05:37,290
the mean of the sampling
distribution of the sample

106
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,330
mean, this x bar-- that's really
just the sample mean

107
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:45,280
right over there-- is equal
to, if we were to do this

108
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,260
millions and millions
of times.

109
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,270
If we were to plot all of the
means when we keep taking

110
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,180
samples of 50, and we were to
plot them all out, we would

111
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,060
show that this mean of
distribution is actually going

112
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,470
to be the mean of our
actual population.

113
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,890
So it's going to be the same
value, I'm going to do it in

114
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:00,710
that same blue.

115
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,570
It's going to be the
same value as this

116
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,000
population over here.

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,740
So that is going
to be 2 liters.

118
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,940
So we still have-- we're still
centered at 2 liters.

119
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,350
But what's neat about this is
that the sampling distribution

120
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,450
of the sample mean, so you take
50 people, find their

121
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,230
mean, plot the frequency.

122
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,650
This is actually going to be a
normal distribution regardless

123
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,600
of-- this one just has a
well-defined standard

124
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,140
deviation mean.

125
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:25,970
It's not normal.

126
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,440
Even though this one isn't
normal, this one over here

127
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,910
will be, and we've seen it in
multiple videos already.

128
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,950
So this is going to be a
normal distribution.

129
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,780
And the standard deviation--
and we saw this in the last

130
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,760
video, and hopefully we've got
a little bit of intuition for

131
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,090
why this is true.

132
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:42,120
The standard deviation--
actually maybe

133
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,600
put it a better way.

134
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,730
The variance of the
sample mean is

135
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,470
going to be the variance.

136
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,580
So remember, it's going to
be-- this is standard

137
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,450
deviation, so it's going to be
the variance of the population

138
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,110
divided by n.

139
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,400
And if you wanted the standard
deviation of this distribution

140
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,260
right here, you just take the
square root of both sides.

141
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:05,350
If you take the square root of
both sides of that we have the

142
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,210
standard deviation of the sample
mean is going to be

143
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,100
equal to the square root of this
side over here, is going

144
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,490
to be equal to the standard
deviation of the population

145
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,290
divided by the square
root of n.

146
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,340
And what's this going
to be in our case?

147
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,920
We know what the standard
deviation of

148
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,890
the population is.

149
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,140
It is 0.7.

150
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:28,240
   

151
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,340
And what is n?

152
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,170
We have 50 men.

153
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:34,010
So 0.7 over the square
root of 50.

154
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:37,360
Now let's figure out what that
is with the calculator.

155
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:46,210
So we have 0.7 divided by
the square root of 50.

156
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:53,000
And we have 0.09-- well I'll say
0.098-- well it's pretty

157
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,370
close the 0.99.

158
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,350
So I'll just write that down.

159
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:03,220
So this is equal to 0.099.

160
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,880
That's going to be the standard
deviation of this.

161
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,990
It's going to have a lower
standard deviation.

162
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,780
So the distribution is going
to be normal, it's going to

163
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,490
look something like this.

164
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:17,800
So this is 3 liters over
here, this is 1 liter.

165
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,980
The standard deviation is almost
a tenth, so it's going

166
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,915
to be a much narrower
distribution.

167
00:08:23,915 --> 00:08:27,540
It's going to look something--
I'm trying my best to draw

168
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,140
it-- it's going to look
something like this.

169
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,990
   

170
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,299
You get the idea.

171
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:38,940
Where the standard deviation
right now is almost 0.1, so

172
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,679
it's 0.09, almost a tenth.

173
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,880
So it's going to be something--
one standard

174
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,650
deviation away is going to
look something like that.

175
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,970
So we have our distribution.

176
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,510
It's a normal distribution.

177
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,090
And now let's go back to our
question that we're asking.

178
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:54,710
We want to know the probability
that our sample

179
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:59,870
will have an average
greater than 2.2.

180
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:03,610
So this is the distribution of
all of the possible samples.

181
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,110
The means of all of the
possible samples.

182
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:09,130
Now to be greater than 2.2,
2.2 is going to be right

183
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,380
around here.

184
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,960
   

185
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,670
So we essentially are asking we
will run out if our sample

186
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,880
mean falls into this
bucket over here.

187
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,330
So we essentially need to figure
out what is-- you can

188
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,240
even view it as what's this area
under this curve there?

189
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,580
And to figure that out we just
have to figure out how many

190
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:32,230
standard deviations above the
mean we are, which is going to

191
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,300
be our Z-score.

192
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,130
And then we could use a Z-table
to figure out what

193
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:39,080
this area right over here is.

194
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:45,080
So we want to know when we're
above 2.2 liters, so 2.2

195
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,630
liters-- we could even do it
in our head-- 2.2 liters is

196
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,360
what we care about.

197
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,940
That's right over here.

198
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:57,095
Our mean is 2, so we are
0.2 above the mean.

199
00:09:57,095 --> 00:10:02,380
   

200
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:06,730
And if we want that in terms
of standard deviations, we

201
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,300
just divide this by the standard
deviation of this

202
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,710
distribution over here.

203
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,820
And we figured out
what that is.

204
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,970
The standard deviation of this
distribution is 0.099.

205
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,900
So if we take-- and you'll see
a formula where you take this

206
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,000
value minus the mean and divide
it by the standard

207
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,986
deviation-- that's
all we're doing.

208
00:10:23,986 --> 00:10:27,020
We're just figuring how many
standard deviations above the

209
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,190
mean we are.

210
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,980
So you just take this number
right over here divided by the

211
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:38,770
standard deviation, so 0.099
or 0.099, and then we get--

212
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:39,345
let's get our calculator.

213
00:10:39,345 --> 00:10:41,050
And actually we had the exact
number over here.

214
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:46,750
So we can just take 0.2-- we
could just take this 0.2

215
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,970
divided by this value
over here.

216
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:51,210
On this calculator when I press
second answer it just

217
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,150
means the last answer.

218
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,480
So I'm taking 0.2 divided
by this value over

219
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,150
there and I get 2.020.

220
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:05,100
So that means that this value,
or I should write this

221
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:12,020
probability is the same
probability of being 2.02

222
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:16,830
standard deviations-- or maybe
I should write it this way--

223
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:20,750
more than-- Let me write
it down here

224
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,530
where I have more space.

225
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:24,700
So this all boils down to the
probability of running out of

226
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:33,380
water is the probability that
the sample mean will be more

227
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,630
than-- just the 50 that we
happened to select-- remember,

228
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,300
if we take a bunch of samples
of 50 and plot all of them

229
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,640
we'll get this whole
distribution.

230
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,850
But the one 50, the group of 50
that we happened to select,

231
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,980
the probability of running out
of water is the same thing as

232
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,560
the probability of the mean of
those people, will be more

233
00:11:49,560 --> 00:12:02,400
than 2.020 standard deviations
above the mean of this

234
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,160
distribution, which they're
actually the same

235
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,000
distribution.

236
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,960
So what is that going to be?

237
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,390
And here we just have to
look up our Z-table.

238
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:12,150
Remember, this 2.02 is just
this value right here.

239
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:17,040
0.2 divided by 0.09.

240
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,860
I just had to pause the video
because there's some type of

241
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,300
fighter jet outside
or something.

242
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,830
So anyway, hopefully they
won't come back.

243
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,880
But anyway, so we need to figure
out the probability

244
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,930
that the sample mean will be
more than 2.02 standard

245
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,380
deviations above the mean.

246
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,870
And to figure that out we go
to a Z-table, and you could

247
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,020
find this pretty
much anywhere.

248
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,600
Usually it's in any stat book or
on the internet, wherever.

249
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,570
And so essentially we want to
know the probability-- the

250
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:43,300
Z-table will tell you how much
area is below this value.

251
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,050
So if you go to z of 2.02--
that was the value that we

252
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:47,930
were dealing with, right.

253
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:53,320
You have 2.02, it was-- so you
go for the first digit.

254
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:59,990
We go to 2.0, and it was 2.02.

255
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,910
2.02 is right over there.

256
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:06,150
So we have 2.0, and then in the
next digit you go up here.

257
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,290
So 2.02 is right over there.

258
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:12,960
So this 0.9783-- let me write
it down over here-- this

259
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,700
0.9783-- I want to
be very careful.

260
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:20,910
0.9783, that Z-table, that's
not this value over here.

261
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:25,700
This 0.9783 on the Z-table, that
is giving us this whole

262
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,240
area over here.

263
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,740
It's giving us the probability
that we are below that value.

264
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:33,840
That we are less than
2.02 standard

265
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,230
deviations above the mean.

266
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,180
So it's giving us that
value over here.

267
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:41,060
So to answer our question, to
answer this probability, we

268
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:44,240
just have to subtract this from
1 because these will all

269
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,090
add up to 1.

270
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:49,830
So we just take our calculator
back out and we just take 1

271
00:13:49,830 --> 00:14:00,310
minus 0.9783 is equal
to 0.0217.

272
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:05,480
So this right here is 0.0217.

273
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:12,520
Or another way you could say it,
it is a 2.17% probability

274
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,250
that we will run out of water.

275
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,160
And we are done.

276
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,350
Let me make sure I got
that number right.

277
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:23,010
So that number it was,
yeah, 0.0217, right.

278
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:27,630
So it's a 2.17% chance
we run out of water.

279
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:27,934
