1
00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:05,828
S: This is Sal again, and this is 4th in a series we're doing here at Stanford Med School w/Dr. Connolly.

2
00:00:05,828 --> 00:00:15,813
Dr: This is the 4th of the slides, and this would now be the reason why this section of colon was removed.

3
00:00:15,813 --> 00:00:22,314
This is cancer. So, just to orient. We're going to go to drawing.

4
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:34,900
Like you said before, this is the lumen, the inside. Out here is the rest of your belly.

5
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:42,098
S: Is there a word for your abdominal [insides]?

6
00:00:42,098 --> 00:00:48,321
Dr: Peritoneal. So the peritoneal cavity is where all the bowel loops are just moving around.

7
00:00:48,321 --> 00:00:57,284
What we have here is an important part, this is the muscle that allows peristalsis.

8
00:00:57,284 --> 00:01:03,971
S: The undulating motion to push stuff.

9
00:01:03,971 --> 00:01:12,237
Dr: Yes. It will milk it along. So the muscle is all fine there, that's how thick it's supposed to be,

10
00:01:12,237 --> 00:01:14,420
and it's all fine here...

11
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,835
S: What scale is this? How thick is that muscle?

12
00:01:16,835 --> 00:01:22,036
Dr: Our tiny little red blood cells are those tiny dots there, and so we're talking thickness here of

13
00:01:22,036 --> 00:01:23,847
about a few millimeters.

14
00:01:23,847 --> 00:01:26,773
S: So that muscle is a few millimeters.

15
00:01:26,773 --> 00:01:28,956
Dr: Right. So remember that guy was about 6mm? That's about 6mm.

16
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:36,990
Dr: That's actually strong, a very strong muscle, you can kinda see it go up here,

17
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,634
it comes around here, but it looks like it's trouble along this area.

18
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:48,878
S: And this stuff was probably once a polyp and it just turned into this massive polyp?

19
00:01:48,878 --> 00:01:56,077
Dr: Yes. So, we have the normal here, for the lining, this is where it's going dysplastic.

20
00:01:56,077 --> 00:02:00,070
There's where it's going dysplastic.

21
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,646
And so now what happens is you got these edges of dysplasia..

22
00:02:03,646 --> 00:02:08,151
S: When people in the medical field say "plastic," they word means...tissue?

23
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:14,606
Dr: Plastic in general, like plastic surgery, or the plastics in material science,

24
00:02:14,606 --> 00:02:18,368
means moldable. It also means you can grow, you can change shape.

25
00:02:18,368 --> 00:02:22,222
S: So when you call something plastic, it's moldable tissue?

26
00:02:22,222 --> 00:02:26,588
Dr: It's the shape changes. So the shape changes were wrong.

27
00:02:26,588 --> 00:02:31,882
Actually, dysplasia can refer to a cell, tissue, an organ, or an entire limb.

28
00:02:31,882 --> 00:02:36,247
It just means that it grew wrong, it molded wrong.

29
00:02:36,247 --> 00:02:39,777
So now, this is where we have the cell dysplasia,

30
00:02:39,777 --> 00:02:47,068
this is all the bad stuff. It basically started somewhere up there and started invading.

31
00:02:47,068 --> 00:02:52,269
S: Just one cell up there started dividing uncontrollably.

32
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:55,520
Dr: Right. It could have started from one cell being very bad,

33
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,071
it often starts though from one of these, meaning maybe a cell went bad right around there,

34
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:02,300
Now it's really starting to grow.

35
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:16,418
S: When you say grow, not the one cell but all of its descendants?

36
00:03:16,418 --> 00:03:22,966
Dr: Its descendants. Millions and billions are now growing downward to now, in this case,

37
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:30,721
grow all the way through. And so you can see the scale is it not only grew a little bit,

38
00:03:30,721 --> 00:03:32,950
it went right through the muscle.

39
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:41,634
S: The body does have some things to fight this off? But it was unsuccessful?

40
00:03:41,634 --> 00:03:46,418
Dr: Right. There are certain conditions where if you decrease the immune functions

41
00:03:46,418 --> 00:03:54,220
you'll get cancer. It's still argued if when the immune system decreases you get a virus,

42
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,724
and a virus causes the cancer, or whether the immune system is [actively watching out for cancer].

43
00:03:58,724 --> 00:04:06,805
S: The whole notion of viruses is fascinating, because a lot of our ancient DNA is from viruses...

44
00:04:06,805 --> 00:04:14,560
Dr: Yeah. There are some categories, where viruses can get into your DNA and really mess up your DNA,

45
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:21,201
and integrate into it, but viruses can also lead to irritation, with more cell growth and [likelihood

46
00:04:21,201 --> 00:04:23,616
for DNA copy errors].

47
00:04:23,616 --> 00:04:27,703
So now we're back where we're looking at the cancer that probably started around here,

48
00:04:27,703 --> 00:04:31,697
and is growing, including spreading all the normal tissue around it.

49
00:04:31,697 --> 00:04:34,715
Now we're going to look at the cells.

50
00:04:34,715 --> 00:04:53,059
First, look at the edges of this. We find normal, though not perfectly normal.

51
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:57,192
You can see it's a little bit dividing and a little bit irritated. This is irritated along the edge.

52
00:04:57,192 --> 00:04:58,725
S: Hyperplasia.

53
00:04:58,725 --> 00:05:01,929
Dr: Exactly! What we have when we go deeper, this is all coming out, growing in all directions,

54
00:05:01,929 --> 00:05:12,564
this is where you can see cancer next to the normal.

55
00:05:12,564 --> 00:05:16,511
We talked before about dysplasia, but this right here is really bad.

56
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:29,180
These are the normal ones, they're doing their job. They're making mucin, nuclei at the bottom,

57
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:37,154
What is this guy doing? It's just chaos. Before we talked about carcinoma in situ,

58
00:05:37,154 --> 00:05:41,612
a cancer in a spot--if you saw cells this bad, you'd say, do not let them go far.

59
00:05:41,612 --> 00:05:46,674
Because they will have a tendency to invade. They're crazy. So this right here is a bunch of the cells,

60
00:05:46,674 --> 00:05:49,460
this is a bunch of the cells, they're these guys here.

61
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,107
You can see they're really haphazard in how they're growing,

62
00:05:52,107 --> 00:05:54,429
they're not doing their job...

63
00:05:54,429 --> 00:06:00,141
S: If we had a polyp that had this stuff that hadn't crossed that boundary line yet,

64
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:02,556
we'd still say, "We got to take this out."

65
00:06:02,556 --> 00:06:05,714
...although I guess we already took it out.

66
00:06:05,714 --> 00:06:09,940
Dr: Cancer of the colon is one of the ones where surgical cures still applies.

67
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,169
Cut it out, and you are probably in pretty good shape.

68
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:15,513
So if it looked like this only at the tip of the polyp, we'd probably got it out,

69
00:06:15,513 --> 00:06:18,207
But you'd say to yourself, "We better watch this person."

70
00:06:18,207 --> 00:06:21,411
S: If the whole polyp looked like that, you'd cut out a bigger section?

71
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:25,173
Dr: Yes, if it's going down into the neck, or going a little further,

72
00:06:25,173 --> 00:06:27,495
or if you had cut it across the margin, then watch out.

73
00:06:27,495 --> 00:06:31,256
But here's the problem: Remember how I said up here it's not a big deal?

74
00:06:31,256 --> 00:06:33,810
But once you get near the veins and arteries?

75
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:39,105
These guys are running amuck, near the veins and arteries,

76
00:06:39,105 --> 00:06:42,170
S: You can see these cells have split off, and infiltrating...

77
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,049
Dr: That's one little nest of cells,

78
00:06:45,049 --> 00:06:49,832
that one is probably a cancer cell just dying to get into that little vein.

79
00:06:49,832 --> 00:06:52,526
S: So this is metastasis?

80
00:06:52,526 --> 00:06:56,845
Dr: This is where it would come from. So these guys are the bad actors,

81
00:06:56,845 --> 00:07:02,232
growing next to these very fragile blood vessels, so that guy is knocking on the door,

82
00:07:02,232 --> 00:07:08,640
wants to get in here--that's a venule, a little vein, that's the road out.

83
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,006
S: It looks like a circle here because it's a 2D cross-section of it,

84
00:07:13,006 --> 00:07:15,374
but you can imagine it popping in and out of our screen.

85
00:07:15,374 --> 00:07:18,532
Dr: Yes. So this guy might pop in and out of screen, connect to this one...

86
00:07:18,532 --> 00:07:24,569
S: And it officially metastasized once it's found a beachhead someplace else?

87
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:29,956
Dr: Right. It's considered a metastasis if the cell got into the vessel and left the region,

88
00:07:29,956 --> 00:07:35,436
This is looking like you really are worrying that this could metastasize.

89
00:07:35,436 --> 00:07:42,959
What's interesting is when you're looking at something like this, there's something called

90
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:47,325
pre-cancer grade, and what grade is is what we've been talking about--

91
00:07:47,325 --> 00:07:50,436
how bad does that look? And so the grade is, "Wow, that looks nasty."

92
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:53,734
S: Is nasty a technical term?

93
00:07:53,734 --> 00:07:58,424
Dr: Actually we use it quite a bit. When we talk about nastiness, it's a lack of behavour,

94
00:07:58,424 --> 00:08:03,997
if you can get a cell where the nucleus gets that big, or sometimes that big,

95
00:08:03,997 --> 00:08:09,802
there's chaos. And there's chaos not just in the nuclear size, but how it behaves.

96
00:08:09,802 --> 00:08:16,953
S: The nuclear size indicates that the cell is devoting cell replication?

97
00:08:16,953 --> 00:08:21,783
Dr: Yes. But it also means to me--normally things in the cell are very orderly,

98
00:08:21,783 --> 00:08:27,170
you do not divide your DNA until these things--now it's just left and right.

99
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:33,858
This would be a high-grade tumor, and stage is the other main thing.

100
00:08:33,858 --> 00:08:37,805
Stage means where is it in the body.

101
00:08:37,805 --> 00:08:44,771
So in this case, if these nasty cells were only at the very top, it would be a lower stage than

102
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:47,836
these which have come all the way down here.

103
00:08:47,836 --> 00:08:50,994
S: In situ carcinoma, what is the stage?

104
00:08:50,994 --> 00:08:59,957
Dr: Stage 0. It's basically nowhere. If you just begin to crossover, it's stage 1;

105
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:05,715
and then there's depth for some stages, and then there's always "did it go to other parts of your body?"

106
00:09:05,715 --> 00:09:08,130
And that's the very highest stage

107
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:14,167
S: And this is true of all cancer--when someone speaks of breast cancer, I've heard of stage 0-4,

108
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:23,827
It isn't just the size--if the cancerous tissue is big, but in a safe place, still be stage 1 or 2?

109
00:09:23,827 --> 00:09:35,019
Dr: It is. The whole world has agreed to the same kind of staging, and that staging is what we're calling TNM.

110
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:41,288
T has to do with how big it is, and how much it's crossed any barriers,

111
00:09:41,288 --> 00:09:52,527
N has to do with if they are in lymph nodes. The lymph nodes are nearby structures where the lymph goes.

112
00:09:52,527 --> 00:09:56,660
M has to do with metastasis.

113
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,889
Staging has to do with all three.

114
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:02,279
S: Metastases always has to happen through the circulatory system?

115
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:06,319
Through the blood vessels, or does it also happen through the lymph network?

116
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:10,917
Dr: It's something where going through the lymph nodes is one of the first steps for something like this,

117
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:14,446
but getting to the liver or the lung, it's got to get into the blood vessels.

118
00:10:14,446 --> 00:10:19,090
The lymphatic in your colon connects to a local lymph node,

119
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:22,713
but does not connect through lymph only to the (...? be quieter, Sal!)

120
00:10:22,713 --> 00:10:25,406
So it must have gone through the blood somewhere.

121
00:10:25,406 --> 00:10:29,864
So that's the way it looks here. And the final thing when looking at this cancer is

122
00:10:29,864 --> 00:10:34,694
if we go over here, this is the greatest depth of invasion.

123
00:10:34,694 --> 00:10:37,109
You had asked me about the body's immune function.

124
00:10:37,109 --> 00:10:40,546
Well, if you look here, you see how it's kind of loose?

125
00:10:40,546 --> 00:10:43,193
There is all these little immune cells?

126
00:10:43,193 --> 00:10:45,422
S: What's the immune cells?

127
00:10:45,422 --> 00:10:48,858
Dr: These guys here. These little round guys? These are lymphocytes.

128
00:10:48,858 --> 00:10:53,084
S: How can you tell the difference between the lymphocytes and the cancer cells?

129
00:10:53,084 --> 00:10:55,360
Dr: Because I'm a pathologist...

130
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:02,837
They're these little round ones. Right here is a classic cell, which is called a plasma cell

131
00:11:02,837 --> 00:11:06,877
in which there is a nucleus here, and all the rest is making antibodies

132
00:11:06,877 --> 00:11:10,453
S: You're not circling that area are you?

133
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:14,215
Dr: No, I'm just drawing. So this guy is this one. So I'm zooming in on him.

134
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:24,106
Dr: That's a plasma cell, that's making antibodies probably against the tumor.

135
00:11:24,106 --> 00:11:40,035
That's the immune response in that spot.

136
00:11:40,035 --> 00:11:43,750
S: How do you know...that looks very similar to the cancer cells?

137
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:48,673
Dr: This one is a little hard to tell. If you had a real microscope, you'd turn up the light,

138
00:11:48,673 --> 00:11:51,320
this would have a very specific look to the nucleus,

139
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,617
and these guys over here have little pink granules in them,

140
00:11:54,617 --> 00:11:56,986
which is a type of immune cell.

141
00:11:56,986 --> 00:12:11,800
S: Which ones are cancerous here?

142
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,119
Dr: These are all inflammation. The nearest cancer cells are these guys up here.

143
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:19,463
