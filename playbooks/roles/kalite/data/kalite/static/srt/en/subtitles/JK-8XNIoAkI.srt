1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,910
In the last video we saw that
if we had some line that was

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:09,050
defined as all of the scalar
multiples of some vector-- I'll

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,800
just write it like this.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,040
The scalar multiples,
obviously,

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,370
are any real number.

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,900
We defined a transformation, and
I didn't speak of it much

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,280
in terms of transformations, but
it was a transformation.

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:26,220
We defined a projection
onto that line L as a

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,500
transformation.

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,870
In the video, we drew it as
transformations within R2, but

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:36,110
it could be, in general, a
transformation from Rn to Rn.

12
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:44,210
We defined it as, the projection
of x onto L was

13
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:49,046
equal to the dot product of x,
with this defining vector.

14
00:00:49,046 --> 00:00:53,420
x dot this defining vector,
divided by that defining

15
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,670
vector dotted with itself.

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,280
All of that times the defining
vector of the line.

17
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,050
This was our definition.

18
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,319
A couple of things might have
popped out at you right when

19
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,490
we first saw this.

20
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,830
When you dot a vector with
itself, what's that equal to?

21
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,960
We know that if I take some
vector, and I dot it with

22
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,100
itself, that is equivalent
to the length

23
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,480
of the vector squared.

24
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:30,610
We can rewrite this as being
equal to x dot v, over the

25
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:34,600
length of v squared, all
of that times v.

26
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,920
Wouldn't it be nice if the
length of v was 1.

27
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,870
The length of v was
equal to 1.

28
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,460
If the length of v was 1, or
this is another way of saying

29
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:52,670
that, v is a unit vector.

30
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,040
Our formula for our projection
would just

31
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,180
simplify to x dot v.

32
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,980
All of that times, this will
just be some scalar number,

33
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,180
that times v.

34
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,660
You say, hey Sal, how do
we know if this is a

35
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,360
unit vector or not.

36
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,290
What you can realize is that
any-- Let me draw it this way.

37
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,280
When I drew it in the previous
video, I just picked

38
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,720
a line, like that.

39
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,540
The line can be really defined
to this vector v in the line.

40
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,150
It can be any of the vectors
that's contained in the line.

41
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,490
The vector v could
be like that.

42
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,100
Let's say someone gives
you a vector v that

43
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,360
isn't a unit vector.

44
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,050
Let's say that the length
of v is not equal to 1.

45
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,660
How can you define a line
using some unit vector.

46
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,300
You can just normalize v.

47
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,180
You can define some unit
vector right here.

48
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,920
You could define sum
vector right there.

49
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,340
Let's call it u, and I'll
say it's a unit vector.

50
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:59,700
That is equal to 1 over 1 over
the length of v times v.

51
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,490
I showed you this in the
unit vector video.

52
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,790
You can construct a unit vector
that goes in the same

53
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:07,190
direction as any vector,
essentially just by dividing,

54
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,070
or I guess multiplying,
that vector

55
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,160
times 1 over its length.

56
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,310
In general, we can always
redefine the line.

57
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,150
All of the possible scalar
multiples of v are going to be

58
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,880
the same thing as all of the
scalar multiples of our unit

59
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,760
vector, u, which is just
a scalar multiple of v.

60
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,860
We can redefine our line.

61
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,410
If we redefine our line, L,
as being equal to all the

62
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:35,360
possible scalar multiples of
our unit vector, where the

63
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,150
scalars are any members
of the real numbers.

64
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,930
Our projection definition
simplifies a good bit.

65
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:51,270
The projection of x onto L
becomes x dot our unit vector,

66
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:57,690
times the unit vector, times
the unit vector itself.

67
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,890
That case that I did in the
previous video, where I had

68
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,280
those two vectors.

69
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,860
Where I said the vector v that
defined the line, I think it

70
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,660
was vector 2, 1.

71
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:16,720
Our vector x was
equal to 2, 3.

72
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,810
If you want to do this
definition, we just have to

73
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,720
turn this guy into a
unit vector first.

74
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,830
The way you turn him into a unit
vector, you figure out

75
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,680
the magnitude.

76
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,060
In this case the magnitude
of v is equal to what.

77
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:35,270
2 squared plus 1 squared is 1.

78
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,080
You take the square
root of that.

79
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,630
Let me just write.

80
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,320
It's equal to square root of 2
squared plus 1 squared, which

81
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,370
is equal to the square
root of 5.

82
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,700
You can define your u-- your
unit vector could just be 1

83
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,510
over this, times that guy.

84
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:54,010
1 over the square root
of 5 times 2, 1.

85
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,590
You could multiply
it out, or not.

86
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,200
You could just leave
it in this form.

87
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,320
You can always, for any vector
v, you can always find a unit

88
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,870
vector that goes in the same
direction, assuming that we're

89
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,870
dealing with non-zero vectors.

90
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:10,060
You can always reduce anything
like this, to some other

91
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,180
definition, like this.

92
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,560
Where this is a unit
vector version of

93
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,780
your vector v up there.

94
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,890
I just said that,
look, this is a

95
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,760
transformation from Rn to Rn.

96
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,180
The one thing that we're not
sure of, is this a linear

97
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,390
transformation.

98
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,590
We can always write
it like this.

99
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,780
Let's see if this is always
going to be a linear

100
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,560
transformation.

101
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,876
There's two conditions for it to
be a linear transformation.

102
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:47,720
Let's see what happens if I take
the projection onto L of

103
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,040
two vectors.

104
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,030
Let's say the vector a
plus the vector v.

105
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,650
If I take the sum of
their vectors.

106
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,960
If this is a linear
transformation, this should be

107
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,190
equivalent to taking each
of their projections

108
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,770
individually, and
then summing.

109
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,050
Let's see if this is the case.

110
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,950
This is equal to, by our
definition, we'll use the unit

111
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,060
vector version, because
it's simpler.

112
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:14,410
This is equal to a plus b,
that's our x, dot u.

113
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:18,260
And then, all of that times
our unit vector.

114
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,880
We know that the dot product has
a distributive property,

115
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:29,580
so that this is equal to
a dot u plus b dot u.

116
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,260
These are unit vectors.

117
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,510
All of that times
the vector u.

118
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,990
These are just scalar numbers.

119
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,930
So scalar multiplication has
distributive properties.

120
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:44,120
This is equal to a dot u,
times our vector u.

121
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,200
Remember, this is just going
to be some scalar.

122
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:52,670
Plus b dot u times our
unit vector u.

123
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,980
What is this equal to.

124
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,070
This right here is equal
to the projection of a.

125
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:02,300
This is equal to the projection
of a onto L, by

126
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,880
definition, right here.

127
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,910
By this definition.

128
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,280
If we assume that we're dealing
with the unit vector

129
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,060
definition for the line.

130
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,820
This is equal to, this whole
thing right here, is equal to

131
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:18,710
plus the projection onto
L of the vector b.

132
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:23,210
We see our first condition
for this being a linear

133
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,150
transformation holds.

134
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:28,190
A projection of the sum of the
vectors is equal to the sum of

135
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,390
the projections of
the vectors.

136
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,350
Our second condition is that
the projection of a scalar

137
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,330
multiple should be equal to
a scalar multiple of the

138
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,710
projection.

139
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:39,150
Let me write that down.

140
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:44,380
What is the projection onto L
of some scalar multiple of

141
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,420
some vector a.

142
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:53,940
That is equal to ca dot
our unit vector u

143
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,060
times unit vector u.

144
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,710
This one is a little bit
more straightforward.

145
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,060
This is the scalar multiple.

146
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,410
We see it in our dot product
properties, this is equal to c

147
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:09,600
times a dot u, times
the vector u.

148
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,320
This is just equal to c times,
this right here, is a

149
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,000
projection of a onto L.

150
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,970
We met both of our conditions
for linear transformations.

151
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:26,020
We know that our projection
onto a line L in Rn is a

152
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,480
linear transformation.

153
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,610
That tells us that we can
represent it as a matrix

154
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,860
transformation.

155
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:41,220
We know that projection of x
onto L, we already know this

156
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,440
definition, it can
be rewritten.

157
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,919
It doesn't hurt to rewrite it.

158
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,550
As x dot some unit vector
that defines our line.

159
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,130
Let me draw it with a little
hat to show that

160
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,680
it is a unit vector.

161
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,910
Times the unit vector
itself, so that we

162
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,590
actually get a vector.

163
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,800
How can I write this as
some matrix product.

164
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,220
Some matrix vector product.

165
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,730
I want to write it as
a product of some

166
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,130
matrix times x.

167
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,230
To simplify things, since we're
actually dealing with a

168
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,920
matrix, let's limit ourselves
to the case of R2.

169
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,010
I'm assuming that my projection
onto L is going to

170
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:22,360
be a mapping from R2 to R2.

171
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,770
You could do what I'm
doing here with

172
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,630
an arbitrary dimension.

173
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:29,850
If we're doing it in R2, then
our matrix A, right there, is

174
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,540
going to be a 2 by 2 matrix.

175
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,200
We've seen in multiple videos
that to figure out the matrix

176
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,310
A, we just take the identity
matrix that has the standard

177
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,360
basis vectors as columns.

178
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,610
0, 1.

179
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,460
Or 1, 0, and then 0, 1.

180
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,680
And we apply the transformation
to each of

181
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,740
these columns.

182
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:54,400
We could say that A is going
to be equal to-- its first

183
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,910
column is going to be equal to
the projection onto L of this

184
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,200
thing right here.

185
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,850
We'll do it in this orange
color, right here.

186
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,050
What is that going to be.

187
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:08,300
That is going to
be this dot u.

188
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,570
Let me write my u.

189
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:12,540
My unit vector, let's just
assume that u can be rewritten

190
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:17,990
as my unit vector is equal
to sum u1 and u2.

191
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,100
Just like that.

192
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,170
I need to take this dot
my unit vector, let

193
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,620
me write this down.

194
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,940
Let me write this on the side.

195
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,560
The first thing I want to do
is figure out what the

196
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,830
projection-- the projection
onto L, let me

197
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,270
write it this way.

198
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:38,680
We know the projection is just
equal to this dot this times

199
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,340
that vector.

200
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,140
Let me write that.

201
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:46,660
The vector 1, 0 dot
the unit vector u,

202
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,970
which is just u1, u2.

203
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:53,980
We're going to have that
times my unit vector.

204
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,770
I'll write it like this.

205
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:58,930
Times the vector u1, u2.

206
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,800
This is going to be my
first column in my

207
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,580
transformation matrix.

208
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,190
My second column is going to be
the same thing, but I'm not

209
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,980
ready to take the projection
of this guy.

210
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,880
The definition of our projection
is you dot this guy

211
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,460
with our unit vector.

212
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,310
So we dot it.

213
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:19,570
We're taking the dot
product of 0, 1.

214
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:26,190
0, 1 dot my unit vector
dot u1, u2.

215
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm going to multiply
that times my unit

216
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,830
vector, times u1, u2.

217
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,670
This seems very complicated, but
it should simplify when we

218
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,810
actually try to work out our
transformation matrix.

219
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,520
Let's do it.

220
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,570
When I dot these two guys,
what do I get.

221
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,580
Let me write it here.

222
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:50,830
My matrix A will become 1 times
u1, plus 0 times u2.

223
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,720
That's just u1.

224
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,190
This whole thing just simplifies
to u1, when I take

225
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,350
the dot product of
these two things.

226
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:01,050
Times u1, u2.

227
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,210
That's going to be
my first column.

228
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:06,890
My second column, if I dot these
two guys, I get 0 times

229
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,680
u1 plus 1 times u2.

230
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:16,240
So I'm going to get u2 times
my unit vector, u1, u2.

231
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,790
If I multiply that out, this
will be equal to what.

232
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,540
I can just write them
as columns. u1

233
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:24,060
times u1 is u1 squared.

234
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:29,860
u1 times u2 is u1, u2.

235
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:34,680
u2 times u1 is u2 times u1.

236
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,560
Then, u2 times u2
is u2 squared.

237
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,110
You give me any unit vector
and I will give you the

238
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,920
transformation that gives you
any projection of some other

239
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,430
vector onto the line
defined by that.

240
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,670
That was a very long
way of saying that.

241
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,030
Let's go back to what
I did before.

242
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,140
Let's say we want to find any
projection onto the line, onto

243
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,540
the vector, I'll draw it here.

244
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,580
We'll do the same example that
we did in the last video.

245
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:07,710
If I have some vector v
that looks like that.

246
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:13,200
We said the vector v was equal
to the vector 2, 1.

247
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,680
That was my vector v.

248
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,930
How can we find sum
transformation for the

249
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,880
projection onto the
line defined by v?

250
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,940
Onto this line right here.

251
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,530
The line defined by v.

252
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:29,070
What we can first do is convert
v into a unit vector.

253
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:32,360
We can convert v into
a unit vector that

254
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,840
goes in the same direction.

255
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,530
Some unit vector u.

256
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,320
We did that already up here.

257
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,290
Where we essentially just
divided [? bv ?]

258
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,210
by it's length.

259
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,840
Let's take v and divide
by it's length.

260
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,830
The unit vector is this, 1
over the square root of 5

261
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,800
times our vector v.

262
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,090
It was 1 over the square
root of 5 times our

263
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,960
vector v, right there.

264
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,820
You start with a unit
vector there.

265
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,610
You just create this matrix,
and then we will have our

266
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,470
transformation matrix.

267
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:07,660
If this is our u, what will
our matrix be equal to.

268
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,220
This is u.

269
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:14,270
Then our matrix would be
equal to u1 squared.

270
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,220
What is u1 squared.

271
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:20,190
Let me rewrite our u a little
bit, not at angles.

272
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:24,060
Our vector u, our unit vector
that defines this line, is

273
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:29,020
equal to the vector 2 over the
square root of 5 and 1 over

274
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,910
the square root of 5.

275
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,730
I just multiplied
out this scalar.

276
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:37,870
If we want to construct this
matrix, we get A is equal to

277
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,870
u1 squared.

278
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,550
What is this squared?

279
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:43,300
It becomes 2 squared 4 over the
square root of 5 squared,

280
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,700
which is just 5.

281
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,640
Equals 4 over 5.

282
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,280
What is u1 times u2?

283
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,780
2 times 1 over square root of
5 times square root of 5.

284
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,590
So, 2/5.

285
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,970
I just multiplied these two.

286
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,990
What is u2 times u1.

287
00:14:58,990 --> 00:14:59,600
Same thing.

288
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,570
Order doesn't matter
when you multiply.

289
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,760
This will also be 2/5.

290
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,780
What is u2 squared.

291
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,270
1 squared over the square root
of 5 squared is just 1/5.

292
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:14,040
Now we can say-- and that's the
neat thing about creating

293
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,010
these matrices, that the
projection-- Let's say we have

294
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,230
some, let's say this is the
origin right here, we have

295
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,540
some other vector
x, right here.

296
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,220
We can now define our
transformation.

297
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:31,970
The projection onto L where
L is equal to any scalar

298
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,190
multiple of our unit vector u.

299
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:37,070
It's right here.

300
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,030
Is a member of the reals.

301
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,260
That is our line L.

302
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,770
The projection onto L
of any vector x is

303
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,260
equal to this matrix.

304
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:54,070
Is equal to the matrix 4, 5,
2/5, 2/5, 1/5 times x.

305
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,530
Which is a pretty neat result,
at least for me.

306
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:59,630
We once again reduced everything
to just a matrix

307
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,760
multiplication.

308
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,400
You take this x and you multiply
it by this matrix,

309
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,470
you're going to get its
projection onto

310
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:08,790
the L, onto the line.

311
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:13,095
If you take this vector, let's
say a, and you multiply it

312
00:16:13,095 --> 00:16:15,190
times this matrix right there,
you're going to get its

313
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,480
projection.

314
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,420
Its projection onto the line.

315
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,320
If you could take this vector--
No, it should go

316
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,010
through the origin.

317
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,240
I want to draw it in
standard position.

318
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,660
If you take this vector, right
there, and multiply it times

319
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:30,300
this matrix, you're going to get
this vector, right here,

320
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,750
that is contained in the line.

321
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,890
When you subtract it from
this, it's orthogonal.

322
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:35,640
We know the definition.

323
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,330
It's kind of the shadow
of that vector.

324
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,220
Anyway, I think this
is pretty neat.
