1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,450
   

2
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,970
We're asked to factor this
expression by grouping.

3
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:06,380
Now, they mention grouping,
we're going to see what

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,130
grouping is, but we're going
to see very quickly that we

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,230
have to do this thing called
grouping because you can't

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,850
just factor this expression.

7
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:15,610
If you look at these, each of
the terms, all but one of them

8
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:16,750
is divisible by 5.

9
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,590
So you can't just
factor out a 5.

10
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,210
Not all of them are divisible
by either r or s.

11
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,620
This is only divisible by r,
that's only divisible by s,

12
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,060
that's divisible by neither.

13
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,820
So there is no common factor
across all four of these

14
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,400
terms. That's why we have to
group them into groups where

15
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,940
there are common factors, and
then see if that simplifies

16
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,010
the whole thing.

17
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,890
And there is a little bit of an
art to recognizing when you

18
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,230
can factor by grouping, but
they've set this problem up

19
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,450
nicely for us.

20
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,620
So if you look at these first
two terms right here.

21
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,240
You have a 5rs and a 25r.

22
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,180
These two guys clearly have
some common factors.

23
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,770
They're both divisible by 5,
they're both divisible by r.

24
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,415
So if I just wanted to factor
this one out, or if I wanted

25
00:01:02,415 --> 00:01:04,790
to rewrite it as a product
of two expressions, how

26
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,269
could I write it?

27
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:10,080
Well, I could write it as a
product of 5r times-- what's

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,420
5rs divided by 5r?

29
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,650
Well, you still have
an s left over, you

30
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:15,810
just have an s there.

31
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,010
Plus-- what's 25r
divided by 5r?

32
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:24,070
Well, 25 divided by 5 is 5, and
r divided by r is just 1.

33
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:28,000
So 25r over 5r is 5.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,210
So these first two terms can
be factored into these two

35
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,230
expressions.

36
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:36,450
And then let's look at these
second two terms. Well, they

37
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,660
definitely have a common factor,
you have a negative 3

38
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,210
or positive 3 common
to both of these.

39
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,710
Let's just go with
the negative 3.

40
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,770
And our goal is really to factor
it into a negative 3

41
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,830
times, hopefully, something
very similar to s plus 5.

42
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,240
And you might already be seeing
that it's going to

43
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,210
factor into s plus it.

44
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:52,950
5.

45
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,580
So let's factor out
that negative 3.

46
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,970
So these two terms you can
rewrite as negative 3 times--

47
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,770
what's negative 3s divided
by negative 3?

48
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,510
Well, you're just going to
have an s left over.

49
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:08,220
And then what's negative 15
divided by negative 3?

50
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,470
Well, that's just positive 5.

51
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,780
   

52
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,570
And just like that, we've
grouped them and we're able to

53
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,400
factor each of those groups, and
then something interesting

54
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,620
might pop out at you.

55
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,410
And one, you can always verify
that you factored this

56
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,690
properly by distributing each
of these expressions.

57
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,380
Distributing the 5r times s
plus 5, and the negative 3

58
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,340
times s plus 5, you'll
get exactly this.

59
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,590
But something maybe jumped
at out you just now.

60
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,170
You have 5r times s plus 5.

61
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,170
Then you have negative
3 times s plus 5.

62
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,420
So now this expression, we
have two terms instead of

63
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,360
four, right, this is one term,
this is another term.

64
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,530
And they both have s plus 5 as a
common factor, so we can now

65
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,445
factor out s plus 5.

66
00:02:50,445 --> 00:02:53,940
   

67
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,020
So this whole thing can
be rewritten as s

68
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:04,490
plus 5 times 5r.

69
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:04,720
Right?

70
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,570
If you take 5r times s plus 5,
and you factor out the s plus

71
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,670
5, you're just left
with the 5r.

72
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,640
And then similarly, if you take
negative 3 times s plus

73
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,820
5, and you factor out the s plus
5, or divide by s plus 5,

74
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,800
you just have a negative
3, just like that.

75
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,650
And then we're done!

76
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,310
We've factored this expression
by grouping.

77
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,520
It's s plus 5 times
5r minus 3.

78
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,270
And you can verify it by
multiplying it out.

79
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:32,860
If you distribute the s plus
5 onto each of these terms,

80
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,660
you'll get this expression
up here, and then if you

81
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,900
distribute the 5r over there
you're going to get that

82
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,340
expression.

83
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,180
If you distribute the negative
3, you're going to get that

84
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:41,710
expression.

85
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:45,040
So this does simplify to that,
so we have factored

86
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,333
