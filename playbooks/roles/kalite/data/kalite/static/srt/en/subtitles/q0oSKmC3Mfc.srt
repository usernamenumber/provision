1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,480
Welcome back to my series
of presentations on

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,480
mortgage-backed securities.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,100
So let's review what we've
already gone over.

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,460
So I've already drawn here-- I
actually prepared ahead of

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,580
time-- so I've already drawn
here kind of what we've

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,570
already talked about.

7
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,560
So we start with borrowers
who need to buy houses.

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,570
Each of them borrowed
$1 million.

9
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:20,890
Actually let me write
that down.

10
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,240
Let me change the
color of my pen.

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,410
Where'd my pen go?

12
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,110
OK.

13
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,790
So each of these people
borrowed $1 million.

14
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:33,920
OK.

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,230
Each of them borrowed $1 million
and there were 1,000

16
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,150
of them, right?

17
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,170
So $1 million times 1,000.

18
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,250
That's $1 billion that
they needed.

19
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,460
And they said that they would
pay 10% a year on that money

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,100
that they borrowed.

21
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,940
So that's 10% for each of them
is $100,000 and then as we

22
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,500
said, there's 1,000 borrowers.

23
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,370
So they're going to put in
$100 million, right?

24
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,030
100,000 times 1,000
is 100 million.

25
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,070
So just to simplify.

26
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,000
Keep it in your mind. $1 billion
goes to a bunch of

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,050
borrowers, goes to 1,000
borrowers, to be specific.

28
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:07,130
And then each year, those
borrowers are going to give

29
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,280
the special purpose entity--
this is just a corporation

30
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,560
designed to kind of structure
these mortgage-backed

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,430
securities-- they're going to
give 10% of the billion, or

32
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,690
$100 million back into this.

33
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:20,190
And then we said, OK, well where
does that money for this

34
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,960
special purpose entity, or for
this corporation, come from?

35
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,150
Well it comes from the investors
in the actual

36
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,400
mortgage-backed securities.

37
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,060
And just to be clear, so
the asset within this

38
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,175
entity are the loans.

39
00:01:44,815 --> 00:01:47,920
The loans are the main asset
that's inside of the special

40
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,470
purpose entity.

41
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,580
And the loans are just the right
on these 10% payments.

42
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,430
And so money came from when the
owners of each of these

43
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,870
mortgage-backed securities--
each, let's say, paid $1,000

44
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,140
for the mortgage-backed
securities.

45
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,620
And in return, they're going
to get 10% on their money.

46
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,750
So each security cost $1,000.

47
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,040
And then they're going to
they're going to get

48
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,640
$100 back per month.

49
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,669
And we said there are a million
of these securities,

50
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:12,210
so $1,000 times 1 million,
that's where the $1 billion

51
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,460
comes from.

52
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,140
My thing's been acting up.

53
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,550
That's where the $1 billion
comes from.

54
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,800
And that essentially is
lent to the borrowers.

55
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,680
And these guys will get 10%.

56
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,500
Now one thing I want you to keep
in mind is, they get 10%

57
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,370
only if every one of these
borrowers pays their loans,

58
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,760
never defaults, never
pre-pays.

59
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,300
Pre-paying a mortgage is just
saying, I sold the house.

60
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,470
I don't need the mortgage
anymore, so I just pay it off.

61
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,390
So it's only 10%, indefinitely,
if all of the

62
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,990
borrowers pay all the money
and never default or

63
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,560
anything like that.

64
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,670
So this 10% is kind of
in an ideal world.

65
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,520
Well everyone knows that it's
not going to be exactly 10%.

66
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,630
Some percentage of these
borrowers are going to default

67
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,240
on their mortgage.

68
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,840
Some of them are going
to pay ahead of time.

69
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,990
And actually that's what the
buyer of the mortgage-backed

70
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,230
security should try
to figure out.

71
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,220
And all sorts of buyers are
going to have all sorts of

72
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,100
different assumptions.

73
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,350
And this is what you probably
read some articles about,

74
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:14,560
these hedge funds with these
computer models to value their

75
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,930
mortgage-backed securities.

76
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,610
And that's what those
computer models do.

77
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,450
They try to look at historical
data and figure out, OK, for a

78
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,940
given population pool in a given
part of the country,

79
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,530
what percentage of
them are able to

80
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,510
pay off their mortgage?

81
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,140
What percentage of them default
on their mortgage?

82
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,100
And when they default, what
is kind of the recovery?

83
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,190
Say they default on a $1 million
mortgage, and then the

84
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,930
special purpose entity would
get control of that house.

85
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,070
And then if that house is sold
for $500,000 because the

86
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,610
property value went down, then
the recovery would be 50%.

87
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,430
So that's all of the things that
someone needs to factor

88
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,260
in when they figure out what
will be the real return.

89
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,030
10% is if everyone pays.

90
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:58,120
So let's make some very simple
assumptions for ourselves.

91
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,760
Let's say we are thinking
about investing in a

92
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,490
mortgage-backed security and we
want to gauge for ourselves

93
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,490
what we think the return
is going to be.

94
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:09,420
Well let's say we know that this
pool of borrowers that--

95
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:16,450
my pen keeps not working--
that 20% will default.

96
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,529
We're not going to worry about
pre-payment rates and all

97
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:19,390
things like that.

98
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,884
Let's say 20% are going
to default.

99
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,660
Of these 1,000 borrowers, 200 of
them are just going to lose

100
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,480
their job or whatever.

101
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,730
They can't afford a
mortgage anymore.

102
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:38,240
And of those 20% that default,
we have a 50% recovery.

103
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,270
So that means borrower X
defaulted on his loan.

104
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,450
And then when we go and get
the property-- because the

105
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,620
loan was secured by the
property-- when we auction off

106
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,980
the property, we only
get $500,000 for it.

107
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,350
So we get a 50% recovery.

108
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,780
50% of the original
value of the loan.

109
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:00,820
So if 20% default and then
there's a 50% recovery, then

110
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:14,570
on average you're going to get
10% of the loan is worthless.

111
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:15,910
And I'm going to make
some kind of

112
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,750
handwaving assumptions here.

113
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,760
But you can assume
statistically, and since this

114
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,230
is a large number of borrowers--
it's 1,000, right?

115
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,470
If there's only one borrower
it would be hard to kind of

116
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,650
gauge when he defaults,
if he defaults at all.

117
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,590
We would just know that
there is a 20% chance.

118
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,430
But when there's a large number
of borrowers, you can

119
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,460
kind of do the math and say,
OK, on average 200 of these

120
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,750
guys are going to default, and
instead of actually getting

121
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:40,470
10%, since 10% of the loans are
going to be worthless, I'm

122
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,940
going to get 10% less
than this 10%.

123
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,610
So I'm going to get 9%.

124
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,210
So this is based on the
model that we just

125
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,500
constructed, right?

126
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,910
This is the model that
we constructed.

127
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:55,080
This is a much simpler model
than what most people use.

128
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,950
But based on the model that we
just constructed, I think the

129
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,990
real return we're going to get
on this mortgage-backed

130
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,570
security is 9%.

131
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,190
If there was another investor
who assumed a 50% default

132
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,040
rate, but with a higher
recovery, he or she would have

133
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,120
a different kind of expected
return from this security.

134
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,000
So why is this even useful?

135
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,760
Well think about it.

136
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,540
Before, in the case we did in
the first video, when someone

137
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:25,620
just borrows from the bank,
the bank has very specific

138
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,670
lending requirements.

139
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,320
They have their own model.

140
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,180
So there's a whole class of
borrowers that they might have

141
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,680
not been able to service.

142
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:34,970
Right?

143
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,830
There might be people with
really good credit scores,

144
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,730
really good incomes, who don't
have a down payment.

145
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:43,210
And if they don't meet what the
bank's requirements are,

146
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,540
they would never get a loan.

147
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,430
But there are probably some
investors out there that would

148
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:46,970
say, you know what?

149
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,310
For the right interest rate and
for the right assumptions

150
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,110
in my model, I'm willing to give
anybody a loan, as long

151
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,840
as I'm compensated
for it enough.

152
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,230
And this is what this
mortgage-backed security

153
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,260
market allows.

154
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:02,495
It allows-- let's say this group
of borrowers-- let's say

155
00:07:02,495 --> 00:07:12,520
this pool of borrowers right
here actually didn't--

156
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,710
This pool of borrowers
actually aren't the

157
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:22,270
traditional-- they don't have
25% down and they don't have

158
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,340
kind of the traditional
requirements to get a normal

159
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:28,290
mortgage-- but if I pool a bunch
of people who don't have

160
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,630
those traditional requirements,
but they're good

161
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,740
in other ways-- they have a
high income or high credit

162
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,940
score-- I can go through this
alternate mechanism to find

163
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,130
investors that are willing
to loan them money.

164
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,840
So essentially, from the
borrower's point of view, it

165
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,260
allows more access to loan
funding that they would have

166
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,790
otherwise not been able to.

167
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,770
And from an investor point of
view, it allows another place

168
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,880
for me to invest in.

169
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,170
Maybe I feel that the computer
models that I have are really

170
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:58,350
good at predicting things like
default rates, and recovery

171
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:01,320
rates, and what a
loan is worth.

172
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,950
And I feel that I can, in some
ways, be a better loan officer

173
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,480
than the banks.

174
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,150
And this would be an attractive
place for

175
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,590
me to invest in.

176
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:14,890
It also might just have a risk
reward characteristic that

177
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,360
doesn't exist in the market
already, and it allows you to

178
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,600
diversify into one other
asset class.

179
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,740
So that's the value that it has

180
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,780
across the entire spectrum.

181
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:27,050
Now in the next presentation I'm
going to show how you can,

182
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,720
I guess, further complicate this
even more, so that you

183
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,570
can open up the investment
to even a

184
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,820
larger group of investors.

185
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,320
Because you can think about it
right now, there's probably

186
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,530
some people who say, OK, I
already said, some people will

187
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,760
do these models and try to make
their own assumptions and

188
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,039
say, OK, this is going
to give me 9% a year.

189
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,580
But there's a whole bunch of
people who are going to say

190
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,450
this is just too complicated
for me.

191
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,740
This seems risky.

192
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,980
I don't have any fancy models.

193
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,560
I only like to invest
in things where I

194
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,120
know I get my money.

195
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,580
Very highly rated debt
is where I'm going

196
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,390
to invest my money.

197
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,850
And there's another group of
people who say, OK, 9%, that's

198
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,670
nice and everything, but I'm
a hotshot, I'm a gambler.

199
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,280
9% isn't the type of
returns I want.

200
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,670
I want to take more risk
and more return.

201
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,690
And so there should be
something, maybe, for those

202
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,500
people as well.

203
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,650
So that's what we're going to
show you in the presentation

204
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,970
on collateralized debt
obligations.

205
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,460
See you soon.
