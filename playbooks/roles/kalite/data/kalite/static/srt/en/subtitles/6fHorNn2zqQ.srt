1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We are in the Orangerie in Paris and we are looking at one of Monet's Waterlily rooms.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's in an oval shaped lid from above which gives it a really lovely soft light.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There is the sense that these are contemplative works

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which ties them in an interesting way

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
as to kind of celendity? of the sort you would expect in a relgious context.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Oh no doubt.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is painted late in Monet's life after

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the death of his wife and

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
after the death of his son.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So I think there is a sense for him of his legacy.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and gave them to French State.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the State in return decided to build this pavillion

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I keep thinking about Monet's life

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
long desire to capture the beauty of the optical world

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
from when he was in Paris and then in Argenteuil

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and thinking back to Boulevard des Capuccines

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the light pouring down the Boulevard

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and Gare de Saint-Lazare

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the light filtered through the steam

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of the trains

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then later in his life in his garden

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with the waterlilies.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
he was interested on not only

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in capturing and understanding and rendering

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
those effects of light

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the momentary but actually in creating them

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you know he devoted an enormous amount of his life

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to actually planting his gardens and maintaining them.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then translating them onto canvas and in a sense preserving that sense of the momentary.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The thing that I can think about when we look at these is intensity of the colour

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the beauty of the color harmonies in

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the paintings is more beautiful than reality.

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's think about the history of landscaping and these are unprecedented in that way.

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
First of all their shape.These very very long panels

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
without a horizon line.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We are looking across the water

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we see neither the ground that we stand on

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
nor the horizon on the foresight.

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Traditional landscaping often provided

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a path for ones eye to travel

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
through the landscape.

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Here we really can't do that because we are confronted

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with the surface of the water and

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the surface of the paintings themselves.

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But I do think that the Monet is borrowing actually from the classical tradition

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If you look on both sides of these canvases

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you see the dark shadows

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of the weeping willows and those functions in a sense that

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
trees often framed .. landscapes.

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So Monet has placed us in a very particular place.

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Obviously we are on the shore in some way.

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But we are looking across the water so we see neither the ground that we stand on

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
nor the horizon on the foresight.

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Monet had just enlarged his ponds but even then they are quite small and

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so he really unmounts us by not giving us a ground to stand on.

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Bu he has given us a very particular angle which we are viewing the paths of the waterlilies themselves.

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And that does place us in relationship to the surface of the water so we can actually locate ourselves

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And they also allow us to hop skip and jump from path to path and move back into space.

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then there is this extraordinary volume of space below the pond and the incredible dome of space

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where there is these towering clouds right above us.

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So there is sense of the extent of the volume that's portrayed and yet done so.

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
on the two dimensional surface of a pond which is of course a reflection of the two dimensional surface of the canvas.

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It is a beautiful summation of this notion that Monet has worked for towards for so long:

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
How does one capture both the extraction of modern art
