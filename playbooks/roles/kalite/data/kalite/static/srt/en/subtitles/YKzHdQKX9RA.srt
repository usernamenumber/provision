1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,400
Man: So the story of David is is Biblical, its Old Testament.

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,900
Woman: This is David who will become King David.

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,833
Man: And this is the story of David and Goliath that's actually being represented here.

4
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:19,751
Woman: Yeah. Although we only see David, obviously. [laughter]

5
00:00:19,751 --> 00:00:21,384
Man: Although, he sees Goliath.

6
00:00:21,384 --> 00:00:23,617
Woman: He does here. He clearly see Goliath.

7
00:00:23,617 --> 00:00:26,817
And he's aming the slingshot, the stone, right at him.

8
00:00:26,817 --> 00:00:31,784
The story is that the Isrealites are endangered by the Phillistines

9
00:00:31,784 --> 00:00:35,651
who have this giant of a man who's...

10
00:00:35,651 --> 00:00:36,851
Man: Who terrifies everybody.

11
00:00:36,851 --> 00:00:40,784
Woman: Who terrifies everybody and the Isrealites are sure their will be defeated.

12
00:00:40,784 --> 00:00:42,884
Because Goliath, this giant.

13
00:00:42,884 --> 00:00:46,251
Man: Except this boy, here represented as a young man.

14
00:00:46,251 --> 00:00:50,517
Woman: Says, well let me go, I'll, I'll face him. Ill face the giant.

15
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:53,955
And...well..pftp [they say] you cant do that! Your just a boy!

16
00:00:53,955 --> 00:00:59,451
And they give him lots of armor to put on so hes safe when he faces Goliath.

17
00:00:59,451 --> 00:01:02,659
And he takes off his armor. And says "aw I dont need this armor."

18
00:01:02,736 --> 00:01:07,617
And he faces Goliath and defeats him with a single blow.

19
00:01:07,617 --> 00:01:13,486
And of course it was not the blow at all really. Its the power of God thats behind David

20
00:01:13,486 --> 00:01:18,721
It's one of those "you got God on your side you dont really need anything else" stories.

21
00:01:18,721 --> 00:01:22,198
Man: That's the tough subjects to take on.

22
00:01:22,198 --> 00:01:24,023
Man and woman: After Michelangelo.

23
00:01:24,023 --> 00:01:25,290
Man: After Donetello.

24
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,557
And unlike the Michealangelo where we can see the contour of the body almost

25
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:35,890
uninterupted. Here the contour is crossed and crossed again and crossed again by his arm.

26
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,657
By the line of his neck, by the cloth.

27
00:01:38,657 --> 00:01:41,557
By the sling that he has across his chest.

28
00:01:41,557 --> 00:01:45,623
And so there's this sort of hightened spiralling of the body.

29
00:01:45,623 --> 00:01:51,023
Woman: Kind of forceful diagonal and twisting simultaneously.

30
00:01:51,023 --> 00:01:55,123
The tension in the rope as he is preparing to throw

31
00:01:55,123 --> 00:01:59,123
the slingshot. You feel that same tension in the twisting of his body.

32
00:01:59,123 --> 00:02:02,090
Man: It's true. He's almost like a spring, wound up ready to release.

33
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:06,457
Woman: Right I mean look at him. His face is such incredible determination.

34
00:02:06,457 --> 00:02:08,457
Concentration to it.

35
00:02:08,457 --> 00:02:10,623
Man: And actually, look at the way he is biting his lips.

36
00:02:10,623 --> 00:02:12,857
It's just this wonderful expression.

37
00:02:12,857 --> 00:02:15,557
Woman: And and pushing his eyebrows together. There is a kind of psychological

38
00:02:15,557 --> 00:02:19,190
insight I always see in Bernini.

39
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:22,490
And look at how hes made this lovely shadows

40
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,390
in the rib cage and in the abdomin.

41
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,890
Really paying attention to the realism of the body

42
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:34,090
but this is a kind of realism as opposed to the idealism of the Renassiance.

43
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,290
And so in a way that is often said about the Baroque.

44
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,357
We feel this especially with David, we feel it in his body

45
00:02:40,357 --> 00:02:43,461
We feel that tension and concentration as opposed to this

46
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:47,523
sort of distant contemplativeness that feel with the Michelangelo.

47
00:02:47,523 --> 00:02:50,390
Man: The more universal the more eternal qualities

48
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,057
that we associate with the high Reniassance.

49
00:02:52,057 --> 00:02:53,590
Thats right, this is much more momentary.

50
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,590
Woman: And he moves out into our space.

51
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,957
You know he twists. You almost like you want to duck

52
00:02:57,957 --> 00:02:59,023
out of the way.

53
00:02:59,023 --> 00:03:02,090
Man: It's true. And its kind of a visual tension

54
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,590
that is constructed both through the actual

55
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,890
physical form

56
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:06,990
but also through the treatment

57
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:07,857
of the surface.

58
00:03:07,857 --> 00:03:09,823
Woman: Im almost seeing Baroque painting here

59
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:11,490
in the use of light and shadow.

60
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,990
Shadow across his neck. A deep shadow on one

61
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:15,957
side of his face

62
00:03:15,957 --> 00:03:17,357
Illumination on the other.

63
00:03:17,357 --> 00:03:18,590
Of course it depends on how he's lit.

64
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,923
But the way the body is twisting against itself.

65
00:03:20,923 --> 00:03:23,890
These areas of deep shadow against illumination.

66
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:24,890
Man: Absolutely.

67
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,523
And so there is a drama in the lighting.

68
00:03:26,523 --> 00:03:29,623
Man: Important to note, even here, even in the free

69
00:03:29,623 --> 00:03:31,123
standing sculpture I think you can

70
00:03:31,123 --> 00:03:32,557
see his understanding of space.

71
00:03:32,557 --> 00:03:34,190
Understanding of the space around him.

72
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,357
It's not only that he is defining light, hes

73
00:03:36,357 --> 00:03:38,423
defining the space around the sculpture.

74
00:03:38,423 --> 00:03:41,057
Almost as if it is a kind of architecture

75
00:03:41,057 --> 00:03:43,790
of the immediate surrounding environment.

76
00:03:43,790 --> 99:59:59,999
