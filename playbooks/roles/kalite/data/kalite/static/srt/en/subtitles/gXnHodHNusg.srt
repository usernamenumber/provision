1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In a regular tetrahedron, and that is just a 4-sided polyhedron, and it's regular so all of its sides

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and all of its faces will be the same. The centers of the 4 faces are the vertices of a smaller tetrahedron.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The ratio of the volume of the smaller tetrahedron to that of the larger tetrahedron is m over n where

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
m and n are relatively prime, positive integers. Find m plus n. So let's just draw this regular tetrahedron

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
first. So this is a regular tetrahedron. So in order to have 4 equal sides, or 4 equal faces I should

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
say in 3 dimensions it needs to look like this, essentially needs to be 4 triangles. So we have 1 triangle,

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
just like that. And we have another triangle like that. Then we have another triangle in the back, so

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is another triangle in the back, and we have a triangle as the base. This is a regular tetrahedron

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where each of these faces are going to be equilateral triangles. Each of these faces are equilateral

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
triangles. So if you look, so this length is the same as that length, fair enough. So that is our regular

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
tetrahedron. Now they say that the centers of the 4 faces, so let's look at the centers of the 4 faces.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's say that this is the center of one face. This is the center of another face. Back here is the center

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of the face that we can't see, that's behind these two faces, and that this is the center... this right

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
here let's say is the center of the base. The center of the 4 faces are the vertices of a smaller tetrahedron.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we can connect them to get a smaller tetrahedron, so along. So we have this one going along the center of

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this face to the center of the base. Going from the center of the base to the center of this face over

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
here. We have this line, you connect those. We have one of the face of the smaller tetrahedron you go

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
like that. You have kind of the top, if you flipped it over you would have the base

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of the smaller tetrahedron. If you connected those in the back.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You would have the two faces that you can't see, that face and that face.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now they want us to essentially figure out the volume of the smaller

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
tetrahedron, this magenta tetrahedron, to this yellow one over here

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And you might already be racking your brain how do you figure out the volume

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of a tetrahedron and what not and all of that,

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But the important thing to realize, the important thing to realize

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if you take two similar, really two similar objects

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and if you just know the ratio of one of their dimensions

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and assuming that all of their dimensions have the same ratio

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And it is the case in this right over here. Then the volume

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
will be the cube of the ratios of one of their sides.

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let me show this to you right over here, let me depict it.

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if we let's say let's say that this length right over here, let's call that

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
length big, for the big tetrahedron. And let's find the corresponding edge

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of the small tetrahedron. So let's say that we have

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
another side of this small tetrahedron. Let's call that length small.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If we know the ratio of length big to length small. If we know,

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if we know the ratio of length big to length small we could figure out

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the ratio of the big tetrahedron, we can figure out the ratio of the

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
big tetrahedron to the small tetrahedron

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to the volume of the big tetrahedron to the volume of the small tetrahedron

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
by just cubing this ratio, by just cubing this ratio.

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we can do that because these are completely similar in every direction and every dimension.
