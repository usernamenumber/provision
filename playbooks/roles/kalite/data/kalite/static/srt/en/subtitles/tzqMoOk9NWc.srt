1
00:00:00,303 --> 00:00:04,810
Let's say that you´re the owner of some type of copyrighted material-

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:08,267
maybe it's a movie, maybe it's music of some kind-

3
00:00:08,267 --> 00:00:10,918
and you observe that there is a site that is operating

4
00:00:10,918 --> 00:00:14,025
outside of the United States and that site-at least in your mind-

5
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:20,000
seems to be infringing on your copyright by US law.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,933
So this is the site in question - and you're saying that it is doing illegal things, at least by US standards.

7
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:30,867
The problem is that there's nothing you can do -

8
00:00:30,867 --> 00:00:34,200
it's operating outside of US soil and outside of US laws.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,800
You can even go to the government, even if the government wanted to do something about it,

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,267
it really couldn't. Because once again, it's outside the US jurisdiction.

11
00:00:42,267 --> 00:00:45,800
The purpose of SOPA-and it seems fairly benign at first-

12
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,600
is to give some tools to these actors to stop this.

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,667
The problem-and we´ll see that it's quite a large problem-

14
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:56,667
is that it gives tools to these actors to do much more than just stopping illegal activity;

15
00:00:56,667 --> 00:01:00,867
it allows them essentially to go on, to some degree, a kind of a witch hunt

16
00:01:00,867 --> 00:01:04,867
for anyone that might even have a whiff of enabling this type of activity.

17
00:01:04,867 --> 00:01:07,867
-it won´t even just be for foreign sites.

18
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:10,200
So let's write this down, so SOPA stands for:

19
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,533
Stop Online Piracy Act -

20
00:01:12,533 --> 00:01:14,200
and it sounds pretty reasonable -

21
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,600
and this is the version of the bill that's coming from the House of Representatives.

22
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,133
The one from the Senate, that's slightly different

23
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:23,267
but they have the same intent, is PIPA [Protect IP Act].

24
00:01:23,267 --> 00:01:26,067
And what it does is, if you can´t go after this site itself

25
00:01:26,067 --> 00:01:30,467
maybe you can go after sites that is somehow benefiting this site.

26
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:32,933
And those sites are inside the United States.

27
00:01:32,933 --> 00:01:36,400
So this is outside, this is inside the United States.

28
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,600
So things that are doing that might include search engines.

29
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,133
So search engines like Google or Bing.

30
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:46,933
They obviously link to this site over here. You might have ad networks -

31
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:53,533
so sites that allow this site over here to display ads and to get revenue from them -

32
00:01:53,533 --> 00:01:55,867
that are benefiting this site over here.

33
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:58,733
You might have payment sites like PayPal

34
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:04,133
or credit card processors that this site uses to collect revenue.

35
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:09,600
And, maybe most importantly, you have things like the DNS servers within the US

36
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,467
that associate this site's domain name with the actual servers.

37
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:17,133
And I wont get too technical about it, but when you type in

38
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:22,533
something like www.shady.foreign

39
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:24,800
, and once again, we´re gonna see that this site might

40
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,267
not even have to be shady or foreign-

41
00:02:27,267 --> 00:02:29,200
but when you type something like that in -

42
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,800
there´re servers in the United states that associate that with these servers

43
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,067
that might be operated outside the United States - that associate this text with a number

44
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:42,867
that points to this website, that points to this website's servers.

45
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:44,800
So these are all things within the United States -

46
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,667
that to some degree this site is dependent on.

47
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:51,800
So what SOPA does is, it allows these actors here -

48
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,267
the ones that are obviously concerned with enforcing their copyrights -

49
00:02:56,267 --> 00:03:01,333
to issue court orders and notices to these actors right over here

50
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:05,000
that essentially compels them, very strongly, to immediately

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,533
cut off ties with this illegal site - or what they think is an illegal site.

52
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:16,333
Now that might seem reasonable to you, except for the fact that

53
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,600
it's kind of a "shoot first and think later" type of policy.

54
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,533
The basic way it works is, you presume guilt until this guy

55
00:03:23,533 --> 00:03:26,467
somehow tries to prove his innocence and we´ll see

56
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:29,133
this guy isn't necessarily outside the US.

57
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:31,667
It might even be completely legal, or what I would consider

58
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:34,667
completely legal sites inside the US.

59
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:37,267
Essentially as soon as this allegation is made and either a court order

60
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:42,000
or a notice is payed, these enablers have to cut off ties to this site -

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,467
and you can imagine that if these cut off ties to this site,

62
00:03:45,467 --> 00:03:48,800
- this sites´ business - whatever it might be - whether illegal or legal,

63
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,333
immediately gets obliterated, especially this one here

64
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,200
including search engines, ad networks and payments.

65
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,267
And if they don´t comply then these guys are going to start having a legal battle.

66
00:03:58,267 --> 00:04:02,067
So these guys are not only going to have to comply-and that by itself is hard-

67
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:04,800
but if they don´t comply, then they themselves are going to be in trouble.

68
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,333
Now it gets really obviously creepy, when you start

69
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,867
going into - so when you think of this - you´re like

70
00:04:10,867 --> 00:04:13,667
okay, so maybe we can work around this a little bit.

71
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:16,800
But it gets creepy when you even know this is the spirit of the legislation,

72
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,067
when you actually read the wording of the legislation-

73
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:21,200
and obviously that's what matters, not the name or the intent-

74
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,533
But actually how it's worded-I mean, the way it's worded

75
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:27,600
- it´s pretty clear that its intent is to go after much more

76
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,267
than just a site that's explicitly selling illegal pharmaceuticals or

77
00:04:31,267 --> 00:04:37,631
allowing people to download movies or, or videos or music

78
00:04:37,662 --> 00:04:40,425
that these owners don´t have access to.

79
00:04:40,425 --> 00:04:43,518
When you read the wording, it's pretty clear that they want to be able

80
00:04:43,564 --> 00:04:47,000
to shut down anything that is in any way associating with itself -

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,200
or in any way enabling it.

82
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,333
And you see it in the wording. So this is actually section 1.0.3 of the SOPA legislation

83
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:59,267
- and this is how they define a site that is dedicated to theft of US property.

84
00:04:59,457 --> 00:05:03,333
So an internet site is dedicated to theft of US property if -

85
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,864
and, so you know, it's useable by people in the United States -

86
00:05:05,864 --> 00:05:10,200
and this is interesting: It´s "primarily designed or operated for the purpose of,"

87
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,200
"has only limited purpose or use other than,"

88
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,800
"or is marketed by its operator or another acting in concert"

89
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,133
"with that operator for use in, offering goods or services in a manner"

90
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:22,867
"that engages in, enables, or facilitates" - now this is interesting -

91
00:05:22,867 --> 00:05:26,800
enables or facilitates all of these violations.

92
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,333
And these are the violations that would be illegal:

93
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,333
You´re selling things that you can´t sell,

94
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:34,200
you´re infringing on other people´s copyright.

95
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,533
And it might seem harmless, this "enables, or facilitates", until you think about

96
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:40,600
what that could encapsulate.

97
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,200
If I have a site, like this, I am part of a site: Khan Academy

98
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,600
Let´s say someone puts a message on Khan Academy

99
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:53,267
and from Khan Academy they link to a site that actually is really illegal

100
00:05:53,267 --> 00:05:56,815
and that is really shady and they link to it in the message boards.

101
00:05:56,831 --> 00:06:01,000
Well, under this am I enabling, is Khan Academy enabling or facilitating?

102
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,667
And if that's the case, then Khan Academy - by this definition -

103
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:08,702
would be considered to be a site that is dedicated to theft of US property.

104
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,400
And there are much bigger players than just Khan Academy,

105
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,067
that can be thrown into this bucket, players like YouTube or Vimeo or any site.

106
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:19,800
Or even a news site, that allows people to put comments,

107
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,338
or allows people to put images, things like Flickr.

108
00:06:22,338 --> 00:06:26,800
That maybe had - in some way - their users infringing on the copyright

109
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,400
now all of the sudden the whole site - based on this definition - the entire site

110
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,800
can be defined as a site dedicated to theft of US property.

111
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,533
By this definition YouTube could be that, if it's viewed in kind of

112
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:41,267
enabling or facilitating.

113
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:43,667
Khan Academy, any news site could be viewed like that.

114
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:45,200
Vimeo could be viewed that way,

115
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,067
a photo sharing site could be viewed like that.

116
00:06:47,067 --> 00:06:49,267
People might take a photo or something that they don´t have the copyright

117
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:52,000
and upload an image and all the sudden - by this definition -

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,133
based on just a sense that that's being violated,

119
00:06:57,133 --> 00:07:00,467
they won´t just be able to shut down these illegal sites;

120
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:03,600
they would be able to shut down things like YouTube, or Vimeo,

121
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,200
or even things like CNN.com, if someone puts a message

122
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,533
or an image, that they think is somehow violating.

123
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:14,333
And so it's not just going-right now the methodology is,

124
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,600
if there is some content on YouTube or Vimeo or some other site,

125
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,533
that they feel is infringing on their copyright,

126
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:22,800
there are laws, where they contact YouTube directly,

127
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,267
they point them to the content, that seems to be infringing

128
00:07:25,267 --> 00:07:30,067
and YouTube, or Vimeo, or whoever will take down that content.

129
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:32,667
But what this allows them to do is shoot first and think later:

130
00:07:32,867 --> 00:07:35,000
"Oh, look: You´re enabling that"; if they could convince some court

131
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,733
to give a court order, they can start giving notice to these players right over here

132
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:44,200
to cut off ties with major - what I would consider very legal sites -

133
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,841
like YouTube or Vimeo or CNN.

134
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,633
It´s really almost any site that allows people to upload things onto it,

135
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:55,267
or put links on it, which is almost - Facebook is another one -

136
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:59,200
anything that has user generated content.

137
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,000
On just a whim they could take down the entire site -

138
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,800
not just take down that user generated content -

139
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,133
they could, on just convincing one judge, or convincing just any of these,

140
00:08:08,133 --> 00:08:10,133
they could cut off ties with Facebook.

141
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:13,733
Not even making Facebook.com point to Facebook anymore.

142
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:17,333
CNN - they could just completely take down these sites on a whim.

143
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,533
And it gets worse than that, because you would say:

144
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:21,467
"well, look, if they can take this down on a whim and, you know,"

145
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,600
"maybe they kind of thought it was, but they didn't do their homework"

146
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,133
"and then they realize that it wasn't copyright infringement,"

147
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:29,800
"couldn't these guys sue back?"-although, already, the damage would have been done,

148
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,431
these sites would have been taken down;

149
00:08:31,431 --> 00:08:33,400
they would have lost millions or billions of dollars;

150
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,067
millions, or tens or hundreds of millions, of users would not be able to access these things

151
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:39,052
and this would also be true for Wikipedia,

152
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:43,533
if someone uploaded something that wasn't completely, 100%, vetted,

153
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:48,867
they could take down the entire site, not just that content.

154
00:08:48,867 --> 00:08:50,421
And you say: "Okay, that's bad enough!"

155
00:08:50,421 --> 00:08:53,667
"But couldn't these people say: `Hey, look, you wrongfully took us down,`"

156
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:56,467
"`we´re going to sue you now`". Well to see that they can´t and

157
00:08:56,467 --> 00:08:59,600
to see how one-sided this legislation is, notice:

158
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,267
The threshold for being able to sued back, if you kind of

159
00:09:03,267 --> 00:09:07,333
misrepresented a violation - the only way you´re kind of held

160
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:12,133
accountable is if you knowingly, materially misrepresented the violation.

161
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:16,600
So, if the copyright holder just says: "Oh, I think someone on YouTube"-you know-

162
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,867
"I feel pretty good that someone on YouTube is violating"

163
00:09:19,867 --> 00:09:22,533
and that YouTube is enabling a violation and, therefore, YouTube

164
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:26,600
is a site dedicated to theft of US property and it later on

165
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,333
it finds out that it wasn't, it was fair use or maybe that person

166
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,133
actually did have the copyright to it,

167
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:34,200
they can´t be sued, because they said: "Oh, I just thought it was";

168
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,933
they weren't knowingly materially misrepresenting themselves.

169
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:43,800
So even if it ends up not even being a violation, these guys

170
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,267
could take the site down. Maybe some small producers actually

171
00:09:46,267 --> 00:09:49,133
secured the rights, put it up on YouTube and then,

172
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:52,200
all of the sudden, these guys take down all of YouTube based on

173
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,867
not actually knowing what they are talking about.

174
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:59,133
And there can´t even be a counter suit in that case, based on the law.

175
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:02,533
And it gets even creepier than that, because to be considered this

176
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:06,200
you don´t even just have to enable or facilitate - which is almost anything-

177
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,667
one could argue a computer is enabling or facilitating this on some level.

178
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:15,867
But you are considered to be a site dedicated to theft of US property,

179
00:10:15,867 --> 00:10:18,800
even if you do nothing illegal, even if you don´t enable anything illegal,

180
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,333
but if you just take actions that make it difficult for authorities to confirm

181
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:28,333
that you´re doing something illegal. So if you view this in the physical world:

182
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,800
obviously, some people are doing illegal things in their homes

183
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,733
and, obviously, some people lock their doors to keep people out of their homes.

184
00:10:35,733 --> 00:10:38,333
And maybe people are doing illegal things, it would even be

185
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,769
more likely to lock their doors and close their shutters.

186
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:43,733
What this would do-and this would do it in the virtual sense-

187
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:48,467
is say: "Look! Just by taking the deliberate action of closing your shutters"

188
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:51,067
"and looking your doors, which makes it hard for federal agents to confirm"

189
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:56,800
"that you´re doing illegal things - just by doing that - that itself is an illegal act".

190
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,333
This is maybe one of the creepiest and draconian Intrusions of privacy,

191
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,533
that I have actually heard of,

192
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:06,000
that was even attempted to be passed into law.

193
00:11:06,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So if I were you - just as a kind of a privacy and liberty loving American - I´d be worried.
