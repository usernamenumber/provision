99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In the last video we kind of reasoned our way towards finding the sum of the factors

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of 27,000 what I wanna do in this video is kinda revisit what we did in the last video

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but in a more generalized way of finding the sum of the factors of a numer

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the last video we startred with 27,000 we figured out that it's prime factorization is
