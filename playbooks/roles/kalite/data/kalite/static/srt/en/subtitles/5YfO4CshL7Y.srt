1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,594
You bought your house recently

2
00:00:02,594 --> 00:00:05,425
for $200 thousand

3
00:00:05,425 --> 00:00:07,262
and the way you were able to pay

4
00:00:07,262 --> 00:00:08,308
$200 thousand

5
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:10,436
is you were able to put 25% down

6
00:00:10,436 --> 00:00:17,359
so you made a fifty thousand dollar down payment

7
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:19,905
and the balance, the other 75%

8
00:00:19,905 --> 00:00:21,369
you borrowed from the bank

9
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:27,857
so one hundred fifty thousand dollar loan

10
00:00:27,857 --> 00:00:30,169
from the bank

11
00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:32,836
and you pay it off with your monthly payments

12
00:00:32,836 --> 00:00:36,116
that include paying down the loan and the interest

13
00:00:36,116 --> 00:00:37,578
Now something happened in your life

14
00:00:37,578 --> 00:00:39,502
maybe unfortunately you lost your job

15
00:00:39,502 --> 00:00:41,169
or your spouse lost their job

16
00:00:41,169 --> 00:00:44,175
or maybe you just overestimated your ability

17
00:00:44,175 --> 00:00:47,042
to pay off your mortgage payments

18
00:00:47,042 --> 00:00:49,325
and so you are having difficulty making them

19
00:00:49,325 --> 00:00:52,703
and quite frankly you can't make the mortgage payments anymore

20
00:00:52,703 --> 00:00:55,739
So in this situation you have a couple of options

21
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:00,671
One option is you can try to sell the house

22
00:01:00,671 --> 00:01:02,436
So some type of a sale

23
00:01:02,436 --> 00:01:04,436
or the other option is you could essentially

24
00:01:04,436 --> 00:01:06,442
give the house back to the bank

25
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:08,502
and that we will call foreclosure

26
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:10,036
in another video we will go more in depth of

27
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:11,304
what happens in foreclosure

28
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:13,243
but the bank is going to get the property

29
00:01:13,243 --> 00:01:15,357
try to auction it off, and they can't auction it off

30
00:01:15,357 --> 00:01:16,502
and the bank will own the property

31
00:01:16,502 --> 00:01:18,578
and then maybe they will try to sell it at a later date

32
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,320
And this is not a good option for you

33
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,744
this will kill your credit

34
00:01:24,744 --> 00:01:26,375
which will make it very hard for you

35
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:30,238
to get a loan, any type of loan

36
00:01:30,238 --> 00:01:31,577
but especially a mortgage loan

37
00:01:31,577 --> 00:01:33,568
any time in the near future

38
00:01:33,568 --> 00:01:36,041
really over the next several or many years

39
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:40,770
so you say, OK, I want to do the sale option

40
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,436
Now unfortunately for you the housing market has

41
00:01:44,436 --> 00:01:46,176
deflated dramatically

42
00:01:46,176 --> 00:01:48,169
And so when you talk to a realtor

43
00:01:48,169 --> 00:01:49,842
The realtor figures out, well look

44
00:01:49,842 --> 00:01:51,570
after all is said and done

45
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,703
you try to sell it for more than your loan amount

46
00:01:53,703 --> 00:01:54,662
but you are not able to

47
00:01:54,662 --> 00:01:56,102
you are getting really low offers

48
00:01:56,102 --> 00:01:59,573
low offers are like $120 - $130 thousand

49
00:01:59,573 --> 00:02:01,436
so when you really sit with a realtor

50
00:02:01,436 --> 00:02:02,861
and you think about what the market

51
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:04,502
is willing to pay for your house

52
00:02:04,502 --> 00:02:06,075
you realize that the most you're going to get

53
00:02:06,075 --> 00:02:08,768
for your house after you pay the real estate commissions

54
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,600
and all of the other things that are involved

55
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,205
when you sell a house

56
00:02:12,205 --> 00:02:16,835
you could get, maybe, $120 thousand

57
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:19,576
for the house

58
00:02:19,576 --> 00:02:21,324
And let's say you still owe pretty close to

59
00:02:21,324 --> 00:02:23,769
$150 thousand on the loan to the bank

60
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,036
your loan might have even been

61
00:02:25,036 --> 00:02:26,169
an interest only loan

62
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:27,375
but even after a year or two

63
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:28,661
you're probably not going to pay down

64
00:02:28,661 --> 00:02:30,707
the balance of your loan too much

65
00:02:30,707 --> 00:02:33,661
it might be like $140 thousand, or $145 thousand

66
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:37,245
And you're only able to get $120 thousand for the house

67
00:02:37,245 --> 00:02:39,102
So what do you do?

68
00:02:39,102 --> 00:02:40,102
You don't want to get into a situation

69
00:02:40,102 --> 00:02:42,302
where you sell the house for $120 thousand

70
00:02:42,302 --> 00:02:44,709
you still owe $150 thousand on the loan

71
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:46,729
and so you're still going to have to pay

72
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:50,253
$30 thousand dollars for a house that you don't even

73
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,702
have anymore

74
00:02:51,702 --> 00:02:52,836
so what do you do?

75
00:02:52,836 --> 00:02:54,326
Well, one option

76
00:02:54,326 --> 00:02:57,171
and this is not always going to be an option

77
00:02:57,171 --> 00:03:00,709
is to go to your bank and say

78
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:05,241
can I do a short sale?

79
00:03:05,241 --> 00:03:07,441
And a short sale is essentially

80
00:03:07,441 --> 00:03:12,698
selling the house for less than you owe on the loan

81
00:03:12,698 --> 00:03:24,237
selling for less than what you owe

82
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,304
and the bank doesn't have to

83
00:03:26,304 --> 00:03:29,637
well one, the bank would have to agree to the short sale

84
00:03:29,637 --> 00:03:32,914
because their loan is secured by this property that you're selling

85
00:03:32,914 --> 00:03:35,899
and in most cases the reason why you would want to do the short sale

86
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:39,370
is that the bank may forgive the balance of the loan

87
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:50,502
so you try to convince bank to forgive the balance

88
00:03:50,502 --> 00:03:52,412
So for example you could go to the bank

89
00:03:52,412 --> 00:03:54,102
and say look I lost my job

90
00:03:54,102 --> 00:03:56,329
we're having trouble paying for this house now

91
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:59,436
after paying real estate commissions and all the rest

92
00:03:59,436 --> 00:04:01,637
I can only get $120 thousand for this house

93
00:04:01,637 --> 00:04:03,969
I know that I owe you $150 thousand

94
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:07,324
Can you forgive the extra $30 thousand that I owe

95
00:04:07,324 --> 00:04:09,404
and the bank might choose to do that

96
00:04:09,404 --> 00:04:12,321
Now, even in this situation you have to be

97
00:04:12,321 --> 00:04:13,993
very, very careful

98
00:04:13,993 --> 00:04:16,502
and this has to be negotiated with the bank and all the rest

99
00:04:16,502 --> 00:04:18,662
is because the bank could still report you

100
00:04:18,662 --> 00:04:20,578
to credit agencies

101
00:04:20,578 --> 00:04:23,907
report to credit agencies

102
00:04:23,907 --> 00:04:26,442
Which is really not going to be a whole lot better

103
00:04:26,442 --> 00:04:28,412
than getting a foreclosure

104
00:04:28,412 --> 00:04:31,079
So in part of this negotiation process

105
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:33,658
The bank is under not obligation to either

106
00:04:33,658 --> 00:04:36,369
forgive your loan and let you go forth with that short sale

107
00:04:36,369 --> 00:04:41,829
and they're under no obligation not talk to credit agencies

108
00:04:41,829 --> 00:04:44,994
But part of that negotiation you should try to convince them

109
00:04:44,994 --> 00:04:49,169
Or you would ideally try to convince them not to report it to the credit agencies

110
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:52,157
The other issue with a short sale

111
00:04:52,157 --> 00:04:54,102
and this is something few people think about

112
00:04:54,102 --> 00:04:55,502
is when you have

113
00:04:55,502 --> 00:05:00,800
lets say in this case $30 thousand forgiven

114
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,363
The IRS might consider that to be income

115
00:05:04,363 --> 00:05:07,905
So you might have to pay income tax

116
00:05:07,905 --> 00:05:09,238
on this right over here

117
00:05:09,238 --> 00:05:10,745
And people always ask me

118
00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:14,577
if someone forgives a loan, why is that considered income?

119
00:05:14,577 --> 00:05:16,637
And the best way to think about it

120
00:05:16,637 --> 00:05:18,969
is if the IRS did not consider that income

121
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:22,657
it would be a huge loophole in how someone could compensate someone

122
00:05:22,657 --> 00:05:24,102
If I wanted to pay someone

123
00:05:24,102 --> 00:05:25,971
I could give them...

124
00:05:25,971 --> 00:05:27,036
So this is me

125
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:29,992
this is the person that I'm trying to pay

126
00:05:29,992 --> 00:05:31,775
I could give them a loan

127
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:37,487
Let's say I could give them $100 thousand loan

128
00:05:37,487 --> 00:05:39,102
and then I could forgive the loan

129
00:05:39,102 --> 00:05:41,836
And so it would essentially be I gave them $100 thousand

130
00:05:41,836 --> 00:05:43,369
maybe to do some work for me

131
00:05:43,369 --> 00:05:45,405
it would be a transfer of money by giving a loan

132
00:05:45,405 --> 00:05:47,769
and then keep forgiving over and over

133
00:05:47,769 --> 00:05:50,079
it would be completely identical to giving someone

134
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:54,489
a gift, which is taxed, or giving someone some type of income

135
00:05:54,489 --> 00:05:57,102
So a short sale, you're not always going to be able to do it

136
00:05:57,102 --> 00:05:58,631
it this scenario

137
00:05:58,631 --> 00:06:02,426
but if your house is selling less than the value of the loan

138
00:06:02,426 --> 00:06:04,906
you might be able to negotiate with the bank

139
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:08,169
to allow you to sell the house for less than the value of the loan

140
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:11,041
The bank's other option is they're going to have to

141
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:14,169
go into some type of foreclosure proceeding and take ownership of the house

142
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:16,298
which is expensive for the bank as well

143
00:06:16,298 --> 00:06:19,662
but they keys here are even if the bank is willing

144
00:06:19,662 --> 00:06:23,654
to let you sell house for less than the loan amount

145
00:06:23,654 --> 00:06:27,655
the owner really needs to make sure that the bank is willing

146
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:31,655
to forgive the balance and ideally not report to credit agencies
