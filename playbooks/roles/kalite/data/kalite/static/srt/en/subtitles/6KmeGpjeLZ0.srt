99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I am very excited to have Vi Hart visiting the office

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
over here and we just having a very mathematical conversation

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
earlier today and she mentioned something that is fascinating

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
ya I was just telling Sal about a cool thing called

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Benford's Law. Benford's Law and what is Benford's law?

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's this weird phenomenon that you get when you are looking at

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
numbers in the real world. so for example we have got some

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
graphs here. if you take the populations of all the

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
countries and you say alright what is the first digit

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of the population of the country whether it is 1 million or

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
1 thousand or a hundred thousand. we'll say that okay

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
starts with 1 . so we'll count up all, all of the countries

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that start with 1. and I guess here we have got 27

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of them. yes about 27. so really, like anything that

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
starts with 1 here, so it could be a country that

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
has a population of 1 or population of 17 or

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
population of 1 billion three hundred million blah blah blah

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they would all fall into this bucket right over here

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Right and then if you start with 2 you fall in the second

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
bucket and so on and so forth. better color oh ya go ahead

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
ya better definitely better color. oh that's great.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
oh that's the Blue..better contrast.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the question is you'd think you'd have kind of

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
random numbers here. yes! for that first digit like

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's kind of random. Ya I mean there is huge differences

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in population of countries, some have billions and

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
some have.. I don't know what the smallest population is.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Yes. it's like Montenegro or something like that.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Yea umm so. Montenegro is not a country.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what am I thinking! I am thinking of what was the

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
one on the French Riviera?. I mean..we can edit that out.

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
[laughs] I don't know I'd be interested to see

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
for populations of states and everything .

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The Vatican is the smallest country. I believe

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
yea does that still count? I guess.. I think the Vatican

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
counts, they have their own..yes. I don't know

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
exactly what the requirements for it to be. But if we

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
include the Vatican which I think would be like in the

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
thousands. yea and so why would this happen? why would

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you see more 1s than 2s.. like what is going on

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and It's not some small chance I mean we were

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
talking also about the idea that it is more likely to have

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
odd numbered addresses than even numbered. you were

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
talking about that earlier. yea I just learned about that

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
recently. That's not a huge..that makes sense . that makes

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
sense because every house will have a number 1 on it

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right. every street if your street starts you know with

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
house number 1.. house number 2.. house number 3

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right. or or. If you have odd number of houses then your

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
street has more odd numbers than.. exactly. and if

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you have an even number you have the same amount.

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
right. right. but that starting with 1 which is odd whereas

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
here a.. populations don't start with 1. exactly. and

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that phenomenon we are talking about the street numbers

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is not an extreme phenomenon. it's like 50 point some 0

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's a slightly more, you have a slightly higher probability

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of having a odd numbered house or I guess a 1 house

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
than everything else. yea it's kind of exactly what you'd

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
expect. it's exactly what you'd expect. but here

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
here it's a significantly higher probability of a random

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
country's population that it's first digit is a 1 versus

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's first digit as an 8 or a 9. I mean it seems

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it seems a little bit strange. yea and this just isn't in

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
countries. yes. you see this if you're looking at a lot of

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
financial stuff like how much money does a company make

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
yes. the 1s show up as the first digit much more frequently

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
much more frequently yea. and here we have another

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
fancy graph which is like completely crazy it's the

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
first digit of physical constants. so what would be the

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
examples of some physical constants. like I am assuming

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that we weren't able to figure out exactly what they applied

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
here but I am assuming it's things like the Gravitational

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
constant, Planck's constant and this seems kind of

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
crazy to me because it depends on the units that you are

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
using and it depends on a whole bunch of you know

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
things you assume about it. but even when you use

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
these kind of arbitrary physical constants. which I am

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
assuming they are doing here. the first the most significant

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
digit in these physical constants is still much more

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
likely to be 1. it almost exactly follows Benford's Law.

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and it's it's kind of gives you goose pimples. it's. yea

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the challenge here is to. oh by the way Benford is

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the guy with the glasses. oh yes! yes you might be wondering
