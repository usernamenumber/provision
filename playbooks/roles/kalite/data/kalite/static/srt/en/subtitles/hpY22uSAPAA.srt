1
00:00:06,263 --> 00:00:08,914
We're standing in Munich,
looking at the House of Art,

2
00:00:08,914 --> 00:00:11,564
which was once called 
"The House of German Art."

3
00:00:11,564 --> 00:00:17,797
It was built for Adolph Hitler, and
was a place to promote a very specific idea

4
00:00:17,797 --> 00:00:19,263
of German art.

5
00:00:19,263 --> 00:00:23,231
This is thought to be the very first building
that Hitler commissioned for the Nazi state,

6
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:27,414
and this was to be the first of many buildings
that were to be constructed around the nation

7
00:00:27,414 --> 00:00:30,914
that were the embodiment of National
Socialist ideology.

8
00:00:30,914 --> 00:00:34,764
As we look at this building, 
it's hard not to notice the Nazis

9
00:00:34,764 --> 00:00:39,096
were drawing on the classical tradition of
ancient Greek and Roman architecture.

10
00:00:39,096 --> 00:00:44,997
Yes, but by way of 19th century classical
revival traditions, especially in Germany,

11
00:00:44,997 --> 00:00:48,864
we might think of the work of Schinkel,
up in Prussia, in Berlin especially,

12
00:00:48,864 --> 00:00:52,047
and we might think of the work of
Klenze here in Munich.

13
00:00:52,047 --> 00:00:57,783
These were artists who took the ancient
tradition and appropriated them for their age.

14
00:00:57,783 --> 00:00:59,183
This building is a little bit different.

15
00:00:59,183 --> 00:01:00,650
It is even more spare.

16
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,400
It is even more stripped down.

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,016
But we can see this long Doric 
colonade on either side

18
00:01:06,016 --> 00:01:07,874
giving a sense of order and power.

19
00:01:07,874 --> 00:01:12,090
And I think timelessness is another word
that we should use about this architecture.

20
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:18,626
There was an aspiration toward the eternal
or timelessness that Ancient Greek architecture

21
00:01:18,626 --> 00:01:23,490
stood for those very values that the 
Nazis wanted to embody

22
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:29,675
as opposed to what they considered
"degenerate" art or "sickly, unhealthy" art

23
00:01:29,675 --> 00:01:32,091
that was actually exhibited just 
a few blocks away.

24
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:34,991
There were two major exhibitions of art
that were opened in 1937

25
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:37,491
that were meant to be seen in opposition
to each other,

26
00:01:37,491 --> 00:01:39,990
and they were only about a block and
a half from each other.

27
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,525
The great exhibition of German art
opened here at the House of German Art,

28
00:01:44,525 --> 00:01:51,156
but then in a temporary exhibition space
was the first iteration of the Entartete Kunst exhibition,

29
00:01:51,156 --> 00:01:53,325
the "Degenerate Art Exhibition."

30
00:01:53,325 --> 00:01:56,275
We use that word, "degenerate," and what
it really meant for the Nazis was an art

31
00:01:56,275 --> 00:02:02,444
that was sickly and unhealthy, the art that
today we hold as most dear.

32
00:02:02,444 --> 00:02:08,027
If you go to modern art museums, you'll be looking
at the art the Nazis considered degenerate,

33
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:13,827
artists like Schmidt-Rutloff or Paul Klee
or Max Ernst, Kirchner,

34
00:02:13,827 --> 00:02:17,961
all of the great early modernists,
and those artists were drawing

35
00:02:17,961 --> 00:02:20,160
on so-called primitive art.

36
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,194
They deformed the human body.

37
00:02:22,194 --> 00:02:23,944
They used extreme colors.

38
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:25,627
They distorted space.

39
00:02:25,627 --> 00:02:28,312
These were all things that Hitler
rejected.

40
00:02:28,312 --> 00:02:32,377
He was looking for an art that was
ideal and beautiful and perfect

41
00:02:32,377 --> 00:02:34,910
and that represented a kind of timelessness.

42
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:38,158
So this architecture, and the art that 
it was meant to house,

43
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,224
were tied up in National Socialist ideology.

44
00:02:41,224 --> 00:02:44,408
Germany had gone through a very rapid industrialization,

45
00:02:44,408 --> 00:02:46,375
and the National Socialists, the Nazis,

46
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:51,933
looked back to a kind of invented,
agrarian past that they romanticized.

47
00:02:51,933 --> 00:02:57,015
And so the contemporary ills that came with
industrialization and that came with urbanization

48
00:02:57,015 --> 00:02:58,114
were villified.

49
00:02:58,114 --> 00:03:03,063
And art that was representative
of those changes, a kind of international character,

50
00:03:03,063 --> 00:03:07,937
a kind of risk taking, all of the aspects
that we associate with modern art

51
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,320
is something that was villified.

52
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,536
And this building was built specifically as
a kind of antidote.

53
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:17,187
And you could say that another aspect of
modern art is that it's constantly changing.

54
00:03:17,187 --> 00:03:22,019
There is cubism and futurism and dadaism
and all of these movements,

55
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:27,019
always trying to stay contemporary as
opposed to what Hitler was wanting for the Third Reich

56
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:28,923
which was timeless.

57
00:03:28,923 --> 00:03:30,690
In fact, Hitler spoke to this directly.

58
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:36,046
In the speech that Hitler gave on the opening
of the first exhibition, he said:

59
00:03:52,738 --> 00:03:55,846
So when HItler says a "German Art," 
make no mistake.

60
00:03:55,846 --> 00:04:00,597
What he means by that is eradicating
another kind of art

61
00:04:00,597 --> 00:04:05,247
and denying those artists the ability
to make art,

62
00:04:05,247 --> 00:04:07,947
sending some of them off to
concentration camps.

63
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:12,330
The artist whose work appears on the cover
of the Entartete Kunst exhibition

64
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,864
was sent to a concentration camp
and murdered.

65
00:04:14,864 --> 00:04:18,445
This was serious, frightening, propaganda.

66
00:04:18,445 --> 00:04:22,447
So the kind of art that was being exhibited here
was really an art of exclusion.

67
00:04:22,447 --> 00:04:25,232
And it really was a kind of propaganda.

68
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:29,965
And it reminds us of just how powerful
the visual arts can be as a tool of the state.

69
00:04:29,965 --> 00:04:33,497
And the person who embodies this most
is a man named Adolph Ziegler,

70
00:04:33,497 --> 00:04:34,897
who was a painter,

71
00:04:34,897 --> 00:04:37,280
and the man responsible for putting
together the first exhibition

72
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,130
of "Great German Art" here in the House
of German Art.

73
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:44,065
And also organizing the Entartete Kunst
exhibition.

74
00:04:44,065 --> 00:04:47,314
And Zeigler was a favorite of Adolph Hitler.

75
00:04:47,314 --> 00:04:51,913
In fact, his painting, "The Four Elements,"
was hung in the Reichs Chancellery

76
00:04:51,913 --> 00:04:54,296
in Hitler's own office in Berlin.

77
00:04:54,296 --> 00:04:58,112
Characteristic of Ziegler's work, and characteristic
of much of the painting and sculpture

78
00:04:58,112 --> 00:05:02,246
that was exhibited in this first exhibition
in the House of German Art,

79
00:05:02,246 --> 00:05:04,046
is a classicism.

80
00:05:04,046 --> 00:05:08,348
We see an emphasis on eternal properties
like the four elements, like the four seasons.

81
00:05:08,348 --> 00:05:14,348
And we see an emphasis on a particularity,
a kind of hyperclarity that we might associate

82
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:16,663
with 15th century northern art.

83
00:05:16,663 --> 00:05:20,130
And the art that was exhibited in the
degenerate art exhibition

84
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:25,789
was hung with art by people who were
mentally and physically handicapped.

85
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:30,605
So that was art that was associated 
with all that the Nazis were eradicating,

86
00:05:30,605 --> 00:05:32,804
literally murdering.

87
00:05:32,804 --> 00:05:34,070
And it was wildly popular.

88
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:39,309
Estimates put the attendance to the Entartete 
Kunst exhibition between two and three million people.

89
00:05:39,309 --> 00:05:40,176
And you know what?

90
00:05:40,176 --> 00:05:45,426
Even now, in the beginning of the 21st century,
there is still real controversy about modernism.

91
00:05:45,426 --> 00:05:46,794
People still get upset.

92
00:05:46,794 --> 00:05:50,026
And I think it's important to understand
our uncomfortableness,

93
00:05:50,026 --> 00:05:56,409
but also the kind of historical dimensions
by which intolerance of art can become dangerous.

94
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:58,076
Very dangerous.

95
00:05:58,076 --> 00:06:02,043
Maybe this is a good time to read 
a little bit more from Hitler's speech

96
00:06:02,043 --> 00:06:04,775
at the inauguration of that first exhibition:

97
00:06:44,176 --> 00:06:46,676
Those are chilling words.

98
00:06:46,676 --> 00:06:50,509
And of course, Hitler did with people
what he also did with the art.

99
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:55,460
It's interesting to note that the motto
of the Austrian avant-garde,

100
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,191
and Hitler was, after all, Austrian.

101
00:06:58,191 --> 00:06:59,942
And he was a would-be artist.

102
00:06:59,942 --> 00:07:05,559
The motto was "To each age its art, 
and to art its freedom,"

103
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:09,559
the very opposite of the ideals Hitler
was trying to promote.
