1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,670
   

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,470
We're on problem 15.

3
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:06,810
It asks us, if triangle ABC
and triangle XYZ are two

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,520
triangles such that-- OK, let
me draw these two triangle.

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:18,000
Triangle ABC, maybe it looks
something like that, and then

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,050
we have triangle XYZ,
and we want to prove

7
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,090
that they are similar.

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,650
Similar means that they
look the same.

9
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:27,130
They have a similar shape, but
could be of different sizes.

10
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,150
So essentially all of their
angles are the same or all the

11
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,190
ratios of their sides
of the same.

12
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:34,580
So XYZ might just be
a smaller version.

13
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,830
Maybe I should have drawn
a bigger one.

14
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,560
   

15
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,260
It looks like they want
us to prove the

16
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,090
triangles are similar.

17
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,520
They tell us that the ratio of
AB to XY-- let me color that.

18
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:52,010
They say the ratio of AB
to XY is equal to the

19
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,640
ratio of BC to YZ.

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,950
   

21
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,820
Which of the following would
be sufficient to prove the

22
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,110
triangles are similar?

23
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,330
So there's a couple of times
when you know that a triangle

24
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:08,125
is similar, is if the ratio of
all the sides are equal.

25
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:13,070
   

26
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,290
Think about it, just giving
two sides isn't enough,

27
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,750
because even though I drew them
so that they're similar,

28
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,030
it could look something
like this.

29
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,490
Maybe the ratio here is 2:1.

30
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,100
So maybe AB and XY, maybe
that's a 2:1.

31
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,460
Maybe that's 2 and that's
1 like that.

32
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,830
The ratio is 2:1.

33
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:34,820
And maybe BC to YZ
is also 2:1.

34
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,490
But there's nothing that tells
us that that can't

35
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:38,850
open up like this.

36
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,010
It could be like a
2 and a 1 ratio.

37
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,750
Or actually even better, I
don't want to draw them

38
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,380
similar anymore.

39
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,020
I want to draw them
some unsimilar.

40
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,130
Maybe BC comes in like that
maybe YZ goes out like that.

41
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:55,200
And so just knowing that the
ratio of two of the sides are

42
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,710
the same, that alone doesn't
tell you that you're dealing

43
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,100
with a similar triangle.

44
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,990
These two triangles would
be very different.

45
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,690
These are definitely not
similar triangles.

46
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,940
In fact, all of the angles
would be different.

47
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,180
Now, how do you prove that
something is similar?

48
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:14,920
Well, actually I attempted this
problem about two minutes

49
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,130
ago and it stumped me, because
I think, if I'm right, that

50
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,930
there's a mistake
in the problem.

51
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,460
In geometry class, they always
teach you that if you know

52
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,640
that the ratio of two of the
sides are equal and that the

53
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,100
angle between them are equal,
then that's sufficient to say

54
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,750
that it's a similar triangle.

55
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,430
Or that you can make the
conclusion of the ratio of AC

56
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,350
to XZ would also be equal.

57
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,080
So that's the answer they're
probably looking for.

58
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,720
That if you have the ratio of
AB to XY, you have the ratio

59
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,860
of BC to YZ, then you want the
angle in between them to say,

60
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,290
OK, these are similar
triangles.

61
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,510
So you'd have to know
that angle B is

62
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,270
congruent to angle Y.

63
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:59,640
And that's choice B.

64
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,750
I don't argue with the fact that
angle B being congruent

65
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,010
to angle Y is sufficient
to prove that these

66
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,170
triangles are similar.

67
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,100
I just think that some of
these other things are

68
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,680
actually sufficient to prove
the triangles are similar.

69
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,730
They don't teach you the tools
in geometry, but you can even

70
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,320
think about it intuitively.

71
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,780
Once you learn the law of
cosines in trigonometry, which

72
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,960
you're not that far away from
right now, you'll see that any

73
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,890
of the other angles, if you know
the corresponding angles

74
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:29,820
are congruent, you would be all
set to know that these are

75
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,870
going to be similar triangles.

76
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,950
   

77
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,020
For example, if you know that
angle C is congruent to angle

78
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,160
Z, and you could even
think about it.

79
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,100
Let's say if you knew that angle
C was congruent to angle

80
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:49,000
Z, there's no other way to draw
this triangle versus just

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,110
having a similar triangle.

82
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,590
So, for example, in this one
right here, this would be

83
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,620
angle C and this would be angle
Z, and clearly, these

84
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,360
two aren't congruent.

85
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,740
If you think about it, when
you say that this angle is

86
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,150
congruent to this angle, you're
constraining the shape

87
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,680
of this line right here.

88
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,000
You're constraining the
direction that it goes in.

89
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,290
   

90
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,000
If you forced this angle to be
the same as this, let's say

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,340
that you said this angle is
equal to that angle, then you

92
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,170
would have to go out in this
direction out there, and then

93
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,170
you would break what you
originally said, that the

94
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,170
ratio of that to
that is equal.

95
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,560
So just think about it in terms
of when you add another

96
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,650
angle, it actually does
constrain the triangle to

97
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,540
being similar.

98
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,040
And the same thing is true,
angle A and angle X.

99
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,540
If you know that angle A is
congruent to angle X, that

100
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,510
also constrains the triangle
to being similar.

101
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,330
The only one that I know
definitely isn't sufficient is

102
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,170
angle X being congruent
to angle Y.

103
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,420
That's useless.

104
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:57,940
   

105
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,520
Let's see, angle X congruent
to angle Y.

106
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,930
Yeah, that doesn't help you.

107
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,100
That tells you that this one
is an isosceles triangle

108
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,370
because these two base angles
would be the same, so that

109
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,210
would be the same as that, but
it doesn't tell you anything

110
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,310
about how does this
relate to that.

111
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,950
So even though the answer
they're looking for is

112
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:20,600
probably B, I would say that A
and C are also sufficient.

113
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,190
Next question.

114
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,950
Question 16.

115
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:30,300
And send me a note if you think
I'm missing something,

116
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,240
because I thought about
it a little bit.

117
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:45,340
All right, 16.

118
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:50,050
In parallelogram FGHI-- let me
draw parallelogram FGHI.

119
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,850
   

120
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,690
We have one side.

121
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,570
We come down at a
45-degree angle.

122
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,500
We have the other side.

123
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,475
Let's say we go up at
a 45-degree angle.

124
00:06:04,475 --> 00:06:05,830
I can do it from here.

125
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,480
   

126
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,880
Close enough.

127
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,320
Got my parallelogram.

128
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,090
Parallelogram FGHI.

129
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:18,960
So that F, that's a G, that's
an H, and that's an I.

130
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,260
Diagonals IG and FH are drawn
and intersect at point M.

131
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,890
So let me draw IG and FH.

132
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,660
   

133
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,635
OK, these are lines.

134
00:06:29,635 --> 00:06:38,090
   

135
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:38,940
Fair enough.

136
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,645
And they intersect at point M.

137
00:06:40,645 --> 00:06:44,350
   

138
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,240
Which of the following
statements must be true?

139
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,650
OK.

140
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,970
Triangle FGI must be
an obtuse triangle.

141
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:58,470
   

142
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,470
And that means that one of the
angles in the triangle is more

143
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,080
than 90 degrees.

144
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,220
I mean, just the way I drew it
here, which is a completely

145
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,550
legitimate way to draw it, all
of these lines are parallel.

146
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,230
We see that that doesn't have
to be the case, because just

147
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,120
the way I drew it, all
these angles are

148
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,070
less than 90 degrees.

149
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,690
So that's definitely
not the case.

150
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,300
   

151
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,463
Triangle HIG, must be
an acute triangle.

152
00:07:21,463 --> 00:07:31,930
   

153
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,790
Let's think about
it a little bit.

154
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,760
Let's try to prove it
by contradiction.

155
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,060
Let's say that one
of the sides was

156
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,100
more than 90 degrees.

157
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,930
So this is just the
way I happened to

158
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,470
draw it right here.

159
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:50,690
But if you think about it, I
could have drawn it like this.

160
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,350
So the way I drew it, HIG
is in an acute triangle.

161
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:56,610
All of these sides are
less than 90 degrees.

162
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,180
But I could have drawn this
the complete opposite way.

163
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,380
Let me draw it that
way actually.

164
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,230
I'll do it quick and dirty.

165
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:06,360
So what if I drew
it like this?

166
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,010
What if I drew our parallelogram
like this?

167
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:13,810
   

168
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,540
The direction that I drew
it was arbitrary.

169
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,830
   

170
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:25,360
So now this is F, G, H and I,
and they're talking about

171
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,610
triangle HIG.

172
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,640
   

173
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:34,350
Well, clearly, in this case,
angle H right here, this is an

174
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,620
obtuse angle.

175
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,350
That is greater than
90 degrees.

176
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,500
So HIG would be an
obtuse triangle.

177
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,799
So there's nothing that prevents
us from drawing the

178
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,900
parallelogram like this,
which would make

179
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,430
this an obtuse triangle.

180
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,580
So that triangle does not have
to be an acute triangle, so B

181
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,990
doesn't work.

182
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,870
All right, what else
do they say?

183
00:08:53,870 --> 00:09:02,115
Triangle FMG must be congruent
to triangle HMG.

184
00:09:02,115 --> 00:09:07,390
   

185
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,430
Well that's congruent.

186
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,970
So that would mean that all
the sides are equal and

187
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,310
everything, and that's
clearly not true.

188
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:16,170
They share this side right here,
but this side up here

189
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,850
could be a lot longer than that
side, which would make

190
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,390
this side here a lot longer
than that side, so that's

191
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,720
definitely not true.

192
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,970
So, D is probably the answer,
but let's see if

193
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:25,640
we can prove it.

194
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,500
Triangle GMH must be
congruent to IMF.

195
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,100
So let me do that in two
different colors.

196
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:38,750
So GMH, that's that one right
there, must be congruent to

197
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:47,040
IMF, that's that one
right there.

198
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,630
Let's see.

199
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:51,660
First of all, we know that this
angle and that angle are

200
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,430
going to be congruent.

201
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:55,600
They are opposite angles or, as
they say, vertical angles.

202
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,860
The reason I don't like using
vertical angles is because

203
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,240
this angle and this angle are
also opposite angles, and to

204
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,310
call them vertical angles is
bizarre because they're not

205
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,470
vertical with each other.

206
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,490
Anyway, that's just my problem
with the notation.

207
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:14,480
   

208
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,310
OK, so where were we?

209
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,545
We wanted to prove that
that triangle and that

210
00:10:16,545 --> 00:10:17,330
triangle are congruent.

211
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:21,040
This angle is definitely equal
to that angle, and know that

212
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,360
this line is parallel
to this line, right?

213
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,700
So we can view each of these
crossing lines as transversals

214
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,680
will between two
parallel lines.

215
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,740
That's a parallel line, that's
a parallel line, so this is a

216
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,370
transversal between two
parallel lines.

217
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:39,530
Then this angle is going to be
congruent to that angle, and

218
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:42,640
that's because I think the word
is opposite internal, or

219
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,440
alternate interior angles,
or something like that.

220
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,140
And it makes sense.

221
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,135
You could imagine drawing the
transversal either way and

222
00:10:48,135 --> 00:10:50,140
then the angles would change,
but they are always going to

223
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,180
be congruent.

224
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:57,450
And by the same argument, this
angle is going to be congruent

225
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,220
to that angle.

226
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,440
So we know that all of the
angles are the same, and now

227
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,420
we have to make some type of
argument that all of the sides

228
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:06,740
are the same.

229
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,550
Really, if we could just prove
that one of the sides are the

230
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,220
same, then we know that all
of the sides are the same.

231
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,470
Well, we know that it's
a parallelogram.

232
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:15,690
   

233
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:19,300
So in order for all of the
sides to be parallel, the

234
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,970
opposite sides have to
be the same length.

235
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,770
I'll leave you to think
about why that is.

236
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:26,940
But if all the opposite sides
are the same length, we know

237
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,890
that this side is equivalent
to this side.

238
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,900
So, you know, we could use one
of those geometry postulates

239
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,410
that they-- angle, side,
angle, right?

240
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,310
We haven an angle, a side and an
angle, and an angle, a side

241
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,000
and an angle, and say, OK,
that's enough for us to show

242
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,440
that these are congruent
triangles.

243
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,880
So the answer is D.

244
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,390
Anyway, see you in
the next video.

245
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,000
