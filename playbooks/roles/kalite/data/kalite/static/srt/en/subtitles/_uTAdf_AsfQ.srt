1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,450
   

2
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,890
What I want to do in this video
-- and it'll probably

3
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,980
occur over several videos -- is
really integrate everything

4
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,990
we know about matrices, and
null spaces, and column

5
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,960
spaces, and linear
independence.

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,100
So I have this matrix
here, this matrix A.

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,510
And I guess a good place to
start is, let's figure out its

8
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,380
column space and
its null space.

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,510
The column space is actually
super easy to figure out.

10
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,070
It's just the span of the
column vectors of A.

11
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,940
So we can right from the get-go
write that the column

12
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:34,240
space of our matrix A-- Let
me do it over here.

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,700
I can write the column space of
my matrix A is equal to the

14
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:46,050
span of the vectors 1, 2, 3.

15
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,490
1, 1, 4.

16
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:52,550
   

17
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,410
1, 4, 1.

18
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,130
And 1, 3, 2.

19
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:56,730
I'm done.

20
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,410
That was pretty straightforward,
a lot easier

21
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,290
than finding null spaces.

22
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,220
Now this may or may not
be satisfying to you.

23
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,660
And there's a lot of
open questions.

24
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,940
Is this a basis for the
space, for example?

25
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,640
Is this a linear independent
set of vectors?

26
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,580
How can we visualize
this space?

27
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,260
And I haven't answered
any of those yet.

28
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,750
But if someone just says, hey
what's the column space of A?

29
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,460
This is the column space of A.

30
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,090
And then we can answer some
of those other questions.

31
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,390
   

32
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:27,330
If this is a linearly
independent set of vectors,

33
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,340
then these vectors would
be a basis for the

34
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,170
column space of A.

35
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,040
We don't know that yet.

36
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,220
We don't know whether these
are linearly independent.

37
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,700
But we can figure out if they're
linearly independent

38
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,070
by looking at the
null space of A.

39
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,530
Remember these are linearly
independent if the null space

40
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,780
of A only contains
the 0 vector.

41
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,110
So let's figure out what
the null space of A is.

42
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,190
And remember, we can do a
little shortcut here.

43
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:54,580
The null space of A is equal to
the null space of the row,

44
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,140
the reduced row echelon
form of A.

45
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,050
And I showed you that when we
first calculated the null

46
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,200
space of a vector, because when
you performed these --

47
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,580
essentially if you want to solve
for the null space of A,

48
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,980
you create an augmented
matrix.

49
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,490
And you put the augmented matrix
in reduced row echelon

50
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,520
form, but the 0's
never change.

51
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,300
So essentially you're just
taking A and putting it in

52
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,630
reduced row echelon form.

53
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,340
Let's do that.

54
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:25,250
So I'll keep row one the
same, 1, 1, 1, 1.

55
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,570
And then let me replace
row two with, row

56
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,580
two minus row one.

57
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,390
   

58
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,510
So what do I get?

59
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,120
No, actually I want to
zero this out here.

60
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,720
So row two minus,
2 times row one.

61
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,130
Actually even better because
I eventually

62
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:44,950
want to get a 1 here.

63
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,700
So let me do 2 times row
one, minus row two.

64
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,150
So let me say 2 times row
one, and I'm going

65
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,170
to minus row two.

66
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:57,670
So 2 times 1 minus 2 is
0, which is exactly

67
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,800
what I wanted there.

68
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,950
2 times 1 minus 1 is 1.

69
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,680
That's nice to have
right there.

70
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,300
2 times 1 minus 4 is minus 2.

71
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:15,530
2 times 1 minus 3 is minus 1.

72
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:20,240
All right, now let me see if I
can zero out this guy here.

73
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,490
So what can I do?

74
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:26,960
   

75
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,510
I could do any combination,
anything that essentially

76
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,710
zeroes this guy out.

77
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,640
But I want to minimize my number
of negative numbers.

78
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,590
So let me take this third row,
minus 3 times this first row.

79
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:43,060
So I'm going take minus 3 times
that first row and add

80
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,250
it to this third row.

81
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,336
So 3 minus 3 times 1 is 0.

82
00:03:49,336 --> 00:03:52,250
   

83
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,370
These are just going to
be a bunch of 3's.

84
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,920
4 minus 3 times 1 is 1.

85
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,990
1 minus 3 times 1 is minus 2.

86
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,510
And 2 minus 3 times
1 is minus 1.

87
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,290
Now if we want to get this into
reduced row echelon form

88
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,970
we need to target that one
there and that one there.

89
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:09,870
And what can we do?

90
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,270
So let's keep my middle
row the same.

91
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,000
My middle row is not
going to change.

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,610
1, 1, minus 2, minus 1.

93
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:24,550
And to get rid of this one up
here I can just replace my

94
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,950
first row with my first row
minus my second row.

95
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,460
Because then this
won't change.

96
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,370
I'll have 1 minus 0 is 1.

97
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,280
1 minus 1 is 0.

98
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,140
That's what we wanted.

99
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:39,210
1 minus minus 2 is 3.

100
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,120
That's 1 plus 2.

101
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,060
1 minus minus 1.

102
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,000
That's 1 plus 1.

103
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,700
That is 2.

104
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,690
Fair enough?

105
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,805
Now let me do my third row.

106
00:04:47,805 --> 00:04:51,950
   

107
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:55,000
Let me replace my third row with
my third row subtracted

108
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,190
from my first row.

109
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,240
They are obviously
the same thing.

110
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,220
So if I subtract the third row
from the second row I'm just

111
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,260
going to get a bunch of 0's.

112
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,610
0 minus 0 is 0.

113
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,060
1 minus 1 is 0.

114
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,500
Minus 2 minus minus 2 is 0.

115
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,070
And minus 1 minus minus 1.

116
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,430
That's minus 1 plus 1.

117
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,020
That's equal to 0.

118
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,900
And just like that
we have it now in

119
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,480
reduced row echelon form.

120
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,690
So this right here is the
reduced row echelon form of A.

121
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,030
That straightforward.

122
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:29,450
Now the whole the reason why
we even went through this

123
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,460
exercise is we wanted
to figure out the

124
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,460
null space of A.

125
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,740
And we already know that the
null space of A is equal to

126
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,400
the null space of the reduced
row echelon form of A.

127
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,360
So if this is the reduce row
echelon form of A, let's

128
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,930
figure out its null space.

129
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:48,030
So the null space is the set
of all of vectors in R4,

130
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,170
because we have 4
columns here.

131
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:54,170
1, 2, 3, 4.

132
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,380
The null space is the set of
all of vectors that satisfy

133
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,780
this equation, where
we're going to have

134
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,770
three 0's right here.

135
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,570
That's the 0 vector in R3,
because we have three rows

136
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,250
right there, and you
can figure it out.

137
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,760
This times this has
to equal that 0.

138
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,745
That dotted with that
essentially is going

139
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:11,780
to equal that 0.

140
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,600
That dotted with that
is equal to that 0.

141
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,970
I say essentially because I
didn't define a row vector dot

142
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,340
a column vector.

143
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,410
I've only defined column vectors
dotted with other

144
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:21,850
column vectors.

145
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,320
But we've been over that in a
previous video, where you can

146
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,720
say this is a transpose
of a column vector.

147
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,800
So let's just take this,
and write a system of

148
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,290
equations with this.

149
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,480
So we get 1 times x1.

150
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,840
So this times this is going
to be equal to that 0.

151
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,740
So one times x1, that is x1.

152
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,330
Plus 0 times x2.

153
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,500
Let me just write that out.

154
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,740
Plus 3 times x3.

155
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:55,870
Plus 2 times x4 is
equal to that 0.

156
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,730
And then -- I'll do it in
yellow right here -- I

157
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:03,200
have 0 times x1.

158
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,410
Plus 1 times x2.

159
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:10,450
Minus 2 times x3.

160
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:14,040
Minus x4 is equal to 0.

161
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,440
And then this gives
me no information.

162
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,400
0 times all this
is equal to 0.

163
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,540
So it just turns into
0 equals 0.

164
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,640
So let's see if we can solve for
our pivot entries, or our

165
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,570
pivot variables.

166
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,930
What are our pivot entries?

167
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,160
This is a pivot entry.

168
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,470
That's a pivot entry.

169
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,730
That's what reduced row echelon
form is all about,

170
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,740
getting these entries that are
1 and they're the only

171
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,860
non-zero term in their
respective columns.

172
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,060
And that every pivot entry
is to the right of a

173
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,370
pivot entry above it.

174
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:42,140
And then the columns that don't
have pivot entries?

175
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,210
These columns represent
the free variables.

176
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,260
So this column has
no pivot entry.

177
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,610
And so when you take the dot
product, this column turned

178
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:54,290
into this column in our
system of equations.

179
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:57,190
So we know that x3 is
a free variable.

180
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,890
x3 is free.

181
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,730
We can set it equal
to anything.

182
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:07,690
Likewise x4 is a
free variable.

183
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,140
X1 and x2 are pivot variables,
because their corresponding

184
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,360
columns in our reduced row
echelon form have pivot

185
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,500
entries in them.

186
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,140
Fair enough.

187
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,580
So let's see if we
can simplify this

188
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,920
into a form we know.

189
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,440
And we've seen this before.

190
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,080
So if I solve for x1 --
this 0 I can ignore.

191
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:32,000
That 0 I can ignore -- I could
say that x1 is equal to minus

192
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,650
3x3 minus 2x4.

193
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,856
I just subtracted these two
from both sides of the

194
00:08:38,856 --> 00:08:49,720
equation and I can say that x2
is equal to 2x3 plus x4.

195
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,750
And if we want to write our
solution set now, so if I

196
00:08:52,750 --> 00:09:00,540
wanted to find the null space of
A, which is the same thing

197
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,400
as the null space of the reduced
row echelon form of A,

198
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,730
is equal to all of the vectors
-- let me do a new color.

199
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:15,050
Maybe I'll do blue -- is equal
to all of the vectors x1, x2,

200
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:19,070
x3, x4 that are equal to --

201
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,620
So what are they going
to be equal to?

202
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,390
X1 has to be equal to
minus 3x3 minus 2x4.

203
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,440
Just to be clear, these are free
variables because I can

204
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,490
set these to be anything.

205
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,560
And these are pivot variables
because I can't just set them

206
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,450
to anything.

207
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,390
When I determine what my x3's
and my x4's are, they

208
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:37,060
determine what my x1's and
my x2's have to be.

209
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,350
So these are pivoted
variables.

210
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,470
These are free variables.

211
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,750
I can make this guy pi.

212
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,830
And I can make this
guy minus 2.

213
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,680
We can set them to anything.

214
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,805
So x1 is equal to -- let's see,
let me write it this way

215
00:09:47,805 --> 00:09:51,655
-- they're equal to x3 -- let me
do it in a different color

216
00:09:51,655 --> 00:09:53,850
-- do x3 like this.

217
00:09:53,850 --> 00:10:04,420
So it's equal to x3 times some
vector plus x4 times some

218
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,080
other vector.

219
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,910
So any solution set in my null
space is going to be a linear

220
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,240
combination of these
two vectors.

221
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,230
We can figure out what these
two vectors are just from

222
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,830
these two constraints
right here.

223
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:22,910
So -- let me do it in a neutral
color -- x1 is equal

224
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:29,460
to minus 3 times x3
minus 2 times x4.

225
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,980
Straightforward enough.

226
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:37,500
x2 is equal to 2 times
x3 plus x4.

227
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,410
What's x3 equal to?

228
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,690
Well x3 is equal to itself.

229
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,870
Whatever we set x3 equal to,
that's going to be x3.

230
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:47,200
So x3 is going to be 1 times
x3 plus 0 times x4.

231
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,580
It is not going to have
any x4 in it.

232
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,460
X3 is going to be kind of
an independent variable.

233
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,200
It's going to be free.

234
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,390
We can set whatever it is.

235
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,240
We set it and then that's
going to be x3 in

236
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,900
our solution set.

237
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,990
x4 is not going to have
any x3 in it.

238
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,140
It's just going to
be 1 times x4.

239
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,980
And so our null space is
essentially all of the linear

240
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,410
combinations of these
two vectors.

241
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,740
This can be any real number.

242
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,420
This is just any real number and
x4 is just a member of the

243
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,140
real space.

244
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:18,700
So all of these, the set of all
of the valid solutions to

245
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,220
Ax is equal to 0 -- where
did I write that.

246
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,300
Did I even write that down?

247
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,930
No I haven't even written
that anywhere.

248
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:29,130
The set of all Ax is equal to
0, where this is my x, it

249
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:33,250
equals all the linear
combinations of this vector

250
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,590
and that vector right there.

251
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:37,540
And we know what all of the
linear combinations mean.

252
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:45,460
It means my null space is equal
to the span of these two

253
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:51,230
guys, the span of minus
3, 2, 1, 0.

254
00:11:51,230 --> 00:12:00,500
And minus 2, 1, 0, 1.

255
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,675
Now let me ask you a question.

256
00:12:02,675 --> 00:12:08,030
   

257
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:13,070
Are the columns in A, are they
a linearly independent set?

258
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:16,980
Are they a linearly
independent set?

259
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:22,100
So if we write these vectors
right there, these are the

260
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,170
column vectors of A.

261
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,220
So let me write that down.

262
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:29,400
So are the column vectors of
A -- so what were they?

263
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:29,790
Let's see.

264
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:34,750
1, 3, 2.

265
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,380
No it's 1, 2, 3.

266
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,480
   

267
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,740
1, 1, 4.

268
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,350
1, 4, 1.

269
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,260
And 1, 3, 2.

270
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,770
So this is just the column
vectors of A.

271
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,600
I could just write A is just
this much of columns, but my

272
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,940
question is, is this a linearly
independent set?

273
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:04,620
   

274
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,690
And here you might immediately
start thinking, well when we

275
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:11,010
said that something is linearly
independent -- so

276
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:19,485
linearly independence implies
that there's only one solution

277
00:13:19,485 --> 00:13:22,010
-- we saw this I think two
videos ago, that there's only

278
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:31,100
one solution -- one solution
to Ax is equal to 0.

279
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,710
And that is the 0 solution,
that x is

280
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,550
equal to the 0 vector.

281
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:40,020
Or another way to say that is
that the null space of my

282
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:44,840
matrix A is equal to
just the 0 vector.

283
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,220
That's what linear independence
implies.

284
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,430
And it goes both ways.

285
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,160
If my null space is just a 0
vector, then I know it's

286
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,430
linearly independent.

287
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,800
If my null space includes other
vectors, then I am not

288
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,180
linearly independent.

289
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,400
Now my null space of A,
what does it include?

290
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,080
Is it just the 0 vector?

291
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,810
Well, no it includes
every linear

292
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,200
combination of these guys.

293
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,590
It includes actually an infinite
number of vectors,

294
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,110
not just one solution.

295
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,180
Obviously 0 vector is contained
here, if you just

296
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,950
multiply both of these -- if you
pick 0 for that and that.

297
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,820
It's contained, but you can get
a whole set of vectors.

298
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:25,850
So because the null span of A,
the null space, sorry, the

299
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:29,720
null space of A does not just
contain the 0 vector.

300
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,730
So it has more than just 0.

301
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:37,510
   

302
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,950
So what does that mean?

303
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,170
Well that means that
there's more than

304
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,300
one solution to this.

305
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,220
And that means that this is
a linearly dependent set.

306
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:51,620
   

307
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,950
And what does that mean?

308
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,940
At the very beginning of the
video I said, what's the

309
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,250
column space of A.

310
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,400
And we said, the column space
of A is just the span of the

311
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,490
column vectors.

312
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,950
I just wrote it out like that.

313
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:04,410
And I said, well it's not clear
whether this is a valid

314
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,680
basis for the column
space of A.

315
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,630
And what's a basis?

316
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:13,590
A basis is a set of vectors that
span a subspace, and they

317
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,970
are also linearly independent.

318
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:19,230
And we just showed that these
guys are not linearly

319
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,910
independent.

320
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:28,070
So that means that they are
not a basis for the column

321
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,360
space of A.

322
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,720
They do span the column space
of A, by definition really.

323
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,780
But they're not a basis.

324
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,620
They need to be linearly
independent for

325
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,020
them to be a basis.

326
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,120
So let's see if we can figure
out what a basis for this

327
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,040
column space would be.

328
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,000
And to do that we just
have to get rid of

329
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,380
some redundant vectors.

330
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,340
If I can show you that this guy
can be represented by some

331
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,810
combination of these two
guys, then I can

332
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:51,650
get rid of that guy.

333
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,480
He's not adding any
new information.

334
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,370
Same with that guy.

335
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,400
Who knows?

336
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,890
So let's see if we can figure
this piece of the puzzle out.

337
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:06,770
So we know already that x1, let
me write it this way, that

338
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:11,010
x1 times -- Maybe I'll just kind
of leave you hanging and

339
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,270
continue this in
the next video.

340
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:18,780
But we know that x1
times 1, 2, 3.

341
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:23,470
Plus x2 times 1, 1, 4.

342
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:28,040
Plus x3 times 1, 4, 1.

343
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,250
Plus x4 times 1, 3, 2.

344
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,600
We know that this
is equal to 0.

345
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,260
Now if we are able to solve for
x4 in terms of -- let me

346
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:47,540
just think that I can solve
for the vectors that are

347
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,300
associated with my
free variables

348
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,600
using the other vectors.

349
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,080
Let me see if I can do that.

350
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,060
And you'll see it's actually
pretty straightforward.

351
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,820
So let's say I want
to solve for x4.

352
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,450
So if I subtract this from
both sides of this

353
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,819
equation, I get what?

354
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:07,690
Let me put it this way, let
me set x3 equal to 0.

355
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,640
It was a free variable.

356
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,290
I can do that.

357
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:16,290
So if I set x3 is equal to 0,
then what do I get here?

358
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,710
If I said x3 equals 0,
this guy disappears.

359
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,780
And if I subtract this from both
sides of this equation, I

360
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:27,230
get x1 times 1, 2, 3.

361
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:31,940
Plus x2 times 1, 1, 4.

362
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,430
Is equal to -- I'm just
setting x3 equal to 0.

363
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,880
That was a free variable.

364
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,930
So I'm setting x3 equal to 0.

365
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,940
So this whole thing
disappears.

366
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:47,490
So that is equal to minus
x4 times 1, 3, 2.

367
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:48,900
Now I set x3 equal to 0.

368
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:55,050
Let me set x4 to be
equal to minus 1.

369
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:58,440
If x4 is equal to minus
1, what is minus x4?

370
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,300
Well then this thing will
just be equal to 1.

371
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,500
And I'll have x1
times 1, 2, 3.

372
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,560
Plus x2 times 1, 1, 4 will
equal this fourth

373
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,980
vector right here.

374
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,350
And can I always find
things like this?

375
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,250
Well sure I can actually find
the particular ones.

376
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,340
If x3 is equal to 0, and x4 is
minus 1 -- Let me copy and

377
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:35,790
paste this that I have up
here -- Let me scroll

378
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,000
down a little bit.

379
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,890
This is what we got when we
figured out our null space,

380
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,440
right there.

381
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,582
So if I'm setting -- remember
these are the free variables

382
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:47,590
-- if I set x3 equal to
0 and x4 is equal to

383
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,070
minus 1, what is x1?

384
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:54,700
Then this will imply that x1 is
equal to minus 3 times x3,

385
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,350
that's just 0, minus
2 times x4.

386
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,450
If x4 is minus 1, minus
2 times minus 1,

387
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,820
x1 will equal 2.

388
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,350
And then what will
x2 be equal to?

389
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:10,370
x2 is equal to 2 times x3,
which is 0, plus x4.

390
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:12,010
So it's equal to minus 1.

391
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:15,450
So I just showed you that if I
set this equal to 2 and this

392
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:19,000
equal to minus 1, I have a
linear combination of this

393
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,340
vector and this vector
that can add up

394
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,190
to this fourth vector.

395
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,140
And you can even verify it.

396
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,430
2 times 1 minus 1
is equal to 1.

397
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:29,290
2 times 2 minus 1
is equal to 3.

398
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:32,340
2 times 3 is 6, minus
4 is equal to 2.

399
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,520
So it checks out.

400
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,820
So I just showed you using,
really, our definitions

401
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,730
looking at what were
our free variables

402
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,110
versus our pivot variables.

403
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:46,210
We were able to show you, kind
of just very simply solve for

404
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:48,310
this third, this fourth
vector, in terms

405
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,540
of these first two.

406
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,860
So we know, if we go back to
the set that this fourth

407
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:58,430
vector is really unnecessary,
really not adding anything to

408
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,330
the span of the set
of vectors.

409
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,910
Because this guy can be written
as a combination of

410
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,730
this guy and this guy.

411
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,320
Now let's see if this guy, this
third guy, we can do the

412
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,340
same exercise.

413
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,350
This is also dictated
by a free variable.

414
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,990
So let's see if I can write
him as a combination

415
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,430
of these first two.

416
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,450
Well we'll do the exact
same thing.

417
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:22,030
Instead of setting x3 equal to 0
and x4 equal to minus 1, let

418
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:27,445
us set x4 is equal to
0 because I want

419
00:20:27,445 --> 00:20:28,760
to cross that out.

420
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:33,000
And let me set x3 is
equal to minus 1.

421
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,360
If x3 is equal to minus
1, what does this

422
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,900
equation reduce to?

423
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,480
We get x1 times 1, 2, 3.

424
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,760
Plus x2 times 1, 1, 4.

425
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,640
Is equal to -- if this is
minus 1 times 1, 4, 1.

426
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,620
And then we add it to both sides
of this equation, we get

427
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,960
plus 1 times 1, 4, 1.

428
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,710
And once again we can just
solve for our x1 and x2.

429
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:06,940
If x4 is 0 and x3 is minus
1, then x1 x4 is 0.

430
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,220
So x3 is just minus 3,
times x3, so x1 would

431
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,430
be equal to 3, right?

432
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,950
Minus 3 times minus 1.

433
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:16,120
And what would x2 be equal to?

434
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,730
x4 is 0, we can ignore that.

435
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,700
x2 would be equal to minus 2.

436
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,250
So this would be 3, and then
this would be minus 2.

437
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:23,830
Let's see if it works out.

438
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:26,500
3 times 1 minus 2 is 1.

439
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,620
3 times 2 minus 2 is 4.

440
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,620
3 times 3 minus 8 is 1.

441
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,800
It checks out.

442
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,120
So I'm able to write this
vector, that was associated

443
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,980
with the free variable,
as a linear

444
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,180
combination of these two.

445
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,990
So we can get rid of
him from our set.

446
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:44,290
So now I've shown that this guy
can be written as a linear

447
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,240
combination of these two.

448
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,880
This guy can be written
as a linear

449
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,690
combination of these two.

450
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:51,710
So the span of all of those guys
should be equal to the

451
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,120
span -- So let me write
it this way.

452
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,690
   

453
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,630
The column space of A,
I can now re-write.

454
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,520
Before it was the span of
all of those vectors.

455
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,150
It was the span of all of
the column vectors,

456
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:10,850
v1, v2, v3, and v4.

457
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:13,470
Now I just showed you that v3
and v4 can be rewritten in

458
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,240
terms of v1 and v2.

459
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,160
So they're redundant.

460
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,270
So that is equal to the span
of v1 and v2 which are just

461
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:23,140
those two vectors.

462
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:29,450
Vector 1, 2, 3, and
vector 1, 1, 4.

463
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:32,800
Now are any of these
guys redundant?

464
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,150
Can I express one of
them as a linear

465
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,690
combination of the other?

466
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,250
Essentially when I'm talking
about the linear combination

467
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,550
of only one other
vector it's just

468
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,930
multiplying it by a scalar.

469
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,330
Well let's think about that.

470
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,510
There are multiple ways you can
show this, but the easiest

471
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:48,730
way is well look, to go from
this entry to that entry I'm

472
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,320
just multiplying by 1.

473
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,525
But if I multiply this whole
vector times 1, then I'm going

474
00:22:53,525 --> 00:22:55,980
to get a 2 here and I'm
going to get a 3 here.

475
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,230
So it won't work.

476
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,840
   

477
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,940
If I want to represent this guy
as a scalar multiple of

478
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:05,960
that guy, so any scalar multiple
of 1, 2, 3 is going

479
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:14,810
to be equal to 1c, 2c, 3c.

480
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,460
Right?

481
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,030
And so we're saying this guy has
to be represented somehow

482
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:21,110
like that, if we say that this
guy is somehow a scalar,

483
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,580
somehow can be represented
by that guy.

484
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:26,600
So that would have to
be equal to 1, 1, 4.

485
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,250
When you look at this top entry
it implies that c would

486
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,940
have to be equal to 1.

487
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,150
But when you look at this second
entry you think that c

488
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:37,020
would have to be equal to 1/2.

489
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,030
So you get a contradiction.

490
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,390
Over here c would have
to be equal to 4/3.

491
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,530
So there's no c where
this will work.

492
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:43,740
There's no multiple of c.

493
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,650
And you can work
that both ways.

494
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:48,240
So there's no way that you can
represent one of these guys as

495
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,560
a linear combination
of the other.

496
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,040
And you can actually prove
other ways, maybe more

497
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,120
formally, that this is
linearly independent.

498
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,810
But given that this is linearly
independent -- I

499
00:23:55,810 --> 00:24:01,710
think you're satisfied with that
-- we can then say that

500
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:19,820
the set of vectors 1, 2, 3, and
1, 1, 4, this is a basis

501
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:23,720
for the column span of A.

502
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,000
Now I'm going to let you go in
this video because I think

503
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,200
I've gone well over time.

504
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,870
But what I'm going to do in
the next few videos is now

505
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:32,180
that I've established that this
is a basis for the column

506
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,780
span of A, we can attempt
to visualize it.

507
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:39,140
Because we can say that the
column span of A is equal to

508
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,100
the span of these two vectors.

509
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,840
And we can think about
what the span of

510
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,850
those two vectors are.

511
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,280
We're going to see that
it's a plane in R3.

512
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,180
Span of 1, 1, 4.

513
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,910
And this is a quick reminder,
I've said a couple times.

514
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:53,760
When I say it's a basis all I'm
saying is that these guys,

515
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,510
they both span the column
space of A.

516
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,275
When I had four vectors,
they also spanned the

517
00:24:58,275 --> 00:24:59,190
column space of A.

518
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:02,460
But what makes them a basis is
that these guys are linearly

519
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:02,980
independent.

520
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,910
There's no extra information, or
redundant vectors that can

521
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:09,260
be represented by other vectors
within the basis.

522
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,360
They are linearly independent.

523
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,510
Anyway, I'll let
you go for now.
