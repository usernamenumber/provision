1
00:00:04,351 --> 00:00:06,725
We're at the Musee d'Orsay and we're looking at

2
00:00:06,972 --> 00:00:10,964
an 1874 Monet. This is The Bridge at Argenteuil,

3
00:00:11,256 --> 00:00:14,350
which is a suburb of Paris, where Monet lived briefly

4
00:00:14,811 --> 00:00:16,673
and was accessible to Paris by the train.

5
00:00:17,087 --> 00:00:19,496
This is the new suburbs that were made possible

6
00:00:19,727 --> 00:00:23,526
by not only the wealth of the city but also the industry of this time

7
00:00:23,865 --> 00:00:26,232
and the place where people would go to escape

8
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:30,982
the intensity of urban life in Paris and go boating

9
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,104
and go fishing and go picnicking. And you can see from this painting

10
00:00:35,304 --> 00:00:37,189
how fun that would be here.

11
00:00:37,481 --> 00:00:41,866
Yes. What really comes across is just the brilliance of the light on a summer day.

12
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,197
Monet is really discarding hundreds of years of tradition

13
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:49,135
of the way that one would paint trees and water

14
00:00:49,443 --> 00:00:53,669
and has found a new method for painting outdoor light.

15
00:00:53,991 --> 00:00:56,398
Remember, he’s painting this out of doors, too.

16
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,620
-	This is a painting painted on plain air. 
-	This is the height of impressionism.

17
00:01:00,897 --> 00:01:05,590
1874 is the year of the first impressionist exhibition and Monet has, as you said,

18
00:01:05,883 --> 00:01:09,541
discarded an entire tradition, turned painting on its head by saying:

19
00:01:09,818 --> 00:01:15,681
What’s important is not the thing that I’m painting, but it is the optical experience of seeing.

20
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:17,519
- That’s right.
- That’s critical here.

21
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,274
And in order to jettison those hundreds of years of how to paint a landscape

22
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:25,276
Monet asks himself: what am I really seeing?

23
00:01:25,691 --> 00:01:29,222
If I put away everything that my brain tells me and everything a person learns

24
00:01:29,437 --> 00:01:33,144
at the academy as though my eye were born now

25
00:01:33,498 --> 00:01:37,081
and I just looked at the scene, what would I see: patches of green,

26
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:40,756
patches of bluish green, dabs of purple.

27
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:43,547
So that not what I know, you know,

28
00:01:43,886 --> 00:01:49,705
not concentrate on formula of academic painting but the actual visual experience of this.

29
00:01:49,982 --> 00:01:52,676
So when you look at for instance the English painter Constable

30
00:01:52,984 --> 00:01:56,776
you can identify the types of trees, you can identify the hardware

31
00:01:57,038 --> 00:02:01,019
that's on the barges that he renders. Here almost nothing is identifiable.

32
00:02:01,203 --> 00:02:03,988
It’s not about that, it’s not about understanding

33
00:02:04,203 --> 00:02:08,182
what kind of sailboat that is, what kind of sail is rolled up.

34
00:02:08,398 --> 00:02:11,186
None of that is important. In fact as you said the water...

35
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:14,929
there are parts of it that could be a green lawn in another context but in fact

36
00:02:15,113 --> 00:02:17,644
it’s just the reflective qualities of that surface.

37
00:02:17,781 --> 00:02:19,707
Right, he’s thought: Oh, I see a dab of green,

38
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:23,084
I see a dab of blue, you have an intensity of colour,

39
00:02:23,222 --> 00:02:27,462
He’s using these colours that would never be seen in academic landscape painting

40
00:02:27,677 --> 00:02:30,497
as they would have always been muted, mixed...

41
00:02:30,804 --> 00:02:34,685
Here they are just the same in the foreground as they are in the background.

42
00:02:34,886 --> 00:02:39,298
For example, that green that we see in the water that’s the shadow of the trees,

43
00:02:39,544 --> 00:02:42,677
it’s just as green and just as deep as the tree itself.

44
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:47,170
And so there’s a kind of flattening that happens here that I think looked

45
00:02:47,324 --> 00:02:51,303
very radical in the 1870s and the kind of sketchiness

46
00:02:51,488 --> 00:02:55,234
and looseness to the brushwork that made it not look like a finished painting.

47
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:59,497
Now, landscape painters had done studies out of doors for hundreds of years.

48
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:04,163
The idea was that Monet was making a completely finished painting

49
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:07,066
out of doors saying: this is done even though it lacked

50
00:03:07,358 --> 00:03:10,895
the kind of polish and finish expected by the academy.

51
00:03:11,142 --> 00:03:12,608
It was a mere impression.
