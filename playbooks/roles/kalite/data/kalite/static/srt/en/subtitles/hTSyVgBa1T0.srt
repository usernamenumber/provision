1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,810
   

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,820
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:03,690
Hopefully you have a
little intuition now

4
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:04,770
of what the curl is.

5
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,070
Now let's actually compute it
because if your sole goal is to

6
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,990
pass a test and not understand
the nature of the universe,

7
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,820
which I think would be sad, but
if that is your goal you at

8
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,880
least need to know how to
calculate these things.

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,700
But it's even more fun when
you have the intuition.

10
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,420
And then you'll hopefully
never forget it.

11
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,480
We'll take the curl of a
fairly fancy vector field.

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,010
One that I have trouble
visualizing but that we can

13
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,020
mathematically chug through.

14
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:35,460
So let's say our vector field--
and I'll do a three dimensional

15
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,480
vector field just to do a
fairly complicated example; I'm

16
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,505
just going to make it up on the
fly --so let's say in the

17
00:00:41,505 --> 00:00:45,545
x-direction the magnitude of
the field is, I don't know,

18
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:57,670
let's say it's x squared, y,
sine, z, in the x-direction,

19
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:06,790
plus-- I don't know --let's
make it x, y squared, z in

20
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,420
the j-direction, or
the y-direction.

21
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,410
And in the z-direction, I don't
know, let's make it cosine of

22
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:19,880
x times cosine of y,
in the z-direction.

23
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,460
Now we said that you can view
the curl of this vector field--

24
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,640
and I have no intuition of
what this vector field looks

25
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,180
like; I just made this up.

26
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,870
Maybe we'll graph it for fun
just to see how messed up it

27
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:38,440
looks --but we said this curl,
you could view it as a cross

28
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:45,230
product of our del operator
and the vector field.

29
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,990
Well, when you were using this
engineering notation, when you

30
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:53,620
have a vector broken down into
it x, y, and z components, or

31
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,130
it's i, j, and k components,
you can take the determinant of

32
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,490
that matrix-- when I showed you
how to compute the cross

33
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,620
product --to figure out
the cross product.

34
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,590
So how do we do this?

35
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:11,440
So the cross product is going
to be equal to-- I didn't have

36
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,970
to draw a straight line --so
how you take the cross product

37
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,680
of this vector field and
the gradient operator?

38
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,990
Well, you write i, j, k on top
like you're taking the cross

39
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:29,680
product of any two three
dimensional vectors, and then

40
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,100
you take the first vector-- but
it's really a vector operator,

41
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,410
but it's this del operator.

42
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,250
And what are the components
of the del operator?

43
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,270
It's the partial derivative
with respect to x, the partial

44
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:48,600
derivative with respect to y,
partial derivative with

45
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,160
respect to z, right?

46
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,750
Let me just rewrite
the del operator.

47
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,350
You can view it as being equal
to the partial with respect to

48
00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:01,750
x, i plus the partial with
respect to y, j plus the

49
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,630
partial with respect to z, k.

50
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,900
So its x, y, and z components
are the partials with respect

51
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,390
to x, with respect to
y, with respect to z.

52
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,160
And then the second, where
we're taking this operator

53
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,375
cross the vector field.

54
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,500
So what are the components
of the vector field?

55
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:25,130
I'll probably run out of space,
but it's x squared, y, sine, z.

56
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:29,940
Then here it's xy squared, z--
I should written all of this

57
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,040
bigger --and then the third
column, the z component is

58
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,980
cosine of x times cosine of y.

59
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,800
Just the x, y, and
z components.

60
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,350
And now we are ready to take
the determinant, which will

61
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,260
probably, well, it'll
probably get pretty

62
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,990
messy, but let's try it.

63
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:55,710
So this is equal to the i-unit
vector-- let me use a more

64
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:59,245
vibrant color --the i-unit
vector times it's

65
00:03:59,245 --> 00:03:59,500
subdeterminant.

66
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,740
So you cross out it's row and
column, and so you take the

67
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,540
determinant of this expression,
so it's going to be times--

68
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,130
this times this, but it's
really the partial.

69
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,400
If you multiply the partial
with respect to y operator

70
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,986
times that expression, you're
really just taking, since it's

71
00:04:14,986 --> 00:04:17,240
an operator and not an
expression, you're really just

72
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,150
going to take the partial of
this with respect to y,

73
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:19,970
but I'll write it down.

74
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:26,750
So it's going to be the partial
with respect to y of cosine x,

75
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:37,020
cosine y minus the partial with
respect to z times xy squared,

76
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:45,490
z-- and now we're on to
our j component --plus j.

77
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,800
So now what's the magnitude of
our curl in the j-direction?

78
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,860
Let's cross out the row
in the column of j.

79
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,580
So it's a partial with
respect to x of this.

80
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,130
So this is maybe messier
than I originally intended.

81
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:05,700
Cosine of x, cosine of y, cross
these columns there, minus

82
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:20,540
the partial with respect to z
of x squared, y sine of z.

83
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,370
And then finally
our k component.

84
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:28,100
Oh, and sorry, when you take
the determinant, you use that--

85
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,180
and this is all kind of a bit
of voodoo --but you put a plus

86
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,550
here, a minus here, a plus
here, so it's kind of

87
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,350
this checkered pattern.

88
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,630
To this is plus i, this
should actually be minus j.

89
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,420
Don't want to make that
mistake; this is minus j.

90
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:46,340
This is just kind of the
algorithm of how do you

91
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,180
take a determinant.

92
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,730
OK, then finally we have plus
k times the determinant

93
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:57,110
of its submatrix.

94
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:06,660
So the partial with respect to
x of this, sorry, we take out

95
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:13,040
it's row and column, so xy
squared, z minus the partial

96
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:19,190
with respect to y of this.

97
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,990
Why don't we take this row and
columns, and this is the

98
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:28,780
submatrix of x squared,
y, sine of z.

99
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,870
All right, now let me try
to simplify it, and I'll

100
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,860
have to get some space.

101
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,960
Hopefully you understood what I
did here and now we got this.

102
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,930
And now I think I can erase
all of this and just so I

103
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,840
can have some room to
simplify things in.

104
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,090
   

105
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:46,540
No, that's not what I wanted
to do; I wanted to do

106
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,570
it in a darker color.

107
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,910
That's what I wanted to do.

108
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,320
Erase that.

109
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,030
Erase that.

110
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,750
Now we just have to simplify
it, taking a bunch of

111
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,260
partial derivatives.

112
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:02,630
What's the partial derivative
of this with respect to y?

113
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:08,320
Well, x is just a constant, so
it's going to be-- well, we can

114
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,480
just put the i out front, but
eventually we want to write our

115
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,350
magnitude before the vector
--so it's i times the partial

116
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,720
of this with respect to
y with our constant.

117
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,850
Cosine of x is just a constant.

118
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,800
And then what's the derivative
of this with respect to y?

119
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,090
It's minus sine of y.

120
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:30,550
So we'll write sine of y, and
let's put the minus out front;

121
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,170
these are what's multiplied.

122
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:39,310
OK, and then we have minus, now
we stick the partial with

123
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:42,180
respect-- sorry, actually,
I forgot to do this part.

124
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,510
Let me start over, actually.

125
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:49,050
So let me just take this
expression and I'll

126
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:49,635
multiply it by i.

127
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:55,180
The partial of this with
respect to y is cosine of x

128
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,590
times minus sine of y-- let's
put the minus out front

129
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,760
--minus sine of y.

130
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,290
   

131
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:05,080
Now minus the partial of
this with respect to z.

132
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,780
Well the partial of this with
respect to z, xy squared

133
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,110
is just a constant, right?

134
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,560
So the partial of this
with respect to z

135
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,530
is just xy squared.

136
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:18,360
So minus xy squared, and then
we're going to have all of

137
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,270
that; that's the magnitude
in our i-direction.

138
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:27,170
And now we have minus-- because
minus in the j-direction

139
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,490
--what's the partial derivative
of this with respect to x?

140
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,483
Well, the partial of cosine
of x with respect to

141
00:08:32,483 --> 00:08:33,779
x is minus sine of x.

142
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:37,470
   

143
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,970
And cosine of y is just
a constant, so it just

144
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:43,080
carries over, cosine of y.

145
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,240
And then that should be-- oh,
there we go --minus this

146
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,350
expression, the partial of
this with respect to z.

147
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,780
Well, the derivative of
sine of z with respect

148
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,960
to z is cosine of z.

149
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,660
This is just a constant,
so it's minus x squared,

150
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,670
y, cosine of z.

151
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,160
And that's the magnitude
in the j-direction.

152
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,500
We're almost there.

153
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,030
And now finally, plus,
what's the partial of

154
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,990
this with respect to x?

155
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:17,480
Well, these are just constants,
so it's y squared, z minus--

156
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,600
once again, we just have a y
term; everything else is a

157
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,680
constant --so the partial
with respect to y is

158
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,250
x squared, sine of z.

159
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:31,962
And that's the magnitude
in our k-direction.

160
00:09:31,962 --> 00:09:33,300
And we're pretty much done.

161
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,570
I mean we can simplify
it a little bit just

162
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,280
to make it clean.

163
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,420
And essentially we could just,
I don't have to rewrite it,

164
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,130
we can just multiply
this by negative 1.

165
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,940
So then this becomes
plus, plus, plus.

166
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,310
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

167
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:52,050
This is the curl of the
vector field v at any

168
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,450
point x, y, and z.

169
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,590
So that's how you calculate it.

170
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:59,810
You just literally take the
cross product of that del

171
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:02,020
operator and your vector field.

172
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,350
And you'll get something fairly
hairy, although this was, I

173
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,700
think, a hairier than
average problem.

174
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,320
In the next video, we'll do a
little bit of this, but I think

175
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,120
it'll give you more intuition
and less of just the algorithm

176
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,020
and the computation
of how do you do it.

177
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,100
So you in the next video.
