1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,790
   

2
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:01,760
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:02,980
I'm now going to introduce
you to the

4
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,310
concepts of work and energy.

5
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,490
And these are two words that
are-- I'm sure you use in your

6
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,220
everyday life already and
you have some notion

7
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,760
of what they mean.

8
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,690
But maybe just not in the
physics context, although

9
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,340
they're not completely
unrelated.

10
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,400
So work, you know
what work is.

11
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,280
Work is when you do something.

12
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,870
You go to work, you
make a living.

13
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,480
In physics, work is-- and I'm
going to use a lot of words

14
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,500
and they actually end up being
kind of circular in their

15
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,350
definitions.

16
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,220
But I think when we start doing
the math, you'll start

17
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,450
to get at least a slightly more
intuitive notion of what

18
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,250
they all are.

19
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,580
So work is energy transferred
by a force.

20
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,910
So I'll write that down, energy
transferred-- and I got

21
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,480
this from Wikipedia because
I wanted a good, I guess,

22
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,780
relatively intuitive
definition.

23
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,880
Energy transferred by a force.

24
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,360
And that makes reasonable
sense to me.

25
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,590
But then you're wondering, well,
I know what a force is,

26
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,400
you know, force is mass
times acceleration.

27
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,670
But what is energy?

28
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,069
And then I looked up energy on
Wikipedia and I found this,

29
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:05,190
well, entertaining.

30
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,560
But it also I think tells you
something that these are just

31
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,770
concepts that we use to, I
guess, work with what we

32
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,900
perceive as motion and force
and work and all of these

33
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,630
types of things.

34
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:22,160
But they really aren't
independent notions.

35
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,380
They're related.

36
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,150
So Wikipedia defines energy
as the ability to do work.

37
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,430
So they kind of use each other
to define each other.

38
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,090
Ability to do work.

39
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,360
Which is frankly, as good of a
definition as I could find.

40
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,520
And so, with just the words,
these kind of don't give you

41
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,390
much information.

42
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,690
So what I'm going to do is move
onto the equations, and

43
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,000
this'll give you a more
quantitative feel of what

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,540
these words mean.

45
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:55,470
So the definition of work in
mechanics, work is equal to

46
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,665
force times distance.

47
00:01:58,665 --> 00:02:01,890
   

48
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,030
So let's say that I have a block
and-- let me do it in a

49
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,720
different color just
because this yellow

50
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,540
might be getting tedious.

51
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:11,840
And I apply a force of--
let's say I apply

52
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,740
a force of 10 Newtons.

53
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:22,390
And I move that block
by applying

54
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,210
a force of 10 Newtons.

55
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,770
I move that block, let's
say I move it-- I

56
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,960
don't know-- 7 meters.

57
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,930
So the work that I applied to
that block, or the energy that

58
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:42,650
I've transferred to that block,
the work is equal to

59
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:46,880
the force, which is 10 Newtons,
times the distance,

60
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,300
times 7 meters.

61
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:54,150
And that would equal 70-- 10
times 7-- Newton meters.

62
00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:00,450
So Newton meters is one, I
guess, way of describing work.

63
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,720
And this is also defined
as one joule.

64
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,340
And I'll do another presentation
on all of the

65
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,230
things that soon.

66
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:06,920
Joule did.

67
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,170
But joule is the unit
of work and it's

68
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,540
also the unit of energy.

69
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,650
And they're kind of
transferrable.

70
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,380
Because if you look at the
definitions that Wikipedia

71
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,620
gave us, work is energy
transferred by a force and

72
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,880
energy is the ability to work.

73
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,900
So I'll leave this relatively
circular definition alone now.

74
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,680
But we'll use this definition,
which I think helps us a

75
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,710
little bit more to understand
the types of work we can do.

76
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,680
And then, what kind of energy
we actually are transferring

77
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,380
to an object when we do
that type of work.

78
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,025
So let me do some examples.

79
00:03:40,025 --> 00:03:42,960
   

80
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,225
Let's say I have a block.

81
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:49,120
   

82
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,290
I have a block of mass m.

83
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:57,610
I have a block of mass m and it
starts at rest. And then I

84
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,200
apply force.

85
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:09,070
Let's say I apply a force, F,
for a distance of, I think,

86
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,850
you can guess what the distance
I'm going to apply it

87
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,380
is, for a distance of d.

88
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:17,500
So I'm pushing on this block
with a force of F for a

89
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,540
distance of d.

90
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,290
And what I want to figure
out is-- well, we know

91
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,610
what the work is.

92
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:27,630
I mean, by definition, work is
equal to this force times this

93
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,480
distance that I'm applying
the block-- that

94
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,930
I'm pushing the block.

95
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,030
But what is the velocity going
to be of this block over here?

96
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:36,620
Right?

97
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,320
It's going to be something
somewhat faster.

98
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,270
Because force isn't-- and I'm
assuming that this is

99
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,570
frictionless on here.

100
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:48,040
So force isn't just moving
the block with a constant

101
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,420
velocity, force is equal to
mass times acceleration.

102
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,430
So I'm actually going to be
accelerating the block.

103
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,390
So even though it's stationary
here, by the time we get to

104
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,960
this point over here,
that block is going

105
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,290
to have some velocity.

106
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,200
We don't know what it is
because we're using all

107
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,550
variables, we're not
using numbers.

108
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,650
But let's figure out what
it is in terms of v.

109
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:10,980
So if you remember your
kinematics equations, and if

110
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,120
you don't, you might
want to go back.

111
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,060
Or if you've never seen the
videos, there's a whole set of

112
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,380
videos on projectile motion
and kinematics.

113
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,170
But we figured out that when
we're accelerating an object

114
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:23,400
over a distance, that the final
velocity-- let me change

115
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,910
colors just for variety-- the
final velocity squared is

116
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,850
equal to the initial velocity
squared plus 2 times the

117
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,530
acceleration times
the distance.

118
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,210
And we proved this back then,
so I won't redo it now.

119
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,640
But in this situation, what's
the initial velocity?

120
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,525
Well the initial
velocity was 0.

121
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:43,250
   

122
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,160
Right?

123
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,026
So the equation becomes vf
squared is equal to 2 times

124
00:05:50,026 --> 00:05:54,990
the acceleration times
the distance.

125
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,830
And then, we could rewrite
the acceleration

126
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,180
in terms of, what?

127
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,050
The force and the mass, right?

128
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,010
So what is the acceleration?

129
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,260
Well F equals ma.

130
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,310
   

131
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:12,450
Or, acceleration is equal to
force divided by you mass.

132
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:18,910
So we get vf squared is equal
to 2 times the force divided

133
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:22,360
by the mass times
the distance.

134
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,930
And then we could take the
square root of both sides if

135
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,930
we want, and we get the final
velocity of this block, at

136
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:37,140
this point, is going to be equal
to the square root of 2

137
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:41,780
times force times distance
divided by mass.

138
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,760
And so that's how we could
figure it out.

139
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,000
And there's something
interesting going on here.

140
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,060
There's something interesting
in what we did just now.

141
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,160
Do you see something that looks
a little bit like work?

142
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,910
Well sure.

143
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,570
You have this force
times distance

144
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,090
expression right here.

145
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,660
Force times distance
right here.

146
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,290
So let's write another
equation.

147
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:07,380
If we know the given amount of
velocity something has, if we

148
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,590
can figure out how much work
needed to be put into the

149
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,580
system to get to
that velocity.

150
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,135
Well we can just replace force
times distance with work.

151
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:15,690
Right?

152
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,370
Because work is equal to
force times distance.

153
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,905
So let's go straight from this
equation because we don't have

154
00:07:20,905 --> 00:07:22,200
to re-square it.

155
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:27,670
So we get vf squared
is equal to 2

156
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,370
times force times distance.

157
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,150
That's work.

158
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,230
Took that definition
right here.

159
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:37,630
2 times work divided
by the mass.

160
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,870
Let's multiply both sides of
this equation times the mass.

161
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:44,150
So you get mass times
the velocity.

162
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,290
And we don't have to write-- I'm
going to get rid of this f

163
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,530
because we know that we started
at rest and that the

164
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,180
velocity is going to be--
let's just call it v.

165
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:56,390
So m times V squared is equal
to 2 times the work.

166
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,090
Divide both sides by 2.

167
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:03,380
Or that the work is equal
to mv squared over 2.

168
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,860
Just divided both sides by 2.

169
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,880
And of course, the unit
here is joules.

170
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,570
So this is interesting.

171
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:16,840
Now if I know the velocity of
an object, I can figure out,

172
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,590
using this formula, which
hopefully wasn't too

173
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,200
complicated to derive.

174
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,110
I can figure out how much work
was imputed into that object

175
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,790
to get it to that velocity.

176
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:31,270
And this, by definition, is
called kinetic energy.

177
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,500
This is kinetic energy.

178
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,760
And once again, the definition
that Wikipedia gives us is the

179
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,190
energy due to motion, or the
work needed to accelerate from

180
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,179
an object from being stationary

181
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,980
to its current velocity.

182
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,490
And I'm actually almost out of
time, but what I will do is I

183
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:51,550
will leave you with this
formula, that kinetic energy

184
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,600
is mass times velocity
squared divided by

185
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,780
2, or 1/2 mv squared.

186
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,150
It's a very common formula.

187
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,030
And I'll leave you with
that and that

188
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,660
is one form of energy.

189
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,680
And I'll leave you
with that idea.

190
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,390
And in the next video,
I will show you

191
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,690
another form of energy.

192
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,560
And then, I will introduce
you to the law of

193
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,590
conservation of energy.

194
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,220
And that's where things become
useful, because you can see

195
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,730
how one form of energy can be
converted to another to figure

196
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,190
out what happens to an object.

197
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,640
I'll see

198
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,500
