1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,750
   

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,220
Let's say we're in R2.

3
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,130
Let me graph it.

4
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:06,085
Let me draw my vertical
axis, just like that.

5
00:00:06,085 --> 00:00:09,220
And then let me draw
my horizontal

6
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,870
axis, just like that.

7
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:20,890
And let's say I have
a vector 1, 2.

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,610
So my vector looks like this,
1, and then we go up 2.

9
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,230
So my vector looks like this.

10
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,110
Let me draw it.

11
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,370
That is my vector.

12
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,080
It's the vector 1, 2.

13
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,650
And I want to look at
the line that is

14
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,200
spanned by this vector.

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,340
So let me just define some line
L, and it's equal to the

16
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:47,850
set of t times 1, 2, where
t is any real number.

17
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,930
So this is just a line with
a slope of 2, right?

18
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,185
You rise 2 for every
1 you go over.

19
00:00:53,185 --> 00:00:57,270
So let me draw my line
just like this.

20
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,520
There's nothing new
at this point.

21
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,220
Let me draw it a little
bit better than that.

22
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,569
There you go.

23
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:06,230
And it keeps going, because
obviously, you could get

24
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,150
negative multiples of my vector,
and it also goes here.

25
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,230
If you look at all the points
that are specified by all of

26
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,750
the scaled up or scaled down or
negative scaled versions of

27
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,880
this vector, you're going to
get all the points on this

28
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,640
line if you draw those vectors
in standard position.

29
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,540
So this is my line
right there.

30
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,050
Now, I want to construct a
linear transformation that

31
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:29,730
reflects around this line.

32
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:33,660
For example, if I have
this vector-- let me

33
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,570
draw it like this.

34
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:37,480
Let's say I have that vector
that specifies that point

35
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,710
right there.

36
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,490
Let me call that vector x.

37
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:44,770
I want the transformation of
x to be essentially the

38
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,540
reflection of x around
this line.

39
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,410
So if I go in this direction
right here, I want this to be

40
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,520
the transformation.

41
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,885
I want that to be the
transformation of x, so it

42
00:01:55,885 --> 00:01:57,300
should look just like that.

43
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,840
I'll do another example.

44
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,935
Let's say I have this vector.

45
00:02:00,935 --> 00:02:03,570
   

46
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,250
Let me give you a particular
vector.

47
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,229
Let's say I have a vector that's
orthogonal to my line.

48
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:11,039
So let's say I have the vector,
I'll call it v1.

49
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,150
And let's see, something that's
orthogonal to it, I can

50
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,750
switch these two guys and make
one of them negative.

51
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:22,040
So if I go to the vector 2,
minus 1, so if I have this

52
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,850
vector right here, visually
it looks orthogonal.

53
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,380
So if I have v2-- let
me call it v1.

54
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:36,780
v1 is equal to 2 minus 1.

55
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,700
Visually, it looks orthogonal,
but then even if you actually

56
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,670
take the dot product 2 times 1
plus minus 1 times 2, that's

57
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,270
going to be equal to 0.

58
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,450
So this is definitely orthogonal
to my spanning

59
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,290
vector, so it's definitely
orthogonal to every

60
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,560
point on that line.

61
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,820
But if I apply the
transformation to this guy

62
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,130
right here, I'm just going
to flip it over the line.

63
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,240
So let me draw it like this.

64
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,160
So it's going to be equal to--
it's just going to look like--

65
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,300
let me do it in a green color.

66
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,360
So the transformation of this
guy, I'm just flipping him

67
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,030
over this line.

68
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,060
I'm finding the reflection
across line L.

69
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:13,360
So this is going to be the
transformation of v1, and it

70
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,430
would be-- we don't know what
the actual transformation

71
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,340
matrix is and that's actually
going to be the subject of

72
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,000
this video, but if you just
look at the transformation

73
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,570
just for v1, it's going to be
the negative of that, so it's

74
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:30,770
going to be minus 2, 1.

75
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,550
So I know I want to define
this transformation.

76
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:39,240
I know I want to define this
transformation from R2 to R2.

77
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,240
That is a reflection.

78
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:53,070
So the transformation of some
vector x is the reflection of

79
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:58,770
x around or across, or however
you want to describe it,

80
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:02,660
around line L, around L.

81
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,470
Now, in the past, if we wanted
to find the transformation

82
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,033
matrix-- we know this is a
linear transformation.

83
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:11,430
I don't have to go through all
of the exercise of this is a

84
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,580
linear transformation.

85
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,380
But in the past, if we wanted
to find the transformation

86
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,370
matrix for a linear
transformation, let's say we

87
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:22,130
say T of x is equal to some
2-by-2 matrix, because it's a

88
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,590
mapping from R2 to R2 times x.

89
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,110
Before in the past to find A, we
would say A is equal to the

90
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:36,180
transformation applied to our
first standard basis vector,

91
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,040
so the transformation
applied to 1, 0.

92
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,180
And then our second column in A
would be the transformation

93
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,750
applied to 0, 1.

94
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,690
And if we were dealing in Rn,
we would do this n times and

95
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,420
we would have the
n basis vectors.

96
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,940
We've seen this multiple,
multiple times.

97
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,290
Now, in the past, when we
were constructing these

98
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,440
transformation matrices, finding
these things were

99
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,300
pretty straightforward, but
you'll see now it's not that

100
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,010
straightforward.

101
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:08,620
If I have 1, 0, if I have the
vector 1, 0, finding its

102
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,380
transformation, if I were to
flip it over, it's going to

103
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,310
look something like this.

104
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,440
And we could do it if we were
creative with our geometry and

105
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,260
our trigonometry.

106
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,860
We could actually figure this
number out, and we could

107
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,910
figure this number out.

108
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:28,130
If I were to flip 0, 1
over, it might look

109
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,110
something like that.

110
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,975
We could figure it out,
but it's not easy.

111
00:05:30,975 --> 00:05:33,120
So let me just write
this down.

112
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,110
It's not easy.

113
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,220
And we want to at least-- I
mean, you know, we could do

114
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,340
this if we had to, but if
there's an easier way, we

115
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,570
should at least be exposed
to that easier way.

116
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,500
So you might have
an insight here.

117
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,670
We've been talking about
alternate coordinate systems,

118
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,690
and this transformation, it
looks difficult in our

119
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,870
standard coordinate system,
because we're reflecting

120
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,010
around this line right there.

121
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,410
But what if we defined a
coordinate system where

122
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,490
reflection around this line
was more natural?

123
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,610
And you might already see an
interesting coordinate system.

124
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:10,430
What if we had a coordinate
system with v1 as one of the

125
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:15,040
basis vectors and then 1, 2
as the other basis vector?

126
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,070
   

127
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,180
Then, all of a sudden, at
least in that coordinate

128
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,340
system, the reflection wouldn't
be around this

129
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,220
inclined line.

130
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,550
The reflection would be around
the second coordinate's axis.

131
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,710
It seems like it would be a more
natural transformation.

132
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,240
So this leads us to a very
interesting thing.

133
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,390
Let me review what we've done in
the last couple of videos.

134
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,020
In the last couple of videos,
we could say, look, if we're

135
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:44,150
in standard coordinates, you
multiply by some matrix A and

136
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,920
you get the transformation
of x.

137
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,390
We've seen that multiple
times.

138
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,300
This is in standard
coordinates.

139
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,640
And we've also seen that we
could change our coordinates.

140
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,480
We can get coordinates with
respect to some other basis.

141
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,740
We can multiply x times C
inverse and then we'll get the

142
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,980
representation of x or in
coordinates with respect to

143
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:05,750
some other basis, and then we
can multiply that times some

144
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,800
other matrix D.

145
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:14,130
And we've seen-- let me write
this down-- that D is equal to

146
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:18,120
C inverse times A times C.

147
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,760
We showed this I think it was
two or three videos ago, where

148
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,395
C is just the change
of basis matrix.

149
00:07:24,395 --> 00:07:27,330
C is just the matrix
that has our new

150
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,040
basis vectors as columns.

151
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,080
And C inverse is obviously
its inverse.

152
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,790
So we can apply D.

153
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:37,300
And then if we multiply D
times this B coordinate

154
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:43,750
version of x, we will get the
B coordinate version of the

155
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,970
transformation of x, so the
transformation of x

156
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,640
represented in B coordinates.

157
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,440
And then, you know, you could
convert back and forth between

158
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:52,970
these guys.

159
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,283
You could go this way if you
multiply by C inverse.

160
00:07:55,283 --> 00:07:58,030
You could go that way
if you multiply C.

161
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,030
We've seen this in
multiple videos.

162
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:03,140
Now, in this particular case
that we're dealing with, I

163
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,680
want to find A.

164
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,330
I've kind of defined my
transformation in kind of

165
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,850
touchy-feely terms. I've just
verbally defined it, but I

166
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:14,170
would like to have a
transformation matrix with

167
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,500
respect to my standard basis.

168
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,190
But I just showed you
that it's not easy.

169
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,960
I'll have to break out some
serious geometry and

170
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,480
trigonometry to figure out what
happens to 1, 0 when I

171
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,540
reflect around the line
spanned by 1, 2.

172
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,640
It's not easy.

173
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,180
But what if we change basis?

174
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,030
What if we change basis
to some new basis?

175
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:36,760
Let's say we define some new
basis, where our spanning

176
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,940
vectors or our basis vectors are
this guy, are the vectors

177
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,150
2, 1, and the vectors 1, 2.

178
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,890
   

179
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:50,240
So you can almost view that
our new horizontal axis--

180
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,990
obviously, it's not horizontal,
but if you want to

181
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,450
think of it this way-- is going
to be like that, and our

182
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,360
new vertical axis
is like this.

183
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,880
And now in this world, our
transformation is just a

184
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,520
reflection around our
new vertical axis.

185
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:09,720
So maybe it'll be easier to find
D, because this might be

186
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,570
a simpler transformation in this
other coordinate system.

187
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,020
And then if we can find D,
then we can solve for A.

188
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,810
We've seen this.

189
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:22,310
A is just equal to C times
D times C inverse.

190
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,950
I showed that to you a
couple of videos ago.

191
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:28,455
So let's see if it's
easier to find D.

192
00:09:28,455 --> 00:09:34,030
So let's just experiment
a little bit.

193
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,260
Let's label our transformation
vectors.

194
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,770
Let's say this is-- or
our basis vectors.

195
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:39,820
Let's say that's v1.

196
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,990
That's the same label I applied
to it over here.

197
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:45,030
Let's say that this spanning
vector right here of our line

198
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,620
that we're reflecting around,
let's call that v2.

199
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,560
So our new coordinate
system has the basis

200
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,910
vectors v1 and v2.

201
00:09:52,910 --> 00:10:05,930
Now, what is v1 represented
in our new basis?

202
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:09,430
Remember, when you transfer to
a new basis, all it means is

203
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:12,560
how much do your coordinates--
your first coordinate now is

204
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,700
going to be-- how much of your
first basis vector do you need

205
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,990
to get a linear combination
of v1 and how much

206
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:19,860
of your second one?

207
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:30,760
Well, v1-- is just equal to 1
times v1 plus 0 times v2.

208
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,050
I mean, if I wanted to, I
could've found C inverse and

209
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,280
multiplied by it, but it's
almost trivial to find the

210
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,430
linear combination of your basis
vectors that gets v1.

211
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,560
In fact, it's not almost
trivial, it is trivial.

212
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,360
v1 is 1 times v1 plus
0 times v2.

213
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,940
So its coordinates with respect
to the basis B are

214
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:53,940
going to be 1 times v1
plus 0 times v2.

215
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:54,910
Fair enough.

216
00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:01,520
Now, what is D going to be?

217
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,590
Let's see.

218
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:05,000
Let's say we want to find D
first, because if we can find

219
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,510
D, then we can just apply this
formula here to figure out A.

220
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:17,030
Now, let's just say D is
equal to-- it's going

221
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,210
to be a 2-by-2 vector.

222
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,890
It's still mapping
from R2 to R2.

223
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,540
This is still a two-dimensional
space.

224
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,700
This is going to map within this
two-dimensional space.

225
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:30,730
So let's say D has just two
column vectors d1 and

226
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,740
d2, just like that.

227
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,690
So what is D times this
going to give us?

228
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:40,040
So let me write it this way.

229
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,380
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

230
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,400
I'd like to show that little
chart right there.

231
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:51,830
But D times the B coordinate
version of our first basis

232
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:57,030
vector is going to be equal to
d1, d2-- those are the two

233
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:05,420
columns of D-- d1, d2 times v1
in B coordinates, right?

234
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,800
So it's times 1, 0.

235
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,770
Now, what is this going
to be equal to?

236
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:14,870
Well, this is just going
to be a linear

237
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,155
combination of these columns.

238
00:12:16,155 --> 00:12:23,180
So it's going to be 1 times d1
plus 0 times d2, which is just

239
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:26,720
d1, so it's the first
column of this.

240
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,160
But what is that also
going to equal?

241
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,750
If I multiply D times the B
coordinate version of x, I've

242
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,600
just gotten the B coordinate
version of the

243
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,550
transformation of x.

244
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:46,260
So this is going to be equal to
the B coordinate version of

245
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:52,730
the transformation of v1.

246
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,540
If you just put a v1 here
instead of an x, v1's B

247
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,480
version, right there, times D
is going to be equal to the

248
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,940
transformation of v1's B version
Or its coordinates

249
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,040
with respect to B.

250
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,430
So it's just that thing
right there.

251
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:11,520
   

252
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,510
So there's a couple of
interesting things here.

253
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:17,540
We just got that the first
column, just by applying D

254
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,280
times this has got to be equal
to this, we just figured out

255
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,290
that the first column of D,
because if you take this times

256
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:30,260
1, 0, which is the first basis
vector's representation in its

257
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,880
own basis, and you're going to
see in general that when you

258
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,670
represent these basis vectors
in their own basis, they're

259
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,660
going to look just like your
standard basis vectors in this

260
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,030
new coordinate system.

261
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:43,240
So when you represented 2, 1 in
your new basis with respect

262
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,850
to this, of course, it's 1 times
this plus 0 times this.

263
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,330
It's going to be 1, 0.

264
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:52,760
If you want to represent
v2 in your new basis,

265
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,550
well, what is it?

266
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,410
It's 0 times this guy plus
1 times this guy.

267
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,790
It's 0 times v1 plus
1 times v2.

268
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,690
So it's going to be 0, 1.

269
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,510
And you're going to see this
is generally the case.

270
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,050
And when you think about it,
it's almost ridiculously

271
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:09,550
obvious that the first basis
vector is going be 1 times the

272
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,510
first basis vector plus 0 times
the second basis vector.

273
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:15,050
And if you had n basis vectors,
it would be 1 times

274
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:18,360
the first basis vector plus 0
times all of the other ones.

275
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:24,990
And in general, if you're
dealing with the nth basis

276
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:29,340
vector and you want to express
it in your basis, you're

277
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,870
essentially going to have a
bunch of the zeroes all the

278
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,460
way-- because it's 1 times your
nth basis vector, and

279
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,790
then everything else
is zeroes, so

280
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,600
this'll be the nth term.

281
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,290
So this applies generally, or
you could called this en, if

282
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,310
you want to call your standard
basis vectors that way.

283
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,440
This is a bit of an aside.

284
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,800
I just want to show you that
this idea is generalizable.

285
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,140
Now, what's useful about this?

286
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,725
Well, just applying this little
logic, D times this guy

287
00:14:57,725 --> 00:15:01,480
is that guy, we figured out that
the first column of D is

288
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,580
equal to the transformation
applied to our first basis

289
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,510
vector in B coordinates.

290
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:12,230
So if I wanted to rewrite D, I
could rewrite D like this.

291
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:16,610
The first column is d1, which
is the same thing as the

292
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:24,250
transformation applied to v1,
our first basis vector, in B

293
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,340
coordinates.

294
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,770
Now, what is d2?

295
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,480
Well, let's do the same
thing to v2, to our

296
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,690
second basis vector.

297
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:40,940
So if I multiply D times the
second basis vector v2 in B

298
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,150
coordinates, in our new
coordinate system, that is

299
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:50,425
equal to d1, d2 times-- what is
this guy's representation

300
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:51,640
in our new coordinate system?

301
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,140
It's 0 times v1, plus
1 times v2.

302
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,810
It's 0, 1.

303
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:57,640
I wrote it up here.

304
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,470
It's 0, 1.

305
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:05,920
So this is going to be equal to
0 times d1 plus 1 times d2,

306
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,320
which is equal to d2.

307
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,450
And what is that going
to be equal to?

308
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:13,260
If you multiply D times some B
coordinate representation of

309
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,240
x, you're going to get the B
coordinate representation of

310
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,680
the transformation of x.

311
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,340
So this is going to be equal
to the B coordinate

312
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,950
representation of the
transformation of v2.

313
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,480
   

314
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,460
And just like that, we see that
column 2 in D, the second

315
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,320
column, so this was the first
column, the second column in D

316
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,580
is just this guy.

317
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:45,985
It's the transformation of
v2 in B coordinates.

318
00:16:45,985 --> 00:16:49,250
   

319
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,810
Now, is this any easier to find
than this stuff up here?

320
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,670
Remember, before, we said,
hey, if we just apply the

321
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:57,550
transformation to the standard
basis vectors, we can get the

322
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,400
standard transformation or we
can find the transformation

323
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,630
matrix with respect to the
standard basis, and that's all

324
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,370
we wanted to do.

325
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,060
And we said that's not easy.

326
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,490
Is this any easier?

327
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:13,020
Well, what is the transformation
of v1?

328
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,890
Let's go back to our original
transformation definition.

329
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,630
This is v1 right here.

330
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:25,400
The transformation of v1 ended
up being minus v1.

331
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,710
It equals minus v1.

332
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:34,870
So if we wanted to write the
transformation of v1 in B

333
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:39,130
coordinates-- so let me
write this right here.

334
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:44,890
So the transformation of v1,
if I wanted to reflect it

335
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,820
around the line L, it just
was equal to minus v1.

336
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,530
That's because v1 was orthogonal
to the line, right?

337
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,700
That's why we picked it.

338
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,455
If you just take the
transformation of this guy, it

339
00:17:53,455 --> 00:17:56,610
just flips over and you get
the minus of the vector.

340
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:00,220
So what is this guy, if we want
to apply it, if we wanted

341
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,266
to write this in
B coordinates?

342
00:18:02,266 --> 00:18:06,580
   

343
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:13,940
Well, minus v1 is just equal
to minus 1 times v1

344
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,380
plus 0 times v2.

345
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,540
So minus v1's coordinates, in
B coordinates, they're just

346
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:25,260
going to be equal to minus 1
times v1 plus 0 times v2.

347
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,130
Remember, these are just the
weights on your basis vector.

348
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,950
So this thing right here is
pretty straightforward.

349
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:35,810
This is just going to be equal
to minus 1 and 0, the first

350
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:36,960
column of D.

351
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,340
Now, what's the second
column of D?

352
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,660
It's the transformation of v2.

353
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,170
v2 was the vector that
spanned our line.

354
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:46,220
This is v2 right here.

355
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,140
So what happens to v2 when
you transform it?

356
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,790
Well, you take the reflection
of something that's on the

357
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,990
line, around that line, it's
just going to be the same.

358
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:53,980
Nothing's going to change.

359
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,390
You're taking a reflection
around this.

360
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,330
You can kind of imagine spinning
that vector, but it's

361
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,600
not going to change the
vector at all, right?

362
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,430
So the transformation of this
guy, of 1, 2, is just

363
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,830
going to be 1, 2.

364
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:11,550
The transformation of v2 is just
going to be equal to v2.

365
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,030
Let me write that down.

366
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:19,060
The transformation of v2 is just
going to be equal to v2.

367
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,910
As you can see, we've picked
these basis vectors because

368
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,820
transforming them was
very natural.

369
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,320
It was very easy.

370
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,060
So what about this guy, if I
wanted to represent this guy

371
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,970
in B coordinates?

372
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:34,050
Well, v2 in B coordinates, we
already figured out is 0, 1.

373
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,790
So this is just going
to be 0, 1.

374
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:41,500
So now we have our
transformation matrix D with

375
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,340
respect to basis B.

376
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,440
It is equal to the
transformation of our first

377
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,640
basis vector with respect to
the B coordinates, which is

378
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,940
minus 1, 0.

379
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,210
And then its second column is
the transformation of our

380
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:59,630
second basis vector with respect
to B coordinates, so

381
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,730
it's 0, 1, or the B coordinate
representation of the

382
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:05,300
transformation of our
second basis vector.

383
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,950
The language can get convoluted
sometimes.

384
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,030
And that was neat.

385
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,010
That was easy.

386
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,980
We now have solved for D.

387
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,470
And now that we've solved for
D, you notice that changing

388
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:17,520
the basis was actually very
natural, and it was very easy

389
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,020
to find what D is.

390
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,360
And now that we know what D is,
we can now solve for A.

391
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,060
We can now solve for the
transformation matrix with

392
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,210
respect to the standard basis.

393
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:30,560
So to do that, we have to figure
out C and C inverse.

394
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,750
So C, remember, C is just the
change of basis matrix.

395
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:38,020
   

396
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,160
And all that is is the
basis vectors.

397
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,290
It's just a matrix with the
basis vectors in the column.

398
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:46,030
So we have our basis
right here.

399
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:50,050
So C is just 2, 1 and 1, 2.

400
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,210
And then what is C inverse?

401
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:58,200
C inverse is equal to-- well,
we have to find that this

402
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,470
guy's determinant, so it's
2 times 2, which is 4.

403
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,630
4 minus 1 times 1, so it's 3.

404
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:08,960
So we do one over the
determinant, 1/3, times-- you

405
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,170
swap these dudes right here.

406
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:14,290
So this becomes a 2 and a 2,
and then you make these two

407
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,530
guys negative.

408
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:17,390
Negative 1, negative 1.

409
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,360
That's C inverse.

410
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,010
So now we're ready
to solve for A.

411
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,910
   

412
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:27,410
So A is going to be equal-- let
me pick a nice color here.

413
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:39,310
A is going to be equal to C,
which is 2, 1; 1, 2 times D.

414
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:50,320
D is minus 1, 0; 0, 1 times C
inverse, which is 1/3, 2 minus

415
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,030
1; minus 1, 2.

416
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,510
So let's solve this.

417
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:58,410
Let's just do some matrix-matrix
products.

418
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:02,620
So let's do these two guys
first. And so what do we get?

419
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,850
We're going to get
a 2-by-2 matrix.

420
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:09,680
We get 2 times minus 1 plus 1
times 0, so this is just going

421
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,090
to be minus 2.

422
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:16,790
And then here, you get 2 times
0 plus 1 times 1, so you're

423
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,250
just going to get 1, right?

424
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,590
2 times 0 plus 1 times 1.

425
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,920
And then here, 1 times minus
1 plus 2 times 0.

426
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,500
That's just minus 1.

427
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,175
And then you get 1 times
0 plus 2 times 1.

428
00:22:29,175 --> 00:22:31,030
That's just 2.

429
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,460
And now we're going to have
to multiply this times

430
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,870
this guy over here.

431
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,970
Let me put the 1/3 out
front, so we can

432
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:38,020
worry about that later.

433
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:42,040
And then let me multiply times
this, so times 2, minus 1;

434
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,120
minus 1, 2.

435
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,110
And all of this is going
to be equal to A.

436
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,060
I'll do it in yellow.

437
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,350
So this is going to be another
2-by-2 matrix.

438
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:57,830
And so we get negative 2 times
2, which is minus 4.

439
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,080
Let me write out, so I
don't make careless

440
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,420
mistakes Minus 4.

441
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:06,560
Minus 2 times 2 plus 1 times
minus 1, so minus 1.

442
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,320
That's that term right there.

443
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,470
The next term is minus 2 times
minus 1, which is 2 plus 1

444
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:15,420
times 2, so plus 2.

445
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,550
And then let's do this term.

446
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:22,380
Minus 1 times 2 is minus
2 plus 2 times minus 1,

447
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,000
which is minus 2.

448
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,040
And then finally we have minus
1 times minus 1, which is 1,

449
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,840
plus 2 times 2.

450
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,955
1 plus 4.

451
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:35,440
Let me make sure I
did that right.

452
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,840
Minus 2 times 2 as minus 4,
1 times minus 1-- yeah,

453
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,000
I think I got it.

454
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,370
And, of course, we have a 1/3
out front, so this is going to

455
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:46,460
be equal to 1/3 times
the matrix.

456
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:53,960
Minus 4 minus 1 is minus
5, 4; minus 4, and 5.

457
00:23:53,960 --> 00:24:04,560
Or it is equal to minus 5/3,
4/3, minus 4/3, and 5/3.

458
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:09,470
That is our transformation
matrix A with respect to the

459
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,950
standard basis.

460
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,110
Now, let me check something,
because I have a suspicion

461
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,720
because I did this before, and I
don't have what I did before

462
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,100
in front of me, but I think
I got a different answer.

463
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,870
So let me just make sure
I did this correctly.

464
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:24,880
So C, these are our basis
vectors right there.

465
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,340
Let's see, our basis vectors
were the vectors-- oh, well,

466
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,330
our first basis vector was
the vector 2 minus 1.

467
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,820
So that's where my
error came from.

468
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:37,220
My first basis vector was the
vector 2 minus 1 and my second

469
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,670
basis vector is the
vector 2, 1.

470
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:44,640
So that obviously is going
to change my C.

471
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,270
It won't change anything else,
because we really didn't use

472
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,580
this information
anywhere else.

473
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:53,380
So it's going to be 2, minus
1, so C is 2, minus 1.

474
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:57,480
So C inverse, let's see, the
determinant is going to be 2

475
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:03,075
times 2, which is 4 minus
1 times 1, so it's going

476
00:25:03,075 --> 00:25:04,400
to be 4 plus 1.

477
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,210
So this is going to be a 5.

478
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,235
Sorry for the error.

479
00:25:07,235 --> 00:25:09,200
And then we're going to
switch these two guys.

480
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,560
And then these two guys are
going to become negative.

481
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,080
So this guy's going to
become negative.

482
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,630
This guy's going to be a plus.

483
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:18,730
Let me rewrite that.

484
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,590
I apologize for the error.

485
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:27,000
C inverse is going to be 2, 1;
minus 1, 2 times 1/5, not 1/3.

486
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,930
That's what that negative
1 changes.

487
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:29,920
And so what are we
going to get?

488
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,550
There's going to be 2 minus--
this is C inverse right here,

489
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,410
so it's going to be 2 minus 1.

490
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:37,810
This is a plus 1 and this
is going to be a 5.

491
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:40,790
And then so this is going to
be a 5 and this is going

492
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,600
to be a plus 1.

493
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,850
This thing wouldn't change, or
actually, this will change,

494
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:48,110
because C is now 2 minus 1.

495
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,490
Actually, let me just redo this
part, because I realize

496
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:53,080
that I made it a bit of a mess,
and just to go through

497
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,570
this and correct this
is a bit hairy.

498
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:59,820
It's easier just to redo the
whole multiplication.

499
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,920
I apologize about that.

500
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,460
I apologize for wasting your
time with my error.

501
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:07,500
So A is equal to-- let
me rewrite them.

502
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,460
2, 1; minus 1, 2, right?

503
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:16,480
2, minus 1; 1, 2-- these
are our basis vectors.

504
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:22,190
I forgot that minus sign there--
times our vector D,

505
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:27,300
minus 1, 0; 0, 1-- our matrix
D-- times 1/5-- let me just

506
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,030
write the 1/5 out here--
times 1/5.

507
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,500
This is C inverse, so
we're going to have

508
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,220
2, 1; minus 1, 2.

509
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,850
And what is this going
to be equal to?

510
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:40,610
So first we can do these
two guys right there.

511
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:45,790
So it's going to be 1/5 times--
we have 2 times minus

512
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:48,770
1 plus 1 times 0,
so it's minus 2.

513
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:52,720
2 times 0 plus 1 times
1 is 1, right?

514
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,510
You have minus 1 times minus
1 plus 2 times 0,

515
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,940
so that's just 1.

516
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,300
And then minus 1 times 0, which
is 0, plus 2 times 1,

517
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,780
which is just 2.

518
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:06,410
And then we multiply it times
this guy, 2, minus 1; 1, 2.

519
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:07,630
And what is this going
to be equal to?

520
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:13,510
This is going to be equal to 1/5
times minus 2 times 2 is

521
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:18,260
minus 4 plus 1 times
1: plus 1.

522
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,170
And then your next term is
going to be minus 2 times

523
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:24,640
minus 1, which is 2, plus 1
times 2, so it's plus 2.

524
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,560
And then we have 1 times 2,
which is 2, plus 2 times 1,

525
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,860
which is 2, right?

526
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,600
1 times 2, plus 2 times 1.

527
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,800
And then you have
1 times minus 1.

528
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,970
You have 1 times minus 1, which
is minus 1, plus 2 times

529
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:41,180
2, which is 4.

530
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:46,780
So this is going to be equal to
1/5 times-- we have a minus

531
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:53,550
3, we have a 4, a 4,
and a minus 3.

532
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:56,140
Sorry, a plus 3.

533
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:59,350
Minus 4, a minus 3,
and then a plus 3.

534
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:02,920
You can imagine when you deal
with matrices, arithmetic is

535
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,240
what will trip you up.

536
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,700
So your matrix A, contrary to
what I found out a few minutes

537
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:21,180
ago, is equal to minus 3/5,
4/5, and then 4/5,

538
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,650
3/5, just like that.

539
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:28,100
So barring my slight arithmetic
error, which I got

540
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,230
from writing down the basis
vectors incorrectly,

541
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:33,060
forgetting to put that
negative number, now

542
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,880
hopefully, you realize you can
appreciate that we found an

543
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,630
easier way to find this
transformation matrix A with

544
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,780
respect to the standard basis.

545
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:46,290
You find the transformation
matrix D first in a more

546
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:49,840
natural basis coordinate system,
and then you can solve

547
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,010
for A from that.

548
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:54,150
And you get this result down
there, which is hopefully the

549
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:54,690
right answer.

550
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:57,590
If my memory serves me right,
this is what I got the first

551
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,410
time I did the problem.
