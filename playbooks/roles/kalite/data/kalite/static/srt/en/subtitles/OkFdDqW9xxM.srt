1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,558
Use the change of base formula to find log base 5 of 100,

2
00:00:05,558 --> 00:00:08,336
to the nearest thousandth.

3
00:00:08,336 --> 00:00:10,854
So the change of the base formula is a useful formula,

4
00:00:10,854 --> 00:00:12,782
especially when you're going to use a calculator,

5
00:00:12,782 --> 00:00:16,259
because most calculators don't allow you to arbitrarily change

6
00:00:16,259 --> 00:00:18,190
the base of your logarithm.

7
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,244
They have functions for log base e,

8
00:00:20,244 --> 00:00:22,136
which is a natural logarithm.

9
00:00:22,136 --> 00:00:23,759
And log base 10.

10
00:00:23,759 --> 00:00:25,438
So you generally need to change your base.

11
00:00:25,438 --> 00:00:27,233
And that's what change of base formula is.

12
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:29,767
And if we have time, I'll tell you why it makes a lot of sense

13
00:00:29,767 --> 00:00:31,700
or how we can derive it.

14
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,300
So the change of the base formula just tells us that

15
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,577
-- and let me do some colors here --

16
00:00:36,577 --> 00:00:48,285
log of base a of b is the same thing as log base x,

17
00:00:48,285 --> 00:01:06,648
where x is arbitrary base of b over log base x over a.

18
00:01:06,648 --> 00:01:10,577
The reason why this is useful is that we can change our base.

19
00:01:10,577 --> 00:01:13,515
Here our base is a and we can change it to base x.

20
00:01:13,515 --> 00:01:16,325
So if our calculator has a certain base x function

21
00:01:16,325 --> 00:01:20,156
we can convert to that base, it's usually e or base 10.

22
00:01:20,156 --> 00:01:22,541
Base 10 is an easy way to go.

23
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:26,352
And in general if you just see someone write a logarithm like this.

24
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:30,362
If they just write log of x -- they're implying, this implies

25
00:01:30,362 --> 00:01:32,952
log base 10 of x.

26
00:01:32,952 --> 00:01:35,387
If someone writes natural log of x,

27
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:38,941
they're implying log base e of x.

28
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:43,505
And e is obviously the number 2.71...keeps going on and on forever.

29
00:01:43,505 --> 00:01:46,321
Now, let's apply it to this problem.

30
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:56,382
We have logarithm -- I'll use colors -- base 5 of 100.

31
00:01:56,382 --> 00:02:00,582
So this property, this change of base formula tells us that

32
00:02:00,582 --> 00:02:05,244
this is exact same thing as log -- I'll make x = 10 --

33
00:02:05,244 --> 00:02:19,602
log base 10 of 100 divided by log base 10 of 5.

34
00:02:19,602 --> 00:02:22,402
And actually we don't even need a calculator to evaluate this top part.

35
00:02:22,402 --> 00:02:26,192
log base 10 of 100 -- what power I have to rise 10 to get to 100?

36
00:02:26,192 --> 00:02:27,836
The second power.

37
00:02:27,836 --> 00:02:30,437
So this enumerator is just equal to 2.

38
00:02:30,437 --> 00:02:35,297
So this simplifies to 2 over log base 10 of 5.

39
00:02:35,297 --> 00:02:38,517
We can now use our calculator, because log function

40
00:02:38,517 --> 00:02:41,365
on the calculator is log base 10.

41
00:02:41,365 --> 00:02:45,818
So let's get our calculator out. And we're going to get,

42
00:02:45,818 --> 00:02:50,536
we want -- let me clear this -- 2 divided by,

43
00:02:50,536 --> 00:02:53,921
when someone just writes log, they mean base 10.

44
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:58,782
They press ln, they mean base e. So log without any other information

45
00:02:58,782 --> 00:03:00,479
is log base 10.

46
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:05,741
So it is log base 10 of 5 is equal to,

47
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:08,259
and they want us to round to the nearest thousandth,

48
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:10,982
so 2.861.

49
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:15,367
So this is approximately equal to 2.861.

50
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:18,290
And we can verify it, because in theory if I raise 5

51
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:22,418
to this power I should get 100. And it kinda makes sense,

52
00:03:22,418 --> 00:03:26,818
cause 5 to the 2nd power is 25, 5 to the 3rd power is 125.

53
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:30,095
And this is in between the two and it's closer to the third power

54
00:03:30,095 --> 00:03:33,259
than it is to the second power and this number is closer to three

55
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:34,882
than it is to 2.

56
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:39,429
But let's verify it, so if I take 5 to that power.

57
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:43,187
And let me type in what we did, to the nearest thousadth.

58
00:03:43,187 --> 00:03:48,310
5 to the 2.861, so I'm not putting in all of the digits.

59
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,490
What do I get?

60
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,782
I get 99.94. if I'd put all of those digits in, it should get pretty close

61
00:03:54,782 --> 00:03:56,175
to 100.

62
00:03:56,175 --> 00:03:58,224
So that's what make you feel good that this is the power

63
00:03:58,224 --> 00:04:01,305
you have to raise 5 to get to 100.

64
00:04:01,305 --> 00:04:04,582
Now that out of the way, let's actually think about

65
00:04:04,582 --> 00:04:10,259
why this property, why this thing right over here makes sense?

66
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:18,552
So if I write log base a, I'm trying to be fair to the colors,

67
00:04:18,552 --> 00:04:26,413
log base a of b, let's say I said that to be equal to

68
00:04:26,413 --> 00:04:33,633
some number, let's call that's equal to c.

69
00:04:33,633 --> 00:04:45,895
So that means a to c-th power is equal to b.

70
00:04:45,895 --> 00:04:49,238
This is an exponential way of writing this truth.

71
00:04:49,238 --> 00:04:52,162
This is a logarithmic way of writing this truth.

72
00:04:52,162 --> 00:04:54,505
... is equal to b.

73
00:04:54,505 --> 00:04:58,295
Now we can take the logarithm of any base of both sides of this.

74
00:04:58,295 --> 00:05:02,767
Anything you do... if you say 10 to the what power is equal this.

75
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:04,648
10 to the same power will be equal to this,

76
00:05:04,648 --> 00:05:06,771
cause those two things are equal to each other.

77
00:05:06,771 --> 00:05:09,782
So let's take the same logarithm of both sides of this.

78
00:05:09,782 --> 00:05:11,823
So logarithm with the same base.

79
00:05:11,823 --> 00:05:15,125
And I actually will do log base x, to prove the general case here.

80
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:18,818
So I'm going to take log base x of both sides of this.

81
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:26,931
So this is log base x of a to the c-th power.

82
00:05:26,931 --> 00:05:29,915
I'm trying to be faithful to the colors.

83
00:05:29,915 --> 00:05:40,936
Is equal to log base x of b.

84
00:05:40,936 --> 00:05:43,895
Let me close it of with orange as well.

85
00:05:43,895 --> 00:05:46,248
And we know from out logarithm properties:

86
00:05:46,248 --> 00:05:53,987
log of a to the c is the same thing as c times the logarithm

87
00:05:53,987 --> 00:06:03,454
of whatever base we are of a.

88
00:06:03,454 --> 00:06:09,408
And of course this going to be equal to log base x of b.

89
00:06:09,408 --> 00:06:11,833
Let me put b right over there.

90
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,387
and if we want to solve for the c,

91
00:06:14,387 --> 00:06:17,156
you just divide both sides by log base x of a.

92
00:06:17,156 --> 00:06:22,705
So you get c is equal to and I'll stick to the color --

93
00:06:22,705 --> 00:06:30,577
so it's log base x of b over log base x of a.

94
00:06:30,577 --> 00:06:35,300
And this is what c was, c was logarithm base a of b.

95
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,648
... is equal to log base a of b.

96
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:43,725
Let me write it... let me do it in the original colors,

97
00:06:43,725 --> 00:06:45,485
just so it becomes very clear what I'm doing.

98
00:06:45,485 --> 00:06:47,233
I think you know where this is going.

99
00:06:47,233 --> 00:06:49,171
But I want to be fair to the colors.

100
00:06:49,171 --> 00:06:55,567
So c is equal to log base x of b over --

101
00:06:55,567 --> 00:06:58,505
let me scroll down a little bit --

102
00:06:58,505 --> 00:07:02,987
over log base x -- dividing both sides by that -- of a.

103
00:07:02,987 --> 00:07:05,218
And we know from here, I can just copy and paste it.

104
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:06,890
This is also equal to c.

105
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,946
This is how we defined it.

106
00:07:08,946 --> 00:07:11,295
So let me copy it and then we paste it.

107
00:07:11,295 --> 00:07:14,162
This is also equal to c.

108
00:07:14,162 --> 00:07:15,823
And we're done.

109
00:07:15,823 --> 00:07:18,459
We've proven the change of the base formula.

110
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:24,018
Log of base a of b is equal to log base x of b divided by log base x of a.

111
00:07:24,018 --> 00:07:28,085
And in this example: a was 5, b is 100

112
00:07:28,085 --> 99:59:59,999
and base we switched to is 10 -- x is 10.
