1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,830
   

2
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,160
We're asked to look at
the table below.

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,530
From the information given,
is there a functional

4
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:14,250
relationship between each person
and his or her height?

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,050
So a good place to start is
just think about what a

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,890
functional relationship means.

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,430
Now, there's definitely
a relationship.

8
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,740
They say, hey, if you're
Joelle, you're 5-6.

9
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,450
If you're Nathan, you're 4-11.

10
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,000
If you're Stewart,
you're 5-11.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,990
That is a relationship.

12
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:31,050
Now, in order for it to be a
functional relationship, for

13
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,820
every instance or every example
of the independent

14
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,000
variable, you can only have one
example of the value of

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,390
the function for it.

16
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:48,730
So if you say if this is a
height function, in order for

17
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:52,610
this to be a functional
relationship, no matter whose

18
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,610
name you put inside of the
height function, you need to

19
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,050
only be able to get one value.

20
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,020
If there were two values
associated with one person's

21
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,040
name, it would not be a
functional relationship.

22
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,915
So if I were to ask you what
is the height of Nathan?

23
00:01:08,915 --> 00:01:12,680
   

24
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,870
Well, you'd look at the table
and say, well, Nathan's height

25
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:19,910
is 4 foot 11.

26
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,350
There are not two heights
for Nathan.

27
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,810
There is only one height.

28
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,790
And for any one of these people
that we can input into

29
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,760
the function, there's only one
height associated with them,

30
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,660
so it is a functional
relationship.

31
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,880
We can even see that
on a graph.

32
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,290
Let me graph that out for you.

33
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,860
   

34
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,340
Let's see, the highest height
here is 6 foot 1.

35
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:49,370
So if we start off with one
foot, two feet, three feet,

36
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:57,330
four feet, five feet,
and six feet.

37
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,680
And then if I were to plot the
different names, the different

38
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,600
people that I could put into our
height function, we have--

39
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,580
I'll just put the first letters
of their names.

40
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:12,990
We have Joelle, we have Nathan,
we have Stewart, we

41
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,540
have LJ, and then we have
Tariq right there.

42
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,090
So lets plot them.

43
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:24,540
So you have Joelle, Joelle's
height is 5-6, so 5-6 is right

44
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,430
about there.

45
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,800
Then you have Nathan.

46
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,860
Let me do it in a
different color.

47
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,390
Nathan's height is 4-11.

48
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,220
We will plot to him
right over there.

49
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,730
Then you have Stewart.

50
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:47,010
Stewart's height is 5-11.

51
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,910
He is pretty close
to six feet.

52
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,430
So Stewart's height-- I made him
like six feet; let me make

53
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,630
it a little lower-- is 5-11.

54
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:57,060
Then you have LJ.

55
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,560
LJ's height is 5-6.

56
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,340
So you have two people with a
height of 5-6, but that's OK,

57
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,090
as long as for each person
you only have one height.

58
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,950
And then finally, Tariq
is 6 foot 1.

59
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,375
He's the tallest guy here.

60
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:13,040
Tariq is right up here
at 6 foot 1.

61
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,600
So notice, for any one of the
inputs into our function, we

62
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,810
only have one value, so this is
a functional relationship.

63
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,695
Now, you might say OK, well,
isn't everything a functional

64
00:03:23,695 --> 00:03:24,180
relationship?

65
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:24,620
No!

66
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,530
If I gave you the situation, if
I also wrote here-- let's

67
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:36,030
say the table was like this and
I also wrote that Stewart

68
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,760
is 5 foot 3 inches.

69
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,560
If this was our table, then
we would no longer have a

70
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,950
functional relationship because
for the input of

71
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,130
Stewart, we would have
two different values.

72
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:49,980
If we were to graph this, we
have Stewart here at 5-11, and

73
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,980
then all of a sudden, we would
also have Stewart at 5-3.

74
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,300
Now, this doesn't make a lot of
sense, so we would plot it

75
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,510
right over here.

76
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,050
So for Stewart, you would have
two values, and so this

77
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,880
wouldn't be a valid functional
relationship because you

78
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,210
wouldn't know what value to give
if you were to take the

79
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:10,120
height of Stewart.

80
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,600
In order for this to be a
function, there can only be

81
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,890
one value for this.

82
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,960
You don't know in this situation
when I add this,

83
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,240
whether it's 5-3 or 5-11.

84
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,620
Now, this wasn't the case, so
that isn't there and so we

85
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,810
know that the height of Stewart
is 5-11 and this is a

86
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,300
functional relationship.

87
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,220
I think to some level, it might
be confusing, because

88
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,800
it's such a simple idea.

89
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,520
Each of these values can
only have one height

90
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,530
associated with it.

91
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,600
That's what makes
it a function.

92
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,430
If you had more than one height
associated with it, it

93
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,450
would not be a function.

94
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:39,866
