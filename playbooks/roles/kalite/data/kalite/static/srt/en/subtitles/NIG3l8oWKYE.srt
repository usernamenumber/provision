1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
   

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,830
So now we have this graph
of this-- what was

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:04,865
clearly a trig function.

4
00:00:04,865 --> 00:00:09,300
And our task is to figure
out what the function is.

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,040
So let's look at this.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,210
The first thing I do when I
look at something like this,

7
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,460
I want to figure out its
period and its amplitude.

8
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,380
So what's its amplitude?

9
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,410
That's always an easy one.

10
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,230
So the amplitude.

11
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:25,620
   

12
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,240
Well, that's just how much does
it move up and down above

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,390
and below the x-axis?

14
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,760
Well, the amplitude here is how
much it moves up the x-axis.

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,750
Well, it moves up 1/2 above
and below the x-axis.

16
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,400
So the amplitude is 1/2.

17
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,980
And keep in mind, the amplitude
is not this whole distance.

18
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,830
It's not this.

19
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:50,370
It's just how much it moves
above or below the x-axis.

20
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,860
So in this case, the
amplitude is 1/2.

21
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,040
And then we have to figure
out what the period is.

22
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,510
The period is, how long does it
take-- how many radians does

23
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,040
it go through for it to go
through 1 complete cycle?

24
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,890
Well, if we start here, and we
were to follow the graph, it

25
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,780
doesn't take until right here
until we complete

26
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,430
1 cycle, right?

27
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,900
Because here, we're still
going down, and now

28
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,470
we're going below.

29
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:15,450
So we're not repeating yet.

30
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,370
And here's where we
start repeating again.

31
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,240
And then we start
repeating again here.

32
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,130
So every pi radians, we
start the cycle over again.

33
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,010
It happens the same if you
go backwards into the

34
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,540
negative radians.

35
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,685
So the period is pi, right?

36
00:01:28,685 --> 00:01:30,420
The period is pi.

37
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,650
And you could start
from any point.

38
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,760
You could start
from this point.

39
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,350
And if you go, follow the
graph, and then come back to

40
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:40,070
the same point again, we
see once again that the

41
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,540
period is pi radians.

42
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,215
Now we have to figure out
if this is a sine or

43
00:01:45,215 --> 00:01:46,335
a cosine function.

44
00:01:46,335 --> 00:01:50,680
And for now, we'll not
think about shifting.

45
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,930
So let's think about what
happens when-- you know,

46
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,900
we want to know what
this function is.

47
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:01,010
f of x is equal to
question mark.

48
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,116
Well, we see that f of 0 is 0.

49
00:02:04,116 --> 00:02:08,800
f of 0 is equal to 0.

50
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,880
What does that tell us?

51
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,830
Is this a sine or a
cosine function?

52
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,510
Well, what's cosine of 0?

53
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,620
Cosine of 0 is 1.

54
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,630
And what's sine of 0?

55
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,390
Well, sine of 0 is 0.

56
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,290
And this function is 0.

57
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,100
So we know that this
is a sine function.

58
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:31,050
So we know the formula is going
to take the form f of x, it's

59
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:38,110
going to equal the amplitude
times sine of 2 pi

60
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,900
over the period x.

61
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,440
And if we just substitute these
numbers we just figured out, we

62
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:56,155
know that f of x is equal to
1/2 sine of 2 pi over pi x.

63
00:02:56,155 --> 00:03:03,650
The pi's cancel out and
you get f of x is equal

64
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:10,270
to 1/2 sine of 2x.

65
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:15,590
   

66
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,020
Let's define another function.

67
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:24,980
Let's define g of x is
equal to 1/2 cosine of 2x.

68
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,370
What would have
this looked like?

69
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,900
Or what would have-- yeah.

70
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,083
The grammar's a
little difficult.

71
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,650
   

72
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,660
I picked the wrong color,
because f of x is

73
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,170
actually the pink one.

74
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,080
This is the one we have now.

75
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,470
So actually, let
me circle that.

76
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,100
This is f of x.

77
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,770
f of x is this one right here.

78
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:46,500
And now, g of x,
I'm going to do--.

79
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:52,910
So when x is 0, what is g of 0?

80
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,800
Let's put 0 in here.

81
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,230
So this whole term
will become 0.

82
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,360
What's cosine of 0?

83
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,000
It's 1.

84
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And 1 times 1/2.

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,300
So g of 0 is 1/2.

86
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:08,180
So we would start here, and
then we would have-- just

87
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,220
like the sine function-- we
would have a period of pi.

88
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,500
Because it has the same
coefficient here.

89
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,070
So this'll just look like this.

90
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:20,150
   

91
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,185
I think you get the point.

92
00:04:21,185 --> 00:04:24,710
   

93
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,150
It's just like the sine
function was just shifted

94
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,000
to the left of it.

95
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,550
   

96
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,920
Well, I'm getting confused
on this-- ignore this.

97
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,120
But if you look at this side,
the important thing to realize

98
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,610
is that it intersects the
y-axis at not 1, but 1/2.

99
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,950
And the reason why it doesn't
intersect it at 1, even

100
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,120
though cosine of 0 is 1, is
because we have this 1/2

101
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,420
coefficient right here.

102
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,610
I guess you can't call
that a coefficient.

103
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:55,430
I guess it's a 1/2 times
the cosine function.

104
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,760
Hopefully that gives you a
little bit more of a sense of,

105
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,980
if you just looked at a graph,
being able to figure

106
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,850
out its equation.

107
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,590
And I'll actually do one more
video where we'll actually use

108
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,900
the Khan Academy trig
graphing module to figure

109
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,360
out a couple more.

110
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,900
See you soon.

111
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,000
