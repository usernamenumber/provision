1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,069
Imagine we listed all integers in a growing spiral,

2
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:07,009
and colored the prime numbers blue,

3
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:10,790
and left the composite numbers black.

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,040
One interesting question we may ask is,

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,420
"How many primes are there

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,020
compared to composites?"

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,840
First, let's zoom out to see the big picture.

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,840
Notice the prime color is dense in the center,

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,970
and slowly drops off in the distance 

10
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,250
but never seems to end.

11
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,000
One way I like to think about this is as follows:

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,870
Imagine there is a tree at the center

13
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,250
which is infinitely high.

14
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,870
The leaves which drop from this tree

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,820
represent prime numbers

16
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,300
which are scattered unpredictably below 

17
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,710
dense near the base of the tree 

18
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,940
and as we walk away from the tree,

19
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,660
we find fewer leaves 

20
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,760
though we always find them.

21
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,180
This is exactly what happens

22
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,010
when we look at larger and larger integers.

23
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,750
We always find more primes 

24
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,489
though the number of primes we find gradually drops

25
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:04,420
the further [away from the tree] we look.

26
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,510
So let's return to our question.

27
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,130
How many primes are there less than some integer 'x?'

28
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,470
If we make a table,

29
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:14,990
we see the number of primes is always increasing.

30
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,140
Though as we search further,

31
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,860
we find fewer and fewer.

32
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,470
Let's graph the number of primes

33
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,390
found on the vertical axis,

34
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,439
and the search size, x, on the horizontal.

35
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,313
As we zoom out to include billions of numbers,

36
00:01:28,313 --> 00:01:31,100
notice the curve never flat lines.

37
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,894
It's always rising, albeit gradually.

38
00:01:35,894 --> 00:01:38,900
First, let's think about the density of primes

39
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,830
less than some integer x.

40
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,020
We can find the density by dividing

41
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,178
the number of primes found by the search size.

42
00:01:47,178 --> 00:01:50,340
For the first 100 integers, we find 25 primes 

43
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,971
therefore, 25% are prime.

44
00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:57,670
Of the first 1000 integers, we find 1229 primes 

45
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,713
12.29% are prime.

46
00:02:00,713 --> 00:02:05,682
Of the first 1 million integers, 7.84% are prime.

47
00:02:05,682 --> 00:02:12,374
And the first 100 million integers contain 5.76% prime.

48
00:02:12,374 --> 00:02:16,030
As we search further, this density continues to drop 

49
00:02:16,031 --> 00:02:20,559
though the speed at which it drops slows down.

50
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:24,180
Here is a graph of the search size on the horizontal axis,

51
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,479
and the prime density on the vertical.

52
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,150
Notice that as we zoom out,

53
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:35,880
the primes are a vanishing proportion of all integers.

54
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,743
Amazingly, we find this formula in nature.

55
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:45,109
We see it in galaxies, storms, flowers 

56
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:46,799
and even inside our bodies 

57
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,980
as the design of least resistance 

58
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,859
known as the 'logarithmic spiral.'

59
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:55,449
Notice that as the spiral rotates,

60
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:58,779
it gets further and further away from the center.

61
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:02,769
Incredibly, the rotation rate of a logarithmic spiral

62
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:07,255
is related to the density of primes – as follows:

63
00:03:07,255 --> 00:03:12,389
We have the number of rotations  – call this 'phi' 

64
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:15,730
and the distance from the center  – call this 'r'.

65
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,689
If we graph phi against r, and zoom out,

66
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:20,919
we see they are related

67
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:24,562
according to the natural logarithm.

68
00:03:24,562 --> 00:03:27,989
This means the natural logarithm of the distance

69
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:30,950
is related to the number of rotations.

70
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,989
The graph of the natural logarithm is commonly written 

71
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:36,620
using the variable names 'y' and 'x' 

72
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,686
as y equals the natural logarithm of x [or y = ln(x)].

73
00:03:40,686 --> 00:03:43,079
Notice the graph tapers off in the same way

74
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:48,010
the density of primes gradually decreases.

75
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,219
The final step is to invert this

76
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:55,839
by changing the y axis to 1/ln(x).

77
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:56,807
And when we zoom out,

78
00:03:56,807 --> 00:03:59,449
we find the exact same curve generated

79
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:02,287
when we plot the density of primes.

80
00:04:02,287 --> 00:04:05,529
Let's confirm this by overlapping the two plots.

81
00:04:05,529 --> 00:04:11,459
In green is a graph of the line y = 1/ln(x).

82
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,671
And in red is the plot of prime number density 

83
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,838
up to x.

84
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,560
As we zoom out, they approach each other.

85
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,916
The further we zoom out,

86
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:23,126
the more accurate the green estimate becomes.

87
00:04:23,126 --> 00:04:24,240
This is known as

88
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,133
the 'asymptotic law of distribution of prime numbers.'

89
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:30,830
We now have a formula to accurately tell us

90
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:36,457
the density of primes  – without counting.

91
00:04:36,457 --> 00:04:39,620
The density of primes up to some integer x

92
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:45,253
is approximately 1/(ln(x).

93
00:04:45,253 --> 00:04:47,949
So let's say you need to know the density of primes

94
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:51,373
between 1 and 100 trillion. Simple.

95
00:04:51,373 --> 00:04:57,571
1/ln(100,000,000,000,000) = 3.1%.

96
00:04:57,571 --> 00:05:00,300
Compare this to the actual result

97
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,180
from counting all primes –

98
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,675
which is 3.2 percent.

99
00:05:04,675 --> 00:05:06,680
This is off by 0.1 percent.

100
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,853
And as we check larger and larger numbers,

101
00:05:09,853 --> 00:05:12,496
the difference approaches zero.

102
00:05:12,496 --> 00:05:13,830
Realize now that we can use

103
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,969
this formula for prime density

104
00:05:15,969 --> 00:05:19,267
to estimate the number of primes up to x.

105
00:05:19,267 --> 00:05:21,430
The number of primes is the area under

106
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,430
the density curve 

107
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,610
for which we can simplify

108
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,590
by assuming density is constant.

109
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:30,210
So the number of primes equals size times density –

110
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,627
or x/ln(x).

111
00:05:33,627 --> 00:05:37,392
This is the prime number theorem.

112
00:05:37,392 --> 00:05:41,911
Here is a graph of y = x/ln(x), in blue,

113
00:05:41,911 --> 00:05:43,099
and [the line] in yellow is a plot

114
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:45,891
of an actual count of primes.

115
00:05:45,891 --> 00:05:47,126
Notice as we zoom out,

116
00:05:47,126 --> 00:05:52,710
these lines eventually overlap as we look to infinity.

117
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,789
And that is it.

118
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:55,919
We have a formula which tells us approximately

119
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,680
how many primes there are up to any value –

120
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,922
 no counting needed.

121
00:06:00,922 --> 00:06:02,370
For example, let's say we need to know

122
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,423
the number of primes less than 100 trillion.

123
00:06:04,423 --> 00:06:06,909
100 trillion divided by

124
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:11,481
the natural log of 100 trillion = 3.1 trillion.

125
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:13,199
Compare this to the actual count,

126
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,765
which is 3.2 trillion.

127
00:06:15,765 --> 00:06:19,169
This is over 99.99 percent accurate –

128
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:22,340
even at this relatively small scale.

129
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,319
So to recap:

130
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:26,849
Given a search size up to some integer x,

131
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:30,906
the prime density is about 1/(ln(x).

132
00:06:30,906 --> 00:06:36,905
And the number of primes is about x/ln(x).

133
00:06:36,905 --> 00:06:44,070
This is the prime number theorem.
