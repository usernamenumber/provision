00:00:00,664 --> 00:00:02,211
PROBLEM: In the United States,

2
00:00:02,211 --> 00:00:06,240
13 out of every 20 cans are recycled.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,363
What percent (%) of cans are recycled?

4
00:00:09,363 --> 00:00:14,641
So 13 out of every 20 are recycled.

5
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:17,573
So 13 20ths … or 13 over 20 (13/20) …

6
00:00:17,573 --> 00:00:18,991
could also be viewed as

7
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:27,959
13 ÷ 20, or 13/20.

8
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:29,360
And if we do this, we’ll get a decimal.

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,728
And it’s fairly straightforward

10
00:00:30,728 --> 00:00:33,905
to convert that decimal into a percentage.

11
00:00:33,905 --> 00:00:35,995
So 13 ÷ 20 (or 13/20) …

12
00:00:35,995 --> 00:00:38,028
We have the smaller number, in this case,

13
00:00:38,028 --> 00:00:40,301
being divided by the larger number.

14
00:00:40,301 --> 00:00:42,951
So, we’re going to get a value less than 1.

15
00:00:42,951 --> 00:00:44,587
Since we’re going to get a value less than 1,

16
00:00:44,587 --> 00:00:46,565
let’s put a decimal point right over here.

17
00:00:46,565 --> 00:00:48,168
And let’s add couple of 0s –

18
00:00:48,168 --> 00:00:50,200
as many 0s as we would need.

19
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:50,672
And we could say,

20
00:00:50,672 --> 00:00:53,188
“Hey, look, 20 goes into 13 zero (0) times.”

21
00:00:53,188 --> 00:00:55,352
0 х 20 is 0. (0 х 20 = 0).

22
00:00:55,352 --> 00:00:58,349
And then 13 - 0 = 13.

23
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,269
Now you bring down a 0.

24
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:03,807
20 goes into 130 –

25
00:01:03,807 --> 00:01:04,938
Let’s see, it goes in –

26
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:06,452
5 × 20 = 100.

27
00:01:06,452 --> 00:01:07,706
So, 6 × 20 = 120.

28
00:01:07,706 --> 00:01:09,716
So it’s going to go 6 times –

29
00:01:09,716 --> 00:01:13,119
6 × 20 = 120.

30
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,603
You subtract.

31
00:01:14,603 --> 00:01:16,025
You get a 10.

32
00:01:16,025 --> 00:01:17,755
Let’s bring down another 0.

33
00:01:17,755 --> 00:01:20,919
20 goes into 100 five (5) times.

34
00:01:20,919 --> 00:01:23,248
5 × 20 = 100.

35
00:01:23,248 --> 00:01:26,404
And we are done.

36
00:01:26,404 --> 00:01:32,728
So this, written as a decimal, is 0.65.

37
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:36,092
So, as a decimal, it’s 0.65.

38
00:01:36,092 --> 00:01:37,952
And if you want to write it as a percentage (%),

39
00:01:37,952 --> 00:01:40,032
you essentially multiply this number by 100.

40
00:01:40,032 --> 00:01:41,563
Or another way you could say it is

41
00:01:41,563 --> 00:01:43,216
you shift the decimal point over

42
00:01:43,216 --> 00:01:44,546
two spots to the right.

43
00:01:44,546 --> 00:01:50,623
So, this is going to be equal to 65 percent (or 65%).

44
00:01:50,623 --> 00:01:52,821
Now. There’s another way you could have done it.

45
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:53,859
You could have said,

46
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:56,821
“Look, ‘percent’ literally means ‘per hundred’

47
00:01:56,821 --> 00:02:04,524
So, 13 out of 20 is going to be equal to what over –

48
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:08,264
is going to be equal to what over 100?

49
00:02:08,264 --> 00:02:10,634
Well, to go from 20 to a 100 –

50
00:02:10,634 --> 00:02:11,887
(Forget the denominator.)

51
00:02:11,887 --> 00:02:14,887
To go from 20 to 100, you would multiply by 5.

52
00:02:14,887 --> 00:02:17,992
So let’s multiply the numerator by 5, as well.

53
00:02:17,992 --> 00:02:19,522
And 13 × 5 –

54
00:02:19,522 --> 00:02:19,914
Let’s see.

55
00:02:19,914 --> 00:02:23,557
That’s 15 + 50, which is 65.

56
00:02:23,557 --> 00:02:25,981
So this would have been a faster way to do it,

57
00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:27,216
especially if you recognize that

58
00:02:27,216 --> 00:02:28,916
it’s pretty easy to go from 20 to 100.

59
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,446
You multiply 20 by 5.

60
00:02:30,446 --> 00:02:32,488
So we would do the same thing with the 13.

61
00:02:32,488 --> 00:02:34,429
And so, you would get 65 over 100 (65/100),

62
00:02:34,429 --> 00:02:37,546
which is the same thing as 65 percent (65%) –

63
00:02:37,546 --> 00:02:38,763
(Let me write this percent symbol.)

64
00:02:38,763 --> 00:02:40,278
65 percent. (65%.)

65
00:02:40,278 --> 00:02:41,101
And just a reminder:

66
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:43,692
‘Percent’ literally means ‘per hundred.’

67
00:02:43,692 --> 00:02:45,467
65 per hundred.

68
00:02:45,467 --> 00:02:47,453
65 percent. (65%.)
