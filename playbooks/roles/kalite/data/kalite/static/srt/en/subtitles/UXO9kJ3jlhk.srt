1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,740
   

2
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,990
We're on problem 76.

3
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:05,400
It says one bag contains
2 green

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,870
marbles and 4 white marbles.

5
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:13,690
So that's one bag, and we have
2 green and 4 white.

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,740
And a second bag contains
3 green

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,595
marbles and 1 white marble.

8
00:00:17,595 --> 00:00:19,070
So here's a second bag.

9
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:23,390
It has 3 green and
1 white marble.

10
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,890
If Trent randomly draws 1 marble
from each bag, what is

11
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,550
the probability that
they're both green?

12
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,520
What's the probability that
he draws a green marble

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,450
from this first bag?

14
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:38,490
Let's see, there's
2 green marbles.

15
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,000
Out of a total how
many marbles?

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,920
2 plus 4 marbles.

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,010
There's a total of 6
marbles in here.

18
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,526
So there's a 2/6 or 1/3 chance
that he draws a green marble

19
00:00:46,526 --> 00:00:47,970
out of this bag.

20
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,850
And then when he goes to this
bag, let's say, OK how many

21
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:51,900
green marbles are there?

22
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,450
Well there are 3 green marbles
out of a total

23
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,350
possibility of 4 marbles.

24
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,080
So there's a 3/4 chance
that he picks a green

25
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,630
marble out of this bag.

26
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:05,670
So the chance that he picks a
green marble out of both bags

27
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,180
is just the 2/6 times the 3/4.

28
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,920
That's 1/3 times 3/4.

29
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,180
Which is equal to a
1/4 probability.

30
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,430
Next question.

31
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,510
   

32
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,720
I've decided that it's
fast when I pre- cut

33
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,790
and paste the questions.

34
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,740
It took me, like, 18 videos to
think of that innovation.

35
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,510
Anyway.

36
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,930
A box contains 7 red
marbles, no.

37
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:38,340
7 large red marbles, 5-- let me
see, we have a box-- I have

38
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:49,090
7 large red marbles, 5 large
yellow marbles, 3 small red

39
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:54,520
marbles, and 5 small
yellow marbles.

40
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,990
If a marble is drawn at
random, what is the

41
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,700
probability that it is yellow?

42
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,760
So probability that it is
yellow, given that it is one

43
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,010
of the large marbles.

44
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,620
   

45
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,430
OK, so this might
seem difficult.

46
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,880
Conditional probability
and all of that.

47
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,350
But all you have to think about
is, OK, we've picked a

48
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:17,290
marble out of the box
and it's large.

49
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,350
So if I have a large marble
in my hand, what is the

50
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,710
probability that I picked
a yellow large marble?

51
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,430
So the easiest way to think
about it is just think about

52
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,160
the universe of large marbles.

53
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,650
We picked 1 of these
12 marbles here.

54
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,620
We picked 1 of the large ones.

55
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,620
So we definitely picked
1 of these 12 marbles.

56
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,640
And so what is the probability
that I picked a

57
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,190
yellow large marble?

58
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:44,180
So there's a total of 5
yellow large marbles.

59
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,150
That's what they want to know.

60
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,270
Given it was one of large,
probability of the yellow.

61
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,320
So there's 5 yellow
large marbles.

62
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,600
That's these right here.

63
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,780
And how many total large marbles
might I have picked?

64
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,520
Well 5 plus 7 is 12.

65
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,000
So there's a 5/12 chance that
I picked a yellow marble,

66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,680
given that I picked 1 of
the large marbles.

67
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,250
Next question.

68
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,800
There's a trash truck outside
making a lot of noise.

69
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,510
Hope you don't hear it.

70
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:14,510
Anyway, this has
a big diagram.

71
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,510
Let's see.

72
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:20,396
Jamie will definitely try out--
this is problem 78-- let

73
00:03:20,396 --> 00:03:21,630
me switch to a dark color
because I'm going to be

74
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,900
writing on white.

75
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,070
Jamie will definitely
try out for either

76
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:28,310
basketball or baseball.

77
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,280
Basketball or baseball.

78
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,490
But not both.

79
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:42,600
The probability that Jamie will
try out for baseball and

80
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,780
try out for catcher is 42%.

81
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,600
So this probability is 42%.

82
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,410
Baseball and catcher.

83
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,650
What is the probability that
Jamie will try out for

84
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,410
basketball?

85
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,700
OK, so what have they
provided us?

86
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,850
There's some probability that
Jamie tries out for

87
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,000
basketball, some probability
that Jamie

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,340
tries out for baseball.

89
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,020
Let's just assign some, let's
say that this is x.

90
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,730
Because that's what we
want to figure out.

91
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,180
And if that probability is x,
then the probability of trying

92
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,270
out for baseball is just
going to be 1 minus x.

93
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,170
And if that's 60%, it's
going to be 40%.

94
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,660
I don't know what it is yet.

95
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:22,000
But then they say, if Jamie is
trying out for basketball,

96
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,720
then there's an 80% chance that
he tries out for guard

97
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,920
and a 20% chance for forward.

98
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,000
But, if you said what's the
probability that he does

99
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,510
basketball and forward, it
would be x times 20%.

100
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,840
Maybe there's a 50% chance he
does basketball and then 20%

101
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,720
of those times he would
be a forward, so it

102
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,250
would be a 10% chance.

103
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,400
So we do the same logic here.

104
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,780
If he tries out for baseball,
there's a 70% chance he'll try

105
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,020
out for catcher.

106
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,490
And they already told us that
the combined probability, the

107
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,560
probability that he'll try out
for baseball and, given that

108
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,310
try out for catcher,
that that is 42%.

109
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:03,650
So we can write that 1 minus
x, that's this probability,

110
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:12,960
times 70%, times 0.7, is equal
to 42%, which is 0.42.

111
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:19,640
And then you get 1 minus
x is equal to what?

112
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,520
What's 0.42 divided by 7?

113
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,050
Let's see, it's 42 divided
by 7 would be 6.

114
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,080
0.7.

115
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,450
It would be 60%.

116
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,710
And you can do that division.

117
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:37,390
And it's always good to do a
reality check and say, OK, 70%

118
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,350
of something is 42%.

119
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:42,710
OK, 70% of 60%, yeah
that makes sense

120
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,650
that it would be 42%.

121
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,240
Just in case you don't make
a decimal mistake.

122
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,200
So 1 minus x is 60%.

123
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,640
This is a 60% probability
right here

124
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,940
going down this chain.

125
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,560
And so now maybe you can see it
a little more concretely,

126
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,760
we said, OK, whatever this is
times the probability that he

127
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,530
tries out for catcher, given
that he's trying out for the

128
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,725
baseball team, that's going
to be equal to 42%.

129
00:06:01,725 --> 00:06:03,990
And we've figured this out.

130
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:10,100
Now if this is 60%, 1 minus x,
then x is-- if this is 60% x

131
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,220
is 1 minus that.

132
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,450
So x is 40%.

133
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,300
And we could have actually
solved for that.

134
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,912
We could have actually said,
1 minus x is equal to 60%.

135
00:06:17,912 --> 00:06:22,380
And then you could have said,
minus x is equal to minus 40%.

136
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,920
Subtract 1 from both sides,
x is equal to 40%.

137
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,570
Anyway that's the question
they asked us.

138
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,450
And what choice was that?

139
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,380
What choice?

140
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,630
Oh, it doesn't matter.

141
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:38,190
   

142
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,670
That was choice A.

143
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,500
Two problems left.

144
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,200
I'm going to be nostalgic for
these California standards,

145
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,130
Algebra II exams. All right.

146
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:52,480
   

147
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,360
Let me copy and paste
this one in.

148
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,160
   

149
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,610
All right.

150
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:04,400
A small business owner must hire
seasonal workers as the

151
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,770
need arises.

152
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,080
The following list shows the
number of employees hired

153
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,860
monthly for a five-month
period.

154
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:20,480
If the mean of these data is
approximately 7, what is the

155
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,060
population standard deviation
for these data?

156
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,190
Round the answer to the
nearest decimal.

157
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:25,710
OK.

158
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,750
Standard deviation has all
sorts of definitions.

159
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,250
Well there is one definition
for it, but I just always

160
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,090
think about it is,
it's the average

161
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,600
distance from the average.

162
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,890
Or it's the average distance
from the mean.

163
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,540
And if you wanted a visual kind
of representation of it,

164
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,990
let's say that I were to draw--
this is some type of

165
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:50,230
y-axis there-- and on the x-axis
I were to draw each of

166
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,550
the data points.

167
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,870
So this is data point 1,
this is data point 2.

168
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,410
You wouldn't have to do this on
the problem, but I really

169
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,860
want to give you an intuition
for what the standard

170
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,660
deviation is so that you
don't forget it when

171
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,210
you're 32 years old.

172
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:02,660
All right.

173
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,400
So the data points go all
the way from 4 to 13.

174
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,550
So let's see, data
point one is 4.

175
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,920
Let's say that this is 4.

176
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,260
I just want to give you.

177
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,460
So that's 4.

178
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,030
Data point two is 13.

179
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,340
So maybe 13 will be up here.

180
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,100
Data point two is 13.

181
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,540
Data point three is 5.

182
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,470
That's right around there.

183
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,090
Data point four is 6.

184
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,320
Maybe it's right there.

185
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,540
And data point five is 9.

186
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:36,000
So maybe nine is-- I don't know
I'm just eyeballing it--

187
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,909
maybe 9 is right there.

188
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:41,030
And they're telling us that if
we average these numbers, our

189
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,630
average is 7.

190
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,790
So 7 is our average.

191
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,040
So this is 7.

192
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,671
   

193
00:08:49,671 --> 00:08:52,720
So the average is 7.

194
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,730
And they didn't have
to tell you that.

195
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,390
They're just trying to
save you some time.

196
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,290
You could have added all of
these numbers up, and you said

197
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,590
OK, I got 7.

198
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,590
I'm guessing that we get some
decimals or something.

199
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,350
That's why they said
approximately 7.

200
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,800
But anyway, that's
the average.

201
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,410
So the standard deviation is
just the average distance from

202
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,760
the average, or the average
distance from the mean.

203
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,590
So you say is, and you might
know it as the square root of

204
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,720
variance and all that.

205
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,490
And the variance is just
the square of the

206
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,070
distance from the mean.

207
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,370
And they just really square it
so that it stays positive.

208
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,140
But if you just say 4 and 7,
what's the difference, what's

209
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,150
the distance between 4 and 7?

210
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,015
Well I'll draw it
with my marker.

211
00:09:29,015 --> 00:09:33,450
The distance between
4 and 7 is 3.

212
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,660
Remember we just want to figure
out the distance.

213
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,130
We don't want to know
which one's bigger.

214
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,190
4 is 3 away from 7.

215
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:41,940
That's why sometimes people will
say, oh OK, the variance

216
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:48,100
is equal to 4 minus
7, squared.

217
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,030
And then that'll give you 9.

218
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,830
And then they will say that
the standard deviation is

219
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:57,900
equal to the square root
of the variance.

220
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,810
Which is equal to 3.

221
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:03,700
But you could have just said
that the standard deviation is

222
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,810
equal to the absolute
value of 4 minus 7.

223
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,840
To me, this is more intuitive
because we're just saying, OK,

224
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,750
how far away is it from 7?

225
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,920
I don't care if it's
above or below.

226
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,680
I just want to know the
distance from it.

227
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,450
And then I just want to
average each of those.

228
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,020
Oh I'm sorry.

229
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,110
This isn't the standard
deviation itself.

230
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:24,810
This is each of the terms and
then we would average them.

231
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,890
Anyway, let me erase this
because I think

232
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,542
I'll need that space.

233
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:31,510
The standard deviation, you
figured this out, you take the

234
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,500
sum of these and then
you average them.

235
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,990
I'll show it to you
in a second.

236
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,240
Let me erase this.

237
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,980
   

238
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:46,870
I think the proper notation
would have been, you could

239
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:50,350
have written it as the standard
deviation is equal to

240
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:54,360
the sum of the differences
of the data points.

241
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,480
You know, there's
n data points.

242
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,650
The n data points.

243
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:01,240
And that we want to take the
absolute value between each of

244
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,460
the data points.

245
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:08,130
Data point i minus the mean.

246
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:11,170
They write mu for the
mean, or something.

247
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,550
It gets complicated.

248
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,290
So that's the sum of all of
them and then you want to

249
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,720
divide that by n.

250
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,080
So essentially you're
taking the average

251
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,840
distance from the mean.

252
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,370
All that might be really
complicated.

253
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,580
You could have written
variance-- well, anyway.

254
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,390
I just want to show you that
when you do the statistics

255
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,820
class, it'll introduce you to
a lot of things, but at the

256
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,820
end, all you care about
is the average

257
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,440
distance from the mean.

258
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,150
And I'll show you how easy
that is to calculate.

259
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,130
Everything I've done so far
this problem you would not

260
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,800
have had to do on a real exam.

261
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,990
I'm just trying to give a
little bit of intuition.

262
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:45,650
All right, so the distance
from 4 to 7 is 3.

263
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:48,230
So the distance from data
point one is 3.

264
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,820
The distance from 13 to 7,
what's that distance?

265
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,920
Well, that's 7.

266
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,890
We just care about the
absolute distance.

267
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,550
So then that distance is 7.

268
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,490
The distance from 5 to 7 is 2.

269
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,970
The distance from 6 to 7 is 1.

270
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,410
The distance from 9 to 7 is 2.

271
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,030
   

272
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,060
So we just want to take
the average of

273
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,560
all of these numbers.

274
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,430
Let's see, 3 plus 7 is 10.

275
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,330
10 plus 2 is 12.

276
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:21,520
12 plus 1 is 13.

277
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,420
Plus 2 is 15.

278
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,880
So the sum of these is 15.

279
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,740
And I have 5 data points.

280
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,820
So divided by 5 is equal to 3.

281
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:34,730
So the standard deviation is
equal to-- well, that's

282
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:40,510
strange because I got 3 and they
have an answer, 3.3, so I

283
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,580
feel like maybe I
made a mistake.

284
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,410
But, I mean, I'm going
to go with that.

285
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:45,610
I'm going to go with the 3.3.

286
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:52,030
Maybe, I guess the actual
mean is probably not 7.

287
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:55,340
So if you used the non-actual
mean you would have-- let's

288
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,520
see what the actual mean is.

289
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,030
And once again this is not
something that you

290
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,790
would have to do.

291
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,150
Well, anyway.

292
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,070
Actually, I just realized
I've run out of time.

293
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,540
So I'll continue this
in the next video.

294
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,180
See you soon.

295
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,280
The next video is going
to be one problem.

296
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,400
