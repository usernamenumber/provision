1
00:00:01,303 --> 00:00:03,418
We're looking at one of the greatest paintings

2
00:00:03,418 --> 00:00:04,772
of the High Renaissance, and really,

3
00:00:04,772 --> 00:00:07,089
one of the paintings that really expresses

4
00:00:07,089 --> 00:00:08,524
what the High Renaissance is.

5
00:00:08,524 --> 00:00:09,037
Yes.

6
00:00:09,037 --> 00:00:12,141
It's Raphael's "The School of Athens,"

7
00:00:12,141 --> 00:00:15,642
and it's in one of the greatest,

8
00:00:15,642 --> 00:00:19,437
most extraordinarily decorated rooms in the Vatican.

9
00:00:19,437 --> 00:00:21,691
In the Papal Palace.

10
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:25,380
And the name of the room is the "Stanza della segnatura."

11
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,372
It was painted by Raphael between 1509 and 1511, and it's -

12
00:00:30,372 --> 00:00:30,372
   

13
00:00:30,372 --> 00:00:32,246
- right at the time Michelangelo was painting

14
00:00:32,246 --> 00:00:34,154
the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.

15
00:00:34,154 --> 00:00:35,234
And they must have gotten to know each other.

16
00:00:35,234 --> 00:00:36,067
I'll bet they did.

17
00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:40,576
It is really an extraordinary expression of

18
00:00:40,576 --> 00:00:44,142
the embrace of the Catholic world during the High Renaissance

19
00:00:44,142 --> 00:00:45,280
of the classical world,

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,265
really looking back at the greatest minds of the classical tradition.

21
00:00:49,265 --> 00:00:51,147
Yes. I always think about this as

22
00:00:51,147 --> 00:00:54,663
a kind of humanist's dream come true, you know,

23
00:00:54,663 --> 00:00:57,002
because what we have is under one roof,

24
00:00:57,002 --> 00:01:00,725
all of the greatest scientists and mathematicians

25
00:01:00,725 --> 00:01:02,489
and philosophers and thinkers -

26
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:03,074
-of ancient Greece.

27
00:01:03,074 --> 00:01:07,249
- of ancient Greece, people who lived at all different time periods,

28
00:01:07,249 --> 00:01:08,830
so it's definitely a kind of fantasy.

29
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:12,270
It's a fabrication. And actually, a kind of messed up fabrication,

30
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,471
I have to say, because you said under one roof.

31
00:01:14,471 --> 00:01:17,766
If you look at the roof, this is classical Roman architecture,

32
00:01:17,766 --> 00:01:19,155
not classical Greek architecture -

33
00:01:19,155 --> 00:01:19,850
No, that's true.

34
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,441
- so Raphael is actually screwing this up a little bit.

35
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:23,154
A little bit, yeah.

36
00:01:23,154 --> 00:01:25,759
And in fact, the architecture, while we're on it,

37
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,276
that we see in "The School of Athens,"

38
00:01:27,276 --> 00:01:30,654
is probably, you know, taken from Bramante,

39
00:01:30,654 --> 00:01:34,535
who's there at the same time, redesigning,

40
00:01:34,535 --> 00:01:38,760
or doing the designs for the new Basilica of St. Peter's.

41
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,382
Ah, right. Which is just next door.

42
00:01:40,382 --> 00:01:42,996
Right. So you have St. Peter's being rebuilt

43
00:01:42,996 --> 00:01:45,716
along the lines of ancient Roman architecture;

44
00:01:45,716 --> 00:01:48,243
you have Michelangelo painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel;

45
00:01:48,243 --> 00:01:49,121
and at the same time,

46
00:01:49,121 --> 00:01:49,933
What a moment!

47
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:53,156
Raphael is painting the frescos in the Stanze,

48
00:01:53,156 --> 00:01:56,153
the rooms - "stanze" means rooms - so,

49
00:01:56,153 --> 00:01:58,804
the "Stanza della segnatura" means the "Room of the Signature."

50
00:01:58,804 --> 00:02:01,405
So, this is where the Pope would have signed important documents.

51
00:02:01,405 --> 00:02:01,988
Exactly.

52
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:04,295
So, there's a lot of figures in here,

53
00:02:04,295 --> 00:02:05,738
there's very complex architecture;

54
00:02:05,738 --> 00:02:08,409
but the architecture, because of the linear perspective,

55
00:02:08,409 --> 00:02:11,817
the orthogonals, really points us to the key figures,

56
00:02:11,817 --> 00:02:13,778
the two central figures.

57
00:02:13,778 --> 00:02:16,667
Yes. And these are not just the two central figures in the painting,

58
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:21,485
but in a way, the two central figures in Western philosophy,

59
00:02:21,485 --> 00:02:23,075
Western ways of thinking about the world.

60
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:23,981
And science, really!

61
00:02:23,981 --> 00:02:24,500
And science, right.

62
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,280
Absolutely. So, okay. So we have two figures

63
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,000
that are really beautifully framed by the smallest of the arches,

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,972
and actually all of the arches.

65
00:02:30,972 --> 00:02:34,540
You have Plato, and you have his student, Aristotle.

66
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,552
That's right. And they kind of represent the two sides,

67
00:02:38,552 --> 00:02:42,157
in a way, of Western thinking, right?

68
00:02:42,157 --> 00:02:44,013
You have Plato, who -

69
00:02:44,013 --> 00:02:45,491
- He's the figure in the red and the gray -

70
00:02:45,491 --> 00:02:47,982
- Right. And he points upward.

71
00:02:47,982 --> 00:02:50,905
Because he's interested in the spiritual.

72
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:55,607
But in a world that transcends the everyday world.

73
00:02:55,607 --> 00:02:57,154
So he's pointing up; and actually,

74
00:02:57,154 --> 00:03:00,934
one could argue - and have - that the four elements are here,

75
00:03:00,934 --> 00:03:05,439
that Plato is represented by the red of fire,

76
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,846
and by the gray of what the Greeks would have called ether;

77
00:03:07,846 --> 00:03:10,579
that is, of the nontangible elements.

78
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:13,265
Mm-hmm. And Aristotle, on the other hand?

79
00:03:13,265 --> 00:03:14,113
Well, he's wearing -

80
00:03:14,113 --> 00:03:15,478
- Holding his hand down.

81
00:03:15,478 --> 00:03:17,494
That's right, actually, to the tangible,

82
00:03:17,494 --> 00:03:19,628
to the actual, to the physical, to the observable.

83
00:03:19,628 --> 00:03:22,426
Right, which is what Aristotle focused on in his philosophy:

84
00:03:22,426 --> 00:03:24,926
What can we observe, how can we make sense

85
00:03:24,926 --> 00:03:27,334
of the world that we can see with our senses?

86
00:03:27,334 --> 00:03:29,318
Not the world that we can't see,

87
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:30,726
which is what Plato was interested in.

88
00:03:30,726 --> 00:03:34,087
And of course, he's wearing blue and brown,

89
00:03:34,087 --> 00:03:35,369
which would be water and earth,

90
00:03:35,369 --> 00:03:37,495
those elements that respond to gravity.

91
00:03:37,495 --> 00:03:38,490
That are physical.

92
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,382
That's right. We have two different ways

93
00:03:40,382 --> 00:03:41,102
of thinking about the world:

94
00:03:41,102 --> 00:03:45,034
That the world is the way we see it and experience it with our senses,

95
00:03:45,034 --> 00:03:49,342
and this is the way we can approach human understanding and knowledge,

96
00:03:49,342 --> 00:03:52,543
and a sense that there's something higher and greater

97
00:03:52,543 --> 00:03:55,886
and perfect, related to the Divine, for Plato,

98
00:03:55,886 --> 00:04:01,285
which was, in large part, also thought about in terms of mathematics.

99
00:04:01,285 --> 00:04:03,635
Interesting. So, this painting is really a balance

100
00:04:03,635 --> 00:04:05,424
between those two aspects, isn't it?

101
00:04:05,424 --> 00:04:05,889
Yes.

102
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:10,261
And it's really quite a glorious kind of harmonious expression.

103
00:04:10,261 --> 00:04:13,499
And in fact, all of the figures as they're organized

104
00:04:13,499 --> 00:04:16,751
are really sort of divided between those two sort of schools of thought.

105
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:19,904
Right. On the side with Plato,

106
00:04:19,904 --> 00:04:24,958
we have the mathematicians, and -

107
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:27,406
- I think the philosophers that are thinking about

108
00:04:27,406 --> 00:04:30,135
ideas that are not related to the physical, the actual -

109
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:32,108
not trying to explain the physical and the actual -

110
00:04:32,108 --> 00:04:34,838
That's right, that's right - whereas on Aristotle's side,

111
00:04:34,838 --> 00:04:39,577
you have people who are, in a sense, scientists in some sense.

112
00:04:39,577 --> 00:04:42,129
So maybe what we should do is actually

113
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:43,385
point out a few of these figures,

114
00:04:43,385 --> 00:04:44,883
and really just speak about them a little bit.

115
00:04:44,883 --> 00:04:46,441
We can do that. Before we do that,

116
00:04:46,441 --> 00:04:48,216
I would like to talk about the architecture -

117
00:04:48,216 --> 00:04:48,766
- Sure.

118
00:04:48,766 --> 00:04:51,467
- as overall. Because, I think that this is,

119
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:52,755
first of all, in two ways.

120
00:04:52,755 --> 00:04:55,998
We have this really grand architecture

121
00:04:55,998 --> 00:04:57,381
that's really unprecedented.

122
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:58,112
It's a little over the top.

123
00:04:58,112 --> 00:05:02,038
And you know, it's just, it's an architecture that's very high,

124
00:05:02,049 --> 00:05:04,871
these round arches, these classical sculptures

125
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,345
and niches on either side-

126
00:05:07,345 --> 00:05:09,515
- Which by the way, represent the same kind of -

127
00:05:09,515 --> 00:05:10,281
- duality.

128
00:05:10,281 --> 00:05:11,581
- dualism that we were talking about.

129
00:05:11,581 --> 00:05:15,179
That's right. We have Apollo on Plato's side -

130
00:05:15,179 --> 00:05:16,577
- the god of poetry and music.

131
00:05:16,577 --> 00:05:20,423
- That's right. And we have Athena on Aristotle's side,

132
00:05:20,423 --> 00:05:22,219
war, wisdom -

133
00:05:22,219 --> 00:05:23,037
- More practical..

134
00:05:23,037 --> 00:05:25,087
- a much more earthly kind of figure.

135
00:05:25,087 --> 00:05:27,213
Right. And so, what I was going to say about the architecture

136
00:05:27,213 --> 00:05:30,248
is that it elevates and ennobles the figures.

137
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:33,745
It creates a context in the way that Leonardo did

138
00:05:33,745 --> 00:05:35,851
in the Last Supper, where the architecture

139
00:05:35,851 --> 00:05:38,902
worked with the figures to help tell the story,

140
00:05:38,902 --> 00:05:42,034
to create meaning. I think here similarly,

141
00:05:42,034 --> 00:05:45,251
the architecture just, you know, I mean,

142
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:46,984
if you imagine a very different space,

143
00:05:46,984 --> 00:05:48,494
the figures become very different.

144
00:05:48,494 --> 00:05:52,867
It elevates them; it somehow is an architecture

145
00:05:52,867 --> 00:05:55,618
that speaks of the achievements of the mind.

146
00:05:55,618 --> 00:05:58,204
It is absolutely a celebration, as this painting

147
00:05:58,204 --> 00:06:01,071
is a celebration, of the potential of human achievement.

148
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:04,586
And what could characterize the High Renaissance better

149
00:06:04,586 --> 00:06:07,811
than this idea of what man is capable of,

150
00:06:07,811 --> 00:06:12,024
of reaching almost a kind of divine status in its creations?

151
00:06:12,024 --> 00:06:15,116
Exactly. And I think that the other thing that's important to keep in mind

152
00:06:15,116 --> 00:06:17,522
is just how many figures there are in this painting.

153
00:06:17,522 --> 00:06:18,879
Just, Raphael's achievement!

154
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,714
It's so much fun.

155
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:22,066
I mean, there's, you know, there's dozens of figures here,

156
00:06:22,066 --> 00:06:25,716
and, there's, you know, this complex composition

157
00:06:25,716 --> 00:06:27,510
where no figure is repeated,

158
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:31,238
where everything just looks so lifelike and so natural,

159
00:06:31,238 --> 00:06:34,125
like Raphael just, you know, it doesn't even look like

160
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,194
this took any work on his part.

161
00:06:36,194 --> 00:06:41,076
You know, there's a kind of complexity, and -

162
00:06:41,076 --> 00:06:43,670
- There's a kind of facility here that Raphael has.

163
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:47,831
I mean, there is nobody that paints with more facility than Raphael.

164
00:06:47,831 --> 00:06:48,457
-No.

165
00:06:48,457 --> 00:06:53,534
-He makes it look absolutely natural, and with such ease.

166
00:06:53,534 --> 00:06:55,579
Like there's only one solution.

167
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:57,571
Like the greatest of ballerinas,

168
00:06:57,571 --> 00:06:59,863
it doesn't look like they practiced for hours and hours.

169
00:06:59,863 --> 00:07:01,319
It's true. I want to go back to a point that you made

170
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,087
a moment ago though, that was important, which is,

171
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:05,346
what does it mean to have all of these figures together?

172
00:07:05,346 --> 00:07:06,918
You know, it's so interesting.

173
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:09,574
The Renaissance really came back to this periodically.

174
00:07:09,574 --> 00:07:12,392
If we look at one of the most important texts

175
00:07:12,392 --> 00:07:15,404
to sort of - that is actually pre-Renaissance,

176
00:07:15,404 --> 00:07:16,599
but really sets up the Renaissance,

177
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:19,432
you could look at Dante's "Inferno."

178
00:07:19,432 --> 00:07:22,251
And in the very beginning of Dante's "Inferno,"

179
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:25,664
when we actually visit Limbo,

180
00:07:25,664 --> 00:07:29,049
we actually get to meet some of these great Greek figures.

181
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:32,520
And it was very revolutionary, this idea of retrieving them

182
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,836
from the way in which the medieval tradition had looked at the Greeks,

183
00:07:35,836 --> 00:07:38,172
which was with incredible disdain.

184
00:07:38,172 --> 00:07:39,750
And so, here they're being celebrated.

185
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,413
What a radical reversal.

186
00:07:41,413 --> 00:07:44,762
It is. It is. And it's a moment that won't last long,

187
00:07:44,762 --> 00:07:45,669
in the Church.

188
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:47,088
No. In fact, it's almost over.

189
00:07:47,088 --> 00:07:50,046
It's almost over! The Reformation is about to happen.

190
00:07:50,046 --> 00:07:52,574
Okay. So let's take a look at some of the primary figures here.

191
00:07:52,574 --> 00:07:53,608
Okay. Should we start with the lower left?

192
00:07:53,608 --> 00:07:56,258
Sure. And actually, let's start sort of actually

193
00:07:56,258 --> 00:07:58,873
lower center left, at the very large,

194
00:07:58,873 --> 00:08:01,070
really the most massive figure in the painting.

195
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:01,799
The seated figure.

196
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:05,295
Yeah, wearing those heavy workmen's boots,

197
00:08:05,306 --> 00:08:08,506
crouched over in a sort of leaning and actually,

198
00:08:08,506 --> 00:08:09,950
writing, interestingly enough.

199
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,956
Mmm-hmm, and kind of twisting his body a little.

200
00:08:11,956 --> 00:08:13,759
The figure that's being represented here

201
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,083
is the great ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus,

202
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:20,145
who's probably best known for thinking about time

203
00:08:20,145 --> 00:08:23,556
as something that is constantly in flux, you know -

204
00:08:23,556 --> 00:08:25,322
Is he the one who said you can't step into the same river twice?

205
00:08:25,322 --> 00:08:26,634
Same river twice, that's right;

206
00:08:26,634 --> 00:08:31,885
that equated life like a flame, that it was never repeated,

207
00:08:31,885 --> 00:08:36,047
that everything was a sort of infinite variety.

208
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:39,504
But here, of course, Raphael had no idea

209
00:08:39,504 --> 00:08:40,921
what Heraclitus actually looked like,

210
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:45,134
so asked somebody that he knew to sit in as a model.

211
00:08:45,134 --> 00:08:47,410
And of course, that was Michelangelo.

212
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,776
Yes! And, but, to me what he did was,

213
00:08:49,776 --> 00:08:53,276
he really tried - not only painted Michelangelo's Heraclitus,

214
00:08:53,276 --> 00:08:58,372
but took on Michelangelo by making him, you know,

215
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:03,281
sort of painting him in the way that Michelangelo had painted the prophets and the Sibyls,

216
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:06,272
these large monumental seated figures,

217
00:09:06,272 --> 00:09:08,806
so Raphael sort of taking out Michelangelo's challenge

218
00:09:08,806 --> 00:09:14,361
and saying, "Oh yeah? Well I can do these amazingly beautiful seated figures, too!"

219
00:09:14,361 --> 00:09:16,755
And with the kind of massiveness and majesty

220
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:18,736
that Michelangelo brings to those seated figures,

221
00:09:18,736 --> 00:09:20,546
whereas so many of the other figures in this painting

222
00:09:20,546 --> 00:09:22,371
are much more delicate in their rendering,

223
00:09:22,371 --> 00:09:26,015
Michelangelo has been rendered as a massive, powerful figure -

224
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,644
- as a Michelangelesque figure!

225
00:09:27,644 --> 00:09:29,464
It's wonderful, isn't it? It's almost a parody.

226
00:09:29,464 --> 00:09:32,525
And interestingly enough, Raphael reminds us here,

227
00:09:32,525 --> 00:09:35,464
because Heraclitus is depicted as writing,

228
00:09:35,464 --> 00:09:38,207
reminds us that Michelangelo was also a poet.

229
00:09:38,207 --> 00:09:42,529
That's true. And so, let's talk about my favorite figure,

230
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:44,279
who's the figure on the far left.

231
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,370
With the bald head.

232
00:09:45,381 --> 00:09:46,007
With the bald head,

233
00:09:46,007 --> 00:09:46,562
and the beard.

234
00:09:46,562 --> 00:09:49,280
And the beard, and that's Pythagoras,

235
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:53,774
who we might remember from high school geometry,

236
00:09:53,774 --> 00:09:57,038
a squared + b squared = c squared, the Pythagorean Theorem -

237
00:09:57,038 --> 00:10:01,173
But who was really an entire school of thought unto himself.

238
00:10:01,173 --> 00:10:05,671
Yes. And Pythagoras is doing some diagrams about

239
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:10,675
how harmony relates to music and numbers,

240
00:10:10,675 --> 00:10:17,806
and how underlying harmony is a kind of mathematical structure.

241
00:10:17,806 --> 00:10:20,469
A kind of rational structure, that could be understood

242
00:10:20,469 --> 00:10:22,244
and, in a sense, measured, really.

243
00:10:22,244 --> 00:10:22,774
Yes.

244
00:10:22,774 --> 00:10:23,672
So, yeah, that's right.

245
00:10:23,672 --> 00:10:28,089
Pythagoras is known for having written the "Harmony of the Spheres,"

246
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:30,170
which is clearly being referred to here -

247
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,719
this critical ancient text which was missing,

248
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,894
which - where he really asks this fundamental question,

249
00:10:34,894 --> 00:10:37,072
which is: What is beauty?

250
00:10:37,072 --> 00:10:40,584
And in a sense, what could be a more important question for Raphael himself?

251
00:10:40,584 --> 00:10:43,011
Right. What is beauty, how does beauty relate

252
00:10:43,011 --> 00:10:46,114
to harmony, and is there a -

253
00:10:46,114 --> 00:10:48,005
- a divine source.

254
00:10:48,005 --> 00:10:50,670
- sort of underlying - right, an underlying source

255
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,271
and structure in the universe that somehow -

256
00:10:53,271 --> 00:10:56,263
I mean, is beauty then a manifestation -

257
00:10:56,263 --> 00:10:58,275
- of the Divine -

258
00:10:58,275 --> 00:10:59,608
or something created by God, right,

259
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:01,229
which is such a High Renaissance idea,

260
00:11:01,229 --> 00:11:05,189
that the contemplation of beauty is in a way

261
00:11:05,189 --> 00:11:07,209
a contemplation of the Divine.

262
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:09,694
And of course, we would see this on Plato's side.

263
00:11:09,694 --> 00:11:10,213
That makes sense.

264
00:11:10,213 --> 00:11:12,768
Because these are absolutely Neoplatonic ideas.

265
00:11:12,768 --> 00:11:13,557
Very much so.

266
00:11:13,557 --> 00:11:16,403
Okay. Should we move over to the right side?

267
00:11:16,403 --> 00:11:17,372
Sure. To Euclid?

268
00:11:17,372 --> 00:11:20,173
Well, here we see, really, the scientists,

269
00:11:20,173 --> 00:11:22,586
the people who tried to understand the universe

270
00:11:22,586 --> 00:11:25,659
and the world and the structures of the world, right?

271
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:28,177
Yes, and to sort of formulate the structures,

272
00:11:28,177 --> 00:11:32,985
just like Aristotle did with the four elements,

273
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:36,190
Euclid does with geometry: the point, the line,

274
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:39,762
the Euclidean - what are they called - theorems,

275
00:11:39,762 --> 00:11:42,781
That's right. Almost all the geometry that we learn

276
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:43,785
- is Euclid.

277
00:11:43,785 --> 00:11:45,065
- in middle school is Euclidean, absolutely.

278
00:11:45,065 --> 00:11:47,006
And here he's actually in the act of teaching.

279
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:47,617
Yes.

280
00:11:47,617 --> 00:11:48,390
It's fabulous.

281
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,979
Yes. And you know, one of the things that is so important

282
00:11:50,979 --> 00:11:53,196
about this painting, and makes it so High Renaissance,

283
00:11:53,196 --> 00:11:56,511
is the way that the figures really interact with each other.

284
00:11:56,511 --> 00:11:59,103
Everyone's talking and gesturing, and there's

285
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:02,975
no sense of stiffness at all, all the groups are so fluid-

286
00:12:02,975 --> 00:12:04,534
- dynamic, absolutely.

287
00:12:04,534 --> 00:12:06,004
and there is, you know, it just -

288
00:12:06,004 --> 00:12:07,562
everyone just looks like they're just hanging out

289
00:12:07,562 --> 00:12:09,372
and talking and having fun and -

290
00:12:09,372 --> 00:12:11,483
This is a forum! It's a -

291
00:12:11,483 --> 00:12:14,542
But how complicated it is, to create these groups of ten people!

292
00:12:14,542 --> 00:12:16,222
It's a dance, really, that he's created.

293
00:12:16,222 --> 00:12:17,494
It's amazing achievement.

294
00:12:17,494 --> 00:12:20,035
Of course, Raphael himself is painted here.

295
00:12:20,035 --> 00:12:20,708
He is.

296
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:23,896
Among the astronomers, in the lower right corner -

297
00:12:23,896 --> 00:12:24,740
Peeking out -

298
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,724
he's the one who's looking directly at us.

299
00:12:26,724 --> 00:12:29,101
Yes. [chuckles]
