1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,360
   

2
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,530
In the last video, we saw what
a system of equations is.

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,970
And in this video, I'm going
to show you one algebraic

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,390
technique for solving systems of
equations, where you don't

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,630
have to graph the two lines and
try to figure out exactly

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:13,560
where they intersect.

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,610
This will give you an exact
algebraic answer.

8
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,290
And in future videos,
we'll see more

9
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:18,290
methods of doing this.

10
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,760
So let's say you had
two equations.

11
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:27,910
One is x plus 2y is equal to 9,
and the other equation is

12
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:35,140
3x plus 5y is equal to 20.

13
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,810
Now, if we did what we did in
the last video, we could graph

14
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:38,350
each of these.

15
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,010
These are lines.

16
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,630
You could put them in either
slope-intercept form or

17
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,560
point-slope form.

18
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,290
They're in standard
form right now.

19
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,530
And then you could graph each
of these lines, figure out

20
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,040
where they intersect, and that
would be a solution to that.

21
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,710
But it's sometimes hard to
find, to just by looking,

22
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,280
figure out exactly where
they intersect.

23
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,890
So let's figure out a way to
algebraically do this.

24
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,150
And what I'm going to do is
the substitution method.

25
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,400
I'm going to use one of the
equations to solve for one of

26
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,440
the variables, and then I'm
going to substitute back in

27
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,880
for that variable over here.

28
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,570
So let me show you what
I'm talking about.

29
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,500
So let me solve for x using
this top equation.

30
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,440
So the top equation says x
plus 2y is equal to 9.

31
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,410
I want to solve for x, so let's
subtract 2y from both

32
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,520
sides of this equation.

33
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:28,500
So I'm left with x is
equal to 9 minus 2y.

34
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,780
This is what this first equation
is telling me.

35
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,960
I just rearranged
it a little bit.

36
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,710
The first equation
is saying that.

37
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,350
So in order to satisfy both of
these equations, x has to

38
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,890
satisfy this constraint
right here.

39
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:47,080
So I can substitute this
back in for x.

40
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,430
We're saying, this top equation
says, x has to be

41
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,320
equal to this.

42
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,690
Well, if x has to be equal
to that, let's

43
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,820
substitute this in for x.

44
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:59,990
So this second equation
will become 3 times x.

45
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:07,300
And instead of an x, I'll write
this thing, 9 minus 2y.

46
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:15,090
3 times 9 minus 2y, plus
5y is equal to 20.

47
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,540
That's why it's called the
substitution method.

48
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,250
I just substituted for x.

49
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,730
And the reason why that's
useful is now I have one

50
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,830
equation with one unknown,
and I can solve for y.

51
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,060
So let's do that

52
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,810
3 times 9 is 27.

53
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:35,150
3 times negative 2 is negative
6y, plus 5y is equal to 20.

54
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,180
Add the negative 6y plus the 5y,
add those two terms. You

55
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:45,750
have 27-- let's see, this will
be-- minus y is equal to 20.

56
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,870
Let's subtract 27
from both sides.

57
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,260
And you get-- let me
write it out here.

58
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:56,110
So let's subtract 27
from both sides.

59
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,250
The left-hand side, the 27's
cancel each other out.

60
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,420
And you're left with negative y
is equal to 20 minus 27, is

61
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,770
negative 7.

62
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,170
And then we can multiply both
sides of this equation by

63
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:12,450
negative 1, and we get
y is equal to 7.

64
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:20,320
So we found the y value of the
point of intersection of these

65
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,320
two lines. y is equal to 7.

66
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,550
Let me write over here, so I
don't have to keep scrolling

67
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,660
down and back up.
y is equal to 7.

68
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,290
Well, if we know y, we can
now solve for x. x is

69
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,780
equal to 9 minus 2y.

70
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,120
So let's do that.

71
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:42,010
x is equal to 9 minus 2
times y, 2 times 7.

72
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:49,210
Or x is equal to 9 minus 14, or
x is equal to negative 5.

73
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,640
So we've just, using
substitution, we've been able

74
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,600
to find a pair of x
and y points that

75
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,020
satisfy these equations.

76
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,990
The point x is equal to negative
5, y is equal to 7,

77
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,520
satisfy both of these.

78
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,830
And you can try it out.

79
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:10,270
Negative 5 plus 2 times 7,
that's negative 5 plus 14,

80
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,990
that is indeed 9.

81
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,910
You do this equation.

82
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:18,170
3 times negative 5 is negative
15, plus 5 times y,

83
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,670
plus 5 times 7.

84
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:24,310
So negative 15 plus
35 is indeed 20.

85
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,350
So this satisfies
both equations.

86
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,640
If you were to graph both of
these equations, they would

87
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,090
intersect at the point
negative 5 comma 7.

88
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:38,000
Now let's use our newly
found skill to do

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,830
an actual word problem.

90
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:46,530
Let's say that they tell
us that the sum of

91
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:55,130
two numbers is 70.

92
00:04:55,130 --> 00:05:00,710
And they differ-- or maybe we
could say their difference--

93
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:06,820
they differ by 11.

94
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,070
What are the numbers?

95
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:14,900
   

96
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,980
So let's do this word problem.

97
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,460
So let's define some
variables.

98
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:29,210
Let's let x be the larger
number, and let y be the

99
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,420
smaller number.

100
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,180
I'm just arbitrarily creating
these variables.

101
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,640
One of them is larger
than the other.

102
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,940
They differ by 11.

103
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,020
Now, this first statement, the
sum of the two numbers is 70.

104
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:51,340
That tells us that x plus
y must be equal to 70.

105
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:56,350
That second statement, that
they differ by 11.

106
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,450
That means the larger number
minus the smaller

107
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,290
number must be 11.

108
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:06,320
That tells us that x minus
y must be equal to 11.

109
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:06,960
So there we have it.

110
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,510
We have two equations
and two unknowns.

111
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,530
We have a system of
two equations.

112
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:15,040
We can now solve it using
the substitution method.

113
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,190
So let's solve for x on this
equation right here.

114
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,160
So if you add y to both
sides of this

115
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,610
equation, what do you get?

116
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,700
On the left-hand side, you just
get an x, because these

117
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,890
cancel out.

118
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,000
And then on the right-hand side,
you get x is equal to 11

119
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,630
plus y, or y plus 11.

120
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,240
So we get x is equal
to 11 plus y

121
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,830
using the second equation.

122
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,070
And then we can substitute it
back into this top equation.

123
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,770
So instead of writing x plus
y is equal to 70, we can

124
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,850
substitute this in for x.

125
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,210
We've already used the second
equation, the magenta one, now

126
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,360
we have to use the
top constraint.

127
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,600
So if we substitute this in, we
get y plus 11-- remember,

128
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,990
this is what x was, we're
substituting that in for x--

129
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,700
plus y is equal to 70.

130
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,710
This is x.

131
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,870
And that constraint was given to
us by this second equation,

132
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,650
or by this second statement.

133
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:20,020
I just substituted this x with
y plus 11, and I was able to

134
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,480
do that because that's the
constraint the second

135
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,420
equation gave us.

136
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,280
So now let's just solve for y.

137
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:32,230
We get y plus 11, plus
y is equal to 70.

138
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:36,470
That's 2y plus 11
is equal to 70.

139
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:45,430
And then if we subtract 11 from
both sides, we get 2y is

140
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,570
equal to-- what is that?

141
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,220
59?

142
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,160
You subtract 10 from
70, you get 60, so

143
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,530
it's going to be 59.

144
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:56,120
So y is equal to 59 over 2.

145
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,240
Or another way to write it,
you could write that as 59

146
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:10,110
over 2 is the same thing as--
let's see-- 25-- 29.5.

147
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:15,380
y is equal to 29.5.

148
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,650
Now, what is x going
to be equal to?

149
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:21,090
Well, we already figured out
x is equal to y plus 11.

150
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:26,120
So x is going to be equal to
29.5-- that's what y is, we

151
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,835
just figured that out-- plus 11,
which is equal to-- so you

152
00:08:30,835 --> 00:08:32,549
add 10, you get 39.5.

153
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:36,809
You add another 1,
you get 40.5.

154
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:37,990
And we're done.

155
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,690
If you wanted to find the
intersection of these two

156
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:48,140
lines, it would intersect at
the point 40.5 comma 29.5.

157
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,435
And you could have used this
equation to solve for x and

158
00:08:51,435 --> 00:08:52,200
then substituted in this one.

159
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,756
You could have used this
equation to solve for y and

160
00:08:53,756 --> 00:08:55,250
then substituted in this one.

161
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,245
You could use this equation
to solve for y and then

162
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,760
substitute into that equation.

163
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,770
The important thing is, is
you use both constraints.

164
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:05,850
Now let's just verify that
this actually works out.

165
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,330
What's the sum of these
two numbers?

166
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:11,600
40.5 plus 29.5, that
indeed is 70.

167
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,250
And the difference between
the two is indeed 11.

168
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,550
They're exactly 11 apart.

169
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:20,320
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.
