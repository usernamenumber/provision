1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,662
So we have some, some race cars racing right here

2
00:00:04,662 --> 00:00:07,800
and I have an interesting question to ask you.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,446
If we assume that these cars

4
00:00:10,508 --> 00:00:12,733
are making this turn right over here,

5
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:14,923
that all of them are making this turn

6
00:00:14,923 --> 00:00:16,782
at a constant speed.

7
00:00:16,782 --> 00:00:19,064
So a constant speed

8
00:00:19,064 --> 00:00:23,623
constant speed of 100 kilometers per hour.

9
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:26,977
100 kilometers per hour.

10
00:00:26,977 --> 00:00:30,054
My interesting question for you is,

11
00:00:30,054 --> 00:00:34,936
are these cars accelerating while they make this turn?

12
00:00:34,936 --> 00:00:37,762
So, is acceleration happening?

13
00:00:37,762 --> 00:00:39,725
Acceleration.

14
00:00:39,725 --> 00:00:41,287
And you might say

15
00:00:42,935 --> 00:00:44,582
Well, gee, look, my speed was constant, it's not changing

16
00:00:44,582 --> 00:00:47,131
if I look at this speedometer for the car here,

17
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:48,556
If I look at this speedometer over here

18
00:00:48,556 --> 00:00:52,090
it won't budge, it just stays in a 100 kilometers per hour.

19
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,162
I don't have any change in speed over time.

20
00:00:55,162 --> 00:00:56,710
And so then, you might say

21
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,356
that you don't have any acceleration.

22
00:00:59,356 --> 00:01:01,085
But then you might be saying why would Sal

23
00:01:01,085 --> 00:01:02,444
even make this video, you know,

24
00:01:02,444 --> 00:01:04,556
why would that question even be interesting?

25
00:01:04,556 --> 00:01:08,259
And your second, your second suspicion would be true

26
00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:11,705
because these cars actually are accelerating.

27
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:13,946
They actually are accelerating

28
00:01:13,946 --> 00:01:16,459
despite having a constant speed.

29
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:18,362
And you can pause it and think about that

30
00:01:18,362 --> 00:01:19,846
for a second if you want to.

31
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:21,844
But I wanted to point this out to you because

32
00:01:21,844 --> 00:01:23,992
in an example like this, the difference

33
00:01:23,992 --> 00:01:27,444
between speed and velocity starts to matter.

34
00:01:27,444 --> 00:01:29,146
Speed being a scalar quantity

35
00:01:29,146 --> 00:01:31,218
only having a magnitude

36
00:01:31,218 --> 00:01:33,341
and velocity being a vector quantity

37
00:01:33,341 --> 00:01:35,587
having speed with a direction

38
00:01:35,587 --> 00:01:38,110
having a magnitude and a direction.

39
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,518
And to think about.

40
00:01:39,518 --> 00:01:41,392
Let's take a top view of this thing

41
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:44,152
And I think It will become a little bit clearer

42
00:01:44,152 --> 00:01:46,490
the difference between speed and velocity

43
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,136
and why these things are accelerating.

44
00:01:48,136 --> 00:01:50,136
So, if I were to take a top view of this race track.

45
00:01:50,136 --> 00:01:52,675
I'll do my best attempt to draw it.

46
00:01:52,675 --> 00:01:55,377
So, it might look something like this.

47
00:01:55,377 --> 00:01:57,346
This is the top view.

48
00:01:57,346 --> 00:01:59,798
I can even draw this red and white.

49
00:01:59,798 --> 00:02:03,895
So, red, just to give you the idea.

50
00:02:03,895 --> 00:02:05,957
So, this is the red

51
00:02:05,957 --> 00:02:08,659
and there is some white in between.

52
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:10,125
I miss I'm not drawing as many dividers

53
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,302
as there are in the actual picture

54
00:02:11,302 --> 00:02:12,813
but it gives you an idea of

55
00:02:12,813 --> 00:02:14,162
what I'm actually drawing.

56
00:02:14,162 --> 00:02:16,229
And there's some grass out here,

57
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:18,208
there's some grass over here,

58
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:21,182
and there is some grass over here.

59
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,884
And let's focus on this orange car,

60
00:02:22,884 --> 00:02:25,208
this red car over here.

61
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:26,679
So, (where?) you say..

62
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,371
And this is a top view.

63
00:02:28,371 --> 00:02:29,721
This is it's path right over here.

64
00:02:29,721 --> 00:02:31,448
(We're?) saying it has a constant speed

65
00:02:31,448 --> 00:02:33,890
of a 100 kilometers per hour.

66
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,679
So if you think about its velocity.

67
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:36,995
If you think about its velocity,

68
00:02:36,995 --> 00:02:39,838
the magnitude of its velocity is constant.

69
00:02:39,838 --> 00:02:42,038
It is a 100 kilometers per hour.

70
00:02:42,038 --> 00:02:44,048
But what is happening to the direction

71
00:02:44,048 --> 00:02:47,454
of the velocity, remember velocity is a vector quantity.

72
00:02:47,454 --> 00:02:49,623
It has magnitude and direction.

73
00:02:49,623 --> 00:02:52,685
So, up here, at this, where it's starting to enter the curve

74
00:02:52,685 --> 00:02:55,367
it's going in this direction.

75
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:58,690
And you, (tend?) to show vectors by arrows like this,

76
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,725
(and what you do is?) the arrow is going in the direction

77
00:03:00,725 --> 00:03:03,844
of the velocity in this case, and (normally?) you draw

78
00:03:03,844 --> 00:03:07,325
the length of the arrow shows what is the velocity,

79
00:03:07,325 --> 00:03:09,459
the magnitude of the velocity, I should say.

80
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:12,248
So, its velocity is constant, so the length of this arrow

81
00:03:12,248 --> 00:03:14,069
will always be constant, but as we see

82
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,782
it's direction changes, when it's halfway through the turn

83
00:03:16,782 --> 00:03:18,371
it's not going in the same direction.

84
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:20,505
It is now going in the different direction,

85
00:03:20,505 --> 00:03:21,836
and when it comes to the bottom of the turn

86
00:03:21,836 --> 00:03:23,875
it's going in the very different direction.

87
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,664
And it'll keep, the direction keeps changing

88
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,905
as long as it is turning.

89
00:03:27,905 --> 00:03:29,577
And I'm not gonna go into math here, we're gonna wait

90
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:31,485
for the math on this a little bit later,

91
00:03:31,485 --> 00:03:32,538
but remember

92
00:03:32,538 --> 00:03:37,279
acceleration is a change in velocity over time.

93
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:42,638
Acceleration is equal to a change in velocity

94
00:03:42,638 --> 00:03:46,095
is equal to a change in velocity

95
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:49,018
over time, or we could say, over change,

96
00:03:49,018 --> 00:03:51,546
over a change in time.

97
00:03:51,546 --> 00:03:55,500
And although the velocity's magnitude is constant here

98
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,931
its direction is changing

99
00:03:57,931 --> 00:04:01,115
it keeps being...

100
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,864
if there's no acceleration on it

101
00:04:02,864 --> 00:04:05,275
it's magnitude and the direction of it's velocity

102
00:04:05,275 --> 00:04:06,544
would be constant.

103
00:04:06,544 --> 00:04:09,485
And the car would just keep going, would just keep going

104
00:04:09,485 --> 00:04:10,831
in that direction.

105
00:04:10,831 --> 00:04:13,725
So, somehow the car is, the car's direction

106
00:04:13,725 --> 00:04:18,438
is changing inward, over and over and over again.

107
00:04:18,438 --> 00:04:20,731
And (...) this is kind of a little bit trick question,

108
00:04:20,731 --> 00:04:22,400
something for you to think about,

109
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,623
we're gonna to discuss the math in more detail

110
00:04:25,623 --> 00:04:26,769
in future videos.

111
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:28,223
But what's happening here is the,

112
00:04:28,223 --> 00:04:31,059
the car is actually (are) accelerating.

113
00:04:31,059 --> 00:04:33,085
And they're actually accelerating inwards,

114
00:04:33,085 --> 00:04:35,146
and that's what's changing inwards.

115
00:04:35,146 --> 00:04:36,400
We wanna say inwards.

116
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,352
They're being accalerated towards the center of the curve.

117
00:04:40,352 --> 00:04:42,879
They're being accelerated to the center of the curve.

118
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,648
And that's what's allowing their direction

119
00:04:45,648 --> 00:04:51,271
to actually change.
