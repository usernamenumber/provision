1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,590
   

2
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,050
Welcome back.

3
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,240
I scared you, I'm sure.

4
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,040
I have more energy.

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,700
I'm actually fasting
today, but I won't

6
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,090
go into it too much.

7
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,790
I don't want to go too much into
my personal life, but I

8
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,900
eat one meal a day now and
I have so much energy.

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,220
It's unbelievable.

10
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,870
Hope you don't think I'm crazy,
but it's back to the

11
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,810
SAT videos.

12
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:33,950
So let's see, we're on
problem number 15.

13
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,750
So I drew it out ahead of time,
because I didn't want to

14
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,810
waste your time because
it's more valuable

15
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,350
than mine, I think.

16
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,170
Considering I have so much time
now that I only eat one

17
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,480
meal a day.

18
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:52,720
They say, in the figure above,
triangle PQR is equilateral

19
00:00:52,720 --> 00:01:03,340
and SR and TV intersect
at point P.

20
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,140
What is the value of y?

21
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,860
So let's just use all the
information they give us.

22
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,190
This is an equilateral
triangle.

23
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,930
So what do you know about
equilateral triangles?

24
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,270
All the angles in
an equilateral

25
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:11,970
triangle are the same.

26
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,690
This is going to be 60 degrees,
this going to be 60

27
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,090
degrees, and this whole
thing is going to

28
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,410
be 60 degrees, right?

29
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,950
Well, if this whole thing is
60 degrees, then what's x?

30
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,860
Well, there's three x's,
and they're equally

31
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,940
splitting it, right?

32
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,970
So this is 20 degrees, this is
20 degrees and this is 20

33
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,220
degrees, right?

34
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,560
   

35
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,620
Well, what's equal to angle y?

36
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:41,940
From our geometry module, we
know that angle y is equal to

37
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,275
the opposite angle, right?

38
00:01:43,275 --> 00:01:47,860
Angle y is going to be equal
to-- so you got to pay close

39
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,570
attention to which
lines this is.

40
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:54,060
So that line and that
line, right?

41
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,010
So the opposite angle
to angle y is this

42
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,610
angle right here, right?

43
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,320
So that angle is just two of the
three x's, so it's 20 and

44
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:07,225
20, so angle y is equal
to 40 degrees.

45
00:02:07,225 --> 00:02:09,940
It just equals two of
these x degrees.

46
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,060
That's it.

47
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,470
All right, number 16.

48
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,480
Maybe I could do it here with
this kind of toothpaste

49
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,220
colored ink.

50
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,430
Let the operations triangle and
square be defined for all

51
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,220
real numbers a and b as follows,
a-- I like these

52
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:37,420
problems-- a triangle b
is equal to a plus 3b.

53
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:49,985
And then a square b is
equal to a plus 4b.

54
00:02:49,985 --> 00:02:52,870
   

55
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,330
And then they have this thing.

56
00:02:54,330 --> 00:03:16,200
If 4 triangle of 5y is equal
to 5y square 4, what is the

57
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,270
value of y?

58
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,760
Well this might seem bizarre
to you, but we just have to

59
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,570
map these functions to-- And
this is just functions in

60
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,610
disguise, right?

61
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,980
A function of two variables.

62
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,510
Let's see, so what
is 4 triangle 5y?

63
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,630
So let's go to the triangle
function.

64
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,940
That's this one, right?

65
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,360
So in this case,
a is 4, right?

66
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,900
Because it's the number before
the triangle, so that's equal

67
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,020
to 4 plus 3 times b.

68
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,170
Well, what's b?

69
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:48,000
b is whatever's after
the triangle, right?

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,640
In this case it's 5y.

71
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,030
So 3 times b would
be 3 times 5y.

72
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,890
   

73
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,190
Let me do some coloring here.

74
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:02,570
This is just this, right?

75
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:08,000
And then if I do the other side
of that-- 5y square 4.

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,775
So in this case, 5-- so we're
using the square.

77
00:04:10,775 --> 00:04:15,400
So in this case 5y
is a, right?

78
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:21,980
So that equals 5y plus 4b.

79
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,500
And what's b?

80
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:28,790
Well, b is whatever's after
the rectangle, right?

81
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,450
So 4b is 4 times 4.

82
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,370
And now we just solve.

83
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:33,920
So let's see.

84
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:39,100
4 times-- 4 plus-- let me just
rewrite that-- 4 plus 3 times

85
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:46,980
5 is 15y is equal
to 5y plus 16.

86
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:53,210
Let's take 4 from both
sides, so you get 15y

87
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:58,200
equals 5y plus 12.

88
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:04,320
Take 5y from both sides, you
get 10y is equal to 12.

89
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,680
y is equal to 12/10, and then
we can reduce that.

90
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:15,950
Divide the top to bottom by 2,
so y is equal to 6/5, and that

91
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,820
is our answer.

92
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,640
These are these kind of fill in
the blank ones, so you can

93
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,980
actually write that--
bubble it in.

94
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,000
The SAT wasn't like that
I when I took it.

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,970
Actually, these problems
are really good.

96
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,220
Let's move on.

97
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:33,990
   

98
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,680
Number 17.

99
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,840
Let me switch to magenta,
bright magenta.

100
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:46,990
In the xy-coordinate plane, the
graph of x is equal to y

101
00:05:46,990 --> 00:06:01,460
squared minus 4 intersects the
line l, at 0 comma p, and the

102
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,830
point 5 comma t, right?

103
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,560
These are two points
on the line l.

104
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,200
What is the greatest possible
value of the slope of l?

105
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,130
So this is interesting.

106
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,790
So x is equal to y
squared minus 4.

107
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,640
So, first of all, you need
realize this isn't how you

108
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,930
normally write a function,
right?

109
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,545
You normally write it y is
equal to x something.

110
00:06:25,545 --> 00:06:30,495
But, what this is going to look
like-- x plus 4 is equal

111
00:06:30,495 --> 00:06:37,840
to y squared-- And you don't
have to draw this actually on

112
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,480
the SAT test. It's going to
take you too much time.

113
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,550
But I think it's useful here
to have a visualization of

114
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,800
this, right?

115
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,710
   

116
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,830
So the graph is going to look
something like this.

117
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:52,030
   

118
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,780
It's going to actually
start at minus 4.

119
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,020
It's going to look something
like this,

120
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,380
the graph-- oh, woops.

121
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,691
I'm still using the line tool.

122
00:07:01,691 --> 00:07:03,950
The graph is going to look
something like this.

123
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:07,570
Start back here at minus 4.

124
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,640
I think.

125
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,410
And then the line l-- we can
only assume since it

126
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:15,100
intersects it at two points,
it's going to look something

127
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,650
like this, right?

128
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,670
Where this could be 0 comma
p, and this is 5 comma t.

129
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,530
What's important to realize is
that both of these points

130
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:28,710
satisfy this relationship,
right?

131
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,720
Because they're on this curve.

132
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,655
So we can do that with
our math, right?

133
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:40,905
We could write this as
0 comma-- Well, if x

134
00:07:40,905 --> 00:07:43,360
is 0, what is y?

135
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,900
Well, 0 is equal to
y squared minus 4.

136
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,580
We add 4 to both sides.

137
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,810
Y squared is equal to 4.

138
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,160
So y is equal to plus
or minus 2.

139
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,790
And that's the tricky part,
right? y is equal to

140
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,040
plus or minus 2.

141
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,620
   

142
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,360
And then what does this equal?

143
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,800
If x is equal to 5, what is t?

144
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,330
What could this term
right here be?

145
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:18,490
So let's see, 5 is equal
to y squared minus 4.

146
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,370
y squared is equal to 9.

147
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,815
y is equal to plus or minus 3.

148
00:08:22,815 --> 00:08:27,830
   

149
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,080
Fascinating.

150
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,620
   

151
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,770
Actually I drew this
original graph.

152
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,659
Since it's written this way,
since it's not written as a

153
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,789
square root, it actually
would kind of do

154
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:42,039
something like this.

155
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:45,750
   

156
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,180
You don't have to draw this.

157
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:47,870
So anyway.

158
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,600
Plus or minus 3.

159
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,240
So these are the possible
two points we could have

160
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,120
intersected.

161
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,130
And what the question is
asking is, what is the

162
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:00,130
greatest possible value
of the slope of l?

163
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:04,460
What we want to figure out--
If we want the greatest

164
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:09,170
possible value, we want to go
from a very low number to a

165
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:12,350
very high number, right?

166
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,880
The x values are fixed.

167
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,200
We want as great a possible
change in y, given that change

168
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,840
in x, right?

169
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,240
So if we want the lowest
possible value here, we'll go

170
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,540
with the negative 2.

171
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,100
If we want the highest
possible value of x,

172
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,082
we'll go with 3.

173
00:09:27,082 --> 00:09:28,320
So let's see.

174
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,940
So if we assume that, the
change in y is 3 minus

175
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:37,330
negative 2 over change
in x, 5 minus 0.

176
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,050
Adds up, right?

177
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,830
So this is 3 plus
2 is 5 over 5.

178
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,420
It equals 1.

179
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,170
That is the greatest
possible slope.

180
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,210
I'll see you in the
next video.

181
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,400
