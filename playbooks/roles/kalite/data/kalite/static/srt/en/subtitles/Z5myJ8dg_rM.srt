1
00:00:00,422 --> 00:00:02,512
Let's learn a little bit about the wonderful

2
00:00:02,512 --> 00:00:06,209
world of logarithms.

3
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:09,519
So we already know how to take exponents.

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,871
If I were to say 2 to the fourth power, what does that mean?

5
00:00:13,871 --> 00:00:18,846
Well that means 2 times 2 times 2 times 2.

6
00:00:18,846 --> 00:00:24,349
2 multiplied or repeatedly multiplied 4 times, and so

7
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:26,499
this is going to be

8
00:00:26,499 --> 00:00:27,630
2 times 2 is 4

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,887
times 2 is 8, times 2 is 16.

10
00:00:32,887 --> 00:00:35,346
But what if we think about things in another way.

11
00:00:35,346 --> 00:00:40,496
We know that we get to 16 when we raise 2 to some power

12
00:00:40,496 --> 00:00:42,908
but we want to know what that power is.

13
00:00:42,908 --> 00:00:46,651
So for example, let's say that I start with 2, and I say

14
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:52,832
I'm raising it to some power, what does that power have to be to get 16?

15
00:00:52,832 --> 00:01:00,369
Well we just figured that out. 'X' would have to be 4.

16
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:04,762
And this is what logarithms are fundamentally about, figuring out what power

17
00:01:04,762 --> 00:01:08,514
you have to raise to, to get another number.

18
00:01:08,514 --> 00:01:12,288
Now the way that we would denote this with logarithm notation

19
00:01:12,288 --> 00:01:15,269
is we would say, log, base--

20
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:18,182
actually let me make it a little bit more colourful.

21
00:01:18,182 --> 00:01:21,656
Log, base 2--

22
00:01:21,656 --> 00:01:23,592
I'll do this 2 in blue...

23
00:01:23,592 --> 00:01:31,777
Log, base 2, of 16

24
00:01:31,777 --> 00:01:36,118
is equal to what, or is equal in this case since we have the 'x' there,

25
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:39,975
is equal to 'x'?

26
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:45,063
This and this are completely equivalent statements.

27
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:49,078
This is saying "hey well if I take 2 to some 'x' power I get 16'."

28
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:57,388
This is saying, "what power do I need to raise 2 to, to get 16 and I'm going to set that to be equal to 'x'."

29
00:01:57,388 --> 00:01:59,927
And you'll say, "well you have to raise it to the fourth power and once again

30
00:01:59,927 --> 00:02:01,583
'x' is equal to 4.

31
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:07,670
So with that out of the way let's try more examples of evaluating logarithmic expressions.

32
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:12,051
Let's say you had...

33
00:02:12,051 --> 00:02:25,127
log, base 3, of 81. What would this evaluate to?

34
00:02:25,127 --> 00:02:31,319
Well this is a reminder, this evaluates to the power we have to raise 3 to, to get

35
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,053
to 81.

36
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:37,764
So if you want to, you can set this to be equal to an 'x', and you can

37
00:02:37,764 --> 00:02:48,779
restate this equation as, 3 to the 'x' power, is equal to 81.

38
00:02:48,779 --> 00:02:52,287
Why is a logarithm useful? And you'll see that it has very interesting properties

39
00:02:52,287 --> 00:02:53,112
later on.

40
00:02:53,112 --> 00:02:57,797
But you didn't necessarily have to use algebra. To do it this way, to say that 'x' is the power

41
00:02:57,797 --> 00:03:02,151
you raise 3 to to get to 81, you had to use algebra here, while with just

42
00:03:02,151 --> 00:03:06,257
a straight up logarithmic expression, you didn't really have to use any algebra, we didn't have to

43
00:03:06,257 --> 00:03:09,248
say that it was equal to 'x', we could just say that this evaluates to

44
00:03:09,248 --> 00:03:12,614
the power I need to raise 3 to to get to 81.

45
00:03:12,614 --> 00:03:15,895
The power I need to raise 3 to to get to 81.

46
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:19,398
Well what power do you have to raise 3 to to get to 81?

47
00:03:19,398 --> 00:03:21,244
Well let's experiment a little bit,

48
00:03:21,244 --> 00:03:25,799
so 3 to the first power is just 3, 3 to the second power is 9,

49
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:34,383
3 to the third power is 27, 3 to the fourth power, 27 times 3 is equal to 81.

50
00:03:34,383 --> 00:03:36,967
3 to the fourth power is equal to 81.

51
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,388
'X' is equal to four.

52
00:03:39,388 --> 00:03:41,169
So we could say...

53
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:50,953
Log, base 3, of 81, is equal to--

54
00:03:50,953 --> 00:03:53,993
I'll do this in a different colour.

55
00:03:53,993 --> 00:03:57,453
Is equal to 4.

56
00:03:57,453 --> 00:04:00,730
Let's do several more of these examples and I really encourage you to give a shot

57
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,548
on your own and hopefully you'll get the hang of it.

58
00:04:04,548 --> 00:04:09,647
So let's try a larger number, let's say we want to take

59
00:04:09,647 --> 00:04:17,511
log, base 6, of 216. What will this evaluate to?

60
00:04:17,511 --> 00:04:22,768
Well we're asking ourselves, "what power do we have to raise 6 to, to get 216?"

61
00:04:22,768 --> 00:04:27,237
6 to the first power is 6, 6 to the second power is 36,

62
00:04:27,237 --> 00:04:31,411
36 times 6 is 216.

63
00:04:31,411 --> 00:04:34,330
This is equal to 216.

64
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,451
So this is 6 to the third power is equal to 216.

65
00:04:37,451 --> 00:04:40,637
So if someone says "what power do I have to raise 6 to--

66
00:04:40,637 --> 00:04:41,851
this base here,

67
00:04:41,851 --> 00:04:44,328
to get to 216?"

68
00:04:44,328 --> 00:04:48,096
Well that's just going to be equal to 3.

69
00:04:48,096 --> 00:04:52,063
6 to the third power is equal to 216.

70
00:04:52,063 --> 00:04:56,891
Let's try another one. Let's say I had, I dunno,

71
00:04:56,891 --> 00:05:02,599
log, base 2, of 64.

72
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:06,056
So what does this evaluate to?

73
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:11,749
Well once again we're asking ourselves, "well this will evaluate to the exponent that I have to raise this

74
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:14,545
base 2, and you do this as a little subscript right here.

75
00:05:14,545 --> 00:05:18,748
The exponent that I have to raise 2 to, to get to 64."

76
00:05:18,748 --> 00:05:22,217
So 2 to the first power is 2, 2 to the second power is 4,

77
00:05:22,217 --> 00:05:27,369
8, 16, 32, 64.

78
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:34,663
So this right over here is 2 to the sixth power, is equal to 64. So when you evaluate this expression

79
00:05:34,663 --> 00:05:38,518
you say "what power do I have to raise 2 to, to get to 64?"

80
00:05:38,518 --> 00:05:43,812
Well I have to raise to the sixth power.

81
00:05:43,812 --> 00:05:49,097
Let's do a slightly more straightforward one, or maybe this will be less

82
00:05:49,097 --> 00:05:51,349
straightforward depending on how you view it.

83
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:58,245
What is log, base 100, of 1?

84
00:05:58,245 --> 00:06:00,626
I'll let you think about that for a second.

85
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:05,101
100 is a subscript so it's, log, base 100, of 1.

86
00:06:05,101 --> 00:06:08,091
That's one way to think about it, I'll put parentheses around the 1.

87
00:06:08,091 --> 00:06:10,991
What does this evaluate to?

88
00:06:10,991 --> 00:06:15,044
Well this is asking ourselves, or we would evaluate this as,

89
00:06:15,044 --> 00:06:22,197
"what power do I have to raise 100 to, to get to 1?"

90
00:06:22,197 --> 00:06:24,241
So let me write this down as an equation.

91
00:06:24,241 --> 00:06:26,909
If I set this to be equal to 'x', this is literally saying

92
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:31,598
100, to what power, is equal to 1?

93
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:34,424
Well anything that a 0 power is equal to 1.

94
00:06:34,424 --> 00:06:36,707
So in this case 'x' is equal to 0.

95
00:06:36,707 --> 00:06:44,114
So log, base 100, of 1, is going to be equal to 0.

96
00:06:44,114 --> 00:06:50,933
Log base anything of 1, is going to be equal to 0 because anything to the 0

97
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:55,905
power and we're not talking about 0 here. Anything that is to the power of 0

98
00:06:55,905 --> 00:07:01,328
that is not 0, is going to be equal to 1.
