1
00:00:00,374 --> 00:00:06,992
This right here is a fresco by Raphael of Plato hanging out with his best student Aristotle

2
00:00:06,992 --> 00:00:12,370
And you may or may not know that these two fellows along with Plato's teacher Socrates

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,904
are considered the fathers of Western philosophy,

4
00:00:15,904 --> 00:00:18,168
but that's not what this video is about.

5
00:00:18,168 --> 00:00:23,253
This is actually just a small little video about different dates or better

6
00:00:23,253 --> 00:00:28,169
different ways to specify dates or dating machinisms.

7
00:00:28,169 --> 00:00:35,574
And so if you were to look up Plato's birth you might get either 428 or 427

8
00:00:35,574 --> 00:00:37,404
but we'll go with 428 -

9
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:40,872
if you were to look up Plato's birth

10
00:00:41,349 --> 00:00:46,405
you might see it written as 428 BC

11
00:00:46,405 --> 00:00:52,444
or you might see it written as 428 BCE

12
00:00:52,444 --> 00:00:55,657
and the natural question is: what's the difference here?

13
00:00:55,657 --> 00:00:59,080
They both have BC but this one has an E and it's the same year right now.

14
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:04,240
And the answer is that these are referring to the exact same year in history

15
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,993
but the acronyms here do stand for different things.

16
00:01:07,993 --> 00:01:13,061
BC literally stands for Before Christ

17
00:01:13,292 --> 00:01:17,436
so the date is written 428 BC.

18
00:01:17,436 --> 00:01:22,658
The implication is that this is 428 years before the birth of Christ.

19
00:01:22,658 --> 00:01:25,236
We'll see in a second that that's not exactly right

20
00:01:25,236 --> 00:01:29,033
but that's what the implication is. If someone writes BCE

21
00:01:29,033 --> 00:01:32,373
they're saying something very different. The B still stands for before.

22
00:01:32,373 --> 00:01:42,037
So the B still stands for Before. But the CE. The C in CE does not stand for Christ anymore. It now stands

23
00:01:42,037 --> 00:01:52,122
for Common. And so the CE part is Common Era.

24
00:01:52,214 --> 00:01:57,971
Even though it's not referring to Christ any more, there is kind of intention here

25
00:01:57,971 --> 00:02:02,034
so that it is less religious than the term Before Christ

26
00:02:02,034 --> 00:02:04,910
it is still kind of putting an importance on Christ's birth

27
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:09,576
because it is saying that the Common Era is the time period after the birth of Christ

28
00:02:09,576 --> 00:02:11,775
which we'll see in a second isn't exactly right

29
00:02:11,775 --> 00:02:15,367
but it's essentially the same exact dating sheme.

30
00:02:15,367 --> 00:02:18,578
One not directly referring to Christ,

31
00:02:18,578 --> 00:02:21,578
one that is directly referring to Christ.

32
00:02:21,578 --> 00:02:27,837
Similarly, this right here is a painting of Christopher Columbus

33
00:02:27,837 --> 00:02:29,502
and if you would look up in history books

34
00:02:29,502 --> 00:02:31,177
you'd know what was his first voyage

35
00:02:31,177 --> 00:02:34,657
and when did he first show up in the New World

36
00:02:34,657 --> 00:02:38,834
fighting an island in the Bahamas you would see it written as

37
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:44,102
either 1492 or AD 1492

38
00:02:44,102 --> 00:02:49,908
or 1492 CE.

39
00:02:49,908 --> 00:02:53,238
And once again these are all referring to the same year

40
00:02:53,238 --> 00:02:55,769
just using different acronyms.

41
00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:57,906
One of them is a little bit more religious

42
00:02:57,906 --> 00:03:00,330
or more directly refers to Christ

43
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,435
and one is a little less religious.

44
00:03:02,435 --> 00:03:06,769
So AD some people think it refers to After Death --

45
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:09,044
it does not refer to After Death.

46
00:03:09,044 --> 00:03:11,913
Because if you think about it if you have years before the Christ and

47
00:03:11,913 --> 00:03:18,503
if you start numbering years after his death how would you number the years during his life?

48
00:03:18,503 --> 00:03:21,769
So AD does not stand for After Death.

49
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:29,027
It stands for Anno Domini.

50
00:03:29,134 --> 00:03:31,444
Which literally means -- Anno means year

51
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:36,664
and Domini means Lord or the Lord or the year of our Lord

52
00:03:36,664 --> 00:03:43,997
and one anno domini 1 AD would be the year of Jesus Christ's birth

53
00:03:43,997 --> 00:03:46,577
so not after death, it stands for Anno Domini

54
00:03:46,577 --> 00:03:51,579
but literally Year of our Lord, so year since that Jesus was born.

55
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:56,664
With year one being the... implicitly starting with his birth.

56
00:03:56,664 --> 00:03:58,378
And we'll see in a second that's not exactly right.

57
00:03:58,378 --> 00:04:04,411
CE stands for Common Era.

58
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:08,913
Once again, 1 CE is the same thing as AD 1,

59
00:04:08,913 --> 00:04:14,437
sometimes, we now write AD 1492 or we write 1492 AD,

60
00:04:14,437 --> 00:04:18,077
all referrig to the exact same thing.

61
00:04:18,077 --> 00:04:23,593
Now, all of these things refer to... you know, when we say 428 BC

62
00:04:23,593 --> 00:04:27,080
it implies 428 years before the birth of Christ,

63
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:32,075
1492 AD that's in the Year of our Lord 1492

64
00:04:32,075 --> 00:04:36,441
and it implies 1492 years since the birth of Christ,

65
00:04:36,441 --> 00:04:40,246
but the reality is that we're not really quite sure

66
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:44,249
when Christ was born and so these aren't exactly.

67
00:04:44,249 --> 00:04:47,992
You know, Columubus didn't sail across the Atlantic

68
00:04:47,992 --> 00:04:51,974
exactly 1492 years after the birth of Christ.

69
00:04:51,974 --> 00:04:58,502
Most historians put the birth of Christ at 7-2 BC or BCE

70
00:04:58,502 --> 00:05:00,703
depending on how you want to view it.

71
00:05:00,703 --> 00:05:03,637
Remember, BC is Before Christ, which is little ironic,

72
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,774
because we're talking about the actual birth of Christ,

73
00:05:05,774 --> 00:05:08,914
BCE is Before the Common Era.

74
00:05:08,914 --> 00:05:15,703
And they put his death at 30-36 AD which is 30-36 in the Year of our Lord,

75
00:05:15,703 --> 00:05:19,171
that's what this stands for, Anno Domini,

76
00:05:19,171 --> 00:05:22,323
or in the Common Era, CE.

77
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:30,241
Now, some people they obviously don't like the BC/AD naming mechanism

78
00:05:30,241 --> 00:05:32,906
because it's explicitly referring to Christ and every year

79
00:05:32,906 --> 00:05:36,170
it makes Christ the central figure in all of history,

80
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:41,260
so they'll say this is clearly too Christian

81
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:48,368
and they would prefer the less Christian naming scheme

82
00:05:48,368 --> 00:05:54,460
where we use BCE and CE.

83
00:05:54,691 --> 00:05:58,325
But lot of people would still say: hey look, ok, you changed... or, you know

84
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:00,168
first of all some Christians wouldn't like this

85
00:06:00,168 --> 00:06:03,746
that you removed the direct references to the birth of Christ

86
00:06:03,746 --> 00:06:07,378
or being the years since Christ's birth,

87
00:06:07,378 --> 00:06:12,908
but even here some people would complain that

88
00:06:12,908 --> 00:06:15,332
althought you've removed the direct reference

89
00:06:15,332 --> 00:06:18,502
that this is saying Before the Common Era and the Common Era,

90
00:06:18,502 --> 00:06:22,170
even though you've removed the direct reference, it still makes Christ's birth

91
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,994
the central thing in all of history.

92
00:06:24,994 --> 00:06:28,764
But this is the convention whether people like it or not

93
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:32,663
in order to have the same reference point

94
00:06:32,663 --> 00:06:35,914
and theologically it's difficult to switch it, this time,

95
00:06:35,914 --> 00:06:38,665
every one has essentially settled on this.

96
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:41,703
So it's really just a matter of letters,

97
00:06:41,703 --> 00:06:44,506
which naming scheme you pick.

98
00:06:44,506 --> 00:06:46,576
The whole point of this video is that you don't get

99
00:06:46,576 --> 00:06:50,259
confused between BC and BCE, that you don't think that

100
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:53,507
AD stands for After Death, it stands for Anno Domini,

101
00:06:53,507 --> 00:06:56,991
the Year of the Lord or the Year of our Lord

102
00:06:56,991 --> 00:07:00,035
and CE stands for Common Era.

103
00:07:00,035 --> 00:07:04,575
This and this are referring to essentially the same count,

104
00:07:04,575 --> 00:07:09,445
after the birth of Christ, or the theoretical birth of Christ

105
00:07:09,445 --> 00:07:11,835
which we don't really know when it actually happened,

106
00:07:11,835 --> 00:07:17,704
it probably did not happen at the beginning of 1 AD or 1 CE.

107
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:25,436
These two things both also refer to the same direction in the timeline.

108
00:07:25,436 --> 00:07:27,999
One last thing I want to point out is that

109
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,307
there is no year zero.

110
00:07:30,307 --> 00:07:36,034
So if you take either of these naming schemes, you have...

111
00:07:36,034 --> 00:07:38,906
so let's go very close to the years one.

112
00:07:38,906 --> 00:07:42,660
So there is at some point this theoretical birth of Christ

113
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,580
which is probably not the actual birth of Christ,

114
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:50,236
but at that theoretical point, right at that point

115
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:55,170
you have 31 December of the previous year,

116
00:07:55,170 --> 00:08:04,110
all of sudden now you have 1 January 1 AD or CE

117
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:17,770
and the year before that was 1 BC or BCE,

118
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,643
depending on how you wanna refer to it.

119
00:08:19,643 --> 00:08:22,914
So there is no year zero in this scheme.

120
00:08:22,914 --> 00:08:25,702
And the last thing I want to emphasize,

121
00:08:25,702 --> 00:08:27,044
and it might be obvious to you,

122
00:08:27,044 --> 00:08:31,912
is the larger number you have here,

123
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:33,657
the further back you're going in time.

124
00:08:33,657 --> 00:08:35,581
Because this is saying how many years

125
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,436
before this theoretical birth of Crhist,

126
00:08:37,436 --> 00:08:42,436
and obviously, the larger numbers the further you're going off

127
00:08:42,436 --> 00:08:44,778
into the future. And if you want to figure out

128
00:08:44,778 --> 00:08:48,502
how many years passed between Plato's birth

129
00:08:48,502 --> 00:08:54,168
and Columbus's sailing across the Atlantic to find the New World,

130
00:08:54,168 --> 00:08:57,660
you would say: well, look at it, it took 428 years to go

131
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:02,437
form Plato's birth to this theoretical birth of Christ

132
00:09:02,437 --> 00:09:06,707
and there is another 1492 years to wait until Columbus gets his ships together,

133
00:09:06,707 --> 00:09:09,662
so the total number of years would be,

134
00:09:09,662 --> 00:09:14,036
428 years to get to Christ from Plato's birth

135
00:09:14,036 --> 00:09:20,172
and then you have another 1492 years to wait for Columbus,

136
00:09:20,172 --> 00:09:22,103
so it's eight plus two, that is ten,

137
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,571
as you can see I just want to add a little arithmetic in this video,

138
00:09:25,571 --> 00:09:28,823
so one plus two plus nine is twelve,

139
00:09:28,853 --> 00:09:32,433
and then we have nine, one plus four plus four...

140
00:09:32,433 --> 00:09:36,157
so 1920 years between the Plato's birth

141
00:09:36,157 --> 00:09:40,157
and Columbus sailing across the Atlantic.
