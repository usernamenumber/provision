1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,159
Before we go into the actual conflict

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:03,472
of the Korean War,

3
00:00:03,472 --> 00:00:07,219
let's try to get a sense of the historical environment

4
00:00:07,219 --> 00:00:08,864
going into the Korean War.

5
00:00:08,864 --> 00:00:10,695
So if you go all the way back

6
00:00:10,695 --> 00:00:13,036
to the late 1800s [and] early 1900s,

7
00:00:13,036 --> 00:00:14,803
the Korean peninsula,

8
00:00:14,803 --> 00:00:17,419
what we now consider both North and South Korea,

9
00:00:17,419 --> 00:00:20,868
they were occupied by the Japanese military.

10
00:00:20,868 --> 00:00:25,506
Then, in 1910, the Korean peninsula [was]

11
00:00:25,506 --> 00:00:28,621
formally annexed into the Japanese empire.

12
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:30,736
So, the Japanese are essentially this colonial,

13
00:00:30,736 --> 00:00:32,470
this imperialist power here.

14
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,325
And they stay in power in the Korean peninsula

15
00:00:35,325 --> 00:00:38,840
all the way until the end of World War II.

16
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,441
And it's probably worth saying here

17
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:41,106
--it's probably worth maybe

18
00:00:41,106 --> 00:00:42,723
doing a bunch of videos here --

19
00:00:42,723 --> 00:00:45,033
that the Japanese occupation

20
00:00:45,033 --> 00:00:48,023
was not a pleasant occupation for the Korean people.

21
00:00:48,023 --> 00:00:51,287
They subjugated the Korean people in multiple ways:

22
00:00:51,287 --> 00:00:54,192
forced labor; forced prostitution;

23
00:00:54,192 --> 00:00:57,525
they tried to kind of eradicate the Korean language

24
00:00:57,525 --> 00:00:58,796
and the Korean culture.

25
00:00:58,796 --> 00:01:01,991
So this was not in a any way a pleasant occupation.

26
00:01:01,991 --> 00:01:03,926
They weren't pleasant imperialists.

27
00:01:03,926 --> 00:01:06,920
But we fast forward all the way to 1945,

28
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,152
we know that Japan loses World War II.

29
00:01:10,152 --> 00:01:14,022
And, the major two victors on the Allied side

30
00:01:14,022 --> 00:01:16,290
-- that are kind of acting in this part of the world --

31
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,650
are the United States and the Soviet Union.

32
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,322
And so, [in] 1945,

33
00:01:21,322 --> 00:01:26,119
you have the Soviets coming from above [the north],

34
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,040
That's the Soviets, coming from above.

35
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,602
and eventually you have the Americans

36
00:01:30,602 --> 00:01:31,937
coming from below.

37
00:01:31,937 --> 00:01:35,209
They occupy Japan first. So this is the USA.

38
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:37,191
And they essentially, you remember, at this point

39
00:01:37,191 --> 00:01:38,606
-- even though this is kind of

40
00:01:38,606 --> 00:01:40,053
the beginning of the Cold War --

41
00:01:40,053 --> 00:01:41,724
at this point in WWII,

42
00:01:41,724 --> 00:01:44,223
the United States and the Soviet Union are allies.

43
00:01:44,223 --> 00:01:45,117
And so, the United States

44
00:01:45,117 --> 00:01:45,922
kind of tells the Soviet Union,

45
00:01:45,922 --> 00:01:51,752
"Hey, why don't we just stop at the 38th parallel?"

46
00:01:51,752 --> 00:01:53,052
And the United States didn't even think

47
00:01:53,052 --> 00:01:54,624
that the Soviets would stop there.

48
00:01:54,624 --> 00:01:55,738
But they actually did.

49
00:01:55,738 --> 00:01:57,123
And from the Soviets point of view --

50
00:01:57,123 --> 00:01:58,332
-- It's believed that they stopped there --

51
00:01:58,332 --> 00:01:59,214
Because the United States

52
00:01:59,214 --> 00:02:00,221
didn't get there at the same time.

53
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:01,532
So, there was no one to stop them

54
00:02:01,532 --> 00:02:02,805
from going further south.

55
00:02:02,805 --> 00:02:04,565
But it's believed that the Soviets

56
00:02:04,565 --> 00:02:06,170
wanted to uphold their side of the agreement

57
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,568
so that they could get --

58
00:02:07,568 --> 00:02:09,201
so that they would be a trusted party

59
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:10,500
to negotiations in Europe,

60
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,366
and maybe get more in Europe,

61
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:15,688
which is what the Soviets maybe cared about more.

62
00:02:15,688 --> 00:02:17,950
So what happens after WWII is that, the North

63
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,352
-- what's now North Korea, essentially, --

64
00:02:20,352 --> 00:02:22,992
becomes [territory] under the influence of Soviets.

65
00:02:22,992 --> 00:02:24,687
Everything below the 38th parallel

66
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:28,369
becomes under the influence of the United States.

67
00:02:28,369 --> 00:02:29,826
The Soviets, essentially,

68
00:02:29,826 --> 00:02:32,904
install this gentleman right over here

69
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:35,781
to lead North Korea, Kim Il Sung,

70
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:38,840
or the part of Korea that is north of the 38th parallel.

71
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,021
At this point, this was just kind of viewed as a point

72
00:02:41,021 --> 00:02:42,237
where the Soviets and the United States should

73
00:02:42,237 --> 00:02:44,232
kind of meet up, where they would have to stop.

74
00:02:44,232 --> 00:02:45,833
It wasn't meant to be

75
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,523
an actual partition of the country.

76
00:02:47,523 --> 00:02:48,475
(But as we'll see,

77
00:02:48,475 --> 00:02:51,078
it actually becomes a partition of the country.)

78
00:02:51,078 --> 00:02:53,279
But the Soviets install Kim Il Sung.

79
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:57,318
He sets up, essentially, a communist dictatorship,

80
00:02:57,318 --> 00:02:59,468
in the north, and this is the current leader of

81
00:02:59,468 --> 00:03:02,462
North Korea's dad. This is Kim Jong Il's dad.

82
00:03:02,462 --> 00:03:04,237
So he gets installed in the north.

83
00:03:04,237 --> 00:03:05,855
And in the South,

84
00:03:05,855 --> 00:03:08,583
if you fast forward a little bit to 1948,

85
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,201
there's an attempt at elections,

86
00:03:10,201 --> 00:03:13,133
but those elections are seriously rigged,

87
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:15,564
and this gentleman, Syngmyn Rhee, comes to power.

88
00:03:15,564 --> 00:03:16,661
And although he might look like

89
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:18,164
a nice, pleasant man,

90
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:19,798
he was actually fairly ruthless,

91
00:03:19,798 --> 00:03:22,236
and he is unanimously considered a strongman.

92
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:24,535
And on both sides of this, this is, once again,

93
00:03:24,535 --> 00:03:26,035
this is one of those situations where

94
00:03:26,035 --> 00:03:29,282
you really can't call either of these guys good guys,

95
00:03:29,282 --> 00:03:32,719
'cause both of them are...have done

96
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:37,082
some pretty nasty things to each other,

97
00:03:37,082 --> 00:03:41,285
to soldiers on either side, and to innocent civilians.

98
00:03:41,285 --> 00:03:43,553
But Syngmyn Rhee comes to power in the south,

99
00:03:43,553 --> 00:03:45,765
and his, I guess, most attractive feature

100
00:03:45,765 --> 00:03:50,550
to the Americans is that he is not a communist.

101
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,366
And so you have this situation setting up

102
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,765
Communist North, above [the] 38th parallel;

103
00:03:54,765 --> 00:03:57,701
noncommunist South, controlled by Syngmyn Rhee,

104
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:59,448
supported by the United States.

105
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:00,661
The other thing that happens is that

106
00:04:00,661 --> 00:04:02,302
the Soviets helped

107
00:04:02,302 --> 00:04:03,970
build up the North Korean military,

108
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,437
The United States is not as encouraging of

109
00:04:06,437 --> 00:04:07,953
a strong South Korean military.

110
00:04:07,953 --> 00:04:10,035
So you start having an imbalance

111
00:04:10,035 --> 00:04:12,781
between the military of the north and the south.

112
00:04:12,781 --> 00:04:15,449
And obviously, either one of these parties---

113
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:18,365
Kim Il Sung wants to unite North Korea under his rule

114
00:04:18,365 --> 00:04:19,336
under his communist rule.

115
00:04:19,336 --> 00:04:22,432
Syngmyn Rhee wants to unite Korea

116
00:04:22,432 --> 00:04:24,753
under his authoritarian rule.

117
00:04:24,753 --> 00:04:26,098
So they're both kind of

118
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:31,929
setting up troops along the border.

119
00:04:31,929 --> 00:04:35,254
And this whole time you have skirmishes

120
00:04:35,254 --> 00:04:37,119
going on across the border.

121
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:38,049
And just to give you a context,

122
00:04:38,049 --> 00:04:38,971
you're probably saying, "Wait,

123
00:04:38,971 --> 00:04:40,602
Korea, you know, is right next to China,

124
00:04:40,602 --> 00:04:42,161
what was going on there? "

125
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:45,494
And if you go to China in 1949,

126
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:47,230
the Communists come to power,

127
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,119
there was a civil war leading up to that,

128
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:51,681
between the Communists led by Mao Zedong,

129
00:04:51,681 --> 00:04:54,652
and the Nationalists led by Chang Kai Shek

130
00:04:54,652 --> 00:04:56,546
Mao Zedong comes to power.

131
00:04:56,546 --> 00:05:00,007
He wants to support the communists in North Korea,

132
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:01,239
especially because some of those

133
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:04,665
communists in North Korea actually helped fight

134
00:05:04,665 --> 00:05:10,592
on the communist side during the Chinese civil war.

135
00:05:10,592 --> 00:05:12,000
So this is an important factor right here.

136
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,769
Mao Zedong is interested in spreading Communism.

137
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:18,005
He doesn't like the Americans in South Korea.

138
00:05:18,005 --> 00:05:20,248
And he feels some type of allegiance

139
00:05:20,248 --> 00:05:22,172
to the communists in North Korea.

140
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:28,739
So now you fast forward to June 25, 1950.

141
00:05:28,739 --> 00:05:30,574
And in the North, you have a major---

142
00:05:30,574 --> 00:05:32,355
There's a lot...the North...

143
00:05:32,355 --> 00:05:34,967
The North Korean army-- And it's not called

144
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,367
North Korea at this point.

145
00:05:36,367 --> 00:05:38,487
They both consider themselves Korea --

146
00:05:38,487 --> 00:05:40,890
competing, I guess, governments of Korea.

147
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:44,649
The army in the north is disproportionately stronger

148
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:45,755
than [the army in] the south.

149
00:05:45,755 --> 00:05:47,103
And so they invade.

150
00:05:47,103 --> 00:05:48,718
They view this as their chance

151
00:05:48,718 --> 00:05:50,651
at unifying the peninsula.

152
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:53,269
And essentially they're able to almost just kind of

153
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,202
storm through the Korean peninsula.

154
00:05:55,202 --> 00:05:57,339
Immediately when that happens,

155
00:05:57,339 --> 00:05:59,552
the UN and especially the United States --

156
00:05:59,552 --> 00:06:01,141
and this is because at this point,

157
00:06:01,141 --> 00:06:03,739
the Soviet Union was boycotting the Security Council,

158
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:05,273
so they couldn't even veto it.

159
00:06:05,273 --> 00:06:07,755
The UN immediately started supplying

160
00:06:07,755 --> 00:06:11,299
naval and air support for the South Koreans.

161
00:06:11,299 --> 00:06:14,674
But, the disparity is so big that the North Koreans

162
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,623
are able to just keep marching forward.

163
00:06:17,623 --> 00:06:20,307
Within a few days, literally by July 1st,

164
00:06:20,307 --> 00:06:24,365
the US decides to commit ground forces--

165
00:06:24,365 --> 00:06:26,474
Because we had substantial ground forces in Japan,

166
00:06:26,474 --> 00:06:28,171
which isn't that far away.

167
00:06:28,171 --> 00:06:30,001
Just to give you a global perspective,

168
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:31,782
this is the Korean peninsula, right here;

169
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:33,688
and this is Japan. I know I could have probably

170
00:06:33,688 --> 00:06:35,054
found a bigger picture of that,

171
00:06:35,054 --> 00:06:37,298
but America had military forces in Japan

172
00:06:37,298 --> 00:06:38,854
that they could send, and so...

173
00:06:38,854 --> 00:06:41,006
and the Americans enter the force...

174
00:06:41,006 --> 00:06:44,257
enter the battle in a major way very early on,

175
00:06:44,257 --> 00:06:46,772
but that doesn't stop the North Koreans for some time

176
00:06:46,772 --> 00:06:49,605
So the North Koreans got all the way...they're able to

177
00:06:49,605 --> 00:06:51,905
occupy all of the Korean peninsula except for

178
00:06:51,905 --> 00:06:53,706
kind of the northeastern corner.

179
00:06:53,706 --> 00:06:56,783
They get around this far. So over here you have

180
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:58,036
the city of Pussan,

181
00:06:58,036 --> 00:07:02,510
and this is called the Pussan perimeter

182
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,217
And it's at the Pussan perimeter that

183
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:06,948
you have a little bit of a...

184
00:07:06,948 --> 00:07:09,709
the United States and the Korean forces combined

185
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:12,513
are able to halt the North Korean,

186
00:07:12,513 --> 00:07:14,997
and you have a kind of a slight stalemate

187
00:07:14,997 --> 00:07:16,568
for a couple of months here,

188
00:07:16,568 --> 00:07:18,099
but while that stalemate is happening,

189
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:19,677
the United States is able to...

190
00:07:19,677 --> 00:07:21,783
and especially the UN, but it's mainly the United States

191
00:07:21,783 --> 00:07:24,978
is able to build up significant troops

192
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:27,950
within the Pussan perimeter, but even more,

193
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:33,358
and at this point, the United States or..and the UN forces

194
00:07:33,358 --> 00:07:36,865
go under the control of Douglas MacArthur,

195
00:07:36,865 --> 00:07:38,861
General Douglas MacArthur,

196
00:07:38,861 --> 00:07:40,332
who's a bit of an interesting character.

197
00:07:40,332 --> 00:07:41,501
Until this point,

198
00:07:41,501 --> 00:07:45,184
he was able to kind of rule Japan with an iron fist.

199
00:07:45,184 --> 00:07:48,959
He's a hugely popular war hero in America.

200
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:51,468
And the current President, Truman,

201
00:07:51,468 --> 00:07:54,763
kind of has little trouble controlling MacArthur

202
00:07:54,763 --> 00:07:56,076
especially during the Korean War

203
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,952
We'll see that MacArthur really oversteps his bounds

204
00:07:58,952 --> 00:08:02,500
during the course of this war.

205
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,847
Now at this point,

206
00:08:03,847 --> 00:08:06,100
you have the South Koreans and the Americans

207
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,792
kind of cornered it out down here

208
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:08,832
inside the Pussan perimeter.

209
00:08:08,832 --> 00:08:11,501
It looks like North Korea is on the verge of the victory,

210
00:08:11,501 --> 00:08:12,982
but the US is able to build forces.

211
00:08:12,982 --> 00:08:15,304
And the Korean War really just starts

212
00:08:15,304 --> 00:08:17,049
becoming into a game of Risk.

213
00:08:17,049 --> 00:08:18,694
I don't know if you've ever played the game of Risk,

214
00:08:18,694 --> 00:08:20,412
but whenever somebody's turn,

215
00:08:20,412 --> 00:08:22,001
they are able to spread their forces

216
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:22,945
but then they get spread in.

217
00:08:22,945 --> 00:08:24,982
And the other side is able to come back.

218
00:08:24,982 --> 00:08:26,325
We will see that the rest of the Korean War

219
00:08:26,325 --> 00:08:27,666
is essentially a back-and-forth

220
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:30,802
between the Communists in the North,

221
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:31,831
supported by the Chinese,

222
00:08:31,831 --> 00:08:34,181
although the Chinese aren't in the war officially just yet;

223
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:37,415
and then the Americans in the south.

224
00:08:37,415 --> 00:08:39,732
And the first really smart thing that MacArthur does

225
00:08:39,732 --> 00:08:40,528
is that he says, "Look,

226
00:08:40,528 --> 00:08:43,197
instead of trying to fight our way through

227
00:08:43,197 --> 00:08:45,594
the Korean forces that are over here,

228
00:08:45,594 --> 00:08:47,478
instead of trying to fight our way through

229
00:08:47,478 --> 00:08:49,280
all of these Korean forces that are over here,

230
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,749
why don't we just kind of outflank them?

231
00:08:51,749 --> 00:08:53,077
And why don't we use our navy

232
00:08:53,077 --> 00:08:57,897
to do an amphibious landing of an army at Incheon.

233
00:08:57,897 --> 00:08:59,701
So in Septmeber 15,

234
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:01,613
well you have kind of the stalemate over here.

235
00:09:01,613 --> 00:09:03,143
The United States,

236
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:04,519
they have an amphibious landing,

237
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:06,249
so they send troops from all of these places.

238
00:09:06,249 --> 00:09:08,231
They have an amphibious landing at Incheon

239
00:09:08,231 --> 00:09:10,623
which is near Seoul.

240
00:09:10,623 --> 00:09:14,187
So, they land right over... they land at Incheon,

241
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:15,655
which is roughly over there

242
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,002
(I'm not super accurate here).

243
00:09:17,002 --> 00:09:19,518
And what's interesting about that is that in any battle,

244
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:21,505
all of these Korean troops, right here,

245
00:09:21,505 --> 00:09:22,754
they have supply chains.

246
00:09:22,754 --> 00:09:24,654
They have to get food, supplies,

247
00:09:24,654 --> 00:09:26,271
and fresh troops from up here,

248
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,488
and so the further in you go into enemy territory,

249
00:09:28,488 --> 00:09:30,538
the more spread-out your troops get.

250
00:09:30,538 --> 00:09:31,934
And the strategy here is,

251
00:09:31,934 --> 00:09:33,714
instead of fighting through this,

252
00:09:33,714 --> 00:09:35,139
what if we outflank them

253
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:38,180
and are able to land a significant force right here,

254
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,501
[in order to] immediately disrupt the supply lines

255
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:41,672
of the North Koreans?

256
00:09:41,672 --> 00:09:43,883
And that's essentially what the Americans did,

257
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,823
and it was successful.

258
00:09:45,823 --> 00:09:47,775
So, McArthur looks like a genius over here,

259
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,297
and he is able to re-take Seoul;

260
00:09:50,297 --> 00:09:53,718
he's able to kind of take the North Korean capital

261
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,520
at this point -- PyongYang --

262
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,182
and you have the Americans marching North.

263
00:09:57,182 --> 00:09:57,990
So, all of a sudden,

264
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,235
it started off with the North Koreans

265
00:09:59,235 --> 00:10:00,564
being able to roll down,

266
00:10:00,564 --> 00:10:01,522
and all of a sudden,

267
00:10:01,522 --> 00:10:04,423
the Americans and South Koreans are able to roll up,

268
00:10:04,423 --> 00:10:07,085
and they're feeling pretty good about themselves.

269
00:10:07,085 --> 00:10:08,136
And the whole time,

270
00:10:08,136 --> 00:10:11,184
Truman's trying to keep MacArthur under check.

271
00:10:11,184 --> 00:10:13,151
McArthur's excited. He's ultra-confident.

272
00:10:13,151 --> 00:10:15,055
He thinks that the troops

273
00:10:15,055 --> 00:10:16,472
are going to be home by Christmas.

274
00:10:16,472 --> 00:10:19,722
He doesn't think China is serious

275
00:10:19,722 --> 00:10:22,234
about supporting the North Koreans.

276
00:10:22,234 --> 00:10:23,132
And even more, he almost--

277
00:10:23,132 --> 00:10:25,584
it seems he wants to pick a fight with China

278
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:29,473
because he wants to maybe eliminate Communism

279
00:10:29,473 --> 00:10:30,554
in China as well.

280
00:10:30,554 --> 00:10:31,434
He's kind of, you know,

281
00:10:31,434 --> 00:10:33,672
on this mission to eliminate Communism

282
00:10:33,672 --> 00:10:34,924
from all of Asia.

283
00:10:34,924 --> 00:10:37,237
So, Truman is saying "limit the war;

284
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:41,184
don't cross the Yalu River, and be careful.

285
00:10:41,184 --> 00:10:43,485
Don't... you now, don't start attacking Chinese

286
00:10:43,485 --> 00:10:45,101
up here [to] enrage them.

287
00:10:45,101 --> 00:10:47,802
You're going to have them enter the war.”

288
00:10:47,802 --> 00:10:50,427
MacArthur doesn't take that too seriously.

289
00:10:50,427 --> 00:10:51,396
He also says,

290
00:10:51,396 --> 00:10:52,526
"Look. I have to start

291
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,552
bombing bombs across the Yalu River,

292
00:10:54,552 --> 00:10:56,151
so that the Chinese won't be able to

293
00:10:56,151 --> 00:11:00,892
send troops and supplies to aid the North Koreans."

294
00:11:00,892 --> 00:11:02,466
So, he's marching up, all confident,

295
00:11:02,466 --> 00:11:04,415
going up against the Yalu River.

296
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:10,406
And this whole time, the Chinese, under Mao Zedong,

297
00:11:10,406 --> 00:11:12,695
are sending a pretty substantial army.

298
00:11:12,695 --> 00:11:13,994
They're able to do it secretly;

299
00:11:13,994 --> 00:11:15,386
they're able to march at night,

300
00:11:15,386 --> 00:11:16,957
and they even have these policies

301
00:11:16,957 --> 00:11:19,587
where if any surveillance planes go overhead,

302
00:11:19,587 --> 00:11:21,608
all of the Chinese soldiers have to freeze.

303
00:11:21,608 --> 00:11:22,806
And if they don't freeze,

304
00:11:22,806 --> 00:11:24,642
someone else is allowed to shoot them.

305
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,057
Everyone wants to freeze,

306
00:11:26,057 --> 00:11:28,171
so that no one can really see them from above.

307
00:11:28,171 --> 00:11:31,638
So, it's really kind of a secret build-up of troops

308
00:11:31,638 --> 00:11:32,953
across the Yalu River,

309
00:11:32,953 --> 00:11:35,621
and this whole time, MacArthur is just ultra...

310
00:11:35,621 --> 00:11:37,944
ultra-confident about what's happening over here.

311
00:11:37,944 --> 00:11:40,588
But then you fast-forward until the end of October --

312
00:11:40,588 --> 00:11:42,392
the Americans think that they're on the verge

313
00:11:42,392 --> 00:11:43,953
of winning the Korean War,

314
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,084
and all of a sudden

315
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:47,254
you have the Chinese cross the Yalu River.

316
00:11:47,254 --> 00:11:48,776
The Americans didn't even know

317
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:51,422
that the Chinese had major forces ready to cross.

318
00:11:51,422 --> 00:11:52,407
And now you have

319
00:11:52,407 --> 00:11:53,791
--once again, it's like a game of Risk--

320
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,092
now you have the Chinese across;

321
00:11:55,092 --> 00:11:57,065
they catch the Americans unsuspected,

322
00:11:57,065 --> 00:11:58,226
they engage a few times.

323
00:11:58,226 --> 00:11:59,066
The Americans weren't sure

324
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:00,102
if the Chinese were serious

325
00:12:00,102 --> 00:12:01,235
and they keep re-engaging them,

326
00:12:01,235 --> 00:12:02,536
but then it becomes clear:

327
00:12:02,536 --> 00:12:05,748
yes, the Chinese are serious.

328
00:12:05,748 --> 00:12:07,449
Essentially, the Chinese are able to

329
00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:09,892
push back the Americans and the South Koreans

330
00:12:09,892 --> 00:12:11,231
all the way back,

331
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,950
so that they are able to re-capture Seoul.

332
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,706
But once again, like any game of "Risk" ,

333
00:12:15,706 --> 00:12:17,849
now the Chinese are spread thin;

334
00:12:17,849 --> 00:12:20,116
the Americans and the South Koreans

335
00:12:20,116 --> 00:12:21,547
and all the other UN forces

336
00:12:21,547 --> 00:12:24,078
(altough the UN forces are mainly the Americans)

337
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:29,968
are able to re-group, and then, in March,

338
00:12:29,968 --> 00:12:32,379
Seoul has changed hands four times.

339
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:36,930
So, in March, they are able to re-take Seoul again.

340
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:41,113
And at this point, McArthur -- ultra-confident --

341
00:12:41,113 --> 00:12:43,906
he's telling the Chinese, "You've essentially lost";

342
00:12:43,906 --> 00:12:45,460
he's even trying to get permission

343
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,077
to use nuclear weapons against the Chinese.

344
00:12:48,077 --> 00:12:50,228
To some degree, he doesn't even think he needs

345
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,394
the permission of Truman to stop.

346
00:12:52,394 --> 00:12:54,344
It sounds like he's eager

347
00:12:54,344 --> 00:12:56,357
to push the Chinese further back,

348
00:12:56,357 --> 00:12:57,465
even though they kind of

349
00:12:57,465 --> 00:12:58,877
surprised him the first go-around.

350
00:12:58,877 --> 00:13:02,625
So, Truman has enough of this “wild-card” guy,

351
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,515
who, you know, thinks he can call the shots,

352
00:13:04,515 --> 00:13:07,444
and use nuclear weapons if he wants to, “willy-nilly”,

353
00:13:07,444 --> 00:13:10,509
and so Truman finally dismisses McArthur

354
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:15,173
in April of 1951. And at this point,

355
00:13:15,173 --> 00:13:20,373
you start having a stalemate near the 38th parallel --

356
00:13:20,373 --> 00:13:22,092
so.. you start having a stalemate

357
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,741
across this border right over there.

358
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:26,256
And both sides think the end of the war is imminent:

359
00:13:26,256 --> 00:13:28,121
"Okay, we're back to where we both began.

360
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:29,562
We should both stop here."

361
00:13:29,562 --> 00:13:31,527
But the negotiations, unfortunately,

362
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:32,433
took over two years,

363
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:35,255
and there's a lot of back-and-forth

364
00:13:35,255 --> 00:13:37,013
on what to do with prisoners of war,

365
00:13:37,013 --> 00:13:38,044
and all of the rest.

366
00:13:38,044 --> 00:13:39,929
But, it finally took two years,

367
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:44,558
so that in July 27, 1953, you have the Armistice

368
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:46,447
signed between the two parties.

369
00:13:46,447 --> 00:13:47,498
And I want to make it clear:

370
00:13:47,498 --> 00:13:51,505
an Armistice agreement is not a peace treaty;

371
00:13:51,505 --> 00:13:53,122
it is not saying that we both agree

372
00:13:53,122 --> 00:13:56,389
that this is the border of our two new countries

373
00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:58,180
and that we are now at peace with each other.

374
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,954
All an Armistice means is

375
00:13:59,954 --> 00:14:01,814
that we are going to stop fighting.

376
00:14:01,814 --> 00:14:03,763
It is not a formal end to the war.

377
00:14:03,763 --> 00:14:07,092
So, in theory, North and South Korea,

378
00:14:07,092 --> 00:14:10,134
even to this day, are in a state of war.

379
00:14:10,134 --> 00:14:11,353
And you know, to this day,

380
00:14:11,353 --> 00:14:13,110
I'm recording this video in 2011;

381
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,300
maybe a few years into the future,

382
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,164
they won't be in an official state of war.

383
00:14:16,164 --> 00:14:17,248
But they're in an official state of war,

384
00:14:17,248 --> 00:14:18,536
under an Armistice.

385
00:14:18,536 --> 00:14:22,178
They've just agreed to stop fighting.

386
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:25,682
So, all-in-all, you have this hugely bloody battle,

387
00:14:25,682 --> 00:14:27,446
with all of these atrocities going on, on both sides;

388
00:14:27,446 --> 00:14:30,249
Syngmyn Rhee, when he was---

389
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:31,946
the first time when North Korean troops

390
00:14:31,946 --> 00:14:33,760
were rolling in to South Korea,

391
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,432
he essentially, beforehand,

392
00:14:35,432 --> 00:14:37,993
he was kind of imprisoning a bunch of people

393
00:14:37,993 --> 00:14:39,496
who he suspected to be Communist.

394
00:14:39,496 --> 00:14:40,510
When I'm talking about "people,"

395
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,373
I'm talking about whole families, sometimes.

396
00:14:42,373 --> 00:14:44,577
And when he was retreating,

397
00:14:44,577 --> 00:14:46,946
he essentially allowed the massacre

398
00:14:46,946 --> 00:14:48,799
of a huge number of people

399
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:50,507
who were just suspected to be Communists.

400
00:14:50,507 --> 00:14:52,614
And these weren't just military men;

401
00:14:52,614 --> 00:14:54,105
these were women, these were children,

402
00:14:54,105 --> 00:14:55,422
these were entire families.

403
00:14:55,422 --> 00:14:56,372
So, he's guilty of that.

404
00:14:56,372 --> 00:14:58,781
And Kim Il Sung, [is] just as guilty;

405
00:14:58,781 --> 00:15:00,908
when the North Korean soldiers

406
00:15:00,908 --> 00:15:03,247
infiltrated the South Korean Seoul,

407
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:07,148
they committed atrocities, killing civil servants,

408
00:15:07,148 --> 00:15:12,021
killing any of the established intellectuals in the areas.

409
00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:14,594
On both sides, [there is] this hugely horrific war.

410
00:15:14,594 --> 00:15:16,718
And to get a sense of what was happening,

411
00:15:16,718 --> 00:15:18,277
Korea isn't a huge country.

412
00:15:18,277 --> 00:15:22,179
But you have, within Korea, the civilian deaths:

413
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:24,918
1.5 to 3 million civilian deaths,

414
00:15:24,918 --> 00:15:26,658
and the consensus is at 2 million.

415
00:15:26,658 --> 00:15:28,690
And this tells you how ugly war is;

416
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,745
you can't even estimate how many people died,

417
00:15:30,745 --> 00:15:33,635
to the nearest 500,000 people.

418
00:15:33,635 --> 00:15:35,253
You just don't know what happened;

419
00:15:35,253 --> 00:15:39,390
2 million people died in a country that's not too big.

420
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,055
You have 30-- all in all,

421
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:44,943
you have about 40,000 American soldiers dying.

422
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:48,533
China, China loses, on the order of

423
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:49,841
(depending on the estimates)

424
00:15:49,841 --> 00:15:51,170
around 400,000 soldiers.

425
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,625
I mean, the estimates are all over the place.

426
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,091
North Korea loses,

427
00:15:54,091 --> 00:15:56,294
[along] the order of the same magnitude of soldiers.

428
00:15:56,294 --> 00:15:58,227
South Korea loses, you know,

429
00:15:58,227 --> 00:16:01,337
several hundred thousand soldiers.

430
00:16:01,337 --> 00:16:02,902
So, you have this hugely bloody battle

431
00:16:02,902 --> 00:16:05,309
-- this hugely bloody war, I should say --

432
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:07,491
that really ends with an outcome

433
00:16:07,491 --> 00:16:10,000
that wasn't so different from where it started.
