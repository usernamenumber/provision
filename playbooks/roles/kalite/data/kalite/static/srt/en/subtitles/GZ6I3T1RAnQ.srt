1
00:00:01,017 --> 00:00:06,364
S: I'm here with Dr. Agus who is a professor of engineering and medicine here at USC.

2
00:00:06,364 --> 00:00:13,302
We're looking at pictures of things that seem very different to me. What is the commonality?

3
00:00:13,302 --> 00:00:20,666
Dr: The commonality is inflammation. Inflammation can be manifested by a runny nose or the flu,

4
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:25,652
it could be manifested by an infection in your toes, it could be hitting your head playing football,

5
00:00:25,652 --> 00:00:28,317
or hitting your arm when you fall while playing a sport

6
00:00:28,317 --> 00:00:31,419
All of those can cause inflammation.

7
00:00:31,419 --> 00:00:37,713
S: Inflammation has a certain meaning in everyday language: It means something is swollen and red.

8
00:00:37,713 --> 00:00:44,168
But here we're talking about inflammation in the medical or scientific sense where it's not things are swollen and red BECAUSE of inflammation.

9
00:00:44,168 --> 00:00:45,403
Dr: Right.

10
00:00:45,403 --> 00:00:53,363
S: So what is inflammation? It isn't just swollen and redness. Football players get red and swollen.

11
00:00:53,363 --> 00:00:56,619
Dr: Inflammation occurs when your body senses danger.

12
00:00:56,619 --> 00:01:01,588
So when something is wrong--whether it be infection, whether it be trauma--in the case of football players

13
00:01:01,588 --> 00:01:06,566
your body senses danger and sends in its front-line soldiers which are its immune cells

14
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,305
in order to fight whatever is causing it.

15
00:01:09,305 --> 00:01:13,791
So, if it's trauma, the immune cells go in there and they help rebuild the tissue that is damaged.

16
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:20,298
If it's bacteria, they go in there and try to take away the bacteria so you can get over that cold or that flu.

17
00:01:20,298 --> 00:01:24,958
So, that whole process is what we call inflammation, it's the "danger process".

18
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:30,890
S: So the immune cells go to the site of danger to either fight the danger itself or repair the aftermath of the danger.

19
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,719
That sounds like a good thing!

20
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:40,242
Dr: It's an awesome thing. The problem is your body, all of us; we care about what happens today, not down the road.

21
00:01:40,242 --> 00:01:44,520
One of the take home points that astonished me when I start to think about it,

22
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:54,315
is that nature, evolution selects out for who has good kids, and that's what evolution is about: it's about having children; about progeny.

23
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:59,470
It's not about what happens when we're 80yrs-old or 90yrs-old.

24
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:04,716
And so, inflammation is fantastic at dealing with today's ramifications.

25
00:02:04,716 --> 00:02:11,503
The problem is if you get the flu today, your risk of cancer and heart disease a decade or a two decades from now are up.

26
00:02:11,503 --> 00:02:13,074
S: If I get the flu just once?

27
00:02:13,074 --> 00:02:19,375
Dr: If you get the flu once. So those five, six days where you feel horrible, your inflammation is through the roof.

28
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:23,043
That's having ramifications down the road.

29
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:28,084
S: This is already getting a little scary for me, because I've had the flu...so I already feel a little worried about my cancer risk.

30
00:02:28,084 --> 00:02:33,635
Dr: I can tell by looking at you!

31
00:02:33,635 --> 00:02:38,330
S: The symptoms we get when we have the flu or cold, it's not the virus that's causing it.

32
00:02:38,422 --> 00:02:40,252
The virus is causing the inflammation, which is causing the symptoms.

33
00:02:40,313 --> 00:02:45,321
Dr: Yes. That's what's wild. When you get a virus, your immune system attacks it, and then you get a fever.

34
00:02:45,444 --> 00:02:51,297
I still don't know why we get fevers. It's one of those things where cytokines,

35
00:02:51,343 --> 00:02:57,660
which are proteins the immune cells make to send out and get more reinforcements and tell the body what to do,

36
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:02,538
it causes a fever. Is a fever good, is a fever bad? I don't know!

37
00:03:02,538 --> 00:03:08,974
We take Tylenol to lower a fever, but is that a good thing? Nobody has really looked at the long-term ramifications.

38
00:03:08,974 --> 00:03:14,902
We've looked at the short-term, but how does that effects will there be a decade from now? We just don't know.

39
00:03:14,902 --> 00:03:20,609
S: What you're saying is the reason we have inflammation is, something is happening to my body,

40
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:25,184
I have some trauma or an injury, but I might have to run away from a lion tomorrow.

41
00:03:25,184 --> 00:03:34,620
So fix-fix-fix Sal now or fix David up so he can run away from a lion tomorrow, but in the wild I might not have lived to 40 anyway.

42
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:40,603
So why even worry about whether that person might get cancer if they get to 40 or 50? Once they're past the point of reproduction.

43
00:03:40,603 --> 00:03:44,671
Dr: Right, the body has to choose priorities. The priority is today rather than tomorrow.

44
00:03:44,671 --> 00:03:50,987
An amazing study was done where we gave patients what we call a "statin".

45
00:03:50,987 --> 00:03:58,703
Statins are drugs that were developed to block the synthesis of cholesterol.

46
00:03:58,703 --> 00:04:05,380
We thought, you know, people with higher cholesterol--particularly the bad one, LDL--those people have a higher incidence of heart disease.

47
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,558
So, if we block the synthesis, we're going to affect heart disease.

48
00:04:09,558 --> 00:04:15,947
What do you know? We did! A dramatic effect: We lowered the death from heart disease with these drugs.

49
00:04:15,947 --> 00:04:17,278
S: so it seems like they worked!

50
00:04:17,278 --> 00:04:24,424
Dr: Right. Then a company, or a very clever group did a trial where they gave people with normal cholesterol these drugs.

51
00:04:24,424 --> 00:04:29,226
It also had a dramatic effect, in that it delayed heart attack and stroke by almost a dozen years,

52
00:04:29,226 --> 00:04:30,183
Wow

53
00:04:30,332 --> 00:04:34,095
and it reduced the incidence of cancer by about 40%.

54
00:04:34,095 --> 00:04:37,447
S: So cancer, something we don't normally associate with cholesterol.

55
00:04:37,447 --> 00:04:42,478
Dr: So it turns out these drugs, which are the biggest drugs in terms of sells we ever had,

56
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:44,974
worked by lowering inflammation.

57
00:04:44,974 --> 00:04:50,380
So the affected heart disease wasn't by lowering cholesterol, it was predominantly by lowering inflammation.

58
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,046
And the affect on cancer was by lowering inflammation.

59
00:04:53,046 --> 00:04:56,509
In fact, remember when the swine flu came out a couple of years ago?

60
00:04:56,509 --> 00:05:02,655
If you got the swine flu, the only thing that protected you from your lungs collapsing going on what we call

61
00:05:02,655 --> 00:05:06,213
a ventilator, a breathing machine, was being on one of these statins.

62
00:05:06,213 --> 00:05:09,397
S: Because it would stop the inflammation. Because with swine flu, people were dying from inflammation going nuts.

63
00:05:09,397 --> 00:05:10,199
Dr: Yes.

64
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:17,847
S: Fascinating. The people who are dying of heart disease, is it the cholesterol that's killing them or the inflammation?

65
00:05:17,847 --> 00:05:24,463
Dr: I think it's a chicken-and-the-egg phenomenon where the inflammation allows the cholesterol to deposit; and they go together.

66
00:05:24,463 --> 00:05:35,837
S: It's really the statins affect inflammation, which then reduces cancer by stopping the inflammation.

67
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:42,723
Dr: Exactly. One of the problems we have in Biology and Medicine is what you can measure.

68
00:05:42,723 --> 00:05:48,146
So, I can measure cholesterol. I don't really know how to measure inflammation well.

69
00:05:48,146 --> 00:05:52,175
So while we can make these associations in big studies where we look back,

70
00:05:52,175 --> 00:05:58,328
if I had a metric, a blood test or something to look at for inflammation, I could optimize this.

71
00:05:58,328 --> 00:06:06,070
S: Can you not just measure the amount of cytokines or other inflammatory types of things?

72
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:11,398
Dr: There are different types of inflammation. So, some inflammation can be good, some can be bad.

73
00:06:11,398 --> 00:06:14,927
Some can be really causal, some can be a little causal.

74
00:06:14,927 --> 00:06:20,815
So we're putting them all into one basket now, which is inflammation, the key is to start to tease them out,

75
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:22,671
and be able to modulate them.

76
00:06:22,671 --> 00:06:26,767
You can develop a drug, but then you would have to optimize it for a particular purpose.

77
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:30,712
So, these were optimized to lower cholesterol. They do that very well.

78
00:06:30,712 --> 00:06:34,419
It also lowers inflammation, and they work beautifully in that regard.

79
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:37,137
But how do we optimize that going forward?

80
00:06:37,137 --> 00:06:41,968
It also means that when you look at your lifestyle and my lifestyle, we have to limit inflammation.

81
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,250
So, what are the easy ways to do that?

82
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,684
One is, which I think should be mandatory, is things like the flu shot.

83
00:06:48,684 --> 00:06:56,248
So again, the flu shot will certainly delay you from having or prevent you from having a bad flu...

84
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:58,681
S: Which is good today and good tomorrow.

85
00:06:58,681 --> 00:07:02,236
Dr: Yes, it lowers heart disease and cancer down the road.

86
00:07:02,236 --> 00:07:07,824
S: I had no clue. I thought the flu shot was just a nice thing to avoid a week of the sneezing.

87
00:07:07,824 --> 00:07:11,059
But flu shot can actually reduce your cancer...

88
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:15,422
Dr: ...and heart disease down the road. And we have to think long-term as a society.

89
00:07:15,422 --> 00:07:18,873
S: What about statins? I mean, it seems things like Lipitor, etc.--

90
00:07:22,765 --> 00:07:25,625
no one should take medical advice based on a thing in a video--

91
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:31,768
but, are taking it, just for heart disease? Or are people taking it more broadly now?

92
00:07:31,768 --> 00:07:38,380
Dr: Listen: I'm a believer that these drugs have such a profound affect on cancer, heart disease, stroke,

93
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:43,051
potentially Alzheimer's, that you should consider taking it to prevent these diseases.

94
00:07:43,051 --> 00:07:49,718
And again, giving no recommendations, but what I say is, you and parents should talk to your doctor and say,

95
00:07:49,718 --> 00:07:51,714
"Why shouldn't I be on this drug?	"

96
00:07:51,714 --> 00:07:54,787
S: And there are some side effects? Are they easy to test for?

97
00:07:54,787 --> 00:07:57,620
Dr: They test for them, and they're reversible.

98
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:03,362
You have to do a risk-benefit analysis. Have to look at you and say, are you at high risk for XYZ?

99
00:08:03,362 --> 00:08:06,330
If you are, what can prevent it or delay it?

100
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:10,647
The name of the game is not treating disease, it's preventing disease.

101
00:08:10,647 --> 00:08:17,798
S: This is fascinating. But no advice here, everyone should talk to their doctor.

102
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:21,892
Dr: Btw, another great medicine that reduces inflammation is aspirin.

103
00:08:21,892 --> 00:08:24,051
S: Aspirin, I've heard of that!

104
00:08:24,051 --> 00:08:27,731
Dr: It's a helluva drug! Again, there are side effects to aspirin, it can effect bleeding,

105
00:08:27,731 --> 00:08:32,039
but at the same time, it gives dramatic effect by lowering inflammation.

106
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:37,140
S: Right. And that is the main side effect, it's an age-old drug, and it's a blood thinner,

107
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:42,784
if you get a cut or you bleed while taking aspirin, you might bleed more.

108
00:08:42,784 --> 00:08:45,597
Dr: Right. Blood thinner is a funny word, I'm not sure what it means.

109
00:08:45,597 --> 00:08:48,301
I keep thinking paint thinner when you say that.

110
00:08:48,301 --> 00:08:50,185
S: That's how I imagine it.

111
00:08:50,185 --> 00:08:53,582
Dr: It binds to the platelets and blocks them from activating, it stops them from working very well.

112
00:08:53,582 --> 00:08:55,274
S: It's more anti-clotting?

113
00:08:55,274 --> 00:08:59,052
Dr: Right. And platelets are one of the key components in clotting, and they certainly affect it.

114
00:08:59,052 --> 00:09:02,339
S: So your blood will have the same viscosity, it just won't clot as easily.

115
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:05,001
Dr: Exactly. And you could certainly paint a wall with either one.

116
00:09:05,001 --> 00:09:09,000
S: That's a little morbid. Thanks so much
