1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:09,470
Simplify x y to the -2 power, times 2 x-squared over y-squared to the 4th power

2
00:00:09,485 --> 00:00:12,098
So let's see what we can do over here

3
00:00:12,098 --> 00:00:19,251
So let's think about this part of our expression first, if I have x over y to the n-th power

4
00:00:19,374 --> 00:00:24,346
we know that this is the same thing as, x to the n over y to the n

5
00:00:24,516 --> 00:00:26,401
So let's apply that right over here

6
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,977
So this expression, 2 x-squared over y-squared to the 4th

7
00:00:29,977 --> 00:00:41,680
this is going to be the same as, 2 x-squared to the 4th power, over y-squared to the 4th power

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,877
and of course we still have our x y to the -2 power out here, and actually let me simplify that as well

9
00:00:47,903 --> 00:00:54,267
we know that if we have, we know that if we have, x times y to the n-th power

10
00:00:54,267 --> 00:01:00,302
this the same thing as, taking each of the powers of each of the x and the y, and then taking the product

11
00:01:00,302 --> 00:01:04,203
this is x to the n times y to the n

12
00:01:04,203 --> 00:01:07,733
and actually if you just expand, if you multiply xy times itself n times

13
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:09,869
we will see why this actually works out

14
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:13,352
because you will have x multiplied by itself n times, if you rearrange the product

15
00:01:13,352 --> 00:01:15,952
and y multiplied by itself n times

16
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:22,800
so if we use the same property here, x y to the -2, that's going to the the same exact thing as

17
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,305
x to the -2 times y to the -2

18
00:01:28,305 --> 00:01:30,024
now, what can we simplify?

19
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:34,668
well, we can use this property again, right over here, we have 2 x-squared raised to the 4th power

20
00:01:34,668 --> 00:01:38,918
so that's going to be the same as, that's going to the the same thing as

21
00:01:39,056 --> 00:01:45,519
2 to the 4th power, 2 to the 4th power times x-squared to the 4th power

22
00:01:45,796 --> 00:01:49,475
now we can do it in the denominator, y-squared to the 4th power

23
00:01:49,552 --> 00:01:51,804
Actually are going to use a different property in the denominator

24
00:01:51,804 --> 00:01:54,520
We just have y-squared to the 4th power

25
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,606
We know that if we have x to the n, and then raise that to the m-th power

26
00:01:59,606 --> 00:02:02,857
this is the same as, x to the n times m

27
00:02:02,857 --> 00:02:06,943
so y-squared, and then raising that to the 4th power, that's going to be equal to

28
00:02:06,943 --> 00:02:12,874
y to the 2 times 4 power, or y to the 8th power.

29
00:02:12,981 --> 00:02:18,898
And of course out here, we have x to the -2 times y to the -2

30
00:02:18,898 --> 00:02:23,337
Now let's think a little bit about what x to the -2 and y to the -2 mean.

31
00:02:23,337 --> 00:02:31,620
x to the -2 just means 1 over x-squared, y to the -2 just means 1 over y-squared

32
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:40,553
so let's rewrite it like that, this is the same thing as, 1 over x-squared times 1 over y-squared

33
00:02:40,553 --> 00:02:46,481
So we can just write that as 1 over x-squared, y-squared. That and that are completely equivalently

34
00:02:46,481 --> 00:02:51,479
So let's see what we can do now, so we have one last thing. Well we don't have one last thing

35
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,919
we have a few more things to worry about

36
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:56,267
we have x-squared and then we are raising that to the 4th power

37
00:02:56,267 --> 00:03:02,021
once again, we can use this property right here, this is going to be x to the 2 times 4 power

38
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:08,383
so this part right over there, do it in a new color, this part right over here is going to simplify to

39
00:03:08,383 --> 00:03:12,238
x to the 8th power, 2 times 4

40
00:03:12,238 --> 00:03:19,250
this part right over here is going to, 2 to the 4th power, 2 to the 3rd is 8. So 2 to the 4th is 16

41
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:25,613
so that is 16. and so our whole expression has now simplified to, if we multiply it times this

42
00:03:25,613 --> 00:03:29,467
we multiply it times 1, so i am going to multiply these 2 fractions.

43
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:37,133
My numerator is 16 times x to the 8th, 16 times x to the 8th, and all of that over

44
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:45,553
I have x-squared, I have an x-squared. And then I am going to have a y-squared times a y to the 8th

45
00:03:45,553 --> 00:03:49,530
what is y-squared times y to the 8th? y-squared times y to the 8th

46
00:03:49,622 --> 00:03:53,326
we have the same base, so we can add the exponents for taking the products

47
00:03:53,326 --> 00:03:57,888
so it's going to be y to the 2 plus 8, or y to the 10th power

48
00:03:57,888 --> 00:04:03,043
so y-squared times y to the 8th is going to be y to the 10th power

49
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:06,067
and we are almost there, we have one more thing we can simplify

50
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:11,588
we have x to the 8th over x-squared, and we know, I will just write the general property

51
00:04:11,588 --> 00:04:22,177
x to the m over, over, x to the n, this is equal to x to the m minus n power

52
00:04:22,177 --> 00:04:31,186
so x to the 8th over x-squared, that over there will simplify to x to the 8 minus 2 power

53
00:04:31,186 --> 00:04:33,786
or x to the 6th power

54
00:04:33,786 --> 00:04:44,223
and our whole expression has now simplified to 16, 16 times x to the 6th, times x to the 6th

55
00:04:44,223 --> 99:59:59,999
all of that over y to the 10th, and we are done
