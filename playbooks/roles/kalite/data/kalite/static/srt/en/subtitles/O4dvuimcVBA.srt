1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,550
   

2
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,670
We spent a couple of videos
naming amines.

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,590
In this video, let's actually
see how they might react.

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,010
Now, to just kind of understand
what happens with

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,080
an amine, let's study
one in particular.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,200
Let's look at ethylamine.

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,070
That's its common name, and
that's obviously going to be a

8
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,140
two-carbon chain, so that's the
ethyl part, connected to a

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,320
nitrogen, so that is
the amine part.

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,620
And then the nitrogen will
have two other bonds, two

11
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,980
hydrogens, just like that.

12
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,400
And if you look at the Periodic
Table, so here's our

13
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,120
Periodic Table right here, you
see nitrogen is in Group 5:

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,510
one, two, three, four, five.

15
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,330
This says Group 15, but we're
going to ignore the transition

16
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:44,400
metals for now.

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,320
So it has five valence
electrons.

18
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,800
When you look at it, when you
look at the bonds here, you

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,050
only see one, two, three
valence electrons.

20
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,430
So there's going to be two more
and they're going to be

21
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,670
in a lone pair, just
like that.

22
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,060
When you also look at the
Periodic Table, you also see

23
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,080
that nitrogen is pretty
electronegative.

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:12,710
   

25
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,670
In fact, there's only a few
elements that are more

26
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,030
electronegative.

27
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,940
But remember, electronegativity
is just how

28
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,200
much does it like to
hog electrons?

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,240
So it's more electronegative
than carbon.

30
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,970
It's to the right of carbon
and it's way more

31
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,200
electronegative than hydrogen.

32
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,460
So if you compare it, not only
does it have this lone pair of

33
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,558
electrons right here, but it's
also going to hog-- let me do

34
00:01:33,558 --> 00:01:34,690
it in a different color.

35
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:42,230
It's also going to hog these
orange electrons that are on

36
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,650
the other side of the bond.

37
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,220
So, as we know, implicitly
there's a

38
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,690
carbon right over here.

39
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,920
There's another carbon
over here.

40
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,370
There's two hydrogens
over here.

41
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,150
We haven't drawn all
of that stuff.

42
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,170
But it's more electronegative
than everything it's bonded to

43
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,560
so its also going to attract
those electrons, so it's going

44
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,955
to have a partial
negative charge.

45
00:01:56,955 --> 00:02:01,890
   

46
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:02,720
Let me make it very clear.

47
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,550
The partial negative charge--
that's carbon right there.

48
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:11,260
The partial negative charge
is at the nitrogen itself.

49
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,550
And you're going to have
slightly partial positive

50
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,840
charges of the carbons
and the hydrogens,

51
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,310
especially at the hydrogens.

52
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,180
And now if we just talk about
the properties of it, because

53
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,820
it's polar, this would actually
give it a reasonably

54
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,690
high melting and
boiling point.

55
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,130
You could imagine, amines when
they are in a solution with

56
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,570
other amines, they are going
to be attracted essentially

57
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,750
via this type of hydrogen-type
bonding.

58
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:38,140
The negative part of partial
negative nitrogens are going

59
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,590
to be attracted to the partially
positive hydrogens

60
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,950
of other amines.

61
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,350
Now, the hydrogen bonding for
an amines is not going to be

62
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,390
as strong as it will be for,
say, waters or alcohols

63
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,190
because waters and alcohols
involve oxygen, and oxygen is

64
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,270
even more electronegative
than nitrogen.

65
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,140
So these partial charges
are even stronger.

66
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,450
So that's why hydrogen bonding
is even stronger in the case

67
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,360
of things that have oxygen in
it like alcohol or water.

68
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,300
Now, with that said,
let's think about

69
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,990
how this might react.

70
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,470
I have a lone pair over here.

71
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,120
I also have a partial negative
charge because this guy is

72
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,430
more electronegative.

73
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:24,200
It seems like we have a lot of
negative action going around

74
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,250
the nitrogen there.

75
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,430
And because it has that, maybe
it would either like to give

76
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,450
away electrons or maybe take
hydrogens from other things.

77
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,500
And that, in fact, is the
case with amines.

78
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,540
So in general, and let me
write this down, this is

79
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,480
ethylamine right here, just so
we get our naming practice.

80
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,700
Ethylamine, this is
the common name.

81
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,110
We just said this is an ethyl
group attached to an amine.

82
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,410
And this is obviously
a primary amine.

83
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,800
It's only attached to one
carbon right here.

84
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,130
But in the case of an amine like
this, and actually out of

85
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:01,260
all of the functional groups
we will look at, out of all

86
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,080
the neutral functional groups we
look at, because of what we

87
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,670
just described, because it has
this partial negative charge,

88
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,570
it has this lone pair,
the nitrogen's pretty

89
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,145
electronegative, this is
actually the most basic.

90
00:04:12,145 --> 00:04:16,550
   

91
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,700
And this isn't just
ethylamine.

92
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,610
This is all amines.

93
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,930
Let me write this down.

94
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:35,090
Amines are the most basic of the
neutral functional groups.

95
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:38,770
Obviously, something like a
hydroxide anion, it has a

96
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,850
negative charge.

97
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,530
It will want to attract
protons even more.

98
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,130
But this one's pretty good,

99
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,660
considering that it is neutral.

100
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,520
So given that it's basic, and
we'll also say, and it's a

101
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,220
related notion, it's
also nucleophilic.

102
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,380
And just as a reminder, when
people talk about basicity,

103
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,280
they're talking about how much
does something want to give

104
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,060
away electrons?

105
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,380
Or how much does it want
to take protons?

106
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,560
When you talk about the
nucleophilicity, or how good

107
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,490
of a nucleophile something is,
it's how good are you at

108
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,180
giving away electrons?

109
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,420
Or how good are you at
essentially being attracted to

110
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:18,930
protons or giving
away electrons?

111
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,910
And so when you talk about
basicity, you're talking about

112
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,010
a thermodynamic property.

113
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,570
When you're talking about
nucleophilicity, you're

114
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,080
talking about a kinetic
property.

115
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,010
How good is it at interacting?

116
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:30,750
The basic tells you how stable
is it once it has interacted.

117
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,490
So given that it's a
nucleophile, you could

118
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,140
imagine, I think you see where
I might be going with this.

119
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,280
Let me draw the ethylamine
again.

120
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,365
So ethylamine, I'll draw it
in a little bit simpler.

121
00:05:39,365 --> 00:05:43,220
So let me draw the hydrogens
like that, and then it has

122
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,570
this lone pair.

123
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,850
Let's think about what might
happen if we have a solution

124
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,180
of ethylamine.

125
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:55,210
If we have ethylamine and
it's mixed in with some

126
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,430
bromoethane.

127
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,850
So that's one, two carbons
right there.

128
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:04,090
Let me draw the bromo group.

129
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,190
And it might not be obvious
the way I drew this

130
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,390
bromoethane right here.

131
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,130
Let me write this down.

132
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,380
This is bromoethane.

133
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,310
   

134
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:18,280
But I think it will be obvious
if I draw this carbon right

135
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,040
here and if I draw the other
two hydrogens, which are

136
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,760
implicitly there.

137
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,150
So that is one hydrogen right
there and then you have

138
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,130
another hydrogen over here.

139
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,490
And you have a good nucleophile
in the ethylamine.

140
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,260
So what do you think
will happen?

141
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,710
Oh, yeah, I also have a
good leaving group.

142
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,310
So you see I'm talking in the
language of Sn2 reactions.

143
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:42,170
Or really, I'm talking in the
language of nucleophilic

144
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:46,240
substitution reactions, and I'm
going to lean towards the

145
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,940
Sn2 direction because I have
a primary carbon here, good

146
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,090
leaving group, pretty
OK nucleophile.

147
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,400
If this was a secondary,
especially if this was a

148
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,820
tertiary carbon, then I
would be thinking Sn1.

149
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,500
Then I would say, oh, maybe
this leaves on its own.

150
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:04,620
But in an Sn2, what we're
going to have is, this

151
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,000
nucleophile will attack or it
will give away its electron,

152
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,590
so it'll give its electron
to this carbon.

153
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,440
And simultaneously, since this
electron is going towards the

154
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,690
slightly positive, the partially
positive carbon

155
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:23,020
here, this bromine can finally
take away that carbon's

156
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:27,420
electrons, and so we just
experienced an Sn2 reaction.

157
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,210
This is an Sn2 reaction.

158
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,810
And then after that is done,
the bromine will have left.

159
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,700
It has taken this electron.

160
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,740
It already had this
one over here.

161
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,470
It already had that one.

162
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,560
And actually, it had another
six electrons.

163
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,740
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven valence electrons

164
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,480
for bromine.

165
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,280
Now, it will have eight.

166
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:51,110
So, one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, now it will

167
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,490
have eight.

168
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,290
It just took this
one right here.

169
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:57,580
It gained an electron, so it
has a negative charge.

170
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,660
And now let me draw this
part right here.

171
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,760
So we had this carbon,
that carbon.

172
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,440
That hydrogen is sticking--
let me draw it like this.

173
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,660
That hydrogen is sticking
out, just like that.

174
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,850
The other hydrogen
is behind it.

175
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,050
It's bonded to the other
carbon up here.

176
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,290
   

177
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,520
That's really a CH3.

178
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,140
It has three hydrogens off
of it implicitly there.

179
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:30,500
And now the ethylamine
has attached to it.

180
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,750
So let me draw that.

181
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,929
   

182
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:38,030
So that's the nitrogen.

183
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:41,620
It's bonded to one, two carbons
just like that.

184
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,690
And then it has a hydrogen, a
hydrogen, and then you have

185
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,450
this electron is still
with the nitrogen.

186
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:55,890
And then this magenta electron
has been given to the carbon,

187
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:56,720
just like that.

188
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,440
And since the nitrogen has given
away an electron, it now

189
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,790
has a positive charge.

190
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,890
   

191
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,270
So when you think about these
two molecules, this molecule

192
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,100
now has a positive charge.

193
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,080
This molecule right now
has a negative charge.

194
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,600
So they would actually be
ionically attracted to each

195
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,100
other, and we've actually
just formed a salt.

196
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,800
And this would be called-- and
this is interesting here, at

197
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,510
least from a naming
perspective.

198
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,840
You have two ethyl groups.

199
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,150
It might not be completely
clear.

200
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,800
You have one, two carbons
here, and then you have

201
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,070
another one, two
carbons there.

202
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:34,440
We could re-draw this as-- or
we could rewrite it as NH2.

203
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,880
And then we have two carbons,
and then another two carbons

204
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,650
just like that.

205
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:42,950
So we could call this diethyl--
we have one ethyl,

206
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,880
two ethyls-- so this
is diethyl.

207
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,130
Let me color this.

208
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,110
Let me do it in a different
color here.

209
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,140
So you have an ethyl group right
there, an ethyl group

210
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,800
right there, so we call this--
this is the common name for

211
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,560
it-- diethyl.

212
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,410
And then you might want to call
it diethylamine, but it's

213
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:04,770
not ammonia or it's not
derivative of ammonia anymore.

214
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,940
It's a derivative of ammonium.

215
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,680
And that's because it's now
positively charged.

216
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,990
This nitrogen now
has four bonds.

217
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,240
So this is diethylammonium.

218
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:19,710
   

219
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,830
Diethylammonium is this
molecule right here.

220
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,850
And if you view it as a salt,
and a salt is just an

221
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:30,220
ionically-- well, I don't want
to go into the definition

222
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,330
completely of a salt, but you
view this as a salt because

223
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,940
it's a ionically bonded
molecule, where one of the

224
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,450
molecules is diethylammonium,
the other one will be bromide.

225
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,725
This is the bromide
anion right here.

226
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:46,020
And you always list the cation
first, the positive charged

227
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:52,480
first. So this is
diethylammonium bromide, which

228
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,450
we were able to form with
the Sn2 reaction between

229
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:59,690
ethylamine or ethylamine
and bromoethane.

230
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:03,550
Now, we can now go under
another step here.

231
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:07,560
If we have a ton of this
ethylamine floating around, if

232
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,730
we have an excess, and early on
we will have a lot more of

233
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:14,250
that than we will have of this
thing right here, if we have a

234
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,760
ton of ethylamine floating
around-- let me draw some

235
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,350
ethylamine.

236
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:24,600
If we have a ton of the
ethylamine floating around, it

237
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,590
might be able to grab one of
the hydrogens from the

238
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,650
diethylammonium over here.

239
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,190
So you could imagine
a situation

240
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,055
where it grabs a hydrogen.

241
00:11:33,055 --> 00:11:35,860
It essentially gives its
electron to the hydrogen, and

242
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,460
then that hydrogen's
electron can be

243
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:43,560
taken back by the nitrogen.

244
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,360
And I'll draw this as an
equilibrium because it's not

245
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,480
really that much more likely
that this guy takes away that

246
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,735
guy's electron than that guy can
go and take the electron

247
00:11:51,735 --> 00:11:53,850
back, so it's a reversible
reaction.

248
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:58,050
But if that were to happen, then
this guy, this guy right

249
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,490
over here, will then
look like this.

250
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:04,510
You have the ethyl group bonded
to a nitrogen that only

251
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,020
has one hydrogen on it.

252
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,000
Let me just draw it like this.

253
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,610
A nitrogen that only has
one hydrogen on it.

254
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,990
And then he's bonded
to another ethyl

255
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:15,680
group right over there.

256
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,290
And now he has his-- so if you
view this as an electron right

257
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,470
there, he has his lone pair.

258
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:24,730
So he took that-- it looks like
yellow ochre, just kind

259
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,610
of a yellow-green color-- took
that back from the hydrogen

260
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:30,880
and is now neutral, got
an electron back.

261
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,225
So now, this is just
diethyl ammonia.

262
00:12:34,225 --> 00:12:49,260
   

263
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:49,730
Actually, no.

264
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,110
I'm sorry.

265
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,290
It wouldn't be diethyl
ammonia.

266
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,560
It would be diethylamine.

267
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,730
Sorry about that.

268
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:57,280
Let me erase that.

269
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,530
This would be diethylamine.

270
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:01,810
   

271
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,280
It would be ammonia.

272
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,880
Ammonia is just NH-- let
me draw it like this.

273
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,930
Ammonia, just to make things
clear, is this, and that's why

274
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,740
my brain was telling
us to go ammonia.

275
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,320
And then ammonium is this.

276
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,490
   

277
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,430
Give away one of these electrons
to a hydrogen

278
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,240
proton, you have a
positive charge.

279
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,220
Now, when you do the common
naming, when it's kind of

280
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,070
ammonium derivative, you
do say diethylammonium.

281
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,020
And then my brain said, OK,
now that we got rid of the

282
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,360
hydrogen, I went back to
ammonia, so I said diethyl

283
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,150
ammonia, but that's wrong.

284
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,930
Obviously, this is now an amine,
so we used the common

285
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:45,210
naming for amines, and we get
back to diethylamine.

286
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:53,110
And then this guy over here will
turn into ethylammonium.

287
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,350
Sorry for all the confusion.

288
00:13:54,350 --> 00:14:00,030
So this guy over here is a
nitrogen, two hydrogens, ethyl

289
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:02,660
group, and then he grabbed
another hydrogen.

290
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,870
So he grabbed this hydrogen
over here.

291
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,680
   

292
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,560
So now he has a positive charge
since he gave away that

293
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,420
electron over there.

294
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,670
So now he is ethylammonium.

295
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:21,980
   

296
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,970
But this is reversible
right here.

297
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:27,050
But what you can see, through
this Sn2 reaction, we were

298
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:31,040
able to essentailly, get rid of
one of these hydrogens and

299
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,010
substitute it with another
ethyl group.

300
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:36,640
We went from having a primary
amine-- this is bonded to one

301
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,420
carbon-- to having
a secondary amine

302
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,170
through this Sn2 reaction.

303
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:43,790
It's bonded to two carbons.

304
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,267
