1
00:00:00,317 --> 00:00:03,236
Let's talk about blood pressure homeostasis

2
00:00:03,236 --> 00:00:08,797
and what homeostasis means is balance.

3
00:00:08,797 --> 00:00:12,613
But how is it that our body is able to create balance

4
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:14,549
for our blood pressure?

5
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:19,247
So this is the heart and we've got branches of the aorta coming off of it.

6
00:00:19,247 --> 00:00:25,946
I haven't been drawing these braches every single time but this time i think it's quite helpfull to see.

7
00:00:25,946 --> 00:00:28,903
We've got here the left brachial artery

8
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:30,779
going to the left arm.

9
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:35,313
And we've got the left carotid artery here.

10
00:00:35,313 --> 00:00:41,238
And again I'm writing left and right from the perspective of the person who's heart this is.

11
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:44,522
And you've got the right carotid artery here

12
00:00:44,522 --> 00:00:46,931
and the right brachial artery.

13
00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:49,087
This is blood going to the right arm.

14
00:00:49,087 --> 00:00:55,182
And we've got blood going to the right neck.

15
00:00:55,182 --> 00:00:58,716
One interesting thing if you look at the right carotid

16
00:00:58,716 --> 00:01:00,584
is that it bulges right here

17
00:01:00,584 --> 00:01:02,148
in fact both sides do

18
00:01:02,148 --> 00:01:04,158
and they bulge right before they split

19
00:01:04,158 --> 00:01:08,970
and so that bulge is actually called the

20
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,098
carotid sinus.

21
00:01:11,098 --> 00:01:16,124
We call it that because a sinus

22
00:01:16,124 --> 00:01:17,516
is any cavity.

23
00:01:17,516 --> 00:01:20,973
And so this is the right carotid sinus

24
00:01:20,973 --> 00:01:24,100
and this is the left carotid sinus.

25
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,652
Another spot I am going to talk about is the aortic arch

26
00:01:28,652 --> 00:01:29,588
which is right there.

27
00:01:29,588 --> 00:01:34,099
So these 3 spots, the 2 carotid sinuses and the aortic arch

28
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:36,462
are really really interesting and actually

29
00:01:36,462 --> 00:01:38,102
they are very important

30
00:01:38,102 --> 00:01:43,702
for learning how it is that our body is able to create balance

31
00:01:43,702 --> 00:01:45,198
in our blood pressure.

32
00:01:45,198 --> 00:01:49,187
So at the top I drew kind of a blown up version of the carotid sinus.

33
00:01:49,187 --> 00:01:53,586
And at the bottom is the aortic arch.

34
00:01:53,586 --> 00:01:55,969
If you'd look closely under a microscope

35
00:01:55,969 --> 00:02:00,411
you'd see nerve endings at the outer layer of the vessel.

36
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,609
So these nerve endings

37
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:06,870
basically join up and form a nerve

38
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:12,037
and these on the carotid sinus do the same thing.

39
00:02:12,037 --> 00:02:16,735
They basically are going to send 2 large nerves that are going to go off.

40
00:02:16,735 --> 00:02:20,901
They send information about what's happening in the blood vessel,

41
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:23,839
specifically about stretch.

42
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:27,102
So as blood is pulsing through this vessel right here,

43
00:02:27,102 --> 00:02:27,923
this carotid sinus,

44
00:02:27,923 --> 00:02:30,109
or as it's pulsing through the aorta even,

45
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:34,395
that wall is being stretched out

46
00:02:34,395 --> 00:02:37,044
and as it gets stretched, these nerves

47
00:02:37,044 --> 00:02:40,838
they're actually called baroreceptors,

48
00:02:40,838 --> 00:02:43,159
baro- meaning pressure,

49
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:45,759
and these receptors for pressure,

50
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:50,403
these baroreceptors are feeling the effects

51
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:53,342
of stretch. What they do is that they

52
00:02:53,342 --> 00:02:57,242
send a signal down the nerve

53
00:02:57,242 --> 00:03:01,737
that tells the brain how much stretch is happening.

54
00:03:01,737 --> 00:03:03,861
And so if this is the brain

55
00:03:06,422 --> 00:03:09,391
and here you have your mid brain,

56
00:03:09,391 --> 00:03:17,993
these nerve endings are actually going here

57
00:03:17,993 --> 00:03:22,835
and tell the brain, communicate information about

58
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:26,389
how much stretch is happening in those vessels.

59
00:03:30,456 --> 00:03:33,273
Now we know the more pressure is in the vessels the more it's going to stretch.

60
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:35,836
So, follow me in a little example

61
00:03:35,836 --> 00:03:37,815
So let's say we have blood pressure over here.

62
00:03:37,815 --> 00:03:45,475
And we have our blood pressure at 115 over 75.

63
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:57,176
In green we have action potentials per minute.

64
00:03:57,176 --> 00:04:03,238
What happens is that, as my blood pressure is 115/75,

65
00:04:03,238 --> 00:04:08,970
those nerves are getting a certain amount of stretch, whatever that amount is.

66
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,476
And they're gonna send a signal

67
00:04:11,476 --> 00:04:14,671
not just one, but they're gonna send a handful.

68
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:20,652
Let's say they send 10 signals.

69
00:04:20,652 --> 00:04:22,670
I'm gonna draw them up there.

70
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:30,236
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 in one minute.

71
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:33,737
Just imagine that both nerves are doing that, right?

72
00:04:33,737 --> 00:04:36,174
They're doing 10/minute.

73
00:04:36,174 --> 00:04:39,602
Well, that's a pretty normal number let's say.

74
00:04:39,602 --> 00:04:45,737
And this over times becomes what my brain regards as my normal setpoint.

75
00:04:45,737 --> 00:04:51,311
The brain starts to assume that if 10 action potentials are fired per minute,

76
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:54,065
then that's pretty normal for me.

77
00:04:54,065 --> 00:04:58,237
The brain regards this as my normal setpoint.

78
00:04:58,237 --> 00:05:00,139
Now, if my pressure goes up,

79
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:02,973
let's say that I'm running late to an exam

80
00:05:02,973 --> 00:05:06,233
or something happens that really worries me

81
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:10,569
and my pressure goes to 140/90.

82
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:12,737
Now I have hypertension.

83
00:05:12,737 --> 00:05:21,769
And this is my new pressure, 
this would be much higher than normal.

84
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:24,048
My body would register this.

85
00:05:24,048 --> 00:05:28,555
And my nerves would start firing, let's say 30 times per minute.

86
00:05:28,555 --> 00:05:32,168
So if they're firing 30 times per minute,

87
00:05:32,168 --> 00:05:36,972
then my body is thinking, or my brain is thinking: 
well, that's higher than normal.

88
00:05:36,972 --> 00:05:39,737
So, this must be high.

89
00:05:39,737 --> 00:05:42,546
It regards this as high.

90
00:05:42,546 --> 00:05:50,517
And on the flipside let's say that, you know, 
I've cut my arm and lose a lot of blood,

91
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:54,070
my blood pressure starts to fall.

92
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,337
My stretching is going to happen less than before,

93
00:05:57,337 --> 00:06:00,544
so it's gonna send less action potentials per minute.

94
00:06:00,544 --> 00:06:02,806
Maybe only 7 per minute.

95
00:06:02,806 --> 00:06:07,005
And again, my mid brain is gonna get 7 little green arrows per minute.

96
00:06:07,005 --> 00:06:09,556
7 action potentials per minute.

97
00:06:09,556 --> 00:06:16,536
And it's gonna think: well that's very odd, before it was 10 per minute.

98
00:06:16,536 --> 00:06:21,404
This represents a fall in blood pressure.

99
00:06:21,404 --> 00:06:27,071
So now you have high blood pressure in pink 
and a fallen blood pressure in blue.

100
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:33,207
So what exactly can the brain do to help normalize or create balance?

101
00:06:33,207 --> 00:06:35,943
So let me write that over here.

102
00:06:35,943 --> 00:06:42,600
Let's write 'response?'

103
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,669
So the body has a couple of strategies.

104
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:54,306
And they're basically summed up in the autonomic nervous system.

105
00:06:54,306 --> 00:07:01,572
There are two major branches of your autonomic nervous system

106
00:07:01,572 --> 00:07:04,567
or two parts to it, let's say parts.

107
00:07:04,567 --> 00:07:12,335
One is called the sympathetics, almost like sympathy.

108
00:07:12,335 --> 00:07:17,503
And the other one is called parasympathics.

109
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:24,501
They're very similar words, except the word para- is in front of this one.

110
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:28,272
And I want you to remember now, that there's a formula.

111
00:07:28,272 --> 00:07:37,346
And I'm gonna write that formula down here, 
just to remind us that pressure equals flow times resistance.

112
00:07:37,346 --> 00:07:43,639
And additionally, I want you to remember that flow, this one right here,

113
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:50,729
is going to be related to stroke volume times heart rate.

114
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:55,129
So if I can do anything, my body can do anything to raise the stroke volume,

115
00:07:55,129 --> 00:08:01,231
or the heart rate, or the resistance, then my pressure will go up.

116
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:05,791
And vice versa, if I can drop the stroke volume, or heart rate, or resistance, then my pressure will go down.

117
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:06,291
Ok.

118
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:14,596
So what this sympathetics do, is they have an effect on the heart and the vessels.

119
00:08:14,596 --> 00:08:19,289
The heart and the blood vessels all over the body,

120
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:26,290
not just the carotid sinus or the aortic arch, 
I'm talking about all blood vessels.

121
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:35,794
And so the sympathetics are going to, 
for the heart, they're going to increase the heart rate

122
00:08:35,794 --> 00:08:41,399
and they're going to increase the stroke volume.

123
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,706
And the parasympathetics do the opposite.

124
00:08:43,706 --> 00:08:47,458
They actually drop the heart rate and drop the stroke volume.

125
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,793
And the way that they do that.

126
00:08:48,793 --> 00:08:53,827
The heart rate is controlled by how many beats you get per minute,

127
00:08:53,827 --> 00:08:55,366
obviously that's the heart rate.

128
00:08:55,366 --> 00:09:01,628
The sympathetics are gonna cause the heart cells that control that, to work faster.

129
00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:04,324
The parasympathetics will slow them down.

130
00:09:04,324 --> 00:09:09,827
And for the stroke volume, the sympathetics force the heart to contract harder

131
00:09:09,827 --> 00:09:16,126
and then you have more volume of blood gushing out every beat.

132
00:09:16,126 --> 00:09:23,865
The parasympathetics make the heart work less forcefully, so you have less blood gushing out with every beat.

133
00:09:23,865 --> 00:09:31,704
And the sympathetics finally, they actually cause vasoconstriction.

134
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:36,600
And, you guessed it, the parasympathetics do the opposite.

135
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,864
So they cause vasodilation.

136
00:09:40,864 --> 00:09:49,165
And vasoconstriction and vasodilation basically mean whether the artery stays open or closes down.

137
00:09:49,165 --> 00:09:56,935
So for the sympathetics, the arteries and arterials primarily, mostly they're arterials, they start getting smaller.

138
00:09:56,935 --> 00:10:01,739
And as they get smaller, that increases resistance.

139
00:10:01,739 --> 00:10:07,501
And for the parasympathetics, they will cause the arterials to get bigger, to dilate

140
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:10,637
and that will cause the resistance to fall.

141
00:10:10,637 --> 00:10:15,639
So taking a quick peak at our equation, 
that I wrote out for you on the right

142
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:22,761
you can see that the sympathetics basically do everything that will help to increase the pressure.

143
00:10:22,761 --> 00:10:29,928
So if you have a pressure again of 140/90, 
then what would happen is,

144
00:10:29,928 --> 00:10:39,735
your body will see that as a high pressure and will try to get the parasympathetics to be active.

145
00:10:39,735 --> 00:10:44,468
It will activate all the parasympathetic nerves.

146
00:10:44,468 --> 00:10:55,668
And if your pressure is low, it's 90/60, then the body is going to respond by getting all the sympathetics to react.

147
00:10:55,668 --> 00:10:57,460
You see how it works?

148
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:04,806
And of course if your pressure is, let's say 115/75, and the baroreceptors are firing the usual 10 times per minute,

149
00:11:04,806 --> 00:11:12,197
then there should be really over all no response.

150
00:11:12,197 --> 00:11:16,429
Because the body thinks: well everything is already balanced, there is nothing more to do.

151
00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:21,672
So this is how the body is able to control blood pressure in a rapid way.

152
00:11:21,672 --> 00:11:23,633
That's the final point I want to make,

153
00:11:23,633 --> 00:11:30,264
that the input here, the baroreceptors, these are nerves

154
00:11:30,264 --> 00:11:34,563
and the autonomic nervous system, obviously these are nerves.

155
00:11:34,563 --> 00:11:41,096
So the information going in is the baroreceptors, 
the information going out is the autonomic nervous system.

156
00:11:41,096 --> 00:11:43,862
All this is happening rapidly.

157
00:11:43,862 --> 00:11:46,269
This is all very rapid.

158
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:51,463
And when I say rapid, I mean on the order of seconds to minutes.

159
00:11:51,463 --> 00:11:58,465
So within seconds to minutes this response can happen.

160
00:11:58,465 --> 00:12:04,828
So this is a fantastic example of how your body can take in information really quickly and really respond quickly,

161
00:12:04,828 --> 00:12:08,828
to help keep your blood pressure balanced.
