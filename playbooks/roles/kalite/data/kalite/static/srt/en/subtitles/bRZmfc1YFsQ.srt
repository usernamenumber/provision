1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,573
In this video, we will cover the power rule,

2
00:00:03,573 --> 00:00:07,251
which really simplifies our life,
when it comes to taking derivatives,

3
00:00:07,251 --> 00:00:09,333
especially derivatives of polynomials.

4
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:13,838
You're probably already familiar
with the definition of derivatives.

5
00:00:13,838 --> 00:00:15,582
The limit as delta x approaches 0,

6
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:21,924
f(x+delta x) - f(x),
all of that over delta x.

7
00:00:21,924 --> 00:00:25,324
and it really just comes out of
trying to find the slope of a tangent line,

8
00:00:25,324 --> 00:00:27,011
at a any given point.

9
00:00:27,011 --> 00:00:29,578
What we're going to see with the
power rule is it simplifies our life.

10
00:00:29,578 --> 00:00:32,841
We won't have to take these,
sometimes complicated, limits.

11
00:00:32,841 --> 00:00:34,642
We're not going to prove it
in this video,

12
00:00:34,642 --> 00:00:37,447
we'll hopefully get a
sense of how to use it,

13
00:00:37,447 --> 00:00:39,841
and in future videos,
we'll get a sense of why it makes sense,

14
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:41,256
and even prove it.

15
00:00:41,256 --> 00:00:43,001
So the power rule just tells us,

16
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:47,769
if I have some function,
f(x), equal to some power of x,

17
00:00:47,769 --> 00:00:55,923
so, x^n, where n is not 0.

18
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:58,638
so n could be anything,
it could be positive and negative,

19
00:00:58,638 --> 00:01:01,775
it does not have to be an integer.

20
00:01:01,775 --> 00:01:05,103
The power rule tells us that
the derivative of this,

21
00:01:05,103 --> 00:01:13,339
f'(x), is just equal to n,
so you're literally bringing this out front,

22
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:19,590
n * x, and then you just
decrement the power.

23
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,753
so f'(x) = n*x^(n-1).

24
00:01:24,753 --> 00:01:28,372
So let's do a couple of examples,
just to make sure that makes sense.

25
00:01:28,372 --> 00:01:34,255
So let's ask ourselves,
let's say f(x)=x^2.

26
00:01:34,255 --> 00:01:39,756
Based on the power rule,
what is f'(x) going to be equal to?

27
00:01:39,756 --> 00:01:43,678
Well, in this situation,
our n=2,

28
00:01:43,678 --> 00:01:50,108
so we bring the 2 out front,
2*x^(2-1).

29
00:01:50,108 --> 00:01:54,672
That will be 2*x^1,
which is just equal to 2x.

30
00:01:54,672 --> 00:01:56,088
That was pretty straightforward.

31
00:01:56,088 --> 00:02:02,930
Let's think about the situation
where g(x)=x^3.

32
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:08,256
What is g'(x) going to be,
in this scenario?

33
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:12,235
Well, n is 3, so we just
literally pattern match here,

34
00:02:12,235 --> 00:02:15,844
you'll find this to be
shockingly straightforward,

35
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:24,772
so this is going to be
3*x^(3-1) = 3x^2.

36
00:02:24,772 --> 00:02:25,775
And we're done!

37
00:02:25,775 --> 00:02:28,834
In the next video, we will think about
whether this actually makes sense.

38
00:02:28,834 --> 00:02:29,703
Let's do one more example,

39
00:02:29,703 --> 00:02:34,445
just to show it doesn't have to
necessarily apply to only the positive integers.

40
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:44,174
We could have a scenario where
we could have h(x)=x^(-100).

41
00:02:44,174 --> 00:02:48,109
The power rule tells us that
h'(x) would be equal to what?

42
00:02:48,109 --> 00:02:54,178
Well n = -100, so it's
-100 x^(-100-1).

43
00:02:54,178 --> 00:02:59,182
which is equal to -100x^(-101).

44
00:02:59,182 --> 00:03:00,004
Let's do one more.

45
00:03:00,004 --> 00:03:10,974
Let's say we had z(x)=x^2.571.

46
00:03:10,974 --> 00:03:16,381
And we are concerned with
what is z'(x).

47
00:03:16,381 --> 00:03:21,104
Once again, power rule simplifies our life,
so this is going to be

48
00:03:21,104 --> 00:03:28,925
2.571 * x^(2.571 - 1),
so it's going to be equal to,

49
00:03:28,925 --> 00:03:32,100
and make sure I'm not falling off
the bottom of the page,

50
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:40,105
2.571*x^1.571.

51
00:03:40,105 --> 00:03:41,928
Hopefully you enjoyed that.

52
00:03:41,928 --> 00:03:44,850
In the next video, we will
not only expose you to

53
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,267
more properties of the derivatives,
we'll get a sense for why

54
00:03:47,267 --> 00:03:48,678
the power rule at least makes 
intuitive sense,

55
00:03:48,678 --> 00:03:52,678
and then also prove the power rule,
for few cases.
