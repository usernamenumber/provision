Recognizing Prime Numbers

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,973
Determine whether the following numbers are prime, composite, or neither.

3
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:11,239
Just as a bit of a review, a prime number is a natural number, so one of the counting numbers

4
00:00:11,239 --> 00:00:17,559
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and so on, that has exactly two factors.

5
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:27,469
Its factors are 1 and itself. So an example of a prime number is 3.

6
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:33,656
There's only two natural numbers that are divisible into 3: 1 and 3.

7
00:00:33,656 --> 00:00:40,847
Another way to think about it is the only way to get 3 as a product of other natural numbers is 1 × 3.

8
00:00:40,847 --> 00:00:43,748
So it only has 1 and itself.

9
00:00:43,748 --> 00:00:51,056
A composite number is a natural number that has more than just 1 and itself as factors

10
00:00:51,056 --> 00:00:52,873
and we'll see examples of that.

11
00:00:52,873 --> 00:00:56,678
And neither, we'll see an interesting case of that in this problem.

12
00:00:56,678 --> 00:00:58,723
First let's think about 24.

13
00:00:58,723 --> 00:01:05,624
Let's think about all of the natural numbers, or the whole numbers, although 0 is also included in the whole numbers

14
00:01:05,624 --> 00:01:12,213
Let's think of all of the natural counting numbers that we can actually divide into 24 without having any remainder.

15
00:01:12,213 --> 00:01:14,309
We'd consider those the factors.

16
00:01:14,309 --> 00:01:20,396
Clearly, it is divisible by 1 and 24; in fact, 1 × 24 = 24.

17
00:01:20,396 --> 00:01:24,281
But it's also divisible by 2.

18
00:01:24,281 --> 00:01:30,480
2 × 12 = 24, so it's also divisible by 12.

19
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:37,994
It is also divisible by 3; 3 × 8 = 24.

20
00:01:37,994 --> 00:01:43,006
And at this point, we don't actually have to find all of the factors to realize that it's not prime.

21
00:01:43,006 --> 00:01:46,401
It clearly has more factors than just 1 and itself.

22
00:01:46,401 --> 00:01:51,096
So then it is clearly going to be composite.

23
00:01:51,096 --> 00:01:54,332
This is going to be composite.

24
00:01:54,332 --> 00:01:57,200
Let's just finish factoring it since we started it.

25
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:04,112
It's also divisible by 4, and 4 × 6 = 24.

26
00:02:04,112 --> 00:02:10,139
So these are all of the factors of 24, clearly more than just 1 and 24.

27
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,051
Now let's think about 2.

28
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:17,991
The non-zero whole numbers that are divisible into 2

29
00:02:17,991 --> 00:02:24,984
1 × 2 definitely works, 1 and 2, but there really aren't any others that are divisible into 2.

30
00:02:24,984 --> 00:02:28,867
So it has only 2 factors, 1 and itself.

31
00:02:28,867 --> 00:02:33,962
That's a definition of a prime number. So 2 is prime.

32
00:02:33,962 --> 00:02:36,860
2 is prime.

33
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:42,100
2 is interesting, because it is the only even prime number.

34
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:48,093
Only even prime number.

35
00:02:48,093 --> 00:02:51,983
And that might be common sense to you, because by definition,

36
00:02:51,983 --> 00:02:56,798
an even number is divisible by 2.

37
00:02:56,798 --> 00:02:59,667
So 2 is clearly divisible by 2, that's what makes it even

38
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:03,481
But it's only divisible by 2 and 1, that's what makes it prime.

39
00:03:03,481 --> 00:03:13,220
But anything that's even is going to be divisible by 1, itself, and 2.

40
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:18,048
Any other number that is even is going to be divisible by 1, itself, and 2.

41
00:03:18,048 --> 00:03:22,873
So by definition it's going to have 1 and itself and something else, so it's going to be composite.

42
00:03:22,873 --> 00:03:27,531
So 2 is prime; every other even number other than 2 is composite.

43
00:03:27,531 --> 00:03:31,062
Here is an interesting case: 1. 1 is only divisible by 1.

44
00:03:31,062 --> 00:03:35,405
1 is only divisible by 1.

45
00:03:35,405 --> 00:03:48,043
So it is not prime, technically, because it only has 1 as a factor; it does not have two factors.

46
00:03:48,043 --> 00:03:55,204
1 is itself, but it order to be prime, you have to have exactly two factors. 1 has only one factor.

47
00:03:55,204 --> 00:04:02,252
In order to be composite you have to have more than two factors: 1, yourself, and some other things.

48
00:04:02,252 --> 00:04:03,835
So it's not composite.

49
00:04:03,835 --> 00:04:07,725
1 is neither prime nor composite.

50
00:04:07,725 --> 00:04:10,291
1 is neither.

51
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,751
And finally we get to 17.

52
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:20,488
17 is divisible by 1 and 17.

53
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:27,162
It's not divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, or 16.

54
00:04:27,162 --> 00:04:39,044
It has exactly two factors, 1 and itself, so 17 is prime.
