1
00:00:00,373 --> 00:00:06,172
Let's add four elevenths to nine over thirteen

2
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:09,916
In order to add these two fractions we need to find a common denominator

3
00:00:09,916 --> 00:00:14,384
And that common denominator used to be the least common multiple of eleven and thirteen

4
00:00:14,384 --> 00:00:17,617
And these two numbers don't share any common factors

5
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:22,410
So their least common multiple is really just going to be the product of eleven and thirteen

6
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,188
So we could say thirteen times eleven

7
00:00:27,188 --> 00:00:29,273
Thirteen times one is thirteen

8
00:00:29,273 --> 00:00:32,415
Thirteen times another one is thirteen

9
00:00:32,415 --> 00:00:35,394
Or you could say thirteen times ten is a hundred and thirty

10
00:00:35,394 --> 00:00:39,480
And we get: three, four, one - one hundred and forty-three

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,540
So that's going to be our common denominator

12
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,292
So I'll write it over here:

13
00:00:43,292 --> 00:00:45,523
Something over one hundred and forty-three plus

14
00:00:45,523 --> 00:00:48,756
Something else over one hundred and forty-three

15
00:00:48,756 --> 00:00:52,125
And to go from four elevenths to something over one forty-three

16
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:55,438
We multiply the eleven times thirteen

17
00:00:55,438 --> 00:00:58,257
--Or we multiply the denominator times thirteen--

18
00:00:58,257 --> 00:01:01,223
So we're going to have to multiply the numerator times thirteen as well

19
00:01:01,223 --> 00:01:04,938
And four times thirteen--let's see: four times ten is forty

20
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:07,594
Four times three is twelve, so it gives us fifty-two

21
00:01:07,594 --> 00:01:10,106
And you can work that out by hand if you like

22
00:01:10,106 --> 00:01:12,291
Four times thirteen is fifty-two

23
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:17,714
And then to go from thirteen to one forty-three we multiply by eleven

24
00:01:17,714 --> 00:01:20,104
So if we multiply the denominator by eleven

25
00:01:20,104 --> 00:01:22,018
(if we don't want to change the value of the fraction)

26
00:01:22,018 --> 00:01:24,722
We have to multiply the numerator by eleven

27
00:01:24,722 --> 00:01:27,331
Nine times eleven is ninety-nine

28
00:01:27,331 --> 00:01:33,925
And now we're ready to add: this is equal to--our common denominator is one hundred and forty-three

29
00:01:33,925 --> 00:01:35,591
And fifty-two plus ninety-nine

30
00:01:35,591 --> 00:01:37,959
--Fifty-two plus a hundred would be one hundred and fifty two

31
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,739
And this is going to be one less than that

32
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:43,073
So it's going to be one hundred and fifty-one

33
00:01:43,073 --> 00:01:45,739
And I think that's about as simplified as we can get

34
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:51,714
As far as I know, it doesn't look like there are any common factors between one fifty-one and one forty-three

35
00:01:51,714 --> 00:01:54,732
So we just get one fifty-one over one forty-three

36
00:01:54,732 --> 00:01:56,585
--We can write this as a mixed number

37
00:01:56,585 --> 00:02:01,774
Because one forty-three goes into one fifty-one one time

38
00:02:01,774 --> 00:02:04,107
One times one forty-three is one forty-three

39
00:02:04,107 --> 00:02:07,678
When you subtract--let's see, this can become an eleven

40
00:02:07,678 --> 00:02:08,667
This is a four

41
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:10,473
Eleven minus three is eight

42
00:02:10,473 --> 00:02:11,905
You have a remainder of eight

43
00:02:11,905 --> 00:02:21,260
So one fifty-one over one forty-three is the same thing as one and eight one forty-thirds

44
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,294
And now it becomes even more clear that these can't be simplified anymore

45
00:02:25,294 --> 00:02:32,537
And we are done--this is the same thing as one and eight one forty-thirds
