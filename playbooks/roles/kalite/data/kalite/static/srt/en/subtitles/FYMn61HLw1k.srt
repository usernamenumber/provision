1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,320
   

2
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,070
In the last couple of videos
we saw that we can describe

3
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:07,810
a curves by a position
vector-valued function.

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,020
And in very general terms, it
would be the x position as a

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,750
function of time times
the unit vector in the

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,260
horizontal direction.

7
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,010
Plus the y position as a
function of time times

8
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,040
the unit victor in the
vertical direction.

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,120
And this will essentially
describe this-- though, if you

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,160
can imagine a particle and
let's say the parameter

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,620
t represents time.

12
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,030
It'll describe where the
particle is at any given time.

13
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,630
And if we wanted a particular
curve we can say, well, this

14
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,220
only applies for some curve--
we're dealing, it's r of t.

15
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:44,130
And it's only applicable
between t being greater

16
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,710
than a and less than b.

17
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,740
And you know, that would
describe some curve

18
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,060
in two dimensions.

19
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,120
Just me just draw it here.

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,920
This is all a review of
really, the last two videos.

21
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,050
So this curve, it might look
something like that where this

22
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,840
is where t is equal to a.

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,610
That's where t is equal to b.

24
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,260
And so r of a will be this
vector right here that

25
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,440
ends at that point.

26
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,170
And then as t or if you can
imagine the parameter being

27
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,210
time, it doesn't have to be
time, but that's a convenient

28
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,300
one to visualize.

29
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,030
Each corresponding as t gets
larger and larger, we're just

30
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,310
going to different-- we're
specifying different

31
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,230
points on the path.

32
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,070
We saw that two videos ago.

33
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,470
And in the last video we
thought about, well, what does

34
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:31,110
it mean to take the derivative
of a vector-valued function?

35
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,030
And we came up with this idea
that-- and it wasn't an idea,

36
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,550
we actually showed
it to be true.

37
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,530
We came up with a
definition really.

38
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,980
That the derivative-- I could
call it r prime of t-- and

39
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,220
it's going to be a vector.

40
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,940
The derivative of a
vector-valued function is once

41
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,330
again going to be a derivative.

42
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:49,060
But it was equal to-- the way
we defined it-- x prime of t

43
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:54,690
times i plus y prime
of t times j.

44
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,880
Or another way to write that
and I'll just write all

45
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,160
the different ways just so
you get familiar with--

46
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:04,740
dr/dt is equal to dx/dt.

47
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,330
This is just a
standard derivative.

48
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,650
x of t is a scalar function.

49
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:12,940
So this is a standard
derivative times i

50
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,610
plus dy/dt times j.

51
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,680
And if we wanted to think about
the differential, one thing

52
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,770
that we can think about-- and
whenever I do the math for

53
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,840
the differential it's a
little bit hand wavy.

54
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,950
I'm not being very rigorous.

55
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,855
But if you imagine multiplying
both sides of the equation by a

56
00:02:29,855 --> 00:02:37,590
very small dt or this exact dt,
you would get dr is equal to--

57
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,740
I'll just leave it like this.

58
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,330
dx/dt times dt.

59
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,765
I could make these cancel
out, but I'll just write

60
00:02:43,765 --> 00:02:45,140
it like this first.

61
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:52,950
Times the unit vector i
plus dy/dt times dt.

62
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,310
Times the unit vector j.

63
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,510
Or we could rewrite this.

64
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,570
And I'm just rewriting it in
all of the different ways

65
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,040
that one can rewrite it.

66
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:09,070
You could also write this as dr
is equal to x prime of t dt

67
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,340
times the unit vector i.

68
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:15,970
So this was x prime of t dt.

69
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,010
This is x prime of t right
there times the unit vector i.

70
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,750
Plus y prime of t.

71
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,400
That's just that right there.

72
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,210
Times dt.

73
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,980
Times the unit vector j.

74
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,000
And just to, I guess, complete
the trifecta, the other way

75
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,720
that we could write this is
that dr is equal to-- if we

76
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,980
just allowed these to cancel
out, then we get is equal

77
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:44,700
to dx times i plus dy
times dy y times j.

78
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,630
And that actually makes a
lot of intuitive sense.

79
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,860
That if I look at any dr,
so let's say I look at

80
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,325
the change between this
vector and this vector.

81
00:03:53,325 --> 00:03:57,300
Let's say the super small
change right there, that is our

82
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:02,390
dr, and it's made up of-- it's
our dx, our change in x

83
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,490
is that right there.

84
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,350
You can imagine it's that right
there times-- but we're

85
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,740
vectorizing it by multiplying
it by the unit vector in

86
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,120
the horizontal direction.

87
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:16,070
Plus dy times the unit vector
in the vertical direction.

88
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,990
So when you multiply this
distance times the unit

89
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,633
vector, you're essentially
getting this vector.

90
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:22,560
   

91
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,840
And when you multiply this
guy-- and actually our change

92
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,530
in y here is negative--
you're going to get

93
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,750
this vector right here.

94
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,390
So when you add those together
you'll get your change in

95
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,370
your actual position vector.

96
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,020
So that was all a little
bit of background.

97
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,160
And this might be somewhat
useful-- a future

98
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,800
video from now.

99
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,160
Actually, I'm going to leave it
there because really I just

100
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,910
wanted to introduce this
notation and get you

101
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:45,720
familiar with it.

102
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,770
In the next video, what I'm
going to do is give you a

103
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:53,780
little bit more intuition
for what exactly does

104
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,780
this thing mean?

105
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,560
And how does it change
depending on different

106
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,540
parameterizations.

107
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,780
And I'll do it with two
different parameterizations

108
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,110
for the same curve.

109
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,200
