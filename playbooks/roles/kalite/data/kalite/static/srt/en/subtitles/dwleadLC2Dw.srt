1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,110
Let's say I'm some type of the Investment Bank.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,580
Can I go out there and I buy a whole bunch of mortgages.

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,470
So right here are a whole bunch of people's mortgages.

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,510
And when I say buy a mortgage

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,450
it means the home-owners who borrow the money

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:19,350
instead of the money going to the mortgage broker

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,560
whom the home-owner think they got the loan from the servicer

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,120
who they think they are paying the check to.

9
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,280
Since I now have bought these mortgages,

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,010
I've essentially become the lender to the home-owner,

11
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,970
and so the home-owner's morgage payment

12
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:38,970
will now come to me the Investment Bank .

13
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,640
So I do this for a bunch of home-owners right over there.

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,550
But I don't want to be the end holder of the paper.

15
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,630
I really want to be the intermediary.

16
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:53,630
So what I do is I set up a Special Purpose Entity,

17
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,100
which is really just a corporation that I set up.

18
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,520
And I stick all of the mortgages inside

19
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,300
that Special Purpose Entity.

20
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,900
So I stick them all inside of that.

21
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,770
So now the Special Purpose Entity is the owner of the mortgages .

22
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,340
The investment bank at least starting off

23
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,810
with all of the shares of the Special Purpose Entity.

24
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:15,130
And so the Investment Bank could then sell shares.

25
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,710
It could split the Special Purpose Entity

26
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,400
into a million or ten million shares

27
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,180
and then sell those shares to investors.

28
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,860
And these shares would be called Mortgage-Backed Securities.

29
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,000
or sometimes MBSes.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,060
There are a part of a general class called Asset-Backed Securities

31
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,840
because what is going to happen now is that all of this money

32
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:42,410
flowing from home-owners will go the mortgages

33
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,160
which is now on the Specail Purpose Entity.

34
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,850
So all ended up inside the Special Purpose Entities .

35
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,440
And some of them will default,some of them won't.

36
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,800
But on average this Special Purpose Entity

37
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,910
will then be able to pay a [inaudible].

38
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,080
Essentially you can almost fueled on interest

39
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,280
to the owner of the Mortgage-Backed Security.
