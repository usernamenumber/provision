1
00:00:00,754 --> 00:00:02,903
I'm in the mood to improve my flexibility

2
00:00:02,903 --> 00:00:06,433
a little bit so I decide to take some Yoga classes

3
00:00:06,433 --> 00:00:10,172
so I show up at the local yoga place called Super Yoga

4
00:00:10,172 --> 00:00:12,701
and ask them, "how much does it cost?"

5
00:00:12,701 --> 00:00:15,737
And they say, "we've got a basic plan"

6
00:00:15,737 --> 00:00:17,675
"and we've got a trial plan."

7
00:00:17,675 --> 00:00:19,368
The trial plan, if you just want to try things out,

8
00:00:19,368 --> 00:00:21,231
you can come to any of the sessions

9
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:24,822
and it's going to cost you $12 per 1hr session.

10
00:00:24,822 --> 00:00:27,035
but if you like what you're doing here

11
00:00:27,035 --> 00:00:29,075
you might want to get a monthly membership

12
00:00:29,075 --> 00:00:30,362
That'll be $20/month,

13
00:00:30,362 --> 00:00:32,452
that you can view that as the basic plan

14
00:00:32,452 --> 00:00:35,420
It's $20/month and then you get a discount per session

15
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,569
It'll only be $8 per session

16
00:00:37,569 --> 00:00:41,590
So this seems interesting, but I'm a little bit confused.

17
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,084
Which plan should I take?

18
00:00:44,084 --> 00:00:47,570
So the first place, I might start is to think about

19
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:48,956
how much I would pay

20
00:00:48,956 --> 00:00:52,390
depending on how many sessions I actually take

21
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,101
And to do a little short hand here

22
00:00:54,101 --> 00:00:56,282
let's just define some variables

23
00:00:56,282 --> 00:01:01,763
Let's say that S = "Number of Sessions" I attend per month

24
00:01:01,763 --> 00:01:07,741
Number of sessions per month that I attend

25
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:09,941
I decided to attend at Super Yoga

26
00:01:09,941 --> 00:01:15,155
And let's say that C = "Total Monthly Cost"

27
00:01:15,616 --> 00:01:18,549
My Total Monthly Cost

28
00:01:18,933 --> 00:01:20,941
So with these variables defined this way,

29
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:22,849
let's think about how much I would pay

30
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,141
under each of these plans

31
00:01:24,141 --> 00:01:26,527
depending on how many sessions I would attend

32
00:01:26,527 --> 00:01:29,605
So first, let's think about the, we'll start with the Trial Plan

33
00:01:29,605 --> 00:01:31,147
cause that seems a little simplier

34
00:01:31,147 --> 00:01:32,755
and I'll draw a little column here

35
00:01:32,755 --> 00:01:38,768
I have a cost, actually, let me see, I'll draw my number of sessions

36
00:01:39,807 --> 00:01:44,243
Number of sessions and then I have my cost

37
00:01:44,243 --> 00:01:47,135
and then I'm going to draw a little table here

38
00:01:47,135 --> 00:01:50,048
A little table, that'll be for my trial plan

39
00:01:50,048 --> 00:01:51,570
and then let's also do the same thing,

40
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,093
since we're doing it for the trial plan

41
00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:55,507
let's do it for the basic plan so that we can compare

42
00:01:55,845 --> 00:01:57,884
Let's do it for the basic plan

43
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,923
so I have the Number of sessions I attend

44
00:01:59,923 --> 00:02:03,768
and my Total Cost

45
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:08,887
So let's first think about, if I decide to attend no sessions

46
00:02:08,887 --> 00:02:12,744
So if I decided to attend no sessions

47
00:02:12,744 --> 00:02:15,567
under my trial plan, what will be my cost?

48
00:02:16,905 --> 00:02:20,833
Well, $12 per session, 12 x no sessions

49
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,369
Well, I'm not going to have to pay anything

50
00:02:22,369 --> 00:02:25,898
My cost is going to be zero

51
00:02:25,898 --> 00:02:28,036
Now what about that same question

52
00:02:28,036 --> 00:02:29,091
under the basic plan

53
00:02:29,091 --> 00:02:33,102
If I have the basic plan, but in a given month

54
00:02:33,102 --> 00:02:35,485
I attend no sessions,

55
00:02:35,485 --> 00:02:38,036
I don't go to the gym, I don't go to this yoga gym at all

56
00:02:38,036 --> 00:02:40,100
How much am I going to have to pay?

57
00:02:40,946 --> 00:02:42,615
Well, it's $8 per sessions

58
00:02:42,615 --> 00:02:44,230
I didn't have to go to any sessions

59
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,562
So I'm not going to have to pay anything

60
00:02:45,562 --> 00:02:46,894
on a per session basis

61
00:02:46,894 --> 00:02:49,418
but I will have to pay that $20/month

62
00:02:49,418 --> 00:02:53,239
So I will have to pay $20

63
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,076
even though I didn't even attend

64
00:02:55,691 --> 00:02:57,923
That doesn't seem so good in that scenario

65
00:02:57,923 --> 00:03:00,365
But let's keep working through other scenarios

66
00:03:00,365 --> 00:03:04,286
Let's think about the scenario where I attend 1 session

67
00:03:05,024 --> 00:03:07,249
Where I attend 1 session

68
00:03:07,249 --> 00:03:11,011
Under the trial plan, how much will I have to pay?

69
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,741
Well, it's $12/session x 1 session

70
00:03:15,741 --> 00:03:21,561
I'm going to pay $12

71
00:03:21,637 --> 00:03:24,476
Let's think about that same scenario under the basic plan

72
00:03:24,476 --> 00:03:27,011
Under the basic plan, if I attend 1 session

73
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:32,070
Well, it's $8/session x 1 session

74
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,173
$8 for that

75
00:03:33,173 --> 00:03:35,257
Plus just the basic monthly

76
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:37,967
So I'm just going to have to pay $20 + ($8 x 1)

77
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,209
So $28.

78
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:43,981
I'm going to have to pay $28

79
00:03:43,981 --> 00:03:46,703
So still that trial plan still looks pretty good

80
00:03:46,703 --> 00:03:49,392
even if I attend 1 session

81
00:03:49,392 --> 00:03:50,303
Let me make it clear

82
00:03:50,303 --> 00:03:51,303
That's in dollars

83
00:03:51,303 --> 00:03:53,506
and that over here is $28

84
00:03:53,506 --> 00:03:54,560
and I could keep going

85
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,615
and I encourage you to keep going

86
00:03:55,615 --> 00:03:56,902
but let's try 1 more

87
00:03:56,902 --> 00:03:59,433
just to see how, just to get a feel for the numbers here

88
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:02,989
If I attend 2 sessions under the trial plan

89
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:05,589
How much am I going to pay?

90
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:08,368
Well, it's $12/session x 2 sessions

91
00:04:08,368 --> 00:04:13,595
i'm going to pay $24

92
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,289
Let's think about the basic plan

93
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:17,969
if I attend 2 sessions

94
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:20,800
-- let me do that in a yellow colour --

95
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,911
if I attend 2 sessions

96
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:27,205
2 x $8/session, that's going to $16

97
00:04:27,205 --> 00:04:30,152
plus the $20 I'm going to have to spend every month

98
00:04:30,152 --> 00:04:35,415
So it's going to 2 x $8

99
00:04:35,815 --> 00:04:38,679
+ $20

100
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:41,389
= $16 + $20

101
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:44,100
= $36

102
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,507
So at least for the scenarios that we set up here

103
00:04:46,507 --> 00:04:49,151
if I attend 0 or 1 or 2 sessions

104
00:04:49,151 --> 00:04:51,552
the trial plan seems to be winning out

105
00:04:51,552 --> 00:04:52,777
but I want to explore at what point

106
00:04:52,777 --> 00:04:56,161
does the trial plan actually become a little bit worse

107
00:04:56,161 --> 00:04:57,278
But before we do that

108
00:04:57,278 --> 00:04:59,893
let's think about if we can represent this

109
00:04:59,893 --> 00:05:00,970
this a little algebraically

110
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,173
because it's going to allow us to be a little bit more precise

111
00:05:03,173 --> 00:05:06,036
with coming up with our answers

112
00:05:06,036 --> 00:05:09,168
So if we say that, S is the "Number of Sessions per Month"

113
00:05:09,168 --> 00:05:11,257
and C is the "Monthly Cost"

114
00:05:11,257 --> 00:05:15,303
How can we express the trial plan as an equation?

115
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,092
Well, we could say our Total Cost

116
00:05:19,092 --> 00:05:20,911
our Total Monthly Cost

117
00:05:20,911 --> 00:05:22,694
so this is for our trial plan right over here

118
00:05:22,694 --> 00:05:24,278
let me draw a dotted line over here to show

119
00:05:24,278 --> 00:05:25,968
well, the dotted line goes around there

120
00:05:25,968 --> 00:05:29,814
so under the trial plan our total cost is going to be equal to

121
00:05:29,814 --> 00:05:37,559
well, it's $12/session x # of sessions

122
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:41,864
times S

123
00:05:41,864 --> 00:05:46,159
So under the trial plan I could say my total cost is equal to

124
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:48,902
$12 x # of Sessions

125
00:05:48,902 --> 00:05:52,101
$12/session x the Number of Sessions

126
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,948
Let's so the same thing with the basic plan

127
00:05:53,948 --> 00:05:56,748
How can we express that as an equation?

128
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:00,752
Well, we have our total cost

129
00:06:00,752 --> 00:06:03,166
our total cost is going to be equal to

130
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,507
well, regardless of what we do

131
00:06:05,507 --> 00:06:07,676
any given month, we're going to have to pay

132
00:06:07,676 --> 00:06:09,633
the $20/month

133
00:06:09,633 --> 00:06:11,368
we're going to have to pay that 20

134
00:06:11,368 --> 00:06:12,270
So no matter what we do,

135
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,172
we're going to have to pay that 20

136
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:14,488
just from the get-go

137
00:06:14,488 --> 00:06:17,923
and then we're going to pay $8/session

138
00:06:17,923 --> 00:06:34,005
so it's going to be $20 + ($8 x # of Sessions)

139
00:06:34,005 --> 00:06:35,793
so that's interesting and you can see

140
00:06:35,793 --> 00:06:38,430
if you put S is 0 here,

141
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,580
if you make S = 0

142
00:06:39,626 --> 00:06:42,300
you get 20 + (8 x 0) which is 20

143
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,547
if you say S is 1, you get 20 + (8 x 1)

144
00:06:46,547 --> 00:06:47,492
which is 28

145
00:06:47,492 --> 00:06:49,967
so you see that each of these S's and C's

146
00:06:49,967 --> 00:06:52,369
they satisfy this equation

147
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:53,786
Same thing over here

148
00:06:53,786 --> 00:06:55,204
and we can keep trying more and more

149
00:06:55,204 --> 00:06:56,832
What's neat about these equations is

150
00:06:56,832 --> 00:06:59,100
just this equation encapsulates

151
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,369
all of the possible combinations here

152
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:03,594
and just this equation encapsulates

153
00:07:03,594 --> 00:07:08,623
all the possible combinations there

154
00:07:08,623 --> 00:07:10,189
and so for the next few videos,

155
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:11,483
what I want to do is explore

156
00:07:11,483 --> 00:07:13,444
How can we use these equations

157
00:07:13,444 --> 00:07:15,405
to come up with more insights as to

158
00:07:15,405 --> 00:07:18,533
which plan is better for me
