1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
   

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,680
We now know how to calculate the
Price to Earnings ratio.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,595
Let's see if we can use it to
make a judgment about whether

4
00:00:07,595 --> 00:00:10,470
a company is cheap or expensive

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,970
relative to another company.

6
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:16,400
So let's say I have Company
A and I have Company B.

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,923
And for the sake of our
discussion, let's say they're

8
00:00:17,923 --> 00:00:18,790
in the same industry.

9
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,660
And that's important because
Price to Earnings really is

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,260
more of a relative valuation.

11
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,590
You kind of want to compare
apples to apples.

12
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,240
It's hard to compare one
Price to Earnings in

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,240
one industry to another.

14
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,690
We'll talk a lot in the future
about why that is, and we'll

15
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,200
get more into the nuance.

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:33,930
But let's just say they're
in the same industry.

17
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,700
Maybe they're software
companies.

18
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,180
Maybe Company A, each share I
can buy it for, so the price

19
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:46,100
per share of Company A is $10.

20
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:51,090
Price per share of
Company B is $20.

21
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,880
So remember, just this
information alone does not

22
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,540
tell me that A is cheap
and B is expensive.

23
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,120
We learned that in
our first video.

24
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:06,080
And let's say that it's
2008 earnings.

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,440
Company A made $1 per share.

26
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,760
$1 of EPS.

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,240
This is Earnings Per Share,
not total earnings.

28
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,140
To figure out total earnings, we
would take this number and

29
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,240
multiply by the number
of shares.

30
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,460
And let's say Company
B made $5 per share.

31
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,110
$5 EPS, Earnings Per Share.

32
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,565
So what are their respective
Price to Earnings ratios?

33
00:01:30,565 --> 00:01:34,710
   

34
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,830
Company is 10.

35
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,120
The price is $10, the earnings
is $1, so $10

36
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,240
divided by $1 is 10.

37
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,950
Company B, the price is $20,
the earnings are $5. $20

38
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,830
divided by $5 is 4.

39
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,670
So just when you look at it
superficially right here, when

40
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,500
you take Price to Earnings-- and
actually just as a little

41
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,760
aside, whenever someone says the
Price to Earnings ratio is

42
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,060
10, or the Price to Earnings for
Company B is 4, the first

43
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,090
thing you should ask is, what
earnings are you using?

44
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,750
Are you using historical
earnings?

45
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,850
Are you using the past
12 months earnings?

46
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,820
Are you using future earnings?

47
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,920
In this case, we use last
year's earnings.

48
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,660
We use 2008 earnings.

49
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,600
And that's a key thing.

50
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,605
And we'll talk about that if we
have time a little bit more

51
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:19,500
in this video.

52
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,550
So based on 2008 earnings, the
price to 2008 earnings for

53
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,920
Company A is 10.

54
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,180
The price to 2008 earnings
for Company B is 4.

55
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,870
So for every dollar of earnings
per year, if you

56
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,940
believe that the 2008 earnings
are indicative,

57
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,550
you're paying $4 here.

58
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,660
For every dollar of earnings
here, you're paying $10.

59
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,505
So based on that, this
looks cheaper.

60
00:02:42,505 --> 00:02:46,440
   

61
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,040
Low Price to Earnings ratio
implies that it's cheaper.

62
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,260
For the same earnings you're
paying a lower price.

63
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,310
For every dollar of earnings,
you're paying $4.

64
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,760
For every dollar of earnings
here, you're paying $10.

65
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,660
So it looks like it's cheaper.

66
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,060
And if everything was equal, if
these companies really were

67
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,470
equal, in terms of their capital
structure, in terms of

68
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,530
how much debt they had, in terms
of their growth rate, in

69
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,010
terms of their risk, in terms
of the markets they operate

70
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:16,160
in, in terms of who are their
customers, and how much of a

71
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,770
competitive advantage they have.
If all of those things

72
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:22,120
were completely identical,
you would be correct.

73
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,350
You would be correct that
Company B was cheaper.

74
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,850
And notice that it's the
complete opposite of just the

75
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:29,940
superficial price.

76
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,630
The price here, Company
B was more.

77
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,220
But when you look at the Price
to Earnings ratio, you say

78
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,430
Company B is cheaper.

79
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,570
Now, immediately if you were
to see this is the real

80
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,880
market, where you see two
identical companies-- or you

81
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,150
think they're identical
companies-- and one is trading

82
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:47,230
at a lower multiple or a lower
Price to Earnings multiple

83
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,120
than the other, you should
be very suspicious.

84
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,580
There's some chance that you're
the first person to

85
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,570
notice this discrepancy, and
then in that case you should

86
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,550
go and buy Company B.

87
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,260
And if you're into shorting
things, you could short

88
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,920
Company A, and you could
make a lot of money.

89
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,190
But you should be
very suspicious.

90
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:05,210
Is kind of like the classical
two economists walking down

91
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:05,900
the street.

92
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,020
And they see a $20 bill.

93
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,530
And one economist says,
hey, why don't I

94
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,420
pick up the $20 bill.

95
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,090
And he says, no you silly, how
can you be an economist?

96
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,380
It clearly isn't a $20 bill,
because if it was, someone

97
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,149
else would have picked
it up before us.

98
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:22,820
That markets don't allow just
free money to be sitting

99
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,400
around there.

100
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,450
And if these companies were
truly identical, this

101
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,140
discrepancy would
be free money.

102
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,600
And the first person to see it
would start buying Company B,

103
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,860
and the price would move up.

104
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,220
And maybe people would short
Company A, and the

105
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,160
price would move down.

106
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,860
And that would happen
very quickly in

107
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,900
today's public markets.

108
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,340
And at some point, these Price
to Earnings ratios should be

109
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,880
equal if-- and this is a big
if-- if these companies really

110
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,360
are equal in terms of their
earnings potential and the

111
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,860
risks and their growth.

112
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,090
But let me ask you a question.

113
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,500
Let's say that we don't know
that they're truly equal.

114
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:01,160
Why would someone be willing
to pay a Price to Earnings

115
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,990
ratio of 10 for Company A and
pass up, or maybe not want to

116
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,240
buy, Company B, even though
they're paying only a Price to

117
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,390
Earnings ratio of 4.

118
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,940
Why would they rather pay $10
for every $1 of earnings in

119
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,775
2008, as opposed to
$4 of every dollar

120
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:21,180
of earnings in 2008?

121
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,080
We touched on it in
the last video.

122
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,620
Maybe they think Company
A is a lot safer.

123
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,730
It's closer to a bank account
that-- Company B, sure it made

124
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,540
$5 in earnings, but
that is risky.

125
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,180
You don't know.

126
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,950
Every year, maybe one year it
makes $5, and maybe the next

127
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,180
it loses $5.

128
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,580
Well Company A is more steady,
so that's one reason.

129
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,210
And the other reason is, this
was just 2008 earnings.

130
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,830
But just one year of earnings
really don't capture what's

131
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,820
happening at a company.

132
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,320
A company could do really good
one year, really bad the next.

133
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,230
It might be shrinking.

134
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,230
It might be growing.

135
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,250
And this is the important
thing.

136
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,380
There's always this temptation
in investing

137
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,870
to always look back.

138
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,100
To see what happened to the
stock in the past. Or how much

139
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,670
did the company earn
in the past?

140
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,870
Or how much did it
grow in the past?

141
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,090
But that's all irrelevant.

142
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,990
That's already in the stock.

143
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,630
That's already happened,
whatever money was there to be

144
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,030
made has already been made.

145
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,070
You always have to be
looking forward.

146
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,050
So we said this is
2008 earnings.

147
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,690
But let's say 2009 earnings,
the picture looks

148
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,540
a little bit different.

149
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,470
Let me draw this here.

150
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:31,850
So let's say in 2009 EPS-- this
is A and this is B-- A is

151
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:38,610
expected to make $2 per share.

152
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:47,750
And B is expected to
make $4 per share.

153
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,180
So now if you took the Price
to Earnings ratio on 2009

154
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,810
earnings-- some of which is
behind us because I'm making

155
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:58,380
this video in August of 2009--
and so we know half the year.

156
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,420
But the other part of this
number is kind of a

157
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,480
projection.

158
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,480
Hopefully diligent and
intelligent people have come

159
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,600
up with this estimate.

160
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,170
So oftentimes you'll see this
as a 2009 estimate EPS.

161
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,550
This is people's best guess.

162
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:18,880
But here, the Price to Earnings
for 2009 then

163
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,430
becomes-- let's see.

164
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,515
If I'm paying $10 today for $2
of earnings in 2009, the Price

165
00:07:23,515 --> 00:07:27,430
to Earnings of 5
for Company A.

166
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:30,260
Well, for Company B, it's
a Price to Earnings

167
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,210
20 divided by 4.

168
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,010
It's also a 5.

169
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:33,650
So notice.

170
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,290
Now when you look at
2009 earnings,

171
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,640
they look pretty similar.

172
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,910
So although when you looked back
at 2008 earnings, Company

173
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:40,680
A looked expensive.

174
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,400
Higher Price to Earnings
in Company B.

175
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,060
But then when you look
at the current

176
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,180
earnings, they look similar.

177
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,540
Now the question was, why would
someone want to pay more

178
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,040
for Company A?

179
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,180
Why would they choose
Company A over this?

180
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,450
This analysis I just said said,
oh, based on 2009 it

181
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,150
looks neutral.

182
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,180
The Price to Earnings
ratio is the same.

183
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,470
For every $1 in earnings,
you're paying $5.

184
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,280
But notice a trend.

185
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,250
In 2008, they made $1.

186
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,620
Then they made $2 in 2009.

187
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,640
And maybe there's some
estimates for 2010.

188
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,500
Or maybe you can make
your own estimate.

189
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,060
So maybe in 2010 people
are saying Company

190
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,110
A has a great product.

191
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,720
It's growing.

192
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,430
The market's growing.

193
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,980
Maybe in 2010, Company A
is going to make $2.50.

194
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,200
It's going to grow another
25% in 2010.

195
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,680
Maybe its growth rate
slows a little bit.

196
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,700
But it's going to continue
to grow.

197
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,450
While Company B went from $5 of
earnings in 2008 to $4 in

198
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,640
2009, and maybe it shrinks
a little bit.

199
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,480
Maybe it shrinks in half.

200
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,690
Maybe it goes to $2 in 2010.

201
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:47,950
So now if you do a Price to
Earnings on 2010 earnings-- so

202
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,160
this is 18 months out from
when this video is being

203
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,780
made-- all of a sudden, your
Price to Earnings relative to

204
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:59,550
2010 earnings is 4
for Company A.

205
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,110
And it's 10 for Company B.

206
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,500
So now we switched places.

207
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,960
Now Company B looks more
expensive on 2010 earnings.

208
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,340
And Company A looks
downright cheap.

209
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,110
And this is an important
thing to realize.

210
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:17,410
In a present period, you are
willing to pay a higher Price

211
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,380
to Earnings ratio if the
company is growing.

212
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,760
And you're going to pay a lower
Price to Earnings ratio

213
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,520
if the company isn't growing.

214
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,280
So growth is the other reason
why you're willing to pay a

215
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,560
higher Price to Earnings
ratio.

216
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,870
A good exercise, let's say
you see a company.

217
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:36,150
Sometimes someone might
look at a company.

218
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:41,910
Company C is trading at $100.

219
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:49,780
And let's say for 2009 people
expect it's going to make $1.

220
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,620
So a lot of people immediately
will figure out the Price to

221
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,610
Earnings based on 2009
estimated earnings.

222
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:56,690
Remember, it's always
important to

223
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,130
know what the E is.

224
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,190
This is 2009 estimates.

225
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,840
They'll say, this is 100 Price
to Earnings Ratio.

226
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,980
That's crazy.

227
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,860
I would never pay that.

228
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,860
That's an expensive company.

229
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,120
And maybe they'll even
short it there.

230
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,600
Which can be a very foolhardy
thing to do

231
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,040
if you're not careful.

232
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,510
But you might say, oh no,
don't short it just yet.

233
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,040
Think about it.

234
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,400
This company's growing so fast,
based on my projections

235
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,280
they've just really tapped
into this market.

236
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,520
They have this intellectual
property, and no one can

237
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,520
compete with them.

238
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,810
In 2010 I expect this company
to double every year.

239
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,910
I expect them to grow
100% every year for

240
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,020
the next three years.

241
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,040
And the other person
says, oh fine.

242
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,350
OK.

243
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,790
In 2010 if they're going
to double, they're

244
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,710
going to make $2.

245
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:42,290
Well that's still a Price to
Earnings based on 2010 of--

246
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,980
100 divided by 2 is
50-- you're like,

247
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,990
that's still expensive.

248
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,000
That's still way more expensive
than most companies.

249
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,940
The average Price to Earnings
ratio in the market right now

250
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,730
I believe is 17 or 18.

251
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,910
Why would I pay 50 times
2010 earnings?

252
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,170
I'm really going forward.

253
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:00,840
We all know if you've watched
the present value videos,

254
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,900
money in the future, earnings
in the future are worth less

255
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,330
than earnings today.

256
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:10,020
But you say, no but these guys
are growing so fast in 2011

257
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,050
they're going to make $4.

258
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,975
Then all of a sudden the Price
to Earnings ratio is starting

259
00:11:13,975 --> 00:11:16,430
to look a little bit better.

260
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,740
25.

261
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,610
And then you could say, not only
that, but in 2012 I'm so

262
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:24,050
confident that these guys have
tapped into this huge market,

263
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,840
they're going to make
$8 per share.

264
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,240
They're going to keep doubling
all the way into 2012.

265
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,430
And now all of a sudden, you're
trading at 12.5 times.

266
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,880
And then if that growth were to
continue-- and this is an

267
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,330
important point-- the growth
has to continue.

268
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,030
You can't just say, oh if
something's growing at 100%

269
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,960
for one year, I'm willing
to pay 100 times that.

270
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,960
Because if it grows 100% for one
year, then stops growing,

271
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,190
there's no way that you would
want to pay 50 times earnings

272
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,340
for something that's not
growing in the future.

273
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,230
But if it keeps growing at 100%
per year for 5 years,

274
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,350
then it actually might
seem interesting.

275
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:00,050
So in 2013 you'll
be making $16.

276
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:04,240
And then we're looking at a 6
and change Price to Earnings,

277
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,400
which is downright cheap.

278
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,280
So the debate on whether you're
willing to pay-- When

279
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,160
you look at a Price to Earnings
ratio of 100, a lot

280
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,580
of people have a knee-jerk
reaction.

281
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,020
They say, that is unbelievably
expensive.

282
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,370
The market is crazy.

283
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,250
Why on earth would
anyone pay $100?

284
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,350
And the reason that they're
paying $100, if they're not

285
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,480
speculators, and obviously most
people in the market are,

286
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,080
is that they believe that this
company is growing very fast--

287
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,000
in this case 100% a year.

288
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,630
And in order to justify this,
the company has to grow that

289
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,510
fast for many, many,
many years.

290
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,920
So in this case maybe at least
five or six years.

291
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,640
Then all of a sudden this
doesn't seem that crazy.

292
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,210
For a company that's growing
100% a year for five or six

293
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,110
years, this is actually
a good deal.

294
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,730
If it's growing 100% a year for
20 years, this is actually

295
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,010
a very good deal.

296
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:53,060
Obviously a 6 Price to Earnings
of 20 times 2013

297
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:57,730
earnings isn't as good as a 6
Price to Earnings of 2010,

298
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,710
because earnings in the future
aren't worth as much as

299
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,880
earnings today.

300
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,730
And you can watch the
present value video.

301
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,490
But give or take, 100% growth is
much larger than what most

302
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,430
discount rates would be.

303
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,400
So this is a good way
to think about it.

304
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,080
The reason why you are willing
to pay a higher Price to

305
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,900
Earnings is for growth, and even
more for growth that will

306
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,220
continue and that you think
has a very high

307
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,990
likelihood of occurring.

308
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,740
And then the other reason
is you think

309
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,790
there's very low risk.

310
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,730
And we touched on that in the
first video when we talked

311
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,170
about bank accounts.

312
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,720
And why someone's willing to
pay a 50 Price to Earnings

313
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,560
essentially for a
bank account.

314
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,110
And one last point-- and I'll
just touch on this at the end

315
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,590
of the video.

316
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,660
It's a little bit
of technical.

317
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,460
There's kind of a general rule
of thumb that if a company is

318
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:44,080
not doing anything, it's just
stable, safe, not moving up or

319
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:50,740
down, that a fair or a cheap
Price to Earnings is 10 times

320
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,730
this year or last year.

321
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,890
10 times earnings.

322
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,850
And you might wonder, where
does that come from?

323
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:59,450
Why isn't it 9 times earnings
or 12 times earnings?

324
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,660
And that's actually a
very good question.

325
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,110
There's actually no obvious
reason why it

326
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,200
isn't 9 or 11 or 12.

327
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,080
It's just 10 because one, this
is a nice round number.

328
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,450
And also, if you were to take
an earnings stream.

329
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:17,510
So if you were to take a company
in 2009, 2010, 2011,

330
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:20,560
2012, and just kept going, and
if it had an earnings stream.

331
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,660
Let's say in every year
it's going to make $1.

332
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,800
And if you were to discount
this back.

333
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,100
And you should watch the present
value videos, if this

334
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,570
makes no sense to you.

335
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,710
But if you were to present value
this-- let's say they

336
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:33,640
make $1 forever going into the
future-- and you were to

337
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,220
present value this using
a discount rate.

338
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,350
So 2009 money, that's
worth $1.

339
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,130
2010 money, you want
to discount it.

340
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:45,240
So you want to divide it by,
let's say we use 11% as a

341
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:45,960
discount rate.

342
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,040
And actually, roughly
10 or 11%.

343
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,880
This is all a little
bit of hand waving.

344
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:54,190
So the value of that dollar
would be 1 divided by 1.11.

345
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,090
I've just added the 11% here.

346
00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:00,390
The value of that dollar would
be 1 divided by 1.11 squared.

347
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:04,810
This dollar would be
1.11 to the third.

348
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:07,100
If you were to add up the
present value of that income

349
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:12,490
stream, you're going to get
roughly $10 or 10 times the

350
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,490
earnings stream.

351
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,360
So that's where it comes from.

352
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,800
Instead of doing this present
value calculation for

353
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,190
everything, and there's so much
error involved anyway, in

354
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,560
terms of just estimating
earnings, people just give a

355
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,480
rule of thumb.

356
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,370
But obviously if interest
rates go down, then this

357
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,480
number will go down, and you
might be able to justify a

358
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,900
higher Price to Earnings,
but I don't want to

359
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,850
go there just yet.

360
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:33,100
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
