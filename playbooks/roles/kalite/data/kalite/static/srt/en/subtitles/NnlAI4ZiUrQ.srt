1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
   

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,450
We know a little bit
about magnets now.

3
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,020
Let's see if we can study it
further and learn a little bit

4
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,880
about magnetic field and
actually the effects that they

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,960
have on moving charges.

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,650
And that's actually really how
we define magnetic field.

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,910
So first of all, with any field
it's good to have a way

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,730
to visualize it.

9
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:24,270
With the electrostatic fields
we drew field lines.

10
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,910
So let's try to do the same
thing with magnetic fields.

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,650
Let's say this is
my bar magnet.

12
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:34,020
This is the north pole and
this is the south pole.

13
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,940
Now the convention, when we're
drawing magnetic field lines,

14
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,410
is to always start at the north
pole and go towards the

15
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:40,180
south pole.

16
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:44,470
And you can almost view it as
the path that a magnetic north

17
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,000
monopole would take.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,490
So if it starts here-- if a
magnetic north monopole, even

19
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,650
though as far as we know they
don't exist in nature,

20
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,060
although they theoretically
could, but let's just say for

21
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,800
the sake of argument
that we do have a

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,950
magnetic north monopole.

23
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,950
If it started out here, it would
want to run away from

24
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:01,040
this north pole and would try
to get to the south pole.

25
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,940
So it would do something,
its path would look

26
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,190
something like this.

27
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,370
   

28
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,110
If it started here, maybe
its path would look

29
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,360
something like this.

30
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,650
   

31
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,460
Or if it started here, maybe
its path would look

32
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,240
something like this.

33
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,280
I think you get the point.

34
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,500
Another way to visualize it is
instead of thinking about a

35
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,610
magnetic north monopole and the
path it would take, you

36
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,800
could think of, well, what if
I had a little compass here?

37
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,290
Let me draw it in a
different color.

38
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,140
Let's say I put the
compass here.

39
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,625
That's not where I
want to do it.

40
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:38,430
Let's say I do it here.

41
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,110
The compass pointer will
actually be tangent to the

42
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,310
field line.

43
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,560
So the pointer could
look something like

44
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,712
this at this point.

45
00:01:47,712 --> 00:01:50,150
It would look something
like this.

46
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,460
And this would be the north pole
of the pointer and this

47
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,440
would be the south pole
of the pointer.

48
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,740
Or you could-- that's how north
and south were defined.

49
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,940
People had compasses, they said,
oh, this is the north

50
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:04,100
seeking pole, and it points
in that direction.

51
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,740
But it's actually seeking
the south pole

52
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,580
of the larger magnet.

53
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,949
And that's where we got into
that big confusing discussion

54
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:12,980
of that the magnetic geographic
north pole that

55
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,840
we're used to is actually the
south pole of the magnet that

56
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,340
we call Earth.

57
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,800
And you could view the last
video on Introduction to

58
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,160
Magnetism to get confused
about that.

59
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,190
But I think you see
what I'm saying.

60
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,100
North always seeks south the
same way that positive seeks

61
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,430
negative, and vice versa.

62
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,870
And north runs away
from north.

63
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,060
And really the main conceptual
difference-- although they are

64
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,530
kind of very different
properties-- although we will

65
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,830
see later they actually end up
being the same thing, that we

66
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,800
have something called an
electromagnetic force, once we

67
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,680
start learning about Maxwell's
equations and

68
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,520
relativity and all that.

69
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,030
But we don't have to worry
about that right now.

70
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:50,090
But in classical electricity and
magnetism, they're kind of

71
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,660
a different force.

72
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,070
And the main difference--
although you know, these field

73
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,100
lines, you can kind of view
them as being similar-- is

74
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,750
that magnetic forces always come
in dipoles, soon. while

75
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,920
you could have electrostatic
forces that are monopoles.

76
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,110
You could have just a positive
or a negative charge.

77
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,100
So that's fine, you say,
Sal, that's nice.

78
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,130
You drew these field lines.

79
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,260
And you've probably seen it
before if you've ever dropped

80
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,950
metal filings on top
of a magnet.

81
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,070
They kind of arrange themselves

82
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:13,930
along these field lines.

83
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,440
But you might say, well,
that's kind of useful.

84
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,520
But how do we determine the
magnitude of a magnetic field

85
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,300
at any point?

86
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,950
And this is where it
gets interesting.

87
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,530
The magnitude of a magnetic
field is really determined, or

88
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:33,340
it's really defined, in terms of
the effect that it has on a

89
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,130
moving charge.

90
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,580
So this is interesting.

91
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,640
I've kind of been telling you
that we have this different

92
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,110
force called magnetism that
is different than the

93
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,610
electrostatic force.

94
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:47,490
But we're defining magnetism in
terms of the effect that it

95
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,500
has on a moving charge.

96
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,510
And that's a bit of a clue.

97
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,550
And we'll learn later, or
hopefully you'll learn later

98
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:55,540
as you advance in physics,
that magnetic force or a

99
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:00,200
magnetic field is nothing but an
electrostatic field moving

100
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,040
at a very high speed.

101
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,160
At a relativistic speed.

102
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,160
Or you could almost view it as
they are the same thing, just

103
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,730
from different frames
of reference.

104
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:08,970
I don't want to confuse
you right now.

105
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,730
But anyway, back to what I'll
call the basic physics.

106
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:17,730
So if I had to find a magnetic
field as B-- so B is a vector

107
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:23,610
and it's a magnetic field-- we
know that the force on a

108
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,000
moving charge could be an
electron, a proton, or some

109
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,190
other type of moving
charged particle.

110
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,840
And actually, this is the basis
of how they-- you know,

111
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,830
when you have supercolliders--
how they get the particles to

112
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,030
go in circles, and how they
studied them by based on how

113
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,110
they get deflected by
the magnetic field.

114
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,820
But anyway, the force on a
charge is equal to the

115
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,670
magnitude of the charge-- of
course, this could be positive

116
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:49,090
or negative-- times, and this is
where it gets interesting,

117
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:56,000
the velocity of the charge
cross the magnetic field.

118
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,460
So you take the velocity of the
charge, you could either

119
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,701
multiply it by the scalar first,
or you could take the

120
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:02,220
cross product then multiply
it by the scalar.

121
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,790
Doesn't matter because
it's just a number,

122
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,990
this isn't a vector.

123
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,220
But you essentially take the
cross product of the velocity

124
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,400
and the magnetic field, multiply
that times the

125
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,090
charge, and then you get the
force vector on that particle.

126
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,930
Now there's something that
should immediately-- if you

127
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,960
hopefully got a little bit of
intuition about what the cross

128
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,240
product was-- there's something

129
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,000
interesting going on here.

130
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,760
The cross product cares about
the vectors that are

131
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,750
perpendicular to each other.

132
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,450
So for example, if the
velocity is exactly

133
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,450
perpendicular to the magnetic
field, then we'll

134
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,290
actually get a number.

135
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,900
If they're parallel, then the
magnetic field has no impact

136
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,180
on the charge.

137
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,340
That's one interesting thing.

138
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,680
And then the other interesting
thing is when you take the

139
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,850
cross product of two vectors,
the result is perpendicular to

140
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,630
both of these vectors.

141
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,380
So that's interesting.

142
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,040
A magnetic field, in order to
have an effect on a charge,

143
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,080
has to be perpendicular
to its you velocity.

144
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,830
And then the force on it is
going to be perpendicular to

145
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,460
both the velocity of the charge
and the magnetic field.

146
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,100
I know I'm confusing you at
this point, so let's play

147
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,680
around with it and
do some problems.

148
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,900
But before that, let's figure
out what the units of the

149
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,700
magnetic field are.

150
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,910
So we know that the cross
product is the same thing as--

151
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,970
so let's say, what's the
magnitude of the force?

152
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:24,790
The magnitude of the
force is equal to?

153
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,580
Well, the magnitude of the
charge-- this is just a scalar

154
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:31,380
quantity, so it's still just
the charge-- times the

155
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,650
magnitude of the velocity times
the magnitude of the

156
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:39,310
field times the sine of the
angle between them.

157
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,230
This is the definition of a
cross product and then we

158
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:44,050
could put-- if we wanted the
actual force vector, we can

159
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,200
just multiply this times the
vector we get using the

160
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:46,720
right-hand rule.

161
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,080
We'll do that in a second.

162
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,230
Anyway we're just focused
on units.

163
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,350
Sine of theta has no units so
we can ignore it for this

164
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,100
discussion.

165
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,140
We're just trying to figure
out the units of

166
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,370
the magnetic field.

167
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:06,160
So force is newtons-- so we
could say newtons equals--

168
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,350
charge is coulombs, velocity is
meters per second, and then

169
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:17,910
this is times the-- I don't know
what we'll call this--

170
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,040
the B units.

171
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,662
We'll call it unit sub B.

172
00:07:22,662 --> 00:07:23,300
So let's see.

173
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,780
If we divide both sides by
coulombs and meters per

174
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,930
second, we get newtons
per coulomb.

175
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,890
And then if we divide by meters
per second, that's the

176
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:34,850
same thing as multiplying
by seconds per meter.

177
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:39,800
Equals the magnetic
field units.

178
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:45,380
So the magnetic field in SI
terms, is defined as newton

179
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,080
seconds per coulomb meter.

180
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,920
And that might seem a little
disjointed, and they've come

181
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,970
up with a brilliant name.

182
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,660
And it's named after a deserving
fellow, and that's

183
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,910
Nikolai Tesla.

184
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:01,400
And so the one newton second
per coulomb meter is

185
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:07,210
equal to one tesla.

186
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:10,150
And I'm actually running out of
time in this video, because

187
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,650
I want to do a whole
problem here.

188
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:15,390
But I just want you to sit and
think about it for a second.

189
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:19,120
Even though in life we're used
to dealing with magnets as we

190
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,200
have these magnets-- and they're
fundamentally maybe

191
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,260
different than what at least we
imagine electricity to be--

192
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:30,570
but the magnitude or actually
the units of magnetism is

193
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,840
actually defined in terms of the
effect that it would have

194
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,100
on a moving charge.

195
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,840
And that's why the unit-- one
tesla, or a tesla-- is defined

196
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,450
as a newton second
per coulomb.

197
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:46,530
So the electrostatic charge
per coulomb meter.

198
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,600
Well, I'll leave you
now in this video.

199
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,810
Maybe you can sit
and ponder that.

200
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:52,010
But it'll make a little bit
more sense when we do some

201
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,940
actual problems with
some actual

202
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,240
numbers in the next video.

203
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,490

204
