1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,000
   

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,000
Created by the hottest, most violent, and

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:12,020
most energetic objects and events in the Universe, gamma rays travel

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,030
across vast stretches of space, only to be absorbed by Earth's atmosphere.

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:20,030
Scientists had no way to detect and study gamma rays

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:24,040
from the cosmos until high altitude balloons and rockets carried

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,060
gamma ray sensors above the atmosphere. Deadly to humans,

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,070
gamma rays are created on Earth by natural radioactive decay,

9
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:36,080
by nuclear explosions, and even by the lightning in thunderstorms.

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,140
Coronal mass ejections from our Sun emit gamma rays,

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,190
followed by masses of charged particles. Monitoring these

12
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,230
gamma rays provides scientists with an early warning of incoming charged particles

13
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,250
that may cause disruptions in power and communication networks.

14
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:56,330
The most energetic of all EM waves - gamma rays carry

15
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,460
enough energy to kill living cells. Doctors are able to selectively

16
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,560
use gamma radiation to destroy cancer growths.

17
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,570
Gamma ray wavelengths are the shortest of all electromagnetic waves,

18
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:12,580
about the size of an atom's nucleus. In fact, it is so short

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,590
that the rays sail through atoms as easily as comets sail through our solar system.

20
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,600
This makes detecting gamma rays difficult for scientists.

21
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,700
Gamma ray detectors typically contain densely packed crystal blocks.

22
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,750
As gamma rays pass through, they collide

23
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,800
with electrons in the crystal. The sensor doesn't directly detect gamma rays.

24
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,820
Rather, it detects the charged particles created by those collisions.

25
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,830
Scientists have used gamma rays to determine the elements

26
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,850
that make up Martian surface soils. When struck by cosmic rays,

27
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:48,860
chemical elements in soils and rocks emit uniquely

28
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,880
identifiable signatures of energy in the form of gamma rays.

29
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,890
The gamma ray spectrometer on NASA's Mars Odyssey Orbiter

30
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:00,900
detects and maps these signatures, such as this map of hydrogen concentrations.

31
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,910
Gamma rays stream from stars, supernovas,

32
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:08,919
black holes, and pulsars to wash our sky with gamma ray light.

33
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,930
NASA's Fermi gamma ray telescope imaged the

34
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,960
location of these sources, mapping out the Milky Way galaxy by creating

35
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,970
a full 360 degree view of the Galaxy from our perspective

36
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:24,980
here on Earth. While the visible light sky is predictable and

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,010
follows regular patterns, the gamma ray sky does not. Bursts of

38
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,030
high-energy gamma radiation arrive from deep space every day.

39
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:37,040
These explosions of gamma rays last fractions of a second to minutes,

40
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,050
popping like cosmic flashbulbs, momentarily dominating the

41
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:45,060
gamma ray sky, and then fading. This video of

42
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,080
the Vela Pulsar beams gamma rays every 89 seconds as it rotates.

43
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,090
Gamma ray bursts are the most energetic and luminous

44
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:57,100
electromagnetic events since the Big Bang and can release more

45
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,110
energy in 10 seconds than our Sun will emit in its entire 10 billion-year

46
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:05,120
expected lifetime. NASA's SWIFT satellite

47
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,140
recorded this gamma ray burst of an exploding star 13 billion

48
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,160
light years away. It is among the most distant objects

49
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,170
ever detected, when the universe was just 630 million years old.

50
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,180
A recent observation of a gamma ray burst produced the greatest

51
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,190
total energy to date, equivalent to 9,000 typical supernovae!

52
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:29,210
By continuing to study gamma rays, we will unlock

53
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,270
important new understanding in astronomy, its use in medical treatments,

54
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:37,310
and allow us to further enhance our protection for

55
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,680
our satellites, and other electronics here on Earth.

56
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,700
Other NASA instruments monitor the changes in other aspects

57
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,710
of the Earth's climate system, such as clouds, aerosol particles,

58
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,720
or surface reflectivity, and scientists are examining their many

59
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,730
interactons with the energy budget. A portion of solar radiation

60
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,750
from the Sun that is just beyond the visible spectrum is referred to

61
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:04,770
as near-infrared. Scientists can study how this radiation

62
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,780
reflects off the Earth's surface to understand changes in land cover

63
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,800
such as growth of cities or changes in vegetation. Our eyes

64
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,850
perceive a leaf as green because wavelengths in the green region

65
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,899
of the visible light spectrum are reflected while other visible wavelengths

66
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,940
are absorbed. Yet, the chlorophyll and the cell structure of the

67
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,990
leaf are also reflecting near-infrared light, light we cannot see.

68
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:33,080
This reflected near-infrared radiation can be

69
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,120
sensed by satellites, allowing scientists to study vegetation from space.

70
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,160
Using these data, scientists can identify some

71
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,210
types of trees, can examine the health of forests, and can even

72
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:49,260
monitor the health of vegetation such as forests infested with pine beetles

73
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,320
or crops affected by drought. Studying the emission and

74
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,330
reflection of infrared waves helps us to understand the Earth's system

75
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,340
and its energy budget. Near-infrared data can also help scientists

76
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,340
study land cover such as changes in snow, ice,

77
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,350
forests, urbanization, and agriculture.

78
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,370
Scientists are beginning to unlock the mysteries of cooler objects across

79
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:17,410
the Universe such as planets, cool stars, nebulae,

80
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:23,430
and much more using infrared waves.
