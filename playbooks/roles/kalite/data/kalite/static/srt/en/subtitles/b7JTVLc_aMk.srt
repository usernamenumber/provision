1
00:00:00,534 --> 00:00:04,600
What I want to do in this video is cover something called the Triple Product Expansion

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,850
or Lagrange's Formula, sometimes.

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:11,819
And it's really just a simplification of the cross product of three vectors.

4
00:00:11,819 --> 00:00:17,703
So if I take the cross product of A and then B cross C.

5
00:00:17,703 --> 00:00:19,933
Now what we are going to do is express this,

6
00:00:19,933 --> 00:00:24,558
we can express this really as sum and difference of dot products.

7
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:27,553
Well not just dot products but dot products scaling different vectors.

8
00:00:27,553 --> 00:00:29,083
You're going to see what I mean.

9
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:33,274
But it simplifies this expression a bit because cross products are hard to take.

10
00:00:33,274 --> 00:00:36,571
They are computationally intensive and, at least in my mind, they're confusing.

11
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:40,101
Now, this is not something you have to know if you are going to be dealing with vectors.

12
00:00:40,101 --> 00:00:41,400
But it's useful to know.

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:48,321
My motivation for doing this video is I saw some problems for the Indian Institute of Technology Entrance Exam

14
00:00:48,321 --> 00:00:53,667
that seems to expect that you know Lagrange's Formula or the Triple Product Expansion.

15
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:55,658
So let's see how we can simplify this.

16
00:00:55,658 --> 00:00:59,002
So to do that, let's start taking the cross product -

17
00:00:59,002 --> 00:01:02,160
the cross product of B and C.

18
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,222
And in all of these situations, I'm just going to assume that we have vector A.

19
00:01:07,222 --> 00:01:13,305
I'm just going to call that A, the x component of vector A times unit vector i,

20
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:21,479
plus the y component of vector A times unit of vector j,

21
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,333
plus the z component of vector A times unit vector k.

22
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:28,491
I can do the same things for B and C.

23
00:01:28,491 --> 00:01:34,900
So, if I say that B sub y, I'm talking about what's scaling the j component in the B vector.

24
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,801
So let's first take this cross product over here,

25
00:01:38,801 --> 00:01:41,309
and as you've seen me take a cross products,

26
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,667
you know that I like to do these little determinants.

27
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:45,628
And what, let me just take it over here.

28
00:01:45,628 --> 00:01:51,943
So, B cross C, B cross C, is going to be equal to the determinant,

29
00:01:51,943 --> 00:01:54,173
and I put an i, j, k up here.

30
00:01:54,173 --> 00:01:56,169
i j k

31
00:01:56,169 --> 00:01:58,306
This is actually the definition of the cross product.

32
00:01:58,306 --> 00:02:00,535
So no proof is necessary.

33
00:02:00,535 --> 00:02:02,485
Let me show you why this is true.

34
00:02:02,485 --> 00:02:03,832
This is just one way to remember the dot product.

35
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,804
If you remember to take the determinant of 3 by 3's.

36
00:02:06,804 --> 00:02:15,349
And we'll put B's x term, B's y coefficient, and B's z component. [term, coefficient and component can be used interchangeably here]

37
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:17,267
And you'll do the same thing for the C's.

38
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:20,225
Cx, Cy, Cz.

39
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:22,333
And then this is going to be equal to -

40
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,667
So first you have its, the i component,

41
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:32,903
so it's going to be the i component times B, so you ignore this column and this row, so

42
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:36,758
By [times] Cz, By Cz

43
00:02:36,758 --> 00:02:40,241
Minus Bz [times] Cy, minus so -

44
00:02:40,241 --> 00:02:42,842
I'm just ignoring all of this, and I'm looking at this 2 by 2 over here.

45
00:02:42,842 --> 00:02:48,368
minus Bz Cy, minus Bz Cy.

46
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,600
And then we want to subtract the j component.

47
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,962
Remember we alternate signs when we take our determinant.

48
00:02:54,962 --> 00:02:59,560
Subtract that, and then we take that column and that row. So it's going to be [chuckle]

49
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,575
It's going to be Bx [times] Cz, Bx Cz

50
00:03:04,575 --> 00:03:07,873
It's a little monotonous, but it'll have an intertesting result.

51
00:03:07,873 --> 00:03:16,882
Bx Cz minus Bz [times] Cx, minus Bz, minus Bz Cx.

52
00:03:16,882 --> 00:03:20,200
And then finally plus the k component.

53
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:32,904
k, we are going to have Bx times Cy, Bx Cy minus By Cx, minus By Cx.

54
00:03:32,904 --> 00:03:36,155
So this is, this, we just did the dot product.

55
00:03:36,155 --> 00:03:40,200
And now we want to take the - sorry we just did the cross product.

56
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,514
I don't want to get you confused. We just took the cross product of B and C.

57
00:03:44,514 --> 00:03:47,579
And now we are going to take the cross product of that with A.

58
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:50,551
Or the cross product of A with this thing right over here.

59
00:03:50,551 --> 00:03:51,805
So let's do that -

60
00:03:51,805 --> 00:03:55,566
Instead of rewriting the vector, let me just set up another matrix here.

61
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:59,467
So let me write my i, j, k up here -

62
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:02,300
And then let me write a's components so we have -

63
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,526
A sub x, A sub y, A sub z

64
00:04:06,526 --> 00:04:09,406
And then let's clean this up a little bit.

65
00:04:09,406 --> 00:04:11,263
Let's ignore the, we're just looking at -

66
00:04:11,263 --> 00:04:13,771
No I want to do that in black.

67
00:04:13,771 --> 00:04:18,554
Let's do this in black so that we can kind of erase that.

68
00:04:18,554 --> 00:04:21,805
This is a uh, this is a minus j times that, so what I'm going to do is

69
00:04:21,805 --> 00:04:24,267
I'm going to get rid of the minus and the j

70
00:04:24,267 --> 00:04:28,400
but I'm going to rewrite this with the signs swapped

71
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,071
So this is going to be -

72
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:31,882
This is going to be swap the signs

73
00:04:31,882 --> 00:04:41,263
Bz Cx minus Bx, minus Bx Cz

74
00:04:41,263 --> 00:04:43,818
So let me delete everything else.

75
00:04:43,818 --> 00:04:47,068
So I just took the negative and I multiplied it by this.

76
00:04:47,068 --> 00:04:49,933
I'm not making any careless mistakes here. So let me just, so I can make -

77
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:54,592
make the brush size a little bit bigger here so I can erase a little more efficiently

78
00:04:54,592 --> 00:04:58,167
There you go. And then we also want to get rid of that right over here -

79
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:02,254
Let me get my brush back down to normal size. All right!

80
00:05:02,254 --> 00:05:05,923
So now let's just take this cross product.

81
00:05:05,923 --> 00:05:10,892
So once again, set it up as, set it up as a determinant.

82
00:05:10,892 --> 00:05:12,424
And what I'm really going to focus on -

83
00:05:12,424 --> 00:05:19,437
because it'll take the video, well it'll take me forever if I were to do, if I were to do the i, j and k components,

84
00:05:19,437 --> 00:05:25,149
I'm just going to focus on i component, just on the x component of this cross product

85
00:05:25,149 --> 00:05:28,911
and then we can see that we will get the same result for the j and k

86
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:32,487
and we can see what hopefully this simplifies down to.

87
00:05:32,487 --> 00:05:35,226
So if we just focus on the i component here

88
00:05:35,226 --> 00:05:36,248
This is going to be,

89
00:05:36,248 --> 00:05:39,499
this is going to be i,

90
00:05:39,499 --> 00:05:43,771
i times, and we just look at this 2 by 2 matrix right over here

91
00:05:43,771 --> 00:05:45,908
We ignore i's column, i's row.

92
00:05:45,908 --> 00:05:47,580
And we have

93
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,134
Ay times all of this.

94
00:05:50,134 --> 00:05:51,898
So let me just multiply it out, so it's

95
00:05:51,898 --> 00:06:07,224
Ay times Bx Cy minus, minus Ay times By, times By Cx, By Cx.

96
00:06:07,224 --> 00:06:10,753
And then, we're going to want to subtract,

97
00:06:10,753 --> 00:06:13,632
we're going to want to have minus Az times this.

98
00:06:13,632 --> 00:06:15,165
So let's just do that.

99
00:06:15,165 --> 00:06:22,177
So it's minus, or negative Az Bz Cx,

100
00:06:22,177 --> 00:06:24,174
and then we have a negative Az times this, so it's

101
00:06:24,174 --> 00:06:30,304
plus Az Bx Cz.

102
00:06:30,304 --> 00:06:31,558
And now I'm going to do this -

103
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,927
This is a little bit of a trick for this proof right here.

104
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:37,363
Just so that we get the results that I want.

105
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:40,149
I'm just going to add and subtract the exact same thing.

106
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:46,744
I'm going to add an Ax Bx Cx

107
00:06:46,744 --> 00:06:58,168
and then I'm going to subtract a Ax Bx Cx

108
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,258
So clearly I have not changed this expression,

109
00:07:00,258 --> 00:07:02,534
I have just added and subtracted the same thing.

110
00:07:02,534 --> 00:07:04,267
And let's see what we can simplify.

111
00:07:04,267 --> 00:07:08,849
Remember, this is just the x component of our triple product,

112
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:10,428
just the x component.

113
00:07:10,428 --> 00:07:12,565
But to do this, let me factor out -

114
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:18,230
I'm going to factor out a B sub x, so let me do this.

115
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,599
We get the B sub x

116
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:22,085
So if I were to factor it out

117
00:07:22,085 --> 00:07:23,571
And I'm only going to look at,

118
00:07:23,571 --> 00:07:25,893
I'm only going to factor it out of this term that has a B sub x

119
00:07:25,893 --> 00:07:29,267
and I'm going to factor it out of this term

120
00:07:29,267 --> 00:07:31,419
and then I'm going to factor it out of this term.

121
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:33,555
So if I take out the B sub x,

122
00:07:33,555 --> 00:07:37,921
I'm going to have an Ay Cy,

123
00:07:37,921 --> 00:07:39,825
actually let me write out a little bit differently.

124
00:07:39,825 --> 00:07:43,168
Let me factor it, let me factor it out of this one first.

125
00:07:43,168 --> 00:07:46,930
So that it's A, it's going to be an Ax Cx

126
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,933
A sub x, C sub x

127
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:51,110
So I used this one up.

128
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,478
And then I'm going to have a, I'll do this one now

129
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:59,190
plus, if I factor the B sub x out, I get A sub y, C sub y

130
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,258
I've used that one now, and now I have this one

131
00:08:00,258 --> 00:08:03,277
I'm going to factor the B sub x out,

132
00:08:03,277 --> 00:08:08,478
so I'm left with a plus A sub z, C sub z.

133
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:10,847
So that's all of those, so I've factored that out.

134
00:08:10,847 --> 00:08:13,169
And now from these -

135
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:17,600
From these right over here, let me factor out a negative C sub x,

136
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,156
a negative C sub x.

137
00:08:21,156 --> 00:08:23,933
And so if I do that, let me go to this term right over here

138
00:08:23,933 --> 00:08:25,615
I'm going to have a Ax Bx

139
00:08:25,615 --> 00:08:30,769
Cross that out

140
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:33,509
And then over here I'm going to have an Ay By

141
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:35,333
Remember I'm factoring out a negative C sub x

142
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:39,333
So I'm going to have a plus A sub y, B sub y

143
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:42,937
And then finally I'm going have a plus A sub z,

144
00:08:42,937 --> 00:08:47,209
A sub z, B sub z

145
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:49,949
And what is this!

146
00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:52,596
Well this right here in green,

147
00:08:52,596 --> 00:08:56,543
this is the exact same thing as the dot product of A and C

148
00:08:56,543 --> 00:09:01,420
This is the dot product of the vectors A and C

149
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,417
It's the dot product

150
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:06,064
of this vector and that vector.

151
00:09:06,064 --> 00:09:07,921
So that's the

152
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:12,733
The dot product of A and C times the x component of B

153
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:18,742
times the x component, the x component of B

154
00:09:18,742 --> 00:09:21,250
minus, I'll do this in the same

155
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,754
minus, once again this is the dot product of A and B now

156
00:09:25,754 --> 00:09:30,398
minus A dot B, A dot B

157
00:09:30,398 --> 00:09:33,467
times the x component of C

158
00:09:33,467 --> 00:09:34,810
And we can't forget all of this was

159
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,993
multiplied by the unit vector i.

160
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:40,197
We're looking at the x component, or the i component

161
00:09:40,197 --> 00:09:42,705
of that whole triple product.

162
00:09:42,705 --> 00:09:46,234
So that's going to be all of this

163
00:09:46,234 --> 00:09:51,668
it's all of this is being, is times the unit vector i.

164
00:09:51,668 --> 00:09:53,665
Now, if we do this exact same thing

165
00:09:53,665 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm not going to do it, because it's, it's computationally intensive

166
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,956
but I think it would, it won't be a huge leap of faith for you

167
00:10:00,956 --> 00:10:02,581
This is for the x component

168
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:06,250
If I were to do the exact same thing for the y component, for the j component

169
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,968
so it'll be plus

170
00:10:07,968 --> 00:10:10,244
If I do the same thing for the j component

171
00:10:10,244 --> 00:10:11,683
We can really just pattern match.

172
00:10:11,683 --> 00:10:14,609
We have, we have B sub x, C sub x

173
00:10:14,609 --> 00:10:15,631
That's for the x component

174
00:10:15,631 --> 00:10:19,532
And we'll have B sub y, and C sub y for the j component

175
00:10:19,532 --> 00:10:21,761
And then this is not component specific

176
00:10:21,761 --> 00:10:27,659
so it'll be A dot, A dot C over here,

177
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:30,333
and minus A dot B over here

178
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:33,556
You can verify any of these for yourself if you don't believe me.

179
00:10:33,556 --> 00:10:35,553
But it's the exact same process we just did.

180
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:38,667
And then finally for the z component, or the k component

181
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:41,267
Let me put parentheses over here

182
00:10:41,267 --> 00:10:42,752
Same idea!

183
00:10:42,752 --> 00:10:47,488
B sub z, C sub z

184
00:10:47,488 --> 00:10:50,786
And then you're going to have A dot B over there

185
00:10:50,786 --> 00:10:57,427
and A dot C over here!

186
00:10:57,427 --> 00:11:01,513
Now what is, what does this, what does this become?

187
00:11:01,513 --> 00:11:03,510
How can simplify this?

188
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,343
Well this right over here -

189
00:11:06,343 --> 00:11:08,340
we can expand this out.

190
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:12,200
We can factor out a A dot C from all of these terms over here.

191
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,424
Remember this is going to be multiplied times i.

192
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,071
Actually let me not skip too many steps.

193
00:11:17,071 --> 00:11:20,229
because I really want you to believe what I'm doing.

194
00:11:20,229 --> 00:11:23,015
So this, if we expand the i here.

195
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,200
Instead of rewriting it, let me just do it like this.

196
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:31,513
A little bit messier, but let me just, so I can write this i there and that i there.

197
00:11:31,513 --> 00:11:33,928
I'm kind of just distributing that x,

198
00:11:33,928 --> 00:11:36,157
that x unit vector, or i unit vector

199
00:11:36,157 --> 00:11:38,805
and let me do the same thing for j

200
00:11:38,805 --> 00:11:43,170
So I can put the j there and I can put the j right over there

201
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,467
And then I can do the same thing for the k.

202
00:11:46,467 --> 00:11:49,997
Put the k there, and then put the k there.

203
00:11:49,997 --> 00:11:51,854
And now what are these!

204
00:11:51,854 --> 00:11:55,198
Well this part right over there

205
00:11:55,198 --> 00:12:03,371
This part right over here is exactly the same thing as A dot C

206
00:12:03,371 --> 00:12:09,037
A dot C times Bx,

207
00:12:09,037 --> 00:12:12,533
B sub x times i, plus B sub y times j

208
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:15,867
plus B sub y times j

209
00:12:15,867 --> 00:12:22,040
plus B sub z times k!

210
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,662
And then from that we are going to subtract all of this

211
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:29,517
A dot B, we are going to subtract A dot B

212
00:12:29,517 --> 00:12:33,511
Times the exact same thing!

213
00:12:33,511 --> 00:12:37,365
And you are going to notice this is the exact same thing as vector B!

214
00:12:37,365 --> 00:12:40,848
That is vector B, and when you do it over here you are just going to get vector C

215
00:12:40,848 --> 00:12:43,077
So I'll just write it over here.

216
00:12:43,077 --> 00:12:45,200
You are just going to get vector C.

217
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,839
So just like that, we have,

218
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:51,158
we have a simplification for our triple product!

219
00:12:51,158 --> 00:12:55,105
I know it took us a long time to get here, but this is a simplification!

220
00:12:55,105 --> 00:12:56,267
It might not look like one,

221
00:12:56,267 --> 00:12:58,774
but computationally it is! It's easier to do!

222
00:12:58,774 --> 00:13:03,186
If I have, I'll try to color code it, if I have A cross

223
00:13:03,186 --> 00:13:10,152
A cross B cross, let me do it all different colors, C

224
00:13:10,152 --> 00:13:13,496
we just saw that this is going to be equivalent to

225
00:13:13,496 --> 00:13:15,307
and one way to think about it is

226
00:13:15,307 --> 00:13:19,672
You take the first vector times the dot product of the

227
00:13:19,672 --> 00:13:24,037
The first vector in this second cross product

228
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:26,545
The one that we have the parentheses around, the one we have to do first

229
00:13:26,545 --> 00:13:29,424
You take the first vector there, so vector B

230
00:13:29,424 --> 00:13:33,836
and you multiply that times the dot product of the other two vectors

231
00:13:33,836 --> 00:13:39,084
So A dot C, A dot C

232
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,499
and from that you subtract

233
00:13:41,499 --> 00:13:44,842
You subtract the second vector [in the parentheses]

234
00:13:44,842 --> 00:13:49,440
You subtract the second vector multiplied by the dot product of the other two vectors.

235
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,502
A dot B.

236
00:13:54,502 --> 00:13:55,524
And we're done!

237
00:13:55,524 --> 00:13:56,685
This is our triple product

238
00:13:56,685 --> 00:13:59,750
This is our triple product expansion!

239
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,468
Now once again, this isn't

240
00:14:01,468 --> 00:14:04,487
this isn't something that you really have to know

241
00:14:04,487 --> 00:14:05,933
You could always obviously multiply

242
00:14:05,933 --> 00:14:07,784
You could actually just do this, you know

243
00:14:07,784 --> 00:14:10,013
you don't have to, you could do it by hand,

244
00:14:10,013 --> 00:14:11,360
you don't have to know this.

245
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,100
But if you have really hairy vectors

246
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,607
or if this is from some kind of math competition

247
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:19,533
And sometimes it simplifies real fast when you reduce it to dot products

248
00:14:19,533 --> 00:14:21,158
This is a useful thing to know.

249
00:14:21,158 --> 99:59:59,999
