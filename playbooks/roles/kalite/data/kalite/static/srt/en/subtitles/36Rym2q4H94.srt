1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's say we were to take a little excursion

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
into the moon. And so here we are sitting on the surface of the moon. That's the surface of the moon

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and with us to our excursion to the moon, we brought two things. We brought ourself a concrete brick. That's my brick right over there. My concrete brick.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Although it's orange... It's an orange concrete brick.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I also brought a bird feather with us... So this is the bird feather.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
My question to you is if I were both the brick and the bird feather at the same time, and I were to let go at both of them at the same time,

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and ask you which one would hit the surface of the moon first, and what would you say?

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, if you were to base it on your experience on Earth -- On, Earth, if you were to take a brick and a bird feather,

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
brick would just go straight down. Brick would immediately just fall to the Earth, it would do it quite quickly...

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It would accelerate quite quickly, and while a feather would kind of float around.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If you had a feather on Earth, it would just float around. It would go that way, and then it would go that way,

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And it would slowly make its way down to the ground. So on Earth, at least in the presence of air, it looks like the brick will hit the ground first.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But what will happen on the moon? And what's interesting about the moon is that we have no atmosphere.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We have no air to kind of provide resistance for either the brick or the feather.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So what do you think is going to happen? So your first temptation is to just say 'Let's use the universal law of gravity.'

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What is the force of gravity on the brick? So the force on the brick is -- Well, you could calculate that out

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The force of gravity on the brick is going to be equal to big G time the mass of the moon --

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'll say it's m for mass and the subscript is lowercase m for moon

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The mass of the moon times the mass of the brick, divided by the distance between

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the brick and the center of the moon squared.

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is the difference between the brick and the center of the moon and you square it. Fair enough.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's the force on the brick. What's going to be the force on the feather?

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The force due to gravity on the force -- Or, another way to think about it, the weight of the feather on the moonz

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so what is the force on the feather? Well, we'll the do the same calculation. The force

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
on the feather is going to be equal to big G times the mass of the moon times the mass of the feather,

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
divided by the distance between the distance between the center of this feather and the center of this moon, squared.

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's the distance, and then we square it. So if you look at both of these expressions,

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they both have this quantity right over here, G times the mass of the moon

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
divided by the distance between this height and the center of the moon squared.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So they both have this exact expression on it. Let's just replace that expression--

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's that call that the gravitational field on the moon. If you multiply this number by any

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
mass, it will tell the weight of that object on the moon.

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Or the gravitational force acting downwards on that object on the moon

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is the gravitational field of the moon. So I'll just call it G sub m.

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
All it is, is all these quantities combined. So if we simplify it that way, the force on the brick

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
due to the moon is going to be equal to that lowercase g on the moon--

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Normally we use this lowercase g for the gravitational constant on Earth, or the force of the gravitational

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
field on Earth, or sometimes acceleration of gravity on Earth, but now we're referring to the moon.

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's what this lowercase subscript m is doing for us.

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it's equal to that, times the mass of the brick. For the case of the feather,

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the force on the feather is equal to all of this business, so that's the g sub m times the mass of the feather.

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So now, assuming that the mass of the brick is much greater than the mass of the feather.

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we're going to assume, which is a reasonable thing to assume, that the mass of

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the brick is greater than the mass of the feather.
