1
00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:04,794
Consider the following story:

2
00:00:04,794 --> 00:00:07,379
Bob is in the room and he has two coins.

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:12,846
One fair coin and one double-sided coin.

4
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:16,586
He picks one at random,

5
00:00:16,586 --> 00:00:19,484
flips it,

6
00:00:19,484 --> 00:00:22,857
and shouts the result. "Heads!"

7
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:27,263
Now what is the probability 
that he flipped the fair coin?

8
00:00:27,263 --> 00:00:29,375
To answer this question, we need only

9
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:32,507
rewind and grow a tree.

10
00:00:32,507 --> 00:00:35,593
The first event he picks one of two coins.

11
00:00:35,593 --> 00:00:37,738
So our tree grows two branches

12
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:39,822
leading to two equally likely outcomes -

13
00:00:39,822 --> 00:00:42,291
fair or unfair.

14
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:46,082
The next event, he flips the coin, we grow again.

15
00:00:46,082 --> 00:00:48,197
If he had the fair coin, we know this flip can result

16
00:00:48,197 --> 00:00:50,272
in two equally likely outcomes -

17
00:00:50,272 --> 00:00:52,171
heads and tails.

18
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:56,610
While the unfair coin results in 
two outcomes - both heads.

19
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,488
Our tree is finished.

20
00:00:58,488 --> 00:00:59,983
And we see it has four leaves,

21
00:00:59,983 --> 00:01:02,494
representing four equally likely outcomes.

22
00:01:02,494 --> 00:01:05,490
The final step - new evidence.

23
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:07,484
He says: "Heads!"

24
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:11,008
Whenever we gain evidence, 
we must trim our tree.

25
00:01:11,008 --> 00:01:12,978
We cut any branch leading to tails

26
00:01:12,978 --> 00:01:15,634
because we know tails did not occur.

27
00:01:15,634 --> 00:01:16,850
And that is it.

28
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:19,945
So the probability that he chose the fair coin

29
00:01:19,945 --> 00:01:22,684
is the one fair outcome leading to heads

30
00:01:22,684 --> 00:01:26,237
divided by the three possible
outcomes leading to heads

31
00:01:26,237 --> 00:01:29,801
or - one-third.

32
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:31,633
What happens if he flips again

33
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,214
and reports: "Heads!" ?

34
00:01:34,214 --> 00:01:37,515
Remember, after each event our tree grows.

35
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:40,857
The fair coins leaves result in
two equally likely outcomes -

36
00:01:40,857 --> 00:01:43,089
heads and tails.

37
00:01:43,089 --> 00:01:47,004
The unfair coin leaves result 
in two equally likely outcomes -

38
00:01:47,004 --> 00:01:49,311
heads and heads.

39
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:53,077
After we hear the second "Heads!",

40
00:01:53,077 --> 00:01:55,860
we cut any braches leading to tails.

41
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,064
Therefore the probability the coin is fair

42
00:01:59,064 --> 00:02:01,122
after two heads in a row

43
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:03,578
is the one fair outcome leading to heads,

44
00:02:03,578 --> 00:02:09,348
divided by all possible outcomes leading to heads.

45
00:02:09,348 --> 00:02:11,880
Or - one-fifth.

46
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,020
Notice our confindence in the fair coins is dropping

47
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,769
as more heads occur -

48
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:19,201
though, realize it will never reach zero.

49
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:20,817
No matter how many flips occur,

50
00:02:20,817 --> 00:02:26,641
we can be never be 100 % certain the coin is unfair.

51
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:32,473
In fact, all conditional probability questions 
can be solved by growing trees.

52
00:02:32,473 --> 00:02:34,808
Lets do one more to be sure.

53
00:02:34,808 --> 00:02:36,931
Bob has three coins.

54
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:43,613
Two are fair.

55
00:02:43,613 --> 00:02:48,471
One is biased - which is weighted to land

56
00:02:48,471 --> 00:02:50,700
heads two-thirds of the time, and tails one-third.

57
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:57,399
He choses the coin at random, and flips it.

58
00:02:57,399 --> 00:02:58,751
"Heads!"

59
00:02:58,751 --> 00:03:03,446
Now, what is the probability he chose the biased coin?

60
00:03:03,446 --> 00:03:07,156
Lets rewind and build a tree.

61
00:03:07,156 --> 00:03:09,969
The first event - choosing the coin -

62
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:12,970
can lead to three equally likely outcomes:

63
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,342
fair coin, fair coin and unfair coin.

64
00:03:16,342 --> 00:03:20,789
The next event, the coin is flipped.

65
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:24,625
Each fair coin leads to two equally likely leaves -

66
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,729
heads and tails.

67
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:31,852
The biased coin leads to three equally likely leaves -

68
00:03:31,852 --> 00:03:37,012
two representing heads, and one representing tails.

69
00:03:37,012 --> 00:03:40,657
Now the trick is to always make sure our tree is balanced _

70
00:03:40,657 --> 00:03:44,796
meaning an equal amount of leaves growing out of each branch.

71
00:03:44,796 --> 00:03:50,266
To do this, we simply scale up the number 
of branches to the least common multiple.

72
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:52,979
For two and three, this is six.

73
00:04:01,165 --> 00:04:03,429
And finally we label our leaves.

74
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:06,792
The fair coin now splits into 
six equally likely leaves -

75
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:09,238
three heads and three tails.

76
00:04:09,238 --> 00:04:13,578
For the biased coin, we now have 
two tail leaves and four head leaves -

77
00:04:13,578 --> 00:04:15,238
and that is it.

78
00:04:16,545 --> 00:04:19,698
When Bob shouts the result, "Heads!",

79
00:04:19,698 --> 00:04:24,120
this new evindence allows us 
to trim all branches leading to tails,

80
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,600
since tails did not occur.

81
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:32,317
So the probability that he chose 
the biased coin, given heads occur?

82
00:04:32,317 --> 00:04:35,597
Well, four leaves can come from the biased coin,

83
00:04:35,597 --> 00:04:39,270
divided by all possible leaves.

84
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:43,456
Four divided by ten - or 40%.

85
00:04:43,456 --> 00:04:46,337
When in doubt, it's always possible to answer

86
00:04:46,337 --> 00:04:49,965
conditional probability questions by base theorem.

87
00:04:49,965 --> 00:04:52,477
It tells us the probability of event A

88
00:04:52,477 --> 00:04:55,193
given some new evidence B.

89
00:04:55,193 --> 00:04:57,805
Though if you forgot it, no worries.

90
00:04:57,805 --> 00:05:01,805
You need only know how to grow 
stories with trimmed trees.
