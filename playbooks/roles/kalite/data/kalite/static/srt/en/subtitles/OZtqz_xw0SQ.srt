1
00:00:01,095 --> 00:00:03,412
A ball is shot into the air from the edge of a building

2
00:00:03,412 --> 00:00:05,260
50 feet above the ground

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,997
It s initial velocity is 20 feet per second

4
00:00:08,997 --> 00:00:20,047
The equation h (height) = -(negative)16t squared+20t+50 can be used to model the height of the ball

5
00:00:20,047 --> 00:00:21,112
after t second

6
00:00:21,112 --> 00:00:23,945
And I think in this problem they just want us to accept this formula

7
00:00:23,945 --> 00:00:26,162
Although we do derive formulas like this

8
00:00:26,162 --> 00:00:30,095
we show why it works for this type of problem in the Khan academy Physics playlist

9
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:32,961
But for here we will just go with the flow in this example

10
00:00:32,961 --> 00:00:36,798
So they give us the equation that we use to model the height of the ball after t seconds

11
00:00:36,798 --> 00:00:40,695
and then say about how long does it take the ball to hit the ground

12
00:00:40,695 --> 00:00:47,231
So if this is the height, the groudn is when the height is equal to zero

13
00:00:47,231 --> 00:00:52,196
So hitting the ground literally means that h (height) is equal to zero

14
00:00:52,196 --> 00:00:56,906
So we need to figure out at which times does h (height) equal zero

15
00:00:56,906 --> 00:00:58,921
So we are really solving the equation

16
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:06,946
0 = -16tsquared + 20t + 50

17
00:01:06,946 --> 00:01:10,331
And if you want to simplify this a little bit

18
00:01:10,331 --> 00:01:13,461
Let's see everything here is divisible at least by 2

19
00:01:13,461 --> 00:01:17,863
so let's divide everything by negative 2 just so that we can be rid of this negative coefficient

20
00:01:17,863 --> 00:01:21,775
So you divide the left hand side by negative 2, you still get a zero

21
00:01:21,775 --> 00:01:26,998
Negative 16 divided by negative 2 is eight so 8t squared

22
00:01:26,998 --> 00:01:29,524
20 divided by negative two is negative 10

23
00:01:29,524 --> 00:01:31,163
Minus 10t

24
00:01:31,163 --> 00:01:34,647
50 divided by negative 2 is minus 25

25
00:01:34,647 --> 00:01:40,992
is equal to zero. If you okay with this on the left hand side you can put it on the left hand side

26
00:01:40,992 --> 00:01:44,883
We can say this is equal to 0

27
00:01:44,883 --> 00:01:46,559
And now we solve

28
00:01:46,559 --> 00:01:51,705
And we can complete the square here or apply the quadratic formula which is derived from

29
00:01:51,705 --> 00:01:52,863
completing the square

30
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:59,597
and we have this in standard form, we know that this is our a

31
00:01:59,597 --> 00:02:04,209
this our b and this over here is our c

32
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:06,680
And the quadratic formula tells us that the roots

33
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,712
In this case in terms of the variable t are going to be equal to

34
00:02:10,712 --> 00:02:15,697
negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus four a c.

35
00:02:15,697 --> 00:02:20,647
All of that over 2 a

36
00:02:20,647 --> 00:02:25,847
So if we apply it we get t is equal to negative b

37
00:02:25,847 --> 00:02:27,417
b is negative 10

38
00:02:27,417 --> 00:02:30,165
so negative negative 10 is going to be postitive 10

39
00:02:30,165 --> 00:02:34,364
plus or minus the square root of negative ten squared

40
00:02:34,364 --> 00:02:39,727
well thats just positive 100 - 4*a which is 8

41
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:42,430
times c which is negative 25

42
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,797
and all of that over 2 a

43
00:02:46,797 --> 00:02:49,858
a is 8 so 2a is 16

44
00:02:49,858 --> 00:02:56,129
and this over here we have a negative sign

45
00:02:56,129 --> 00:02:57,648
negative times a negative... so this is a positive

46
00:02:57,648 --> 00:02:59,648
4 times 25 is 100

47
00:02:59,648 --> 00:03:01,929
100 times 8 is 800

48
00:03:01,929 --> 00:03:03,429
so all that simplifies to 800

49
00:03:03,429 --> 00:03:05,900
and we have 100 + 800 under the radical sign

50
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:12,250
so 10 plus or minus the square root of 900 all of that over 16

51
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:19,314
is equal to 10 + or - 30 over 16

52
00:03:19,314 --> 00:03:23,498
so we get time is equal to 10+30/16

53
00:03:23,498 --> 00:03:27,585
40-16 which is the same thing if we divide the numerator

54
00:03:27,585 --> 00:03:29,064
and denominator by 4

55
00:03:29,064 --> 00:03:33,363
which is 10 over... or even better divide by 8

56
00:03:33,363 --> 00:03:35,631
5 over 2

57
00:03:35,631 --> 00:03:37,299
so thats one solution.

58
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:38,664
Thats if we add the 30

59
00:03:38,664 --> 00:03:39,764
if we subtract the 30

60
00:03:39,764 --> 00:03:46,480
so or t = 10 -30 which is -20 over 16

61
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,066
divide the numerator and the denominator by 4

62
00:03:49,066 --> 00:03:51,979
and you get -5 over 4

63
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:53,298
Now we have to remember

64
00:03:53,298 --> 00:03:54,649
were trying to find a time

65
00:03:54,649 --> 00:03:58,098
and so a time at least in this problem

66
00:03:58,098 --> 00:03:59,764
is positve

67
00:03:59,764 --> 00:04:03,966
we want to figure out how long it takes for the ball

68
00:04:03,966 --> 00:04:04,798
to hit the ground

69
00:04:04,798 --> 00:04:08,430
we dont want to go back in time, we dont want negative time

70
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,665
we only want to think about our positive answer

71
00:04:10,665 --> 00:04:12,830
and so this tells us that the only root that should work

72
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,471
is, we have to assume that this is in seconds

73
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:18,678
so 5/2 seconds

74
00:04:18,678 --> 00:04:20,801
i woudnt worry to much about the phisics here

75
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:23,115
i think they just want us to apply the quadratic formula

76
00:04:23,115 --> 00:04:24,814
into this modeling situation

77
00:04:24,814 --> 00:04:30,041
the physics, we go into a lot more depth in the physics playlist

78
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,916
so lets verify that we definitley

79
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,086
are at a height of 0 at 5/2 seconds

80
00:04:35,086 --> 00:04:39,750
so if t=5/2 then this expression is equal to 0

81
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,148
so we have, lets try it out, so we have

82
00:04:44,148 --> 00:04:49,773
-16*5/2^2

83
00:04:49,773 --> 00:04:53,067
+20*5/2

84
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:54,733
+50

85
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:59,522
this needs to be equal to 0

86
00:04:59,522 --> 00:05:16,185
so this is -16*25/4 + 50+50=0

87
00:05:16,201 --> 00:05:19,254
-16/4 is -4

88
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:21,293
4/4 is 1

89
00:05:21,293 --> 00:05:27,044
so -4/25 which is 100, +50

90
00:05:27,044 --> 00:05:29,898
sorry, -4/25 is NEGATIVE 100

91
00:05:29,898 --> 00:05:32,692
100+50+50

92
00:05:32,692 --> 00:05:37,295
so we have -100 plus 100

93
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,212
so thats definatly going to be 0

94
00:05:39,212 --> 00:05:40,545
we get 0 = 0

95
00:05:40,545 --> 00:05:42,276
and it all checks out

96
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:45,294
we hit the ground after 5/2 seconds

97
00:05:45,294 --> 00:05:51,536
or another way to think about it is 2.5 seconds
