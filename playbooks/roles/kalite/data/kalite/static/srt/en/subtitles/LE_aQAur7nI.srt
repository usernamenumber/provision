1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
   

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,010
I've got some matrix A.

3
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,810
We learned several videos ago
that it's row space is the

4
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:10,960
same thing as the column space
of it's transpose.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:19,720
So that right there is
the row space of A.

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,990
That this thing's orthogonal
complement, so the set of all

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,820
of the vectors that are
orthogonal to this, so its

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:31,230
orthogonal complement is equal
to the nullspace of A.

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,760
And, essentially, the same
result if you switch A and A

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,750
transpose, we also learned that
the orthogonal complement

11
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:46,450
of the column space of A
is equal to the left

12
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,680
nullspace of A.

13
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,450
Which is the same thing as the
nullspace of A transposed.

14
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,410
We could write this, just to
understand the terminology,

15
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,550
that's the left nullspace, which
is the same thing as the

16
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,410
nullspace of A transposed.

17
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,890
Now, what is the orthogonal
complement of the

18
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,140
nullspace of A?

19
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,270
   

20
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,910
Well, you might guess that it's
the row space of A, but

21
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,740
we didn't have the tools
until the last video

22
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,500
to figure that out.

23
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,120
In the last video, we saw that
if we take the orthogonal

24
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,400
complement -- let me write it
this way -- if we were to take

25
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,110
the orthogonal complement of the
orthogonal complement, it

26
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,620
equals the original sub space.

27
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,030
So now, what are we doing?

28
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,200
We're taking the orthogonal
complement of the

29
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,510
nullspace of A.

30
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:41,120
Well, the nullspace of A is just
this thing right here.

31
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,520
So this is equal to taking the
orthogonal complement of the

32
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,490
nullspace of A.

33
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,630
But the nullspace of
A is this thing.

34
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:54,790
It's the row space's orthogonal
complement.

35
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,590
Now, we're essentially the
orthogonal complement of the

36
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,020
orthogonal complement.

37
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,760
We can use this property, which
we just proved in the

38
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,160
last video, to say that this
is equal to just the

39
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,270
row space of A.

40
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:11,730
Which is the same thing as the
column space of A transposed.

41
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,090
So the orthogonal complement
of the row space is the

42
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,580
nullspace and the orthogonal
complement of the nullspace is

43
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,550
the row space.

44
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,920
We can apply that
same property on

45
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,030
this side right here.

46
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:28,840
What is the orthogonal
complement of the left

47
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,750
nullspace of A?

48
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,890
What is this?

49
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,920
Well, this is going to be
equal to the orthogonal

50
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,170
complement of this thing.

51
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,740
Because that's what the left
nullspace of A is equal to.

52
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,390
So it's equal to the orthogonal
complement of the

53
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,090
orthogonal complement
of the column space.

54
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,190
And we just learned in the last
video, if you take the

55
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,180
orthogonal complement of the
orthogonal complement it

56
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,070
equals the original subspace.

57
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,680
So this is just equal to
the column space of A.

58
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,460
So we now see some
nice symmetry.

59
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,060
The nullspace is the orthogonal
complement of the

60
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,580
row space, and then we see
that the row space is the

61
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,000
orthogonal complement
of the nullspace.

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,235
Similarly, the left nullspace
is the orthogonal complement

63
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:14,310
of the column space.

64
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,310
And the column space is the
orthogonal complement of the

65
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,610
left nullspace.

66
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,850
So we have some nice symmetry
that we're able to essentially

67
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,500
prove given what we saw
in the last video.

68
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:26,733
