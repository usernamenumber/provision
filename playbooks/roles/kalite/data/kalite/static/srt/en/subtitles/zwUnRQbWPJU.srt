1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
   

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:06,140
Find the volume of a cube with
a side length of 8xy squared.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,600
So we have a cube right here.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,190
And they're saying that each of
the sides, for a cube all

5
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,430
the sides have the same length,
each of them have

6
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,240
length 8xy squared.

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,980
So the length of this side,
maybe we call this the width,

8
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,770
is 8xy squared.

9
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,660
The length of this side, maybe
we can call that the depth, or

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,210
the length, depending
on how you want to

11
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,460
label it, is 8xy squared.

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,870
The height of this cube is also
going to be 8xy squared.

13
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,540
A cube, all of the dimensions
are the same.

14
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,770
Now, if you want to take the
volume of any a rectangular

15
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,170
prism, you'll multiplied
these three dimensions.

16
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,200
You"ll multiply the
width times the

17
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,390
depth times the height.

18
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,070
Now, in a cube, these are
all the same dimensions.

19
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,460
So you can just take this
dimension and multiply it by

20
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,940
itself three times.

21
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,740
Or you could take it
to the third power.

22
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:06,710
So the volume of this cube is
8xy squared, I could just

23
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,760
multiply it by itself three
times, or I could say to the

24
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,130
third power.

25
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,120
That's why raising something
to the third power is

26
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,510
called cubing it.

27
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,060
Because you're essentially
finding the volume of a cube,

28
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,550
where the thing that you're
cubing is the dimension of

29
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,160
each of the sides.

30
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,910
Now, what's this going to be?

31
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,610
Well, when you take a product
and you raise it to some

32
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,950
power, that's the same thing as
taking each of the terms to

33
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:32,760
that power.

34
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:39,230
So this is the same thing as 8
to the third power times x to

35
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:46,120
the third power times y squared
to the third power.

36
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,910
   

37
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,760
And what's 8 to the
third power?

38
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:59,690
8 squared is 64, so we'll
multiply 64 times 8.

39
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,670
4 times 8 is 32.

40
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,570
6 times 8 is 48 plus 3 is 51.

41
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,430
So it's 512.

42
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:14,650
So this is equal to 512 times
x to the third and y squared

43
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,760
to the third power, that's the
same thing is y to the 2 times

44
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,105
3 power, or y to the
sixth power.

45
00:02:20,105 --> 00:02:24,490
   

46
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,050
And we're done.

47
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,380
We found the volume
of the cube.

48
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,710
It's 512 x to the third
y to the sixth.

49
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:30,800
