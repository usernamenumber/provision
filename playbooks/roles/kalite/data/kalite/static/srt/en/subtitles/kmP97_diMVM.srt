1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,600
We are on problem number 14. See, what did they draw here?

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,900
That's the y-axis, that's the x-axis.

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,650
They drew a line that looks something like this.

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,010
Let's see, negative 3, so it goes something like this.

5
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,510
That's close enough.

6
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:28,000
And then they're saying that this is the point negative 3.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,940
This is the point y equals negative 1.

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,060
This is of course the y-axis. This is the x-axis.

9
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,270
The figure above shows a graph of the line of y equals mx

10
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,050
plus b, where m and b are constants.

11
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:43,310
Which of the following best represents the graph of y is

12
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:47,000
equal to minus 3mx plus b?

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,010
Well, if this yellow line-- this is y equals mx plus b.

14
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,020
Well, what is b, first of all? b is just the y-intercept.

15
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,040
So the y-intercept is right here, y equals negative 1.

16
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,020
So b is negative 1. And what's the slope?

17
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,060
Well, when we run, that's what-- 1, 2, 3 units.

18
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:17,030
Change in x is 3. What is the rise?

19
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:21,040
The rise, we go down, so it's negative 1. We go down 1.

20
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,410
So the change in y is equal to negative 1.

21
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,050
So the slope is negative 1/3.

22
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:29,870
So the equation of this line is y is equal to

23
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:34,070
minus 1/3 x minus 1.Right?

24
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:38,240
So if you want to know what minus 3mx plus b is, what's minus

25
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:45,070
3 times this m? What's minus 3 times minus 1/3?

26
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,000
Well, the negatives cancel out, so you just get-- let me

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
switch to purple, because that's that problem-- minus 3

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,050
times-- this is m, right? This is m.

29
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:59,080
So minus 3 times minus 1/3,that just equals 1.

30
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:06,070
So it equals 1x plus b. What's b? It's minus 1.

31
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,710
So the graph we're looking for is x minus 1.

32
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,210
And so if we wanted to draw that, the y-intercept would be

33
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,660
the same, it would be right there.

34
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,030
And then you just have a slope of 1.

35
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:20,110
Slope of 1 looks-- well, that's as close as I could do

36
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,590
to drawing it, right--that's a slope of 1.

37
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:26,010
Your change in x should be the same as your change in y.

38
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,500
So if you look at all the choices, first of all,

39
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,640
it's pretty obvious it's D, I think.

40
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,230
And they make it very explicit that the slope is 1 and the

41
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:40,000
y-intercept is negative 1. And that's choice D. Next problem.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,070
I get excited when there's something to draw, because we

43
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:49,010
can get through them faster. 15.

44
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:56,010
If the volume of a cube is 8,what is the shortest distance

45
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,560
from the center of the cube to the base of the cube?

46
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,020
Fascinating.

47
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,010
So the volume is 8,so what are the dimensions of this cube?

48
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,080
It's a cube, so all the sides are the same, right?

49
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,040
So x times x times x is x to the third, and that equals 8.

50
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,730
So the dimensions-- what to the third power is 8?

51
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,070
You should know that. 2, right? 2 times 2 times 2 is 8.

52
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:25,030
So the dimensions of the cube are 2 by 2 by 2.

53
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,040
So let's take that cross section where the center is.

54
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,890
And if I were to draw it, so that's just-- so the center of

55
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:42,540
the cube is right here.

56
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,450
And we know the dimensions of this cross section.

57
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:50,020
It's 2, 2, 2, 2. Right? I just sliced the cube right there.

58
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,640
And I just want to make sure I'm doing this problem.

59
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,190
From the center of the cube to the base of the cube-- so the

60
00:03:55,190 --> 00:04:00,470
base of the cube is going to be-- if I were to draw the cube,

61
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,070
this would have been the base of the cube down here.

62
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,040
So this is the base of the cube.

63
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,930
So they're essentially just asking us,

64
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,010
what's this distance right here? Well that's easy.

65
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,780
This is the center, so it's right in the middle, so it's 1.

66
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,630
Right?. It's 1 to the bottom, it's 1 to the roof of the cube,

67
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,610
it's 1 to each of the sides. So it's 1 away.

68
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,050
So that is answer A.

69
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,030
Next problem.

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:44,200
Problem 16. If y is equal to 5x cubed over z,

71
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:51,590
what happens to the value of y when both x and z are doubled?

72
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,330
So the way I think about it is, y is equal to 5x cubed

73
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,060
divided by z.

74
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,000
Actually do you know what the very easiest way to do this

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,040
problem is?

76
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,820
Substitute numbers for x and z.

77
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,010
So let's say that x is equal to 1 and z equals to 1.

78
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,010
So in this situation, y is equal to what?

79
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:21,070
5 times 1 cubed divided by 1,well that's just equal to 5.

80
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,000
Now they're saying,what happens if x and z are doubled?

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,470
So let's take the second situation.

82
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,040
x is equal to 2, z is equal to 2.

83
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:35,090
Now, y is equal to 5 times 2 cubed over 2.

84
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,760
And that is equal to what?

85
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,780
Well, 2 cubed divided by 2, this 2 cancels with the cubed.

86
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,740
You get 2 squared.

87
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:50,010
So it's just 5 times 2 squared,which is 5 times 4,which is 20

88
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:57,030
So y went from 5 to 20, so y increased by a factor of 4.

89
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:02,020
And that is choice E. y is multiplied by 4.

90
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,070
These questions can be surprisingly confusing because

91
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,100
you're like, oh, you have these variables,

92
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,500
do you make x into 2x and z into 2z,and then solve for--

93
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,610
just try out numbers.

94
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,000
They're not putting any restrictions on you,

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,520
so just substitute x and z, 1 and 1, and then double them.

96
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:27,060
Next problem. The SAT, speed matters more than maybe rigor.

97
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,080
All right. Problem 17.

98
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:38,030
Luke purchased an automobile for $5,000.

99
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:43,040
And the value of the automobile decreased by 20% per year.

100
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,580
The value in dollars of the automobile n years from the

101
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:52,360
date of the purchase is given by the function v, where v of n

102
00:06:52,360 --> 00:07:00,330
is equal to 5,000 times 4/5, which is the same thing as 0.8,

103
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,040
to the nth power. Fair enough.

104
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,410
How many years from the date of the purchase will the value

105
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,510
of the automobile be $3,200?

106
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,130
Well, they're saying the value is $3,200,

107
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:15,000
so we just solve for n.v of how many years is equal to$3,200?

108
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:23,010
3,200 is equal to 5,000 times 4/5 to the n.

109
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:27,520
Divide both sides by 5,000,

110
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:35,280
you get 3,200/5,000 is equal to 4/5 to the n.

111
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,070
And then,let's see,what's 32/5,000? You can delete these 0's.

112
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,070
Let's see, 16/25.

113
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:54,250
That equals-- so 16/25 is equal to 4/5 to the n.

114
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:57,010
And we should immediately--well, hopefully you'd

115
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:01,180
recognize is that 16 is 4 squared, and 25 is 5 squared,

116
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:10,990
so 16/25 is equal to 4/5 squared. 4 squared is 16.

117
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:16,720
5 squared is 25. So n is equal to 2. 2 years.

118
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,220
And that is choice B.

119
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,510
Let's see if I have time for--

120
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,710
no,we have a couple more problems.

121
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,290
I'll do the last three problems in the next video.

122
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:29,020
I will see you soon.
