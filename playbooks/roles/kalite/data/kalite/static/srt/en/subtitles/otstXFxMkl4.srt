1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,410
   

2
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,140
In the last video, I touched
on the core weakness of

3
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:07,400
fractional reserve banking and
that's the idea of the bank

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,340
run-- where if you have a bunch
of banks and they've all

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,780
lent out 90% of their reserves--
let's say that

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,280
here's all my banks-- Bank One,
Bank Two, Bank Three--

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,010
and you could have
a ton of banks.

8
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,700
I mean, you could imagine you
go all the way to Bank 100.

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,810
The problem with a bank run is
if just even one bank all of a

10
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:31,990
sudden isn't able to give its
depositors its money-- so it

11
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:37,470
is illiquid-- and we'll reserve
judgment as to whether

12
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,910
it is truly insolvent, but it
really just doesn't have the

13
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:42,410
money to give it to depositors,
then all of the

14
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,200
depositors of all of the other
banks get scared and run over

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,710
to the banks and ask for
their money back.

16
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,920
And by definition, in a
fractional reserve banking

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,220
system, these guys only have
10% of their deposits as

18
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,910
reserves, 10% reserves.

19
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,890
So if more than 10% of the
people ask for their money,

20
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,140
they're all going
to be illiquid.

21
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,390
   

22
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,410
Then you're going to have
just an all-out panic.

23
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,000
You're going to have
an all-out panic of

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,180
the financial system.

25
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,380
As soon as any of these guys'
loans come due-- so let me

26
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,410
draw one of their balance
sheets-- let's assume that

27
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,400
they were actually good
investors, which is a big

28
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,160
assumption, but let's say
that their balance

29
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,720
sheets look like this.

30
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,140
Here's all of the deposits that
they owe to people-- to

31
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,730
me and you.

32
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,290
That's their liabilities.

33
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:38,425
They have 10% of their assets
as actual currency reserves.

34
00:01:38,425 --> 00:01:42,320
   

35
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,470
And then the rest is loans
out to businesses

36
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,720
and whatever else.

37
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,230
   

38
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:55,590
And that's an asset because
businesses owe them something.

39
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,380
And what's going to happens--
as soon as there's a panic,

40
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,840
everyone wants their
money out.

41
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,635
The reserves are depleted
very quickly.

42
00:02:00,635 --> 00:02:06,340
   

43
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,419
And then these guys sit there
waiting for their money.

44
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,560
Essentially it shuts
down the bank.

45
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,710
As soon as these loans mature--
maybe this guy owed

46
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,670
his money in a year.

47
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,270
Then they're going to say, just
give me the money back.

48
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,120
I'm not going to renew the loan
even though you have a

49
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,070
good business.

50
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,790
And so everyone's going to want
their money back and the

51
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,510
whole financial system's going
to break down and credit is

52
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,760
going to freeze.

53
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:33,120
   

54
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,380
And this is a huge problem.

55
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,040
Remember, this could be just
because by one bad actor who

56
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,010
couldn't manage their
liquidity properly.

57
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:43,810
Even worse, it could be caused
just by one panicky

58
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:44,480
withdrawer.

59
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,590
There's doesn't even have
to be a bad actor.

60
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,160
It could just be some fear that
enters the system-- and

61
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,750
even for a completely legitimate
bank-- and I'll use

62
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,150
legitimate in quotations
because we're assuming

63
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,350
legitimate-- because some
would debate whether

64
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,440
fractional reserve banking
is legitimate.

65
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,190
But even if this is a completely
up-and-up bank, if

66
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:07,070
for whatever reason more than
10% of their deposits get

67
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,680
scared, then all of a sudden
they'll be illiquid and you'll

68
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,120
be in this all-out
panic condition.

69
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,150
Now I talked in the last video,
some of the things that

70
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,260
have been engineered to
fix this problem.

71
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,350
So these are the fixes.

72
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,615
The first one is to have a
banker of last resort, a

73
00:03:22,615 --> 00:03:23,865
lender of last resort.

74
00:03:23,865 --> 00:03:28,810
   

75
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,000
And that's our central bank--
or the Federal reserve bank.

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,590
   

77
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:41,010
And they'll never run out of
reserves, because these

78
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,490
reserves can be borrowed from
them and all these are, are

79
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:53,230
IOUs from the Federal reserve.

80
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,590
So what the Federal reserve
does-- and I've talked about

81
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,960
this in the past-- let's say
that their balance sheet

82
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,390
currently looks like this.

83
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:03,000
Let's say that this is their
current liabilities.

84
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,430
These are their current
assets.

85
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,510
And their current
liabilities are

86
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,880
essentially going to be IOUs.

87
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,420
These are going to be their
reserve notes, but let's say

88
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,830
someone else comes and says,
hey, federal reserve, lend me

89
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,355
some money.

90
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:18,370
So what they're going to do is
that they're going to print

91
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,010
some-- so these are Federal
reserve notes.

92
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,940
   

93
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,250
And then they're going to just
create an offsetting liability

94
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,240
and they have no
reserve limits.

95
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,770
Let me make it a new color just
to ease the monotony.

96
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,160
So they'll have this
corresponding notes

97
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,740
outstanding liability and
they're going to give those

98
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,030
notes to you.

99
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,420
They're going to give those
notes to the bank that's in a

100
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,190
desperate situation if
it couldn't borrow

101
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,790
from any other bank.

102
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,470
And so the Federal reserve
balance sheet will

103
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,240
now look like this.

104
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,190
This is what it looked
like before.

105
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:56,910
It has these new notes
outstanding and now this will

106
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:00,570
say-- instead of federal reserve
notes in its vaults,

107
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:04,510
it'll now have this little thing
on its books called loan

108
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,780
to the bank, loan to this guy
right here, which is an asset

109
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,760
because he owes him something.

110
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,140
And there's no limit to
which the Federal

111
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,010
reserve could do this.

112
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,910
Obviously there might be some
kind of implicit limit.

113
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,590
If they keep doing this
arbitrarily, people might not

114
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,370
accept these Federal
reserve notes as

115
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,600
actually carrying value.

116
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,940
So that's probably the main
limiting concern.

117
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,280
And I'll probably talk more in
future videos on other things

118
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,030
that are kind of keeping the
Federal reserve from just

119
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,030
doing this willy-nilly, but the
general idea is that they

120
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:33,790
never run out.

121
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:36,610
So this is one idea-- lender of
last resort, but not even

122
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,230
the Federal reserve wants to
keep doing this because what

123
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,870
if this guy is essentially
insolvent?

124
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:51,090
If these loans are actually
going bad, then there's no

125
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,210
reason that even the central
bank should actually be

126
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,700
lending to this guy.

127
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,970
They shouldn't be lending
to this guy.

128
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,990
So let's say the Federal reserve
looks at this guy's

129
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,180
books and say, you know what?

130
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,240
These loans are really
worthless.

131
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,060
I'm not going to lend
more money to you.

132
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,510
What I'm going to do is take
you into receivership.

133
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,450
And I haven't even talked
about what that is.

134
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,090
That's the second fix.

135
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:16,260
The second fix is to have this
notion of insurance, of

136
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,510
deposit insurance.

137
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:23,830
   

138
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,700
So if a bank just has a
liquidity problem-- it's a

139
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:35,160
good bank-- it just ran out of
reserves and no other bank is

140
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,016
willing to lend to it-- which
you might debate whether it's

141
00:06:38,016 --> 00:06:40,010
even a good bank if the other
banks aren't willing to lend

142
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:44,170
to it-- then it can go to the
discount window at the Federal

143
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,230
reserve and borrow some
reserve notes.

144
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,730
Now, in the situation where even
that's not good enough

145
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:51,590
and the bank is essentially out
of business, it had been

146
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:59,270
paying the FDIC a little bit of
money-- the Federal Deposit

147
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:05,560
Insurance Corporation-- a little
bit of money-- I mean,

148
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,920
probably a lot of money by an
individual's point of view,

149
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,720
but a little bit of money from
a bank's point of view-- and

150
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,440
it's a fraction of a percent--
a little bit of money every

151
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,400
year so that it could tell its
depositors, look, even in the

152
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,840
situation that our bank goes
bust, the Federal reserve is

153
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,310
going to pay you directly.

154
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,530
These are FDIC bank accounts.

155
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:28,190
The Federal reserve will make
you whole completely,

156
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,650
regardless of what happens
to the banks.

157
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,300
Now this, to me, is a big fix.

158
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,680
I mean, I'll tell you right now,
all of my savings right

159
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,180
now are in Federal deposit
insured-- FDIC

160
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,340
insured-- bank accounts.

161
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,180
This might sound great to the
depositor, but what's the side

162
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,490
effect on the banking system?

163
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,890
Let me draw all of
my banks again.

164
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:55,080
So I have Bank One, I have Bank
Two, I have Bank Three, I

165
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,120
have Bank Four.

166
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,540
Now, they are all
FDIC insured.

167
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,670
They pay some small fraction of
a percentage every year so

168
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,980
that they can tell their
depositors, look, if we ever

169
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,040
go bust, if we ever blow up
for whatever reason, your

170
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,570
deposits are 100% safe.

171
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,810
And what's going to happen?

172
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,470
This will solve the bank
run problem, right?

173
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,040
Let's say for whatever reason
this guy runs out of reserves

174
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,660
or he goes bankrupt--
let's say that

175
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,720
this guy goes bankrupt.

176
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,970
In the old situation, before the
insurance, everyone else

177
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,570
is going to get scared
and you're going

178
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,470
to have a bank run.

179
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,990
They're going to ask for their
money and there's just not

180
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,260
going to be enough reserves
because they only keep a

181
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,600
fraction of the reserves.

182
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,530
That's what fractional reserve
banking is, but now everyone's

183
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,870
going to feel comfortable,
like, you know what?

184
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,730
Everything is backed by the
Federal reserve, which can

185
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,340
print as many notes is
it wants so I'm just

186
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,010
going to sit pretty.

187
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,580
So this does solve the
bank run problem.

188
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:53,180
   

189
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,560
And so you might say, this
doesn't make it an unstable

190
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,500
equilibrium any more-- which
is kind of true, but

191
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,900
what does this do?

192
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,440
All of these guys are
now FDIC insured.

193
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,540
I'm equally willing to give my
money to any of these guys.

194
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,510
So I'm going to essentially
going to give my money to the

195
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:18,600
guy who gives me the highest
interest. And I've actually

196
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,820
done that with my personal
accounts.

197
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,530
I've gone and I've seen which
bank provides the highest

198
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,210
interest and I've ignored how
they're investing their

199
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:28,300
money-- I mean, otherwise I'd
be pretty suspicious about a

200
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,190
bank offering more interest
because they're probably doing

201
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,870
something risky, but now I don't
care because I know it's

202
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,560
FDIC insured and even if that
bank blows up, I'm going to

203
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,960
get all my money back.

204
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,890
So I might as well give my
deposit to the bank with the

205
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,270
highest interest.

206
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:44,250
Now based on what you saw in
that last video, which is the

207
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,710
bank that's going to be giving
the highest interest?

208
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,920
What's going to be
the bank that's

209
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,240
taking on the most risk?

210
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:57,100
   

211
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,120
So once again, when you give
this relatively cheap

212
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:06,520
insurance to all of these banks
and all of these banks

213
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,390
can attract money much easier by
paying this insurance-- if

214
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,990
they didn't have this insurance,
they would have to

215
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:11,660
pay much more.

216
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:19,130
Let's say this insurance
is 0.1% per year.

217
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:21,080
If they didn't have this
insurance, they would have to

218
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,610
pay much more than 0.1% per
year to the depositor in

219
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:27,810
interest to make up for the risk
that they're taking on,

220
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,810
that they're not being backed
by the government.

221
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:33,360
So it's a really good deal
for the depositor.

222
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,530
Let's put it this way.

223
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,690
When you give a deposit to
a bank, you're lending

224
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:37,970
money to the bank.

225
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,130
So your checking deposit rate--
so let me write this

226
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:50,840
down-- your checking deposit
interest rate is the same

227
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,050
thing as the bank's borrowing
cost, right?

228
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,750
When I go to some bank and
they're paying me 2% a year,

229
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:04,600
that's the bank's borrowing
cost. They're the same thing.

230
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,220
Now if the bank didn't have FDIC
insurance, it wouldn't

231
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,620
have to pay 0.1% a year, but it
would have to give me more

232
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,500
interest. It would have to pay
me 3% or 4%, probably more,

233
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,910
because I'd say this
is a risky bank--

234
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,110
or it's more risky.

235
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,680
Any bank would be more risky
than someone who can

236
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,120
print out the notes.

237
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,020
So it would have to pay more,
but now it can just pay 0.1% a

238
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:32,240
year or whatever the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation

239
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,810
pays it, but it's going to lower
to FDIC, but the main

240
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:42,000
side effect of this is it's
going to lower what it has to

241
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,340
pay the depositors because the
depositors say, this is a lot

242
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,850
safer than what I thought.

243
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:54,560
So it's going to lower
borrowing costs by

244
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,420
much more than 0.1%.

245
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,290
So it's a really good deal
for the bank and it's an

246
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:05,000
especially good deal for the
ultra-risky banks who might

247
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,030
have to pay a little bit more,
but because they can now do

248
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,810
super duper risky things.

249
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,480
You say, hey, but this
is insurance.

250
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,820
The Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation isn't stupid.

251
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,310
It should just charge more
for riskier banks.

252
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:20,590
But I guess the rebuttal to
that is that's easier said

253
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:26,860
than done because when times are
good, like in the '20s or

254
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:32,520
during the housing bubble,
you get hidden risk.

255
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,360
So you don't know who's
taking on the risk.

256
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,050
It's usually the person who's
getting the highest returns,

257
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,280
but if they're always good for
it, you don't see it and that

258
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,545
person just looks
like a genius.

259
00:12:43,545 --> 00:12:47,500
   

260
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,780
And then when times are
bad, that guy blows

261
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,200
up, but guess what?

262
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,690
He's not on the line for it.

263
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,040
It's the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, who all

264
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,200
along was probably

265
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,720
undercharging for that insurance.

266
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,090
I want to make one last
point about this.

267
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,010
It's called insurance.

268
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,385
It's the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation.

269
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:08,460
   

270
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,970
And I want to point out the
difference between financial

271
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,230
insurance-- and you could
watch my video on credit

272
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,380
default swaps, which is another
form of financial

273
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,830
insurance-- between financial
insurance and what we normally

274
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,660
associate with insurance.

275
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,890
If I have car insurance-- let's
say I'm a car insurance

276
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:28,060
person and I agree-- let's say
that they are Driver One--

277
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,180
let's say I have a bunch of
drivers-- so Driver One,

278
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:36,210
Driver Two, Driver Three,
Driver Four.

279
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:39,230
And I know that in any given
year, they each have a 10%

280
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:43,050
chance of an accident.

281
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,860
That's a lot higher than
reality, but we'll make the

282
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,750
numbers easy.

283
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:53,620
And if there is an accident,
it will cost me $10,000.

284
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,190
So I could go to Driver One and
say, look, there's a 10%

285
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,510
chance you're going to
have an accident.

286
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,770
It would cost $10,000
if you do.

287
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,450
So I'm going to charge
you-- the fair

288
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,330
price would be $1,000.

289
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:03,760
I'll charge you $1,100.

290
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,040
I'll charge $1,100 just so I
can make a little bit of a

291
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,760
profit, right?

292
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,600
What you would charge is $1,000
if you wanted to break

293
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,060
even, but I'll charge $1,100--
and I might do this more than

294
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,780
just four drivers.

295
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,670
I might do it with
4,000 drivers.

296
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:23,530
So on average in any given
year-- let's say I have one

297
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:30,140
million drivers-- in any given
year, how much am I

298
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:30,740
going to bring in?

299
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,310
I'm going to bring in a million
times $1,100, which

300
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:37,510
is-- I'm going to get $1.1
billion in input, or in

301
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,980
revenue, from people paying
their premiums. And how much

302
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,310
am I going to have to pay out?

303
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:47,090
   

304
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,670
Well, roughly 10% if you believe
these statistics are

305
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,300
going to have an accident.

306
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:55,330
So that means that 100,000 are
going to have an accident.

307
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,220
Each of those 100,000
accidents are

308
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,300
going to cost me $10,000.

309
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,830
$10,000 times $100,000.

310
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,200
I'm going to have to pay out $1
billion for the accidents.

311
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:09,110
So I will net every year-- if my
actuaries did their job, I

312
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,840
will net $100 million
every year.

313
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,340
And this works out pretty good
assuming these statistics are

314
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,130
right and people are willing to
pay the premium because if

315
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:19,690
you have enough drivers-- like
a million drivers-- the

316
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,190
statistics really hold.

317
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:24,530
In any given year, the chance
of 20% of the drivers having

318
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,040
an accident is very,
very, very-- almost

319
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,310
infinitesimally small.

320
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,790
It's almost zero.

321
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:32,140
And one driver having an
accident doesn't make it more

322
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,770
or less likely that another
driver will have an accident

323
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,480
when you're talking
about on the order

324
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,860
of a million drivers.

325
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,030
And that's true of health
insurance and everything else.

326
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,260
It's just purely probabilistic
and if you have enough people

327
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,070
insured, the statistics
can actually hold up.

328
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,040
Now with financial
insurance, you

329
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,010
have a different situation.

330
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:57,220
You might say, look, in any
given year, on average, the

331
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:03,100
FDIC might say, look, only-- I
don't know-- one out of out of

332
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,410
1,000 banks fail.

333
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:07,200
So there's a 0.1% chance
of failure.

334
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,260
Of course it'll capture back
some money because it'll have

335
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,030
some assets on average.

336
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:15,700
But the reality is that when
times go bad, the bank

337
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,210
failures tend to be correlated
because they're all

338
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:18,370
interlinked.

339
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:21,680
And I've done a lot-- one
might be lending to some

340
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,520
business that's dependent on
some business that this guy's

341
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,350
lending to.

342
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,200
The whole financial system
is all linked up.

343
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,990
So the failures aren't-- they
all correlate with each other.

344
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,360
They're not independent
events.

345
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,870
So if one bank fails, it's much
more likely that other

346
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,740
banks are going to fail all
at the same time and we're

347
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,580
experiencing that right now.

348
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:45,550
So you can't really follow the
insurance model because the

349
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,800
statistics really don't apply.

350
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,800
You can do this insurance model
when each of the events

351
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,350
that you're insuring are
uncorrelated, but when all the

352
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,940
events that you're insuring are
likely to all happen at

353
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,270
the same time, what you're going
to have is-- when times

354
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:02,220
are good, you're going to see a
much lower kind of loss rate

355
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,430
and then when times are bad, all
of your guys are going to

356
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,200
blow up and you're essentially
on the hook

357
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,950
for all these people.

358
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:10,410
We see that right now and the
FDIC is actually-- it's going

359
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:13,050
to have to go back to Congress,
I'm 100% sure, and

360
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,890
ask for more money and it's we
the taxpayers that are going

361
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,910
to be on the line for
this type of thing.

362
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:18,933
