1
00:00:01,065 --> 00:00:03,911
David Drogin: This a small painting by the Sienese artist--Duccio

2
00:00:03,911 --> 00:00:07,485
active at the end of the 13th and very beginning of the 14th centuries

3
00:00:07,485 --> 00:00:09,932
--and Duccio was one of the artists who helps establish

4
00:00:09,932 --> 00:00:12,927
a Sienese gothic style--and this well rather well

5
00:00:12,927 --> 00:00:15,283
preserved painting is an excellent example of that

6
00:00:15,283 --> 00:00:17,165
Beth Harris: We're lucky because this painting is at

7
00:00:17,165 --> 00:00:18,979
the Metropolitan Museum of Art

8
00:00:18,979 --> 00:00:21,661
--and there's not a lot of the great paintings

9
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:25,031
of the 1200s and early 1300s that are here

10
00:00:25,031 --> 00:00:26,976
in New York City

11
00:00:26,976 --> 00:00:28,749
David Drogin: That's right--and in fact there are

12
00:00:28,749 --> 00:00:30,675
very very few Duccio paintings that survive

13
00:00:30,675 --> 00:00:32,234
anywhere in the world

14
00:00:32,234 --> 00:00:34,477
--there's only thirteen of them total in the world

15
00:00:34,477 --> 00:00:36,700
Beth Harris: And the Met actually just purchased

16
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,510
this one a few years ago

17
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,627
for a very very large sum of money

18
00:00:41,627 --> 00:00:43,748
David Drogin: That's right because there are only

19
00:00:43,748 --> 00:00:46,500
thirteen of them--and all of the other paintings

20
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,911
besides this one--at the time--were already in

21
00:00:48,911 --> 00:00:51,077
museum collections and museums don't sell

22
00:00:51,077 --> 00:00:52,813
or get rid of works of art

23
00:00:52,813 --> 00:00:55,178
--and so when this painting came up to sale

24
00:00:55,178 --> 00:00:57,479
it was the only opportunity the Met

25
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:59,903
was ever going to have to buy a painting by Duccio

26
00:00:59,903 --> 00:01:01,875
Beth Harris: So we should all go and look at this one

27
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,742
because we are really fortunate that it's here

28
00:01:03,742 --> 00:01:06,206
--but it's hard not to look at it and think about

29
00:01:06,206 --> 00:01:07,813
how much money it cost

30
00:01:07,813 --> 00:01:09,867
David Drogin: That's right--the Met--the Metropolitan Museum

31
00:01:09,867 --> 00:01:12,098
won't officially confirm how much money they spent

32
00:01:12,098 --> 00:01:14,049
but people estimate that they probably paid

33
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:16,089
$45 million for this painting

34
00:01:16,089 --> 00:01:17,953
which is less than one foot tall

35
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:19,533
Beth Harris: Oh my gosh

36
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:21,134
David Drogin: It's quite a lot

37
00:01:21,134 --> 00:01:23,245
Beth Harris: So let's talk about what makes

38
00:01:23,245 --> 00:01:27,411
it so special--so we're looking at just a typical

39
00:01:27,411 --> 00:01:29,428
Madonna and child painting

40
00:01:29,428 --> 00:01:33,016
--and its got that Sienese interest

41
00:01:33,016 --> 00:01:35,994
in all that gold that we were talking about

42
00:01:35,994 --> 00:01:38,715
David Drogin: It's very other worldly looking in some sense

43
00:01:38,715 --> 00:01:42,343
because of the intense gold in the background

44
00:01:42,343 --> 00:01:45,123
that has patterns incised into it

45
00:01:45,123 --> 00:01:47,029
that also made it more reflective

46
00:01:47,029 --> 00:01:48,884
when candles were burning in front of it

47
00:01:48,884 --> 00:01:52,162
--and the halo makes it very other worldly

48
00:01:52,162 --> 00:01:54,866
the disparity and the unevenness in scale

49
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:57,758
between the infant Christ and the Virgin Mary

50
00:01:57,758 --> 00:02:02,043
--the flowing undulous liquid-like weightless fabric

51
00:02:02,043 --> 00:02:04,129
that covers her body

52
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:06,335
--all of these thing help us understand

53
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,256
that these figures are other-worldly figures

54
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,957
not a scene that you would glimpse

55
00:02:09,957 --> 00:02:11,617
through a window as you were walking down the street

56
00:02:11,617 --> 00:02:12,883
Beth Harris: And why does he look like

57
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:16,332
a little man and not like a child?

58
00:02:16,332 --> 00:02:17,991
David Drogin: Well that's a good question

59
00:02:17,991 --> 00:02:20,452
--it's not that Duccio didn't know how to represent

60
00:02:20,452 --> 00:02:21,994
an infant if he wanted to

61
00:02:21,994 --> 00:02:24,698
--but by choosing to represent the infant Christ

62
00:02:24,698 --> 00:02:27,016
looking mature--looking like a little man

63
00:02:27,016 --> 00:02:29,428
--Duccio and viewers would have understood

64
00:02:29,428 --> 00:02:32,095
this as acknowledging his maturity

65
00:02:32,095 --> 00:02:34,025
--in other words that Christ had the wisdom

66
00:02:34,025 --> 00:02:35,746
of man--the wisdom of God--even though he

67
00:02:35,746 --> 00:02:37,296
was a small child

68
00:02:37,296 --> 00:02:40,067
--and not only that these paintings--and even sculptures

69
00:02:40,067 --> 00:02:42,319
of the Virgin Mary with the infant Christ

70
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,767
are supposed to remind you of the scene

71
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:46,265
at the end of Christ's life

72
00:02:46,265 --> 00:02:48,567
when the dead adult Christ is lying

73
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:49,997
across his mother's lap

74
00:02:49,997 --> 00:02:51,918
--so by painting the figure in this way

75
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:53,935
--looking as a mature sort of older man

76
00:02:53,935 --> 00:02:55,500
Duccio is doing all of things

77
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,410
suggesting maturing and also referencing Christ's death

78
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,683
Beth Harris: And we can see Mary looking down at Christ

79
00:03:00,683 --> 00:03:03,855
and there's a kind of connection between them

80
00:03:03,855 --> 00:03:05,535
as mother and son

81
00:03:05,535 --> 00:03:09,308
--and he lifts up her headdress here

82
00:03:09,308 --> 00:03:11,884
and gazes back at her

83
00:03:11,884 --> 00:03:14,844
--she looks sad--and maybe there's a sense

84
00:03:14,844 --> 00:03:17,164
of foreboding of his future

85
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:19,667
and how she will hold him on her lap

86
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:21,826
after the crucifiction

87
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,417
David Drogin: Even though the painting

88
00:03:23,417 --> 00:03:24,549
is generally other-worldly

89
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:26,946
there are some things that help us understand

90
00:03:26,946 --> 00:03:29,161
exactly what's going on--there are some things here

91
00:03:29,161 --> 00:03:30,701
are descriptive and naturalistic

92
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:32,633
such as the child-like gesture of him pulling her vail

93
00:03:32,633 --> 00:03:34,480
--the way she looks at him--and also the fact

94
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,114
that they stand behind a painted parapet or balcony

95
00:03:39,114 --> 00:03:40,482
Beth Harris: I didn't realize that was painted

96
00:03:40,482 --> 00:03:41,868
David Drogin: This is painted here

97
00:03:41,868 --> 00:03:44,995
--and it serves to--in a way--separate them from us

98
00:03:44,995 --> 00:03:47,145
that's a boundary between them and us

99
00:03:47,145 --> 00:03:49,197
--but at the same time is also connects

100
00:03:49,197 --> 00:03:50,564
there space with our space

101
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,063
because it's as if we glimpse them

102
00:03:52,063 --> 00:03:54,377
across that wall--over that balcony

103
00:03:54,377 --> 00:03:56,885
and that also is something that was rather

104
00:03:56,885 --> 00:03:58,296
unusual and innovative for the time

105
00:03:58,296 --> 00:04:00,851
Beth Harris: Now it looks like Mary is dressed in very dark clothing

106
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:02,651
but it would have been a very vivid blue--right?

107
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:04,931
David Drogin: Originally it would have been a brighter

108
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:06,910
stronger blue that would also have been

109
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,116
a very decorative effect

110
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:10,984
Beth Harris: What happened down here--to the frame?

111
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,494
David Drogin: Well--as I said before

112
00:04:12,494 --> 00:04:13,968
this painting is very well preserved

113
00:04:13,968 --> 00:04:15,918
but you notice these areas down in the bottom

114
00:04:15,918 --> 00:04:17,661
this is actually where this small painting

115
00:04:17,661 --> 00:04:19,151
was burnt by candles

116
00:04:19,151 --> 00:04:20,911
that were burning in front of it

117
00:04:20,911 --> 00:04:22,319
--this was not an altar piece

118
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:24,030
--but it was a devotional image

119
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,652
Beth Harris: So it wasn't in a church?

120
00:04:25,652 --> 00:04:27,235
David Drogin: It might have been in a church

121
00:04:27,235 --> 00:04:28,348
but it wouldn't have been over an altar

122
00:04:28,348 --> 00:04:29,965
--it could have been hanging on the sidewall

123
00:04:29,965 --> 00:04:32,285
of a chapel or even on a column or pier

124
00:04:32,285 --> 00:04:33,884
and there would have been candles

125
00:04:33,884 --> 00:04:35,532
burning in front of it as people prayed

126
00:04:35,532 --> 00:04:36,843
in front of it and those candles

127
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:38,277
have left their mark

128
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:39,706
Beth Harris: So its smallness helps it to be

129
00:04:39,706 --> 00:04:41,433
a very person image

130
00:04:41,433 --> 00:04:42,801
David Drogin: Absolutely

131
00:04:42,801 --> 00:04:51,109
it has a kind of intimacy because of its scale
