1
00:00:04,052 --> 00:00:07,204
-We're one the second floor of Orsanmichele, and here,

2
00:00:07,204 --> 00:00:13,078
one after the other, are the monumental sculpture that had once filled the niches outside.

3
00:00:13,078 --> 00:00:19,683
-It's important to remember that Orsanmichele is in many ways the place that the Rennaisance began in Florence.

4
00:00:19,683 --> 00:00:24,365
It began in this space that had both a secular function as a grainery

5
00:00:24,365 --> 00:00:26,966
but also a spiritual function...
-It's also a church.

6
00:00:26,966 --> 00:00:33,758
...and these were sculptures commissioned by the guilds, and so it makes sense that these first Rennaisance sculptures

7
00:00:33,758 --> 00:00:42,385
would be commissioned not by a church, but by guilds. By these secular organizations.

8
00:00:42,385 --> 00:00:44,382
-Okay so let's take one as an example.

9
00:00:44,382 --> 00:00:50,766
One of the important guilds in the city were the Linen Workers, and we're standing in front of St. Mark

10
00:00:50,766 --> 00:00:55,553
which is this monumental sculpture by Donatello. We know it's the Linen Worker

11
00:00:55,553 --> 00:00:59,476
because he is standing on a pillow, presumably made of linen.

12
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:04,827
-Right. If we think about him outside in that niche, and imagine walking by him,

13
00:01:04,827 --> 00:01:10,717
you could almost imagine the way that you would relate to him, that you could engage with him

14
00:01:10,717 --> 00:01:16,601
right on the streets of Florence. This sense of civic pride of bringing beauty to the city.

15
00:01:16,601 --> 00:01:20,914
-There really is a sense of immediancy here. This is Donatello's brilliance.

16
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:25,685
I mean, here we have a figure that is first of all reviving the classical in really important ways.

17
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:33,905
This is a figure that is an incredible early expressions of contrapposto, that hasn't been seen with this kind of understanding for a thousand years.

18
00:01:33,905 --> 00:01:38,375
-If you look at so many of the other figures that were created for Orsanmichele,

19
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:44,436
they still have that gothic sway to the hips and what Donatello gives us instead

20
00:01:44,436 --> 00:01:48,581
is something that looks very much like an ancient Roman sculpture.

21
00:01:48,581 --> 00:01:53,979
-Look for instance at the hips that push to his right, and over the engaged leg

22
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:59,728
you have the cloth falling in perfect unbroken lines, almost as if that's the fluting of a classical collumn.

23
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:03,524
It's on the other side that you can see the knee breaking the cloth,

24
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:09,852
and you can really get a sense, even though its under this heavy drapery, you still understand the movement of the body,

25
00:02:09,852 --> 00:02:17,079
the turn of the spine, the turn of the hips, the axis of the knees.
-Yep, Donatello is barrowing this directly from

26
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:21,413
ancient greek and roman sculpture. There's no other place he could have gotten this from.

27
00:02:21,413 --> 00:02:27,091
And so, the figure, because of the contrapposto, really looks alive. He looks like he can trully walk.

28
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:29,056
His feet are firmly planted on the ground.

29
00:02:29,056 --> 00:02:33,772
The sense that the weight is shifting gives a sense that he could walk at any second.

30
00:02:33,772 --> 00:02:38,682
We have an idea of sculpture beginning to be separate from the architecture,

31
00:02:38,682 --> 00:02:42,688
I mean, even though he was in a niche and he was intended for the architechture,

32
00:02:42,688 --> 00:02:48,028
the contrapposto, the sense of movement, gives us a sense of his autonomy from the architecture.

33
00:02:48,028 --> 00:02:52,828
-But it's also the authenticity of his experience, and so it's a revival of the classical

34
00:02:52,828 --> 00:02:58,435
not only in terms of the mechanics of the body, but also in terms of the experience of the individual.

35
00:02:58,435 --> 00:03:03,103
You said a moment ago we would walk down the street and see this figure in a niche,

36
00:03:03,103 --> 00:03:05,020
there would be a commedian kind of relationship,

37
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:10,603
and yes that's true, but at the same time he's seeing further. He's also seeing past us.

38
00:03:10,603 --> 00:03:14,853
-Right, it's this bringing together of the spiritual and the human.

39
00:03:14,853 --> 00:03:21,019
So close at this moment in the early fifteenth century in Florence.
-Look at the face,

40
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:26,906
there's a kind of intelligence, there's a kind of internal focus, there's a kind of awareness that is just piercing,

41
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:31,878
and he's thinking, he's reflecting on the gospels that he holds so easily at his side.

42
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,610
And perhaps he's about to speak them to us.

43
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:38,504
There is this way in which our eyes are drawn up through the planear quality

44
00:03:38,504 --> 00:03:43,010
of the drapery to the more focused handeling of the stone

45
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,227
near the beard, near the eyes -- look at that furrowed brow --

46
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:50,522
so that he's somebody that we can understand or approach in some real way.

47
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:54,986
-You know, the sculptures like the ones by Ghiberti that are more in that high Gothic style

48
00:03:54,986 --> 00:03:58,701
the face is often more plain, right?
-Yes.

49
00:03:58,701 --> 00:04:05,315
-And less individualized, and our focus goes on those decorative forms in the drapery...
-It's distracted in a sense!

50
00:04:05,315 --> 00:04:10,126
-Exactly! And so we don't have that human to human connection that we're getting here,

51
00:04:10,126 --> 00:04:13,441
here instead of focusing -- although the drapery is fabulous --

52
00:04:13,441 --> 00:04:18,089
we look directly at the face, and we see the furrowed brow,

53
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:23,813
the eyes that gaze out, the beard that animated his face and makes it seam even more thoughtful,

54
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:27,436
his receding hairline. Then we look down at his hands,

55
00:04:27,436 --> 00:04:32,020
and we can see that Donatello has clearly been thinking about human anatomy.

56
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:37,774
Those are not just generalized shapes for hands, but a sense of bone and muscle and veins,

57
00:04:37,774 --> 00:04:41,183
and then down to the feet, firmly planted on the ground.

58
00:04:41,183 --> 00:04:47,287
When the Florentines looked up at St. Mark, they looked up at him and saw a figure that ...

59
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,830
-It ennobled.
-That ennobled them!

60
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:56,268
That they looked at St. Mark and could have a sense of their own profound diginity as human being,

61
00:04:56,268 --> 00:05:00,411
as Florentines in the early fifteenth century. In a way, St. Mark is a mirror.

62
00:05:00,411 --> 00:05:08,322
-And so, isn't that exactly what this notion of civic pride, that was so tied in to fifteenth century Florence, was really about?

63
00:05:08,322 --> 00:05:12,114
This notion that we can rise to our own ideals.

64
00:05:12,114 --> 00:05:18,122
-We can be like the ancient Romans, and be virtuous, and...

65
00:05:18,122 --> 00:05:25,051
-Shake off the corruption of the medieval, and in a sense return the greatness that man had once known.
