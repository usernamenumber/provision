1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710
   

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,370
Let's say I've got some
basis B, and it's

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:05,790
made up of k vectors.

4
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:12,050
Let's say it's v1, v2,
all the way to vk.

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:16,830
Let's say I have some vector
a, and I know what a's

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,600
coordinates are with
respect to B.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,490
So this is the coordinates of
a with respect to B are c1,

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,800
c2, and I'm going to have k
coordinates, because we have k

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,780
basis vectors.

10
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,645
Or if this describes a
subspace, this is a

11
00:00:34,645 --> 00:00:36,670
k-dimensional subspace.

12
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:40,790
So I'm going to have k of
these guys right there.

13
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,740
All this means, by our
definition of coordinates with

14
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,970
respect to a basis, this
literally means that I can

15
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:54,210
represent my vector a as a
linear combination of these

16
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,120
guys, where these coordinates
are the weights.

17
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:04,709
So a would be equal to c1 times
v1, plus c2 times v2,

18
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,030
plus all the way, keep adding
them up, all the

19
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:11,250
way to ck times vk.

20
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:17,080
Now, another way to write
this is that-- let me

21
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,160
write it this way.

22
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,590
If I had a matrix where the
column vectors were the basis

23
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,660
vectors of B-- so let me write
it just like that.

24
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:30,190
So let me see I have some matrix
C that looks like this,

25
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,820
where its column vectors are
just these basis vectors.

26
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:39,230
So we have v1, v2, all
the way to vk.

27
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:42,990
If we assume that all of these
are a member of Rn, then each

28
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,870
of these are going to have n
entries, or it's going to an n

29
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,130
by k matrix.

30
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,670
Each of these guys
have n entries.

31
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,800
So we're going to have n rows,
and we have k columns.

32
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,220
So let's imagine this
matrix right there.

33
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,450
Another way to write this
expression right there, is to

34
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:11,670
say that a is equal to the
vector c1, c2, all the way to

35
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,520
ck, multiplied by this
matrix right there.

36
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,210
This would be equal to a.

37
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,070
   

38
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:24,650
This statement over here and
this expression over here are

39
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,620
completely identical.

40
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,110
If I take this matrix vector
product, what do I get?

41
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:36,250
I get c1 times v1, plus c2 times
v2, plus c3 times v3,

42
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,960
all the way to ck times
vk, is equal to a.

43
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,950
We've seen this multiple
times in

44
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,860
multiple different contexts.

45
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,710
But what's interesting
here is this

46
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,390
expression is the same thing.

47
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,710
And really I'm just applying new
words to things that we've

48
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,350
seen probably 100
times by now.

49
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,750
We can rewrite this
expression.

50
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,530
This is C-- and remember C is
just a matrix with our basis

51
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:01,400
vectors as columns-- C
is equal to this guy.

52
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,210
This is just the coordinates
of a with respect

53
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,750
to the basis B.

54
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:11,320
So C times the vector that has
the coordinates of the vector

55
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,330
a with respect to the basis B.

56
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,245
That is going to
be equal to a.

57
00:03:17,245 --> 00:03:21,000
   

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,510
Now, why did I go through the
trouble of doing this?

59
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,820
Because now you have a fairly
straightforward way of-- if I

60
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,760
were to give you this, if I were
to give you that right

61
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,600
there, and say, hey, what is a,
if I wanted to write it in

62
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,710
standard coordinates, or with
respect to the standard basis?

63
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,120
Which is just kind of
the way we've been

64
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,560
writing vectors all along?

65
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,140
Then you just multiply it times
this matrix C, this

66
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,750
matrix that has the basis
vectors as columns.

67
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:55,490
The other way, if you have some
vector a that you know

68
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:59,010
can be represented as a linear
combination of B, or it's in

69
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,920
the span of these basis vectors,
then you could solve

70
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,540
for this guy right here to
figure out a's coordinates

71
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,520
with respect to B.

72
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,200
So this little matrix right
here, what does it do?

73
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,730
It helps us change bases.

74
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,230
If you multiply it times this
guy, you're going from the

75
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,040
vector represented by
coordinates with respect to

76
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,100
some basis, and you multiply
it times this guy, you're

77
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,430
going to get to the vector
just with standard

78
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:24,840
coordinates.

79
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:35,360
So we call this matrix right
here change of basis matrix,

80
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,020
which sounds very fancy.

81
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,090
But all it literally is is a
matrix with the basis vectors

82
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:41,970
as columns.

83
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,230
Let's just apply this a little
bit to see if we can do

84
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,400
anything vaguely constructive
with it.

85
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,130
Let's say that I have
some basis.

86
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,350
let's say B for basis.

87
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,440
Let's say I have two vectors.

88
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,930
I'll define the vectors
up here.

89
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,740
Let's say vector 1, let's say
we're dealing with R3.

90
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,130
So vector 1 is 1, 2, 3.

91
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:12,360
And let's say that vector
2 is 1, 0, 1.

92
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,540
And let's say I'm going to
define some basis B as being

93
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:22,060
the set of the vectors
v1 and v2.

94
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,800
I'll leave it to you to verify
that these are not linear

95
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,390
combinations of each other,
so this is a valid basis.

96
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,740
These aren't in any way
linearly dependent.

97
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,050
Now, let's say that I know some
vector that's in the span

98
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,300
of these guys.

99
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,790
   

100
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,700
All I know is how it happens
to be represented in

101
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,710
coordinates with respect
to this basis.

102
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,620
So let's say I have
some vector a.

103
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,840
And when I represent the
coordinates of a with respect

104
00:05:51,840 --> 00:06:02,800
to this basis, it's equal
to 7, 7, minus 4.

105
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,410
So how can we represent this
guy in its standard

106
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,390
coordinates?

107
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:12,410
What is a equal to?

108
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:17,990
Well, you could just say a is
equal to 7 times v1, minus 4

109
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,720
times v2, and you'd be
completely correct.

110
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,660
But let's actually use this
change of basis matrix that

111
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,490
I've introduced you
to in this video.

112
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:30,820
So the change of basis matrix
here is going to be just a

113
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:35,880
matrix with v1 and v2 as
its columns, 1, 2, 3,

114
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,550
and then 1, 0, 1.

115
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:43,000
And then if we multiply our
change of basis matrix times

116
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,340
the vector representation with
respect to that basis, so

117
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:57,220
times 7 minus 4, we're going to
get the vector represented

118
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,080
in standard coordinates.

119
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,650
So what is this going
to be equal to?

120
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:05,810
We have a 3 by 2 matrix,
times a 2 by 1.

121
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:10,420
We're going to get a 3 by 1
matrix, which makes complete

122
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,680
sense because we're
dealing in R3.

123
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,540
   

124
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,130
a is going to be member of R3.

125
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,970
So when we write it with
standard coordinates, we

126
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,680
should have 3 coordinates
right there.

127
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,520
Now when we represented a with
respect to the basis, we only

128
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,420
had two coordinates, because a
was in the plane spanned by

129
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,230
these two guys.

130
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:35,460
Actually this is a good
excuse to draw this.

131
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,270
So let me draw it in
three dimensions.

132
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,790
Let's say the span of v1
and v2 looks like this.

133
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:45,530
   

134
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,390
Let's say this is the 0
vector right there.

135
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:54,620
So this right here is the
span of v1 and v2.

136
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,290
Or another way, this is
the subspace that B

137
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,210
is the basis for.

138
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,490
So we know that a
is in this guy.

139
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:07,390
So let's say v1 looks like this,
and that v2-- I'm not

140
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,810
even looking at the numbers,
I'm just doing it fairly

141
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:16,960
abstract-- let's say v2 looks
like this right here.

142
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,150
Now, the fact that a can be
represented as a linear

143
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:23,240
combination of v1 and v2, tells
us that a is also going

144
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,060
to be in this plane in R3.

145
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:32,500
In fact, it's 7 times v1,
so it's 1 v1, 1 v1's, 3

146
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,549
v1's, 4, 5, 6, 7.

147
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:38,390
So it's 7 in that direction, and
then it's minus 4 in the

148
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,070
v2 direction.

149
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,635
So that's 1 in the
v2 direction.

150
00:08:40,635 --> 00:08:43,980
This is minus 1 in the v2
direction, minus 2,

151
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,850
minus 3, minus 4.

152
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:50,470
Or we can do it here,
1, 2, 3, 4.

153
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:54,390
So our vector a is going
to look like this.

154
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:57,470
It's going to sit
on the plane.

155
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,680
So this is our vector a.

156
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,000
It's going to sit
on the plane.

157
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,190
And when we represent it with
respect to this basis, when we

158
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,080
represent these coordinates with
respect to our basis B,

159
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,850
we say oh OK, it's
7 of this guy.

160
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,060
I'm just doing this
abstractly.

161
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,570
Don't pay attention to
the numbers just now.

162
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,480
I just want you to understand
the idea.

163
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,500
We said it's 7 of this guy,
minus 4 of this guy.

164
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,590
So it takes you back here.

165
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,990
And you get this vector,
which is in this plane.

166
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,310
So we only needed two
coordinates to specify it

167
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,290
within this plane, because
this subspace was

168
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,340
two-dimensional.

169
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,430
But we're dealing in R3.

170
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,460
And if we just want the general
version of a in

171
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,030
standard coordinates, we'll have
to essentially get three

172
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,740
coordinates.

173
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,730
I want you to understand that
a is sitting on this plane.

174
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:43,900
This plane just keeps going on
and on and on in all of these

175
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,430
directions.

176
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,840
a actually sits on that plane.

177
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,070
It's a linear combination of
that guy and that guy.

178
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,550
But let's figure out what
a looks like in standard

179
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,690
coordinates.

180
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,230
In standard coordinates, we get
the first term is going to

181
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,730
be 1 times 7, plus
1 times minus 4.

182
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,710
So that's going to be 3.

183
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,920
We get 2 times 7, plus
0 times minus 4.

184
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,480
That is 14.

185
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,610
You're going to get 3 times
7, plus 1 times minus 4.

186
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:13,360
So 3 times 7 is 21,
minus 4, is 17.

187
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,560
So a is the vector 3, 14, 17.

188
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,430
That is equal to a.

189
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:22,780
Now let's say we wanted
to go the other way.

190
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,400
Let's say we have some vector--
let me pick a letter

191
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,800
I haven't used recently-- let's
say I have some vector

192
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:39,190
d, which is 8, minus 6, 2.

193
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:48,220
And let's say we know that d is
a member of the span of our

194
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:56,600
basis vectors, the span of v1
and v2, which tells us that d

195
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,380
can be represented as a linear
combination of these guys, or

196
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,990
that d is in this subspace, or
that d can be represented as

197
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,040
coordinates with respect
to the basis B.

198
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:13,680
Remember, the basis B was just
equal to the set of v1 and v2.

199
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,450
That's all that basis B was.

200
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:22,410
Now, we know that if we have
our change of basis matrix

201
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:28,610
times the vector made up of
the coordinates, of d with

202
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:33,660
respect to B-- so let me write
that down, d with respect to

203
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,080
B-- is equal to d.

204
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,680
We know that.

205
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,285
We know if we have this guy's
coordinates and we multiply it

206
00:11:40,285 --> 00:11:44,270
by the change of basis matrix,
we'll just get the regular

207
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,900
standard coordinate
representation of d.

208
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,370
Now in this case, we have d.

209
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,690
We're given this.

210
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,450
We of course know what the
change of basis matrix is.

211
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:57,640
So if we wanted to represent d
in coordinates with respect to

212
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,940
B, we're going to have to
solve this equation.

213
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,200
So let's do that.

214
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:08,050
So our change of basis matrix
is 1, 1, 2, 0, 3, 1.

215
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,580
And we're going to have to
multiply it times some

216
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,830
coordinates.

217
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,640
This thing right here, we can
represent it as-- I'll do it

218
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,050
in yellow-- we're going to
need two coordinates.

219
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:21,180
It's going to be some
multiple of v1, plus

220
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,450
some multiple of v2.

221
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,940
So it's c1, c2.

222
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,870
We know it has to be two
coordinates because this

223
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:30,210
matrix vector product is only
well-defined if this is a

224
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:33,920
member of R2, because this
is a 3 by 2 matrix.

225
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,190
We have two columns here,
so we have to

226
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,890
have two entries here.

227
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,895
Then that's going to
be equal to d.

228
00:12:38,895 --> 00:12:41,955
   

229
00:12:41,955 --> 00:12:45,530
So we have 8, minus 6, 2.

230
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,940
So if we figure out what this
vector is, we've figured out

231
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,060
what the representation, or
the coordinates of d with

232
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,050
respect to B, are.

233
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,300
So let's solve this.

234
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,030
   

235
00:12:56,030 --> 00:13:01,150
So to solve this, we can just
set up an augmented matrix.

236
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,940
That's just our traditional
way of

237
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,610
solving a linear equation.

238
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:11,340
So we have 1, 1, 2, 0, 3, 1.

239
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,740
We augment it with this
side right there.

240
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,850
So we have 8, minus 6, and 2.

241
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,490
And let's keep my first
row the same.

242
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:24,560
So I have 1, 1, augmented
it with 8.

243
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,940
And let's replace my second row
with the second row minus

244
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,070
2 times the first row.

245
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:36,770
So I'm going to get 2 minus 2
times 1 is-- actually, let me

246
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:37,400
do it the other way.

247
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,360
Let me replace my second row
with 2 times my first row,

248
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,130
minus my second row.

249
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,990
So two times 1, minus 2, is 0.

250
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:50,650
2 times 1, minus 0, is 2.

251
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:55,390
2 times 8 is 16,
minus 6, is 10.

252
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:59,960
Now let's replace the third
row with 3 times the first

253
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,820
row, minus the third row.

254
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,190
So 3 times 1, minus 3, is 0.

255
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:09,660
3 times 1, minus 1, is 2.

256
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:23,290
And then 3 times 8 is 24, minus
2, is going to be 22.

257
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,540
See it looks like I must have
made a mistake someplace,

258
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,180
because I have these two would
lead to no solutions.

259
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,640
Let me verify what I did, make
sure that I didn't make any

260
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,990
strange errors.

261
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,950
So the second row, I replaced it
with 2 times the first row,

262
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,110
minus the second row.

263
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:39,740
So 2 times 1, minus 2, is 0.

264
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,920
2 times 1, minus 0, is 2.

265
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,620
2 times 8, minus minus 6-- so
there's my error-- that's

266
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,230
equal to 22.

267
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:49,790
That was my error.

268
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,080
So these two things
are equivalent.

269
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:56,000
   

270
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,305
I'll do one step at a time.

271
00:14:57,305 --> 00:15:00,650
   

272
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,910
Let me replace my third row with
my third row, minus my

273
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,260
second row, just get
it out of the way.

274
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:11,130
So I"ll keep this 1,
1, 8, 0, 2, 22.

275
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:14,570
And then the third row, I'm
going to replace it with my

276
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,110
third row, minus
my second row.

277
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,130
So it's going to be 0, 0, 0.

278
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,200
So that just gets zeroed out.

279
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,260
Now let me divide my
second row by 2.

280
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,060
So I get 1, 1, and 8.

281
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,250
And then this one becomes
0, 1, and 11.

282
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,470
Then of course the third row
is just a bunch of 0's.

283
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:38,300
Then let me keep my middle
row the same.

284
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,290
So it's 0, 1, and 11.

285
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:45,790
Then let me replace my first
with my first row, minus my

286
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,770
middle row.

287
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,950
So 1 minus 0 is 1.

288
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,070
1 minus 1 is 0.

289
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,600
8 minus 11 is minus 3.

290
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,540
And I'll keep my last
row the same.

291
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,550
So I put the left-hand side in
reduced row echelon form.

292
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,960
So this right here
is essentially

293
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,210
telling me my solution.

294
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,350
   

295
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,830
So I could write it this way.

296
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:18,480
I could write that 1, 0, 0, 1,
0, 0 times c1, c2 is equal to

297
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,030
minus 3, 11, 0.

298
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:25,420
Or another way of writing this,
is that 1 times c1, plus

299
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:30,060
0 times c2, or c1, is
equal to minus 3.

300
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:35,540
   

301
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:42,700
Then we have 0 times c1, plus
1 times c2 is going to be

302
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,510
equal to 11.

303
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:53,350
So our solution to this equation
is minus 3, 11.

304
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:56,900
Or another way of saying this,
is that if I wanted to write

305
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:01,470
my vector d in coordinates with
respect to my basis B, it

306
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:19,319
would be the coordinates minus
3, 11, which implies-- let me

307
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:23,060
write it this way-- which
implies that d is equal to

308
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:27,670
minus 3 times vector 1, plus
11, times vector 2.

309
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:30,520
I'll leave that for
you to verify.

310
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,190
But just like that, using this
change of basis matrix, we can

311
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,130
go back and forth.

312
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,270
If you have this representation,
it's very easy

313
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,540
to take the product and
get the standard

314
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,990
representation for d.

315
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,700
If you have the standard
representation or the

316
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,780
coordinates with respect
to the standard

317
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,310
basis, it's very easy.

318
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,830
Well, it's a little
more involved.

319
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,870
But then you just solve
for your coordinates

320
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,930
with respect to B.

321
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:54,466
