99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm stending here in the galleries, the Japanese gallerise at the Portland Art Museum

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we are looking at a recent aquisition

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it is a ewer, which is a particular kind of pitcher

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that comes to us from late XVI century Japan

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The first thing that comes to mind is its material, because when I first wallked up to this

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I imagined, in some way, probably because of the sides, that it was metal

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and when I came close to it I realized that it wasn't , it's wood. Is that right?

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Yes, it's wood.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And what's interesting is that body, and we often talk about pots in this anthropomorphic way,

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the body has a very slight, I mean it's almost a cylinder, but it tapers a little bit at the foot

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the body is sort of in the shape of a bucket

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This isn't carved from a single block of wood

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but it's rather a strip of wood that was steemed and wrapped

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Then we see these things that, these ridges on it

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Those are actually strips of bamboo

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that are sort of like little reinforcing vergers

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that help hold that steemed wood in that wrapped cylindrical shape

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So it's really a process from struction that's made in a way that is not dissimulous to the way that we might treat metal

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If you can think of a sheet of metal hammered and...

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
yes

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
...and then bent, that's like that

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and what is so interesting, if we think

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
OK, what are the normal ways that you handle wood

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
well we think of carving wood...

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
yes, exactly

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
...that idea of making a vessel, by wrapping a slab of wood into a cylinder

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then putting a bottom on it

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that is a technique, in which Japanese woodmakers excel.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There's a kind of delecacy and a kind of..

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I think that I get the sense of the thinness of the wall,

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that seems to me only possible in metal

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I think that's why I jump there

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but I think it really speaks to the extraordinaries of the tradition out of which this is coming

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I see it as increadibly impressive

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And can we talk a liitle bit about the way the wood is treated

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the color which I find beautiful

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's got this almost gorgeous, almost patina

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Yes, it does have a patina

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This ware is an example of Japanese lacquerware

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the wood turning, the wood bending, the wood shaping happens

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then it goes to a number of stages of being coated with lacquer

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and lacquer is found really much of Southeast Asia and East Asia

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but in Japan...

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Japanese lacquer was so treasured by the Europeans when trade began

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that analogous to the way we use the word "china" to associate ceramics with China,

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Eouopeans used to call works that were lacquered "Japanned"...

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Oh, is that right?

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
... It was so associated with Japan

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And lacquer is the sap of a Lac tree

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's a naturally occurring sap, so think of maple syrup,

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and think of it as something that, you know, trees oose out in a particular season of the year

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you have to go and tap it

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and it's thik and viscous like maple syrup

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Interestingly it's also toxic...

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Oh really?

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
... it has the same chemicals in it that poison ivy does

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Woo

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So lacquer workers have to spend a lifetime building a resistence to this

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So you have this lacquer and then you can..

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
ther's a sort of traditional colors to dye it

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and in Japan those two traditional colors were black
