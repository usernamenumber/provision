1
00:00:06,833 --> 00:00:08,100
We're in the town of Chartres

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,986
looking at Notre Dame de Chartres

3
00:00:09,986 --> 00:00:14,333
which is one of the great medieval cathedrals, but it's got a complicated history.

4
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:18,933
This site was a sacred space. According to legend there was a druidic temple here.

5
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:23,988
We don't know if it's true of course, but we do know is that there probably was a Roman temple here.

6
00:00:23,988 --> 00:00:29,400
And ultimately it was converted into a Christian space maybe third century.

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,567
And at that point we actually have some historical record.

8
00:00:32,567 --> 00:00:39,267
And by the time we get to around 1000 A.D. we know that there was a substantial church.

9
00:00:39,267 --> 00:00:45,233
A church that was always associated with the Virgin Mary, and in the ninth century,

10
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:52,533
the church received a special gift by way of Constantinople, a relic of the tunic of the Virgin Mary.

11
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:57,448
So a relic is an object that is believed to have special spiritual power.

12
00:00:57,448 --> 00:01:04,467
It could be a part of a saint, or it could be a piece of clothing or something in some very direct way related to a spiritual figure.

13
00:01:04,467 --> 00:01:10,533
So for instance, the crown of thorns that Christ wore, or in this case, the tunic that is believed

14
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:13,900
Mary wore when she gave birth to Christ.

15
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:19,000
Relics were critically important, because they were believed to actually have a kind of spiritual power

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,434
that could benefit those who paid reverence to it.

17
00:01:21,434 --> 00:01:25,600
And what this meant was that people would travel enormous distances to go and pay homage

18
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,233
to these relics often bringing gifts and offerings.

19
00:01:29,233 --> 00:01:32,267
Sometimes these would be jewels. Sometimes it would be money, donations.

20
00:01:32,267 --> 00:01:35,500
And the sites of important relics became really quite wealthy.

21
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,867
And there were these pilgrimage routes, and for the first time Europe is stable enough politically

22
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:41,567
so that it was actually relatively safe to travel.

23
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:46,867
Now we have no idea whether or not this in fact the tunic that Mary wore.

24
00:01:46,867 --> 00:01:49,321
What's important is that it was believed to be that.

25
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:53,600
And therefore had very special saving and protective powers.

26
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,433
But something terrible happened.

27
00:01:55,433 --> 00:01:58,933
The great Romanesque church that housed the tunic,

28
00:01:58,933 --> 00:02:02,033
that pilgrims came to from far and wide,

29
00:02:02,033 --> 00:02:03,600
burned to the ground.

30
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,233
In 1194.

31
00:02:05,233 --> 00:02:07,267
And the shroud was lost.

32
00:02:07,267 --> 00:02:09,733
Well, they thought the shroud was lost.

33
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:14,033
And it's a terrible moment, because without the shroud,

34
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:16,442
the town lost its protection.

35
00:02:16,442 --> 00:02:18,904
The people felt abandoned by Mary.

36
00:02:18,904 --> 00:02:24,267
But lo and behold, three days later, the tunic was discovered unharmed.

37
00:02:24,267 --> 00:02:28,333
In the crypt below the church. It was seen as a miracle.

38
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:31,367
Instead of the Virgin Mary having forsaken the town,

39
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:34,740
instead of this being evidence of her anger,

40
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,700
now it was clear that the Virgin simply wanted to get the old church out of the way

41
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:47,533
so that in 1194 the town of Chartes could raise a church that was equal to her importance in its splendor.

42
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:52,133
The architect of Chartes whose name we don't know, built the church on the foundations

43
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:56,533
of what was left of the Romanesque church that had been here.

44
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:59,833
But by this time, architecture in the West had changed.

45
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:03,967
And we had moved from a Romanesque style to a Gothic style.

46
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:09,700
And this church is one of the most pre-eminent examples, and probably the most unified example,

47
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,367
of the Gothic in France.

48
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:15,933
We're talking about a new focus on opening up the walls of the church

49
00:03:15,933 --> 00:03:18,500
and a new focus on geometry.

50
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,633
God created the world according to measure.

51
00:03:21,633 --> 00:03:29,800
And the church could mirror the measure, the numbers with which God had created the universe.

52
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:36,833
And so by being in that space, created with that measure, we would feel closer to God.

53
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:41,267
We would have an approximation of the divine realm.

54
00:03:41,267 --> 00:03:49,233
So what is sometime referred to as Chartes I, the westwork, the part that survived the fire of 1194,

55
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:52,067
that was built earlier, that part feels so much more massive.

56
00:03:52,067 --> 00:03:56,520
The architect is not yet shedding the fears that went along with the Romanesque

57
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,467
where the walls had to be solid, had to be massive.

58
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:01,200
Well, stone roofs weigh a lot.

59
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,400
They sure do.

60
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,867
And so you can see that the building is pierced only with the smallest windows.

61
00:04:05,867 --> 00:04:09,433
The facade is divided into threes in two directions.

62
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:15,733
A reference to the Trinity, but I think more importantly organized according to the Golden Ratio.

63
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:20,019
And a notion of creating a sense of perfect proportion.

64
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,033
Let's walk a little closer.

65
00:04:21,033 --> 00:04:23,200
Let's take a look at the jamb figures on the royal portal.

66
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,867
[hammers ringing]

67
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:26,776
You can actually hear some of the masons working, doing some repairs on the church.

68
00:04:26,776 --> 00:04:30,467
The jamb figures are the figures on either side of the doorway.

69
00:04:30,467 --> 00:04:34,333
They're very columnar, each attached to columns.

70
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:37,527
Probably the kings and queens of the Old Testament.

71
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,734
They're really Gothic.

72
00:04:38,734 --> 00:04:40,847
They're not people like we are.

73
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:44,200
They're clearly representations of spiritual beings.

74
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,267
You can tell that, because as you said they're incredibly long.

75
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:50,233
Virtually architectural columns except they support nothing.

76
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:52,067
They don't really seem to have a sense of weight.

77
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:55,300
If you look down at their feet, they sort of dangle down a little bit.

78
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,767
They don't really have bodies.

79
00:04:56,767 --> 00:05:02,333
They have drapery with folds indicated by lines carved into the stone

80
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:06,033
and in some cases indicating a knee or a hip.

81
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:11,000
But there is really no sense of a monumental, three-dimensional body under that drapery.

82
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,768
I'm taken by the pure aesthetic beauty of these figures to represent these figures as gatekeepers,

83
00:05:16,768 --> 00:05:20,182
somebody that can hasten our entry into the spiritual realm.

84
00:05:20,182 --> 00:05:23,367
Precisely. As we walk in, the figures tower above us.

85
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:30,163
They look paternal, kindly, and they look down at us but also past us.

86
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:37,340
So they seem to occupy both the heavenly realm and the physical realm at the same time

87
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:42,999
and provide a kind of transition into the spiritual realm inside the church.
