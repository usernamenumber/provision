1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,232
What I want to do with this video is start with some point that's

2
00:00:03,263 --> 00:00:05,895
not on the plane, or not necessarily on the plane.

3
00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:09,656
So let me draw a point right over here

4
00:00:09,656 --> 00:00:12,467
and let's say the coordinates of that point are x-naught

5
00:00:12,467 --> 00:00:16,867
x-sub-zero, y-sub-zero and z-sub-zero.

6
00:00:16,867 --> 00:00:19,733
Or it could be specified as a position vector.

7
00:00:19,733 --> 00:00:21,933
I could draw the position vector like this.

8
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:25,170
So the position vector, let me draw a better dotted line

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,000
so the position vector for this could be x-naught i

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,067
plus y-naught-j, plus z-naught-k

11
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:35,533
specifies this coordinate right over here.

12
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:39,333
What I want to do is find the distance between this point

13
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,733
and the plane. And obviously there could be a lot of distances

14
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:44,350
I could find the distance between this point and that point

15
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,345
And this point and this point, and this point and this point

16
00:00:47,345 --> 00:00:48,467
And when I say I want to find the distance,

17
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:50,600
I want to find the minimum distance

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,429
and you're actually going to get the minimum distance when

19
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:57,267
you go the perpendicular distance to the plane

20
00:00:57,267 --> 00:00:59,095
or the normal distance to the plane.

21
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:02,133
We'll hopefully see that visually as we try to figure out

22
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:03,855
how to calculate the distance.

23
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,339
So the first thing we do, let's just construct

24
00:01:06,339 --> 00:01:09,428
a vector between this point that's off the plane and some

25
00:01:09,428 --> 00:01:10,800
point that's on the plane.

26
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,353
And we already have a point from the last video

27
00:01:12,353 --> 00:01:15,533
that's on the plane: x-sub-p, y-sub-p, z-sub-p.

28
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:21,270
So let's construct a vector. Let's construct this orange vector

29
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,429
that starts on the plane.

30
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:27,841
its tail is on the plane, and it goes off the plane

31
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:35,133
to this vector, to this position x-naught, y-naught, z-naught.

32
00:01:35,133 --> 00:01:39,683
So what would be, how could we specify this vector

33
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:40,751
right over here?

34
00:01:40,751 --> 00:01:43,867
Well, that vector, let me call that vector, well

35
00:01:43,867 --> 00:01:46,133
let me call that vector--what letters have I not used yet?

36
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:48,400
let me call that vector f.

37
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:54,000
Vector f is just going to be this yellow position vector

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,425
minus this green position vector.

39
00:01:56,425 --> 00:02:00,512
So it's going to be--the x component is going to be

40
00:02:00,512 --> 00:02:01,733
the difference in the x-coordinates.

41
00:02:01,733 --> 00:02:03,182
The y-coordinate is going to be the difference in the

42
00:02:03,182 --> 00:02:04,018
y-coordinates.

43
00:02:04,018 --> 00:02:08,867
It's going to be x-naught minus x-sub-p.

44
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:16,667
I subtracted the x coordinates i plus y-naught minus y-p j

45
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:21,084
plus, I'll go to the next line, plus z-naught

46
00:02:21,084 --> 00:02:23,933
minus z p k.

47
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:26,733
So fair enough. That's just some vector that comes

48
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:30,200
off of the plane and onto this point.

49
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,867
And what we want to find out is this distance.

50
00:02:34,867 --> 00:02:37,333
We want to find out this distance in yellow. The distance

51
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:40,600
that if I were to take a normal off of the plane and go straight

52
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,600
to the point. That's going to be the shortest distance.

53
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,420
And actually we can see it visually now.

54
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,603
Because, if you look at--we can actually form

55
00:02:46,603 --> 00:02:48,133
a right triangle now.

56
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:50,760
So this base of the right triangle is along the plane

57
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,333
This side is normal to the plane

58
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,102
So this is a right angle.

59
00:02:55,102 --> 00:02:56,100
And you can see

60
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,769
if I take any point, any other point on the plane,

61
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:03,867
it will form a hypotenuse on a right triangle.

62
00:03:03,867 --> 00:03:06,733
And obviously, the shortest side here, the shortest

63
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:08,267
way to get to the plane,

64
00:03:08,267 --> 00:03:09,753
is going to be this distance right here

65
00:03:09,753 --> 00:03:11,400
as opposed to the hypotenuse.

66
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,133
This side will always be shorter than that side.

67
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:17,933
So given that we know this vector here, how can we

68
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:24,684
figure out this length here in blue?

69
00:03:24,684 --> 00:03:27,842
Well, we could figure out the magnitude of this vector.

70
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:31,200
So the length of this side right here is going

71
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,000
to be the magnitude of this vector f.

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,467
That will give us this length.

73
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:38,175
But we want this blue length.

74
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:39,200
Well, we could think about it.

75
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,099
If this was some angle (I know the writing's getting small)

76
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:44,000
if this was some angle theta, we could

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,867
use some pretty straight up,

78
00:03:45,867 --> 00:03:49,933
pretty straightforward trigonometry.

79
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:52,867
If the distance under question is d, you could say

80
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:59,667
cosine of theta is equal to the adjacent side

81
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:00,667
over the hypotenuse.

82
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:06,600
or, is equal to d, d is the adjacent side, over the hypotenuse

83
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,175
Well, the hypotenuse is the magnitude of

84
00:04:08,175 --> 00:04:12,517
this vector f.

85
00:04:12,517 --> 00:04:16,348
Or we could say, the magnitude of the vector f

86
00:04:16,348 --> 00:04:18,252
times the cosine of theta

87
00:04:18,252 --> 00:04:20,333
(I'm just multiplying both sides times the magnitude

88
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,177
of vector f)

89
00:04:22,177 --> 00:04:25,533
is equal to d.

90
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:26,681
So that's still, well you might say

91
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:30,800
well, Sal, we know what f is.

92
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,604
We could figure that out.

93
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,763
We could figure out its magnitude.

94
00:04:33,763 --> 00:04:35,667
But we don't know what theta is.

95
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:38,067
How do we figure out what theta is?

96
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:40,267
And to do that, let's just think about it a little bit

97
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:44,200
This angle, this angle theta, is the same angle

98
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,733
so this distance here isn't necessarily the same as the

99
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:49,867
length of the normal vector, but it's definitely

100
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:52,432
going in the same direction.

101
00:04:52,432 --> 00:04:55,867
So this angle here is the same thing as the angle between

102
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:59,514
this vector and the normal vector.

103
00:04:59,514 --> 00:05:02,733
And so you might remember from earlier linear algebra

104
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:05,760
when we talk about the dot products of two vectors

105
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,600
it involves something with the cosine of the angle between them

106
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,867
And to make that fresh in your mind, let's divide

107
00:05:11,867 --> 00:05:14,133
let's multiply and divide

108
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:17,200
both sides, let me multiply and divide the left side

109
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,180
of this equation by the magnitude of the normal vector.

110
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,600
So I'm obviously not changing its value.

111
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm multiplying and dividing by the same number.

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,683
So I'm going to multiply by the magnitude

113
00:05:25,683 --> 00:05:26,682
of the normal vector

114
00:05:26,682 --> 00:05:31,933
and I'm going to divide by the magnitude of the normal vector.

115
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:34,200
So I'm essentially multiplying by 1.

116
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,667
So I have not changed this. But when you do it

117
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:38,467
in this, it might ring a bell

118
00:05:38,467 --> 00:05:41,000
This expression up here,

119
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,867
this expression right here

120
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:46,133
is the dot product of the normal vector

121
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:50,467
and this vector right here, f.

122
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:52,733
So this right here is the dot product.

123
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:57,000
This is n dot f up here.

124
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,422
It's equal to the product of their magnitudes times

125
00:05:59,422 --> 00:06:01,604
the cosine of the angle between them.

126
00:06:01,604 --> 00:06:03,933
So the distance, that shortest distance we care about,

127
00:06:03,933 --> 00:06:06,200
is the dot product between this vector

128
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,933
the normal vector divided by the magnitude

129
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:17,667
of the normal vector.

130
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:19,507
So let's do that. Let's take the dot product

131
00:06:19,507 --> 00:06:21,533
between the normal and this.

132
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:23,067
And we already figured out in the last video

133
00:06:23,067 --> 00:06:24,755
the normal vector.

134
00:06:24,755 --> 00:06:26,752
If you have the equation of a plane, the normal vector

135
00:06:26,752 --> 00:06:28,533
is literally, the components are just the

136
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:30,400
coefficients on the x, y, and z terms

137
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,267
So this is the normal vector right over here.

138
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,509
So let's take

139
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:34,600
let's literally take

140
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,179
the dot product.

141
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:41,845
So n dot f is going to be equal to

142
00:06:41,845 --> 00:06:46,000
A times x-naught minus x-p

143
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,020
So it's going to be equal to, I'll do that in pink

144
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,867
So it's going to be A x-naught minus A x-p

145
00:06:53,867 --> 00:06:57,681
and then, plus B times the y component here

146
00:06:57,681 --> 00:07:01,800
so plus B y-naught, I'm just distributing the B

147
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,179
minus B y-p, and then plus

148
00:07:06,179 --> 00:07:07,867
(I'll get another color here)

149
00:07:07,867 --> 00:07:11,333
C (that's too close a color)

150
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:14,467
plus C times the z component.

151
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:22,533
So, plus C z-naught minus C z-p

152
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:24,755
And all of that over the magnitude of the

153
00:07:24,755 --> 00:07:26,267
normal vector.

154
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:28,600
So what's the magnitude of the normal vector going to be?

155
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,867
It's just the square root of the normal vector

156
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,467
dotted with itself.

157
00:07:32,467 --> 00:07:35,133
So this is just each of these guys squared, added to themselves

158
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:37,067
and then take the square root.

159
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:42,067
So the square root is (and I can make a nicer looking radical

160
00:07:42,067 --> 00:07:43,533
sign than that)

161
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:47,418
So it's the square root of A-squared plus B-squared

162
00:07:47,418 --> 00:07:51,017
plus C-squared.

163
00:07:51,017 --> 00:07:52,933
Now what does this up here simplify to?

164
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:54,400
Let me just re-write this.

165
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,354
So this is the distance in question. This right here is

166
00:07:58,354 --> 00:07:59,771
equal to the distance.

167
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,512
So let's see if we can simplify it.

168
00:08:01,512 --> 00:08:03,765
So first we can take all of the terms

169
00:08:03,765 --> 00:08:05,600
with the x-naught, these are involved

170
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,178
with the point that sits off the plane

171
00:08:07,178 --> 00:08:10,104
and remember x-naught, y-naught, and z-naught sit off the plane

172
00:08:10,104 --> 00:08:18,091
so this is Ax-naught plus B y-naught plus C z-naught

173
00:08:18,091 --> 00:08:21,533
and then what are these terms equal to?

174
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:23,867
A x-p

175
00:08:23,867 --> 00:08:30,421
negative A x-p minus B y-p minus C z-p

176
00:08:30,421 --> 00:08:31,605
and if you remember up here,

177
00:08:31,605 --> 00:08:34,467
D in the equation of a plane

178
00:08:34,467 --> 00:08:36,200
D when we started in the last video

179
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,867
when we tried to figure out what the normal to a plane is

180
00:08:38,867 --> 00:08:44,000
D is this point x-p sits on the plane, D is

181
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
A x-p plus B y-p plus C z-p

182
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,853
or another way you could say it is

183
00:08:51,853 --> 00:08:57,751
negative D would be negative A (and it's just

184
00:08:57,751 --> 00:08:59,600
the difference between lower case and upper case

185
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,667
here, right. We see that lower case a is the same as this upper case A)

186
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:10,800
So it's negative A x-p minus B y-p minus C z-p

187
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,267
I'm just using what we got from the last video.

188
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:15,733
This is what D is, so negative D is just this business.

189
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:17,933
And that's exactly what we have over here.

190
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:22,271
negative A x-p, negative B y-p, negative C z-p.

191
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:26,000
So all of this term, this term, and this term,

192
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,842
simplifies to a minus D.

193
00:09:28,842 --> 00:09:32,933
And remember, this negative capital D, this is the

194
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:34,867
D from the equation of the plane

195
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:37,133
NOT the distance d.

196
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:39,500
So this is the numerator of our distance

197
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,267
and then the denominator of our distance

198
00:09:41,267 --> 00:09:46,768
is just the square root of A-squared plus B-squared

199
00:09:46,768 --> 00:09:48,267
plus C-squared.

200
00:09:48,267 --> 00:09:49,764
And we're done!

201
00:09:49,764 --> 00:09:52,333
This tells us the distance between any point and a plane

202
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,600
And this is a pretty intuitive formula here.

203
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,733
Because all we're doing--

204
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:58,355
if we have some

205
00:09:58,355 --> 00:10:00,267
Let me give you an example.

206
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:09,467
If I have the plane 1x minus 2y plus 3z is equal to five

207
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:11,103
so that's some plane.

208
00:10:11,103 --> 00:10:15,000
and let me pick some point that's not on the plane

209
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:23,333
So let's say I have the point 2,3, (and let me make sure

210
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,133
this is not on the plane

211
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:29,400
so it's 2 minus six is negative, yes, let me just pick

212
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,200
a random 1. So this is definitely not on the plane

213
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,867
because we have 2 minus six plus 3, that gives us negative 1

214
00:10:37,867 --> 00:10:40,533
which is not 5, so this is definitely not on the plane)

215
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:43,355
We can find the distance between this point and the plane

216
00:10:43,355 --> 00:10:45,352
using the formula we just derived.

217
00:10:45,352 --> 00:10:48,133
We literally just evaluate it at

218
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:49,800
so this will just be

219
00:10:49,800 --> 00:11:04,184
1 times 2 minus 2 times (I'm going to fill it in)

220
00:11:04,184 --> 00:11:09,467
plus 3 times something minus 5

221
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:11,939
All of that over (and I haven't put these guys in,

222
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:13,588
let me do that right now)

223
00:11:13,588 --> 00:11:19,667
So 1 times 2 minus 2 times 3 plus 3 times 1

224
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:22,533
minus 5 (kind of bringing it over to the left hand side)

225
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:27,533
all of that over the square root

226
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:32,533
of 1 squared (which is 1) plus negative 2 squared (which is 4)

227
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:36,133
plus 3 squared (which is 9)

228
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:38,015
so it's going to be equal to

229
00:11:38,015 --> 00:11:44,000
let's see, this is 2 minus 6 (or negative 6)

230
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,067
and then you have plus 3, minus 5

231
00:11:48,067 --> 00:11:52,333
so this is what, this is 5, 2 plus 3 is 5

232
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,200
minus 5, so those two just cancel out

233
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,467
so this is negative 6 over

234
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,467
the square root of 5 plus 9 is 14

235
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:04,184
over the square root of 14.

236
00:12:04,184 --> 00:12:06,533
And you're done.

237
00:12:06,533 --> 99:59:59,999
So hopefully you find that useful and hopefully you can apply that in other example problems
