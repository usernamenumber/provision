1
00:00:00,137 --> 00:00:02,059
What is BD?

2
00:00:02,059 --> 00:00:03,668
So, when they're just saying BD,

3
00:00:03,668 --> 00:00:06,602
they're saying literally the length of segment BD.

4
00:00:06,602 --> 00:00:11,205
So they're saying the length from point B to point D.

5
00:00:11,205 --> 00:00:14,428
And B is sitting here at negative two, D here is at five,

6
00:00:14,428 --> 00:00:18,680
so you're looking at really the distance between negative two and five.

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,014
So you literally could just say,

8
00:00:20,014 --> 00:00:24,012
Well, that's gonna be five (that's kind of our endpoint), minus negative two,

9
00:00:24,012 --> 00:00:29,003
so five minus negative two is the same thing as five plus two, or seven.

10
00:00:29,003 --> 00:00:31,429
Another way, you could literally just count it out.

11
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:39,795
Count out the distance: you go 1, 2, to get to zero; 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, to get all the way to five.

12
00:00:39,795 --> 00:00:40,567
Or, you could say,

13
00:00:40,567 --> 00:00:45,137
Look, I gotta go two to the right just to get to zero,

14
00:00:45,137 --> 00:00:48,137
and I gotta go five more to the right to get to D,

15
00:00:48,137 --> 00:00:50,071
so that's going to be seven.

16
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:52,512
Let's do a couple more.

17
00:00:52,512 --> 00:00:54,348
What is BD, again?

18
00:00:54,348 --> 00:00:55,870
Well, here we're going from one to four.

19
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,982
The distance between one and four is three.

20
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:02,604
And then, let's do one more.

21
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,347
What is AD?

22
00:01:04,347 --> 00:01:08,737
So, A is at negative five, D is all the way at four.

23
00:01:08,737 --> 00:01:14,205
So, we're going from negative five to zero, which is five, and then we're gonna go four more.

24
00:01:14,205 --> 00:01:16,348
Five plus four is nine.

25
00:01:16,348 --> 00:01:17,269
Or, you could say,

26
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:19,936
Look, we start at negative five, we end up at four.

27
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:23,936
Four minus negative five is the same thing as four plus five, which is nine.
