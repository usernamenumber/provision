1
00:00:00,335 --> 00:00:02,743
We've already talked a lot about plate boundaries

2
00:00:02,743 --> 00:00:09,546
where essentially new crust material is being created and the plates are actually moving apart -

3
00:00:09,546 --> 00:00:15,336
we call these divergent boundaries, and the example we showed of this was the Mid-Atlantic Ridge

4
00:00:15,336 --> 00:00:19,199
where essentially new crustal material is being created.

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,151
Now, on the other side of the equation you have areas where plates are ramming into each other.

6
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:28,807
We see that over here where the Nazca plate is running into the South American plate.

7
00:00:28,807 --> 00:00:38,466
We see it over here where the Pacific plate is running into the Filipino plate - they're running into each other.

8
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:43,384
So what happens over there? So what we're gonna do is just go through the different scenarios.

9
00:00:43,384 --> 00:00:48,121
The general idea is that one plate is going to get subducted under another.

10
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:52,446
Tthey're ramming into each other, one is going to get essentially pushed under the other one.

11
00:00:52,446 --> 00:00:55,412
This diagram shows some subduction over here.

12
00:00:55,412 --> 00:01:00,158
Tthis is essentially an oceanic plate being subducted under another oceanic plate,

13
00:01:00,158 --> 00:01:06,134
so not too different than what might happen when the Pacific plate runs into the Filipino plate

14
00:01:06,134 --> 00:01:09,954
right over here, then on this side of the diagram

15
00:01:09,954 --> 00:01:18,069
we see an oceanic plate and the oceanic crust getting subducted under a continental plate, right over here.

16
00:01:18,069 --> 00:01:24,126
And this is what's happening when the Nazca plate is getting subducted under the South American plate

17
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:26,238
and when that happens you have a couple of things

18
00:01:26,238 --> 00:01:29,383
so you have the oceanic plate being pushed under

19
00:01:29,383 --> 00:01:36,010
and what happens at the same time the continental plate gets pushed upwards causing mountain ranges like The Andes

20
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:39,674
and that's exactly what causes - what has created The Andes,

21
00:01:39,674 --> 00:01:46,953
it's the upward force from the Nazca plate being pushed under the South American plate at that coast line.

22
00:01:46,953 --> 00:01:52,956
And what you're also going to see is, and if you can imagine you have these huge plates grinding past each other,

23
00:01:52,956 --> 00:01:59,628
it's not a very smooth process, every now and then you reach a breaking point where hug amount of energy

24
00:01:59,628 --> 00:02:03,823
get released so you're also going to see a lot of earthquakes in those areas

25
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:06,878
and we know that Chile has a lot of earthquakes.

26
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:10,538
And then on top of that, this is going to result in a lot of heat

27
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:14,472
and a lot of friction of the plates grinding past each other

28
00:02:14,472 --> 00:02:20,960
essentially allowing magma to form at that part of the rock

29
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,625
and because it's getting so heated you also have volcanoes in these areas

30
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:30,829
where essentially something is being subducted underneath a continental plate.

31
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:33,939
Now, we also talked about what's happening in the Pacific

32
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:38,602
where we have the Pacific plate being subducted under the Filipino plate.

33
00:02:38,602 --> 00:02:41,812
That's what we keep referring to over here.

34
00:02:41,812 --> 00:02:44,266
And that's doing a couple of interesting things.

35
00:02:44,266 --> 00:02:46,410
So whenever you have subduction, you have trenches.

36
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,279
But it's most interesting - or at least in my mind

37
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:54,899
that the deepest trenches have been created where you have an oceanic plate being subducted under another oceanic plate.

38
00:02:54,899 --> 00:02:56,909
So a couple of things are going to happen.

39
00:02:56,909 --> 00:03:01,087
You're going to have deep trenches form,

40
00:03:01,087 --> 00:03:04,282
over here you see in this diagram we also have a trench and the first example,

41
00:03:04,282 --> 00:03:08,673
but you have trenches form where one oceanic plate is being subducted under another

42
00:03:08,673 --> 00:03:12,406
and then you have that same type of friction that you saw over here create volcanoes

43
00:03:12,406 --> 00:03:15,812
and those volcanoes will initially be underwater volcanoes

44
00:03:15,812 --> 00:03:23,003
since these are both oceanic plates, or we're dealing with oceanic crust at that point of the plate,

45
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,939
it doesn't have to be entirely and oceanic plate,

46
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:27,407
and there'll first be underwater volcanoes

47
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:32,141
but as the lave piles up and hardens, it'll eventually turn into a group of islands.

48
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:37,474
And we've had that happening where the Pacific plate runs into the Filipino plate

49
00:03:37,474 --> 00:03:39,070
and first we have the trench,

50
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,569
let me just draw everything right here.

51
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:45,491
So, this is the boundary, roughly, roughly speaking

52
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,343
this is the boundary between the two plates

53
00:03:47,343 --> 00:03:51,937
the Pacific plate and the Filipino plate right over here.

54
00:03:51,937 --> 00:03:55,320
And where it's being subducted you have the Mariana Trench

55
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,968
which is the deepest trench in the world!

56
00:03:57,968 --> 00:04:04,151
It goes down 11 km - eleven thousand metres!

57
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:06,891
That's deeper than Mount Everest is high.

58
00:04:06,891 --> 00:04:09,492
Mt Everest is about 9,000 metres high.

59
00:04:09,492 --> 00:04:12,737
And we'll see that's also due to another convergent plate boundary,

60
00:04:12,737 --> 00:04:15,288
another plate boundary where plates are running into each other.

61
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,736
So not only do you see the Mariana Trench here

62
00:04:17,736 --> 00:04:20,173
because one plate is being subducted under the other,

63
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:22,989
you see the formation of the Mariana Islands

64
00:04:22,989 --> 00:04:25,813
which were essentially created from underwater volcanoes

65
00:04:25,813 --> 00:04:28,606
because of all of the energy being released.

66
00:04:28,606 --> 00:04:34,670
And this is actually a depiction of what's the subduction that's happening at the Mariana Trench.

67
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:38,066
You have the subduction over here then you have the Mriana Islands being created

68
00:04:38,066 --> 00:04:42,615
by essentially the enrgy causing magma and lava,

69
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:46,383
essentially magma before it surfaces, to flow on the top

70
00:04:46,383 --> 00:04:49,495
and as lava just goes and starts building these islands.

71
00:04:49,495 --> 00:04:52,290
Now, the last type of convergent boundary

72
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:57,139
is when you have two parts of continetal crust running into each other.

73
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:04,222
So that's the situation that we have when the Indian plate is running into the Euroasian plate,

74
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:06,782
I think you might already guess what's going to happen there.

75
00:05:06,782 --> 00:05:09,686
When you have two pieces of continetnal crust running into each other,

76
00:05:09,686 --> 00:05:12,496
one is more or less dense that the other.

77
00:05:12,496 --> 00:05:15,679
And so at least the crustal portions on them

78
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:19,969
are just going keep jamming into each other.

79
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:22,018
And so they're just going to push things up.

80
00:05:22,018 --> 00:05:25,689
This is a depiction righ here that I got from the USGS.

81
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:31,277
And what's kind of depicting it - this is the Indian plate, this is the Euroasian plate,

82
00:05:31,277 --> 00:05:35,946
this is if you rewind a good bit before they really had the chance to jam into each other.

83
00:05:35,946 --> 00:05:39,936
But as they're jamming into each other, the Indian plate is kind of digging in a little bit,

84
00:05:39,936 --> 00:05:43,687
not being fully subducted, and it's causing the land to rise.

85
00:05:43,687 --> 00:05:49,799
And that essentially ends up with something like the Himalayas.

86
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:55,483
This right here is a picture of Mount Everest which is almost 9,000 metres high,

87
00:05:55,483 --> 00:05:58,206
9,000 metres above sea level.

88
00:05:58,206 --> 00:06:02,206
So, it's almost as high as the Mariana Trench is deep.
