1
00:00:00,933 --> 00:00:02,600
Let's continue with the story of

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,400
Pete's mutual fund.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,000
The year goes by,

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,600
and then even after paying Pete the 1%,

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,333
so we had $500 of assets under management

6
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:13,467
this whole assets under management

7
00:00:13,467 --> 00:00:15,533
a year later goes to,

8
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:18,133
let's say it goes to, like I mention at the end of the last video,

9
00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:22,733
$1,000, so Pete either is really good, or really lucky,

10
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:24,667
or a little bit of both.

11
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:32,058
So now it is at $1,000,

12
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:34,266
and it still has the same five investors here,

13
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:36,827
and I am lucky enough to be one of them.

14
00:00:36,827 --> 00:00:39,590
So here are the five investors,

15
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,867
let me draw the shares, so there is one,

16
00:00:41,867 --> 00:00:42,921
two, three,

17
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:46,928
four, five shares.

18
00:00:46,928 --> 00:00:49,467
Now, each of these shares,

19
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:51,136
well the $1,000 is called the NAV,

20
00:00:51,136 --> 00:00:53,133
or the net asset value,

21
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:56,123
let me give you that piece of terminology,

22
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:58,733
it just means net asset value.

23
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:00,600
So there is an NAV per share,

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,867
the NAV per share over here is $200,

25
00:01:03,867 --> 00:01:07,400
I just took the total NAV and I divided it by the shares.

26
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,800
And what's special about an open ended mutual fund

27
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,236
is that the close, or end of every day,

28
00:01:13,236 --> 00:01:16,336
either new shares can be removed from the fund,

29
00:01:16,336 --> 00:01:18,733
or be created before the fund.

30
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:20,200
So, in the first video,

31
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,133
I showed how I wanted to buy into the fund,

32
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:23,467
so I bought a share, and that increased the NAV,

33
00:01:23,467 --> 00:01:26,541
and it also increased the number of shares,

34
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:28,514
he had to create a share for me to buy,

35
00:01:28,514 --> 00:01:31,067
he didn't sell me a share that already existed,

36
00:01:31,067 --> 00:01:32,973
so you can imagine after this type of performance

37
00:01:32,973 --> 00:01:35,667
more people would want to buy shares,

38
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:37,710
so now they would have buy in,

39
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,733
to make things fair,

40
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:39,985
at $200 per share

41
00:01:39,985 --> 00:01:42,400
because that's the current NAV per share,

42
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,533
so lets say that five more people want to buy in at

43
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:47,508
$200 per share,

44
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:50,388
so what Pete would do, or what this mutual fund,

45
00:01:50,388 --> 00:01:52,895
its not Pete really, its the corporation,

46
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:55,496
it would creat five new shares.

47
00:01:55,496 --> 00:01:58,190
So, one, two,

48
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:02,133
three, four, five, if there was only one person that day

49
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:03,533
it would create one share that day,

50
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:04,784
if there were ten people that day,

51
00:02:04,784 --> 00:02:06,400
it would create ten shares that day,

52
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,872
and it can keep doing this,

53
00:02:07,872 --> 00:02:09,267
and the NAV of each of these are

54
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:10,682
$200.

55
00:02:10,682 --> 00:02:13,200
So it gives these shares to each of these people,

56
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,978
and they have to contribute $200,

57
00:02:14,978 --> 00:02:16,133
so essentially,

58
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:21,400
it puts another $1,000 into the pool, that Pete can now manage,

59
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,133
and so now the total NAV for the fund is $2,000 now

60
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:29,328
and Pete will get his 1% management fee

61
00:02:29,328 --> 00:02:33,043
off of this entire $2,000.

62
00:02:33,043 --> 00:02:36,502
Now, lets say we fast forward a little bit,

63
00:02:36,502 --> 00:02:38,667
we fast forward a little bit to,

64
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:41,200
lets say Pete starts having a not so good year,

65
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,667
so lets say we fast forward a year past that,

66
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:47,834
and Pete has a negative 10% return.

67
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,970
So if you started at $2,000,

68
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,933
and that's when you include taking his management fee out,

69
00:02:52,933 --> 00:02:54,777
you started at $2,000,

70
00:02:54,777 --> 00:02:57,000
you lose 10% in one year,

71
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,800
so it goes down to $1,800.

72
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,533
Let me put this in a new color,

73
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:04,181
so now he's at $1,800.

74
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:06,456
It's not completely drawn to scale,

75
00:03:06,456 --> 00:03:08,523
but hopefully you will get the idea.

76
00:03:08,523 --> 00:03:11,733
So now he is at $1,800,

77
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:15,867
$1800, but you still have a total of ten shares,

78
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:20,267
you still have a total of ten shares,

79
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:21,388
let me draw,

80
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:24,133
or let me do my best to draw, the ten shares.

81
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:26,533
One, two, three,

82
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:28,469
four, five, six,

83
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:31,467
seven, eight, nine, ten.

84
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:33,507
These should be at equal size,

85
00:03:33,507 --> 00:03:38,533
and now the NAV per share is going to be

86
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:40,172
$1,800 divided by 10,

87
00:03:40,172 --> 00:03:42,133
or $180.

88
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:44,792
And lets say, that I get a little freaked out,

89
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,667
by this recent performance,

90
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:48,400
and I have some other commitments with my money,

91
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:48,900
so I say,

92
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,767
Pete,

93
00:03:49,767 --> 00:03:52,067
you need to buy my one share back from me,

94
00:03:52,067 --> 00:03:53,871
so what Pete does,

95
00:03:53,871 --> 00:03:56,133
is he would give me back $180,

96
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:59,933
so the total NAV would lose $180,

97
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:01,800
so it would go down $180,

98
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,067
so we would take this out of it,

99
00:04:04,067 --> 00:04:09,938
$1,800-$180 is $1,620,

100
00:04:09,938 --> 00:04:12,600
and they would buy back a share from me.

101
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,400
So they would cancel one of the shares, but notice,

102
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,649
the NAV per share does not change,

103
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,367
by me redeeming my share,

104
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:21,733
it does not change what happens to everyone else,

105
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:23,733
now you have $1,620, divided by

106
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:25,733
nine shares,

107
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:31,047
that should still get you $180 per share,

108
00:04:31,047 --> 00:04:32,533
if I did my math right,

109
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:35,600
so $1,800 minus $180 gets you $1,620,

110
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,733
it should still be $180 per share,

111
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:40,381
but this is the nature of an open ended fund,

112
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:43,400
you can keep creating shares and selling them to the public

113
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,733
to raise more money,

114
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:46,667
or when someone wants their money back,

115
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:48,933
you essentially buy the share back from them,

116
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:50,600
give them their money,

117
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,333
when you buy it back, and you remove that share.

118
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,709
So an open ended fund,

119
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:55,706
really at the close of every trading day,

120
00:04:55,706 --> 00:04:57,333
can keep growing or shrinking,

121
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,467
it can keep adding more and more investors,

122
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:01,667
or their investors can take their money back.

123
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:03,400
What's difficult about this,

124
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,389
from the fund manager's point of view,

125
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:07,107
is that they have to manage this,

126
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:10,846
they have to manage this constant buying and selling with the public,

127
00:05:10,846 --> 00:05:12,067
they have to manage the paper work,

128
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:13,260
and if you think about it,

129
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,652
they can't have all of their money invested,

130
00:05:15,652 --> 00:05:18,000
in relatively illiquid assets,

131
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,400
or even in regular stocks,

132
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,067
they have to keep some amount of their money,

133
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:23,200
and it is usually 3 to 5%,

134
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,076
they have to keep some of this $2,000,

135
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,133
they have to keep some of it in cash.

136
00:05:29,133 --> 00:05:30,722
and from an investor's point of view,

137
00:05:30,722 --> 00:05:31,222
they would say,

138
00:05:31,222 --> 00:05:33,253
well if I'm good at investing, I should try to minimize

139
00:05:33,253 --> 00:05:34,933
the amount of cash that I have,

140
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:36,457
because I am not getting a return on cash,

141
00:05:36,457 --> 00:05:37,800
but because it is open ended,

142
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,600
because investors might come by and say,

143
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,933
hey, I want my money,

144
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:44,067
you have to have a little amount of cash on hand

145
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:45,133
as part of the asset pool,

146
00:05:45,133 --> 99:59:59,999
in order to buy people's shares back.
