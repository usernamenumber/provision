1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,890
   

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,140
[MUSIC PLAYING]

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,690
   

4
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:10,060
What I want to do in this video
is talk a little bit

5
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:15,400
about traditional IRA's.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,040
And IRA stands for Individual
Retirement Account.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:29,460
   

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,900
And the focus in this video
is the traditional IRA.

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,820
You'll hear of other types of
IRA's, especially Roth IRA's

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,650
and SEP IRA's, but this is
only on traditional.

11
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,880
The gist of all of them is
really it's the governments

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,760
way of encouraging you to save
for your retirement.

13
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,100
But they all have slightly
different details, so I'm just

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,610
going to focus on the
traditional right now.

15
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:56,750
So let's say we are
in the year 0.

16
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,690
That's right now instead
of year 0, let

17
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:00,640
me write right now.

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,530
And you have two options, you
could take advantage of the

19
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:09,740
traditional IRA, so this
is the IRA scenario.

20
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:14,920
And this is the no
IRA scenario.

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,230
Now, an IRA allows you to put up
to a certain amount of your

22
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,010
income aside.

23
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,700
Now depending on your age and
what year it is, that amount

24
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,510
will change.

25
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:32,360
But in 2010 that number
is $5,000 if you're

26
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:38,620
under the age of 50.

27
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,740
And it's $6,000-- this is for
an individual, not for a

28
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:52,530
family-- and it's $6,000 if
you're over the age of 50.

29
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,360
I guess the rationale was
probably gee, if you're over

30
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,200
the age of 50, you better save
even more for your retirement,

31
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,520
which might only be 10
or 15 years away.

32
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,540
So they give a little bit more
leeway for over the age of 50.

33
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,840
So let's say we're under the
age of 50 and we take full

34
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:14,290
advantage of this IRA, so
we set aside $5,000.

35
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,610
Here we set aside nothing.

36
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:20,760
   

37
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,930
Now in the very short term,
the advantage is that this

38
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:28,330
$5,000 of our income
will not be taxed.

39
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:38,240
So let's say that I'm in
the 32% tax bracket.

40
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,702
Let me write that on the
side because it will

41
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:41,720
apply to both scenarios.

42
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:48,580
32% tax bracket today, because
I'm making some good money.

43
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,350
   

44
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,970
So if on the $5,000 only-- I'm
only talking about the taxes

45
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,990
on the $5,000, you're going to
have to pay taxes above and

46
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,690
beyond that on the rest of your
income-- but today, I'm

47
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:03,050
going to pay zero taxes
on that $5,000.

48
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:10,360
So zero taxes on the $5,000.

49
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,950
Now if I don't set aside that
$5,000 into an IRA, then I

50
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,060
will have to pay taxes
on that $5,000.

51
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:25,570
So I'm going to have to pay
$5,000 times 32%, which is

52
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:30,650
equal to what-- I'll just get
the calculator out-- so you

53
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:39,660
get $5,000 times 0.32 is equal
to $1,600 in taxes.

54
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:49,880
So I'm going to pay $1,600
in taxes today.

55
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,320
So in the year that I actually
made that $5,000.

56
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,920
Now I can't set aside $5,000
if I made less than $5,000.

57
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:02,340
It's always the lower of your
income or these IRA limits.

58
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,030
And, of course, you're going
to pay, even in this

59
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,570
situation, let's say you made
a $100,000, when you put the

60
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,450
$5,000 aside, you're still
going to have to

61
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,050
pay taxes on $95,000.

62
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,280
In this situation, where you
didn't put the $5,000 aside,

63
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,790
you're going to have to
pay taxes on $100,000.

64
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,310
So you're going to pay
taxes on the extra

65
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,610
$5,000, which is $1,600.

66
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:28,450
Now, let's say in either
situation with that $5,000 you

67
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:33,030
want to buy and sell some
securities or some

68
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,650
investments.

69
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,400
So let's say right after you put
it in the IRA account, so

70
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,920
now everything is sitting in
our IRA account, all of our

71
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,630
transactions are sitting in this
special IRA account right

72
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,620
here, where we can actually buy
and sell investments and

73
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,250
trade them, but we can't cash
them in and turn them into

74
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,040
cash and then spend
it on a new car or

75
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,850
something like that.

76
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,910
So and if we did do that before
the age of 59 and 1/2,

77
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,390
we'd have to pay a penalty.

78
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,380
So let me write that down.

79
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,160
You might immediately say hey,
gee, this is a good deal.

80
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,990
Why doesn't everyone
always do it?

81
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,720
Well the answer is, when I pull
it out before 59 and 1/2,

82
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,230
I pay a penalty.

83
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,070
Let me write this down, because
that's important to

84
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,970
keep in mind.

85
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:29,910
Pay penalty and taxes if
withdrawn before 59 and 1/2.

86
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,880
And once again, this is
the traditional IRA.

87
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,450
The Roth IRA, for example, is a
little bit more flexible on

88
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:39,140
the actual principal amount that
you put into the account.

89
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,780
But we're just dealing with the
traditional, so this is an

90
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,980
important thing to
keep in mind.

91
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,200
This is kind of the tradeoff
that you're giving.

92
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,850
So the government is saying,
hey, I'm getting you an

93
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,590
incentive to put this aside, and
I really want to make sure

94
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:51,560
that you leave this aside until
you are ready to retire.

95
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,280
So you don't get tempted when
you see a nice sports car to

96
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,480
cash in your IRA and use it,
because you're going to have

97
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,610
to pay a penalty.

98
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,120
But as long as you don't
actually withdraw it and turn

99
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,030
into cash, you can actually
buy and sell

100
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,680
securities within that IRA.

101
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,500
So let's say as soon as you
put that $5,000, you buy

102
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:18,940
$5,000 of stock A.

103
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,690
Here we don't have $5,000
anymore, we only have $3,400

104
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,350
of our original amount.

105
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:33,610
So we buy $3,400 of stock A.

106
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:41,090
And let's say, I don't know,
10 years in the future--

107
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:45,320
that's going to be in either
situation-- let's say that

108
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,580
stock A has doubled.

109
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:54,330
So in 10 years and you sell
it, you have $10,000 here.

110
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:59,640
You have $10,000
from sale of A.

111
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,520
It's doubled.

112
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,090
Here it's doubled, but you only
had $3,400 of stock A, so

113
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,180
now that $3,400 is
worth $6,800.

114
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:15,800
So you have $6,800
from sale of A.

115
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,980
And let's say you want to put
that into another stock.

116
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,185
So let's say you put that
all into stock B.

117
00:07:22,185 --> 00:07:24,630
And I'm painting a very rosy
picture, you can't always

118
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,840
ensure that stocks
will double.

119
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,420
And then so you buy $10,000
in this situation.

120
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:34,870
$10,000 of B and well,
I'll hold off there.

121
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,630
So you buy $10,000 of B.

122
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:40,220
And here you might say oh, I'm
going to buy $6,800 of B, but

123
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:45,080
because you are not operating
within an IRA account, you're

124
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,600
going to have to pay taxes on
the capital gains from this

125
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,530
right here.

126
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:54,150
So capital gains are gains made
from capital investments.

127
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,150
In this case, the capital
investment is

128
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,470
investing in stocks.

129
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:01,080
And since you owned your stock
for more than one year, you at

130
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,030
least will only have to pay
long-term capital gains, which

131
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,460
tends to be lower than
short-term capital gains.

132
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:18,670
So in this situation, you
made $3,400 profit.

133
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:22,170
You're going to have to
pay 15% capital gains.

134
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:26,540
Times 15%.

135
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,240
Let's get the calculator
out again.

136
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,450
So $3,400 times 0.15.

137
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:42,890
It's $510, you're going
to have to pay $510.

138
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:47,450
So you take your $6,800,
pay $510 to the IRS.

139
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:57,110
You're going to be
left with $6,290.

140
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,100
Remember, the reason why you
have to pay taxes is this is

141
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,230
not operating inside
of an IRA.

142
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,730
Here you are operating inside
of an IRA, so you don't have

143
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,000
to pay taxes.

144
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,780
Now let's say you invest in
stock B and then over the next

145
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,235
10 years, stock B
also doubles.

146
00:09:09,235 --> 00:09:13,900
   

147
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:18,470
So stock B is now worth $20,000
and you sell it

148
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:23,680
from sale of B.

149
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,120
And once again it's sitting
inside of your IRA, so you

150
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,440
don't have to pay any
capital gains on it.

151
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,270
Now, in this situation, you use
that $6,290 to also invest

152
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:42,330
in stock B and, after 10 years,
stock B doubles, so it

153
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:47,480
is now $12,580.

154
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,180
But once again, it's sitting
outside of your IRA, you have

155
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,840
to pay 15% capital gains.

156
00:09:52,840 --> 00:10:02,590
You had a $6,290
gain times 15%.

157
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,700
Let's see what that is.

158
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,030
Let's get the calculator.

159
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,160
Where's my calculator?

160
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,100
There it is.

161
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:17,310
So you have $6,290 times
15% is equal to $943.

162
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:30,330
And let me take that from
my $12,580 minus 943.5.

163
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:41,020
So I have $11,636.

164
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,020
Let's say 20 years have passed,
we're now over the age

165
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:49,550
of 59 and 1/2, we can now
withdraw from our IRA.

166
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,070
Now, of course, this situation,
this is cash that

167
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,760
we have. We can do
anything with it.

168
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,540
Maybe we're now over 60 years
old, this could be used for

169
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,810
our retirement for our
everyday expenses.

170
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,880
Now this money that was sitting
in an IRA, now that

171
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,770
we're over the age of 60, or
over 59 and 1/2, if you want

172
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,130
to be particular.

173
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:11,520
Now that we're over 60 we can
withdraw the IRA without

174
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,020
paying any penalty, but we
will have to pay taxes.

175
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:22,650
So we're going to withdraw, no
penalties, but we will have to

176
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,930
pay taxes, but the huge
advantage here is once we're

177
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:28,090
over 60, we're probably earning
less money, so the

178
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,150
actual tax bracket
that we're in is

179
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,820
probably going to be lower.

180
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,680
So let's say we're in
a 25% tax bracket.

181
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,370
Remember, when we first made
that $5,000, we were in a 32%

182
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:44,280
tax bracket, because we were
this young gun at the peak of

183
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,780
his or her career making
a lot of money.

184
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,020
Now we're making less money,
we're starting to live off of

185
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,860
our savings.

186
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,470
So we have to pay 25%
income tax on it.

187
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,820
So if we pay 25% on $20,000--
Remember, now we're actually

188
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,280
withdrawing it.

189
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,240
We're actually putting it into
our checking account so we can

190
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,450
spend it for living
or whatever we

191
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,760
want to do with it.

192
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:08,410
So 25% of $20,000 is equal
to $5,000 in taxes.

193
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:16,820
So we will be left with $15,000
to do anything that we

194
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,860
want with it.

195
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,940
Now, compare this.

196
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:23,260
This is $15,000 versus
$11,636.

197
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:26,610
And everything we did was
completely identical, except

198
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:31,690
for over here we took
the $5,000 and

199
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,330
invested within an IRA.

200
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:37,220
Here, we took the $5,000, we
had to pay taxes on it.

201
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,170
Then we invested it in the exact
same way-- we actually

202
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,710
made very good stock
investments in both

203
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:45,890
situations-- and we ended
up with a significant

204
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,890
less amount of money.

205
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,620
I mean, this is a $15,000 verses
$11,000, that's almost

206
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,780
a-- what is that?-- a
30-something percent

207
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,940
difference in the total amount
of money we have.

208
00:12:54,940 --> 00:13:00,640
And not only that, but this tax
we have to pay, this is

209
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,540
only a situation where you
have a 25% tax rate.

210
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,490
When you're retired, you might
even have a lower tax rate

211
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,090
than that, and it's deferred
a good bit.

212
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,670
But the real thing to think
about is just, 20 years in the

213
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:13,130
future, you're sitting on
$15,000, versus, if you didn't

214
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,580
participate in an IRA, you're
sitting on only

215
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,150
a little over $11,500.

216
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:21,560
And of course, the main tradeoff
here is that in the

217
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,950
IRA situation, you really
couldn't touch your money.

218
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,270
So if you had an emergency, and
you have to withdraw the

219
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:31,690
money, you would have had
to pay penalties on it.

220
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:32,940
