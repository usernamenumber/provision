00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,533
so ill tell you ahead of time this problem is no joke but if we do it step by step

2
00:00:08,533 --> 00:00:10,733
its actually not to bad but its not an easy problem so don't

3
00:00:10,733 --> 00:00:13,200
get too discouraged if you kind of don't know where to start with this one

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:01:06,533
(reading problem)

5
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:16,400
this sum right here is this is the sum of the absolute value of the imaginary parts

6
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,133
of the square of the roots

7
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:22,133
b sub k is the imaginary part

8
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:24,933
of the square of root k
