1
00:00:00,871 --> 00:00:02,636
In this video we will look at the classification

2
00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:04,572
and nomenclature of alcohols.

3
00:00:04,572 --> 00:00:09,619
So here we have generic alcohol up the top and have an alcule group on the left.

4
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:13,303
and have an OH on the right which is called a hydroxyl group.

5
00:00:13,303 --> 00:00:16,173
Lets look at the classification of our alcohol so

6
00:00:16,173 --> 00:00:20,176
If I have a carbon bonded to an OH and that carbon

7
00:00:20,176 --> 00:00:23,637
is bonded to one other carbon in this alcule group here

8
00:00:23,637 --> 00:00:27,219
that said to be primary alcohol.

9
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:31,902
This carbon over here is bonded to two carbons in those two alcule groups so

10
00:00:31,902 --> 00:00:37,793
it is therefore secondary alcohol.and

11
00:00:37,793 --> 00:00:39,536
then this carbon over here on the right is bonded to three other carbons

12
00:00:39,536 --> 00:00:42,286
so it is said to be tertiary alcohol.

13
00:00:42,286 --> 00:00:48,636
Lets take a look at the nomenclature of alcohols.lets start with a simple molecules here.

14
00:00:48,636 --> 00:00:53,287
So if i had a molecule look like that i wanted to name it using iupac nomenclature

15
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:58,714
I want to number my carbon chain to give that a away a lowest number possible

16
00:00:58,714 --> 00:01:00,639
so therefore this carbon we get number 1

17
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:02,619
this carbon we get number 2 and for this carbon number 3.

18
00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:10,237
now that weren't there we would have 3 carbon alkane which we call propane.

19
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:14,237
but since we have our OH there this is actually an alcohol

20
00:01:14,237 --> 00:01:18,636
and alcohol is gonna have the OL endin so this is called propanol.

21
00:01:18,636 --> 00:01:24,896
so go ahead and write propanol here.

22
00:01:24,896 --> 00:01:30,168
so OH group is coming off of carbon 1 so we are gonna say this is 1 propanol like that .

23
00:01:30,168 --> 00:01:32,770
how we classify this alcohol.

24
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:42,120
well the carbon right here is bonded to the OH that carbon is bonded to one other carbon

25
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,122
so this would be a primary alcohol.

26
00:01:45,122 --> 00:01:49,769
so one propanol is a primary alcohol in terms of its classification.

27
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:53,830
lets look at similar looking molecule

28
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:58,369
still 3 carbon but this time we put the OH on the carbon in the middle there.

29
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:01,921
so once again we are going to number it this is

30
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:04,636
carbon 1,this carbon 2,and this is carbon 3

31
00:02:04,636 --> 00:02:08,539
3 carbon alcohol those also called propanol.

32
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:13,127
The difference is the hydroxy group is on different carbon.

33
00:02:13,127 --> 00:02:18,239
right its now on carbon 2.so we are gonna go and write 2 propanol here .which is the iupack name

34
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,970
which is also called isopropanol,rubbing alcohol all the same stuff.

35
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:25,971
but 2 propanol would be iupack nomenclature.

36
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:29,325
how would you classify 2 propanol

37
00:02:29,325 --> 00:02:33,314
so once again we find the carbon attached to OH this one how many carbons

38
00:02:33,314 --> 00:02:41,238
attached to .attached to 1 and 2 other carbon.so therefore this is a secondary

39
00:02:41,238 --> 00:02:47,239
alcohol.so we have an example of primary alcohol and secondary alcohol here.

40
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:53,578
lets do a little more complicated nomenclature question.

41
00:02:53,578 --> 00:02:59,194
so lets go ahead and draw out larger molecule with more substituents.so

42
00:02:59,194 --> 00:03:06,433
lets put an OH here and lets do something like that and lets go ahead and do that as well.

43
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:11,702
so give the full iupack name for this molecule.

44
00:03:11,702 --> 00:03:16,970
so you want to find the largest carbon chain that includes the OH.

45
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:25,195
and you want to give the OH the lowest number possible.so that gonna mean you are gonna start here

46
00:03:25,195 --> 00:03:29,384
and make this carbon number 1 .so thats carbon number 1

47
00:03:29,384 --> 00:03:37,201
this must be carbon number 2,3,4.5,6 and 7.

48
00:03:37,201 --> 00:03:48,383
So we have a 7 carbon alcohol so 7 carbon alcohol be heptanol so we can start naming this make sure to give us plenty of space here so heptanol

49
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:55,596
and we know that the OH is coming off of carbon 2 so we can go ahead and write 2-heptanol

50
00:03:55,596 --> 00:03:58,107
like that.lets look at the other substituentes that we have.

51
00:03:58,107 --> 00:04:05,302
well what do we have right here coming off of our ring thats a 3 carbon alcule group

52
00:04:05,302 --> 00:04:15,097
so that would be propyl so we have 3 propyl.so go ahead and write 3-propyl here.

53
00:04:15,097 --> 00:04:19,842
like that and what else do we have carbon 5

54
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:25,669
we have 2 substituents alright so we have chloro group right here

55
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:26,770
ans we have methalic group right here.

56
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:33,773
remember our alphabet so c comes before m

57
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,927
so we can go ahead and put our methyl right here coming off of carbon 5

58
00:04:34,927 --> 00:04:41,513
so we write 5methyl like that and also coming of 5-chloro that should do it

59
00:04:41,513 --> 00:04:48,178
everything follows to alphabet rules.

60
00:04:48,178 --> 00:04:53,929
so we have 5-chloro 5 methyl 3 propyl 2 heptanol for this molecule.

61
00:04:53,929 --> 00:04:57,436
what about a problem that includes stereochemistery.

62
00:04:57,436 --> 00:05:02,313
so lets say they give us one where we have to worry about stereochemistery.

63
00:05:02,313 --> 00:05:07,569
so we go ahead and draw another chain out here.

64
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:14,262
so lets make an OH group going away from us.

65
00:05:14,262 --> 00:05:18,674
and then lets go ahead and make this one coming out at us like that.

66
00:05:18,674 --> 00:05:23,972
so giving iupack name for this molecule we have to include stereochemistery.

67
00:05:23,972 --> 00:05:29,010
once again find longer carbon chain that includes OH group.and we want to give

68
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:33,179
OH lowest number possible .so it takes precedence over things like alcule groups and

69
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:36,704
halogens and double bonds. so we are gonna start from left

70
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:50,270
so 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 like that so we have a 9 carbon

71
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:54,028
alcohol so that will be nonanol and the alcohol is coming off of carbon 3

72
00:05:54,028 --> 00:05:59,876
and OH is coming off of carbon 3 so we have 3 nonanol .

73
00:05:59,876 --> 00:06:09,891
and lets see other substituents at carbon 6 so at carbon 6 we have a 2

74
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:15,179
carbon substituent so that would be an ethylic group so lets go ahead and put in our 6

75
00:06:15,179 --> 00:06:29,763
ethyl .so for we have 6-ethyl-3 nonanol and we have to worry about stereochemistery.

76
00:06:29,763 --> 00:06:33,631
put in wedges and dashes on the problem you need to think about

77
00:06:33,631 --> 00:06:38,330
stereochemistery.and you put those absolute configurations at the beginning

78
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:43,434
of the iupack name.so lets figure out the stereochemistery of carbon 3

79
00:06:43,434 --> 00:06:51,362
so this is our chirality center right here

80
00:06:51,362 --> 00:06:56,186
this carbon and again you go to the atoms that are directly connected to chirality center

81
00:06:56,186 --> 00:07:02,434
so thats carbon carbon oxygen and then we also have right coming off our chirality center

82
00:07:02,434 --> 00:07:09,917
we have hydrogen which is coming out at us like that so that would be the lowest priority

83
00:07:09,917 --> 00:07:12,253
we get number 4 over here.so oxygen has the highest atomic number

84
00:07:12,253 --> 00:07:13,759
so thats gonna get number 1 so we have longer chain over here for this carbon

85
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,427
thats gonna get number 2 then number 3 then the hydrogen will be number 4

86
00:07:16,427 --> 00:07:25,888
there is little trick that I covered in eariler videos.

87
00:07:25,888 --> 00:07:29,508
right so it looks if you ignore the hydrogen it looks like you are going around

88
00:07:29,508 --> 00:07:40,059
counter clock wise so it looks like its s but you have this lowest priority group is coming out

89
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:45,239
at you so remember the trick was it would look like its s with those 3.just reverse it

90
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:50,980
so it must be R .and must have an absolute configuration of R at carbon 3.so

91
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:58,508
go ahead and put in here a 3R.then we will have to worry about absolute configuration at carbon 6

92
00:07:58,508 --> 00:08:05,777
so carbon 6 here so this is another chirality center.right 4 different substituents attached to it

93
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:11,054
there is also a hydrogen attached to this carbon going away from us like that

94
00:08:11,054 --> 00:08:17,820
and lets think about a highest priority while this chain over here in the left

95
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,643
this chain is gonna get highest priority

96
00:08:19,643 --> 00:08:23,238
thats most carbon is definitely gonna get highest prority

97
00:08:23,238 --> 00:08:28,371
there is more carbon over here in right so again you assign priority its gonna get highest 1

98
00:08:28,371 --> 00:08:31,443
and then this is gonna get 3rd.

99
00:08:31,443 --> 00:08:36,502
so this time we have going around 1,2,3.going around counter clock wise

100
00:08:36,502 --> 00:08:41,504
lowest priority group which is this hydrogen back here is going away from you

101
00:08:41,504 --> 00:08:46,435
so this actually is going to be S.its counter clock wise so its S.

102
00:08:46,435 --> 00:08:51,642
so 3R,6S and i want you kind of fast so go back and watch eariler videos

103
00:08:51,642 --> 00:08:56,502
on absolute configuration if that was little fast for you.

104
00:08:56,502 --> 00:09:03,778
so lets look at cyclic alcohol so ring systems.

105
00:09:03,778 --> 00:09:07,903
so lets take a look at alcohol with 6 carbons in a ring and

106
00:09:07,903 --> 00:09:15,060
OH coming off like that.so 6 carbons without the OH we call that cyclohexane.

107
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:20,644
and since this is an alcohol we would just change that to cyclohexanol

108
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:26,173
so thats very simple nomenclature cyclohexanol.you dont really need a number

109
00:09:26,173 --> 00:09:32,148
but if you could right one there its implied if we dont put it in.so thats cyclohexanol.

110
00:09:32,148 --> 00:09:37,505
what about something that has ring system with 2 hydroxyl groups.

111
00:09:37,505 --> 00:09:41,644
so lets go ahead and put in some stereochemistery 2.lets say we have an OH coming out at us

112
00:09:41,644 --> 00:09:48,902
and lets say we have OH going away from us like that alright so when you have a situation

113
00:09:48,902 --> 00:09:57,373
like this when you have 2 alcohols in the same molecule prefix would be diol.

114
00:09:57,373 --> 00:10:00,644
and the nomenclature is based off the cyclohexane molecule so you will write

115
00:10:00,644 --> 00:10:10,143
cyclohexane and then write off cyclohexane where you put the diol .diol meaning two alcohols.

116
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:13,574
we have to specify where these two alcohols are on the ring.

117
00:10:13,574 --> 00:10:21,329
so we need to go ahead and number our ring lets say this is carbon 1 carbon 2 carbon 3 and then carbon 4

118
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:28,377
so we have alcohols at the 1 and 4position so go ahead and write 1 and 4 here

119
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:34,237
and those 2 alcohols are trans to each other.alright one is coming out at you and one is

120
00:10:34,237 --> 00:10:39,772
going away from you so you could go ahead and write trans-1,4-cyclohexanediol

121
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:44,971
and thats a good iupack name.so there are other types of alcohol.

122
00:10:44,971 --> 00:10:54,961
we could have instead of cyclohexane ring we can have alcohol based on benzene ring.

123
00:10:54,961 --> 00:11:03,115
so put in our pi bonds and OH here this is special type of alcohol called phenol

124
00:11:03,115 --> 00:11:13,024
molecule called phenol and also you will see this hydroxybenzene portion of the molecule

125
00:11:13,024 --> 00:11:15,892
and lots of natural products.

126
00:11:15,892 --> 00:11:20,294
this is actually very imporant molecule to recognize the phenols.

127
00:11:20,294 --> 00:11:27,822
alright so lets go ahead and put something on that ring and we have our phenol is base here

128
00:11:27,822 --> 00:11:33,918
so lets go ahead and put a bromene (Br) right here so how would we name that molecule.

129
00:11:33,918 --> 00:11:37,970
the base part of the molecule is phenol molecule so go ahead put phenol like that

130
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:42,965
go ahead and number it alright so OH this must be carbon 1

131
00:11:42,965 --> 00:11:47,025
and want to give substituents lowest number possible so we are gonna give this

132
00:11:47,025 --> 00:11:51,969
carbon number 2 bromene(Br) coming out from carbon number 2 so its very simple

133
00:11:51,969 --> 00:11:58,437
we have to write 2-bromophenol like that.

134
00:11:58,437 --> 00:12:02,437
so thats nomenclature for alcohol and special type of alcohol called phenol
