1
00:00:09,002 --> 00:00:12,255
It's very complicated with this body thing, you know, how--

2
00:00:13,517 --> 00:00:18,202
I was painting as a young artist, and mostly I was painting these clouds.

3
00:00:18,448 --> 00:00:20,979
And one day, sitting and painting and looking at the sky,

4
00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:23,642
I saw 12 military planes passing by,

5
00:00:23,642 --> 00:00:26,116
and they made these incredible drawings in the sky,

6
00:00:26,116 --> 00:00:28,917
and I looked at them and I said God it's ridiculous

7
00:00:28,917 --> 00:00:31,848
I'm painting these paitings that are so two-dimensional.

8
00:00:31,848 --> 00:00:34,867
Maybe I could go to the military base and ask for

9
00:00:34,867 --> 00:00:37,360
the twelve planes to make drawings in the sky.

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,136
I went to the military base and my father was a general in the army

11
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:45,732
so they called him and said "Your daughter is in our base. Can you take her home

12
00:00:45,732 --> 00:00:49,062
because she's out of her mind. She wants to use the planes to paint the sky.

13
00:00:49,154 --> 00:00:51,293
Do you know how much this could cost?"

14
00:00:51,493 --> 00:00:54,179
So after that I stopped painting

15
00:00:54,225 --> 00:00:57,156
and I started realizing I could use any material I want.

16
00:00:57,156 --> 00:00:59,514
Fire, water, and the body.

17
00:00:59,637 --> 00:01:04,700
And the moment when I started using the body i felt enormous satisfaction.

18
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,930
That I could communicate with the public that I never could do anything else.

19
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:14,897
I could never go back to the seclusion of the studio and be protected by the space there.

20
00:01:15,589 --> 00:01:18,353
The only way of expression is to perform.

21
00:01:18,353 --> 00:01:25,045
And if I put art into a heirarychy I would always put music on the top

22
00:01:25,045 --> 00:01:28,645
because it is so immaterial enough to (
incoherent) performance

23
00:01:28,645 --> 00:01:32,932
and then any other art, from a subjective point of view.
