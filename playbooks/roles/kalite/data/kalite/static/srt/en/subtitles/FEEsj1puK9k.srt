1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,450
One problem left,problem number 20.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:09,380
There are 75 more women than men enrolled in Linden College.

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,230
If n men enrolled,then in terms of n,

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,330
what percentage of those enrolled are men?

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:25,830
Well,they're saying that n is men,

6
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:33,550
so n is equal to number of men,right? They tell us that.

7
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:38,110
And there are 75 more women than men,right?

8
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,320
So what is equal to the number of women?

9
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,920
We know that there are 75 more women than men,

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,160
so it must be n plus 75.

11
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,830
I think I'm coming down with something.

12
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,000
And then they say well,in terms of n,

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,860
what percentage of those enrolled are men?

14
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,980
So if we want to know the fraction that are men,

15
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,770
it's the number of men over the total number of students.

16
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,820
So the total number of students is going to

17
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,490
be the men plus the women.

18
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:20,730
So the men is n plus the women is n plus 75,right?

19
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,660
So this tells us the fraction that are men.

20
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:28,880
So this is n over 2n plus 75.

21
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,080
This would be some decimal number,

22
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,780
and if I want to convert this to a percentage,

23
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:42,890
I'd multiply it times 100 and add a percent sign right here.

24
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:43,900
And if I wanted to rewrite that,

25
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:50,120
it would be 100n over 2n plus 75 percent.

26
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,600
And that is choice E.

27
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,880
I have all this extra time I don't know what to do with.

28
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,420
I guess I will let you use it more productively

29
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,970
then watching me do nothing on a video.

30
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,110
I'll see you in the next SAT Section.
