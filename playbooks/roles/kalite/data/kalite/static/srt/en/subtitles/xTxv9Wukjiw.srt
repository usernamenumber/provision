1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,990
   

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,200
In the last video, we
did problem 65,

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,470
and we got the answer.

4
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,750
And we did it in kind of an
intuitive way, but if it was a

5
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,390
slightly harder problem, it
would've gotten a little more

6
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:10,820
complicated, so I really wanted
to show you how you can

7
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,090
do it with the binomial theorem
as well, or at least

8
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:19,030
with binomial coefficients, and
then we can try to see how

9
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:20,070
they relate to each other,
that they're

10
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,270
actually the same thing.

11
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,780
I realized that I should do
this, because I'm looking at

12
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,320
the next couple of questions,
and they all deal with the

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,450
binomial coefficient.

14
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,620
So I figured I might as well do
it the binomial way because

15
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,130
that's probably what
the California

16
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,400
Standards want you to do.

17
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,330
And it's a good way.

18
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,230
It's good to be able to do it
intuitively and with the

19
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,030
binomial coefficients and
understand how they're the

20
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,020
same thing.

21
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,050
So reading the same problem,
Teresa and Julia are among 10

22
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,580
students who have applied
for a trip to D.C.

23
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,390
Two students from the group
will be selected at

24
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,890
random for the trip.

25
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,820
   

26
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,790
What is probability that Teresa
and Julia will be the

27
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,200
two students selected?

28
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,160
So the way we did it last time,
we said, OK, we could

29
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,720
pick Julia first, and there's a
1 in 10 chance, and then we

30
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,240
would pick Teresa, and that's
a 1 in 9 chance.

31
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,910
Or we could go the other way
around, so it would be 2 times

32
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,960
1/10 times 1/9.

33
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,930
2, because there's two different
ways to pick the

34
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:15,240
people, and then for each of
those ways, there's a 1 in 10

35
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,380
chance of picking the first
person and then a 1 in 9 for

36
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,020
the second.

37
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,310
That was the intuitive way we
did that in the last video.

38
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,860
The way you would do it with
the binomial coefficient is

39
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,980
you'd say, OK, I have 10 items,
10 students in this

40
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,640
case, and I'm going to
choose two of them.

41
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,340
And people will often read
this as 10 choose 2.

42
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,570
And it's useful to memorize to
some degree what this means.

43
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:43,500
This means 10 factorial
over 2 factorial

44
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,750
times 10 minus 2 factorial.

45
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,970
And so that is equal to-- and
I'll give you in a second what

46
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:51,560
the intuition is.

47
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,480
That's equal to 10
factorial over 2

48
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,230
factorial times 8 factorial.

49
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,480
And at first, you might say, oh,
my God, 10 factorial is a

50
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,140
huge number.

51
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,440
It's going to take me forever
to multiply that out, until

52
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,870
you realize that you're dividing
it by 8 factorial.

53
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:13,240
So 10 factorial, that's the same
thing as 10 times 9 times

54
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,670
8 times 7, and you keep going.

55
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,540
But 8 factorial is 8 times
7 times 6 and so

56
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,310
forth and so on.

57
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,160
So the 8 factorial, if you
divide into 10 factorial,

58
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,050
that's going to cancel
out with that.

59
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,520
And you're just left
with 10 times 9.

60
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,590
So if you have to say, how many
different ways can you

61
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,730
pick 2 people out of 10?

62
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,800
You then get 10 times 9, which
is 90, divided by 2 factorial,

63
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,610
which is 2 times 1, so you say
there's 45 different ways to

64
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,070
pick 2 people.

65
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:49,320
So the chances that I pick one
of those ways, pick Julia and

66
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,490
Teresa, is 1 out of 45.

67
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,270
There are 45 combinations of
picking 2 people out of 10.

68
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,900
So the chances of picking
any one of those

69
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,260
combinations is 1 out of 45.

70
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,420
So you get to the same answer.

71
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,240
And just to get the intuition,
this thing boils down

72
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,990
to-- we just saw.

73
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:07,660
It boils down to 10 times
9 over 2 factorial.

74
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,090
And if you just want the
intuition, there's 10 ways to

75
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,390
pick the first person, there's
9 ways to pick the second

76
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:17,500
person, and then there's 2 ways,
or 2 factorial ways,

77
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,300
that you could have picked
one person and

78
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,050
then another person.

79
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,960
So it's the same intuition
as this.

80
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,890
But if you just wanted to kind
of plug and chug and get the

81
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,650
answer, you say, oh,
10 choose 2.

82
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,453
That gives me the answer.

83
00:03:27,453 --> 00:03:28,220
I have 10 things.

84
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:28,870
I need to choose 2.

85
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,410
That gives me 45 different
combinations and I want only

86
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,380
one of them.

87
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,660
So that's 1 out of 45.

88
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,270
Next question.

89
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,340
Let me see.

90
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,250
Scroll up.

91
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,060
All right.

92
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,410
And when I saw this, I said, oh,
they definitely want us to

93
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,010
deal with binomial
coefficients.

94
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,020
And I'll show you two ways how
to do this problem, too.

95
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:53,100
So this one says 3y minus
1 to the fourth power.

96
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,590
And you can multiply it out just
using regular algebraic

97
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,640
multiplication, polynomial
multiplication.

98
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,590
It will take you some
time and you might

99
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,790
make a careless mistake.

100
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,270
I'm guessing they want us to
use the binomial theorem.

101
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:07,880
And the binomial expansion
of this-- I'll use that

102
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,180
combinatorics or that binomial
coefficient notation.

103
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,510
I think you'll get
the pattern.

104
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,870
And I've done several videos on
this where I explain deeper

105
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,760
why it works and all of that.

106
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:23,480
But it equals 4 choose 0 times
the first term to the fourth

107
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:33,670
power, 3y to the fourth, times
the second term to the 0th

108
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,030
power, so you don't
include it.

109
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,620
That's times 1.

110
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,790
Anything to the 0th power is 1.

111
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,440
Fine.

112
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:45,820
Plus 4 choose 1 times the first
term, so that's 3y to

113
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,880
the third power-- I'm just
decrementing it on each term--

114
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:55,880
Times the second term to the
first power, so times negative

115
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,130
1 to the first power.

116
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,170
And, in general, if you want
to know what should this

117
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,390
exponent be, it's going to
be whatever is here.

118
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,780
So this one is the
same as that.

119
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,180
So here we had a 0, so negative
1 to the 0, I didn't

120
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,560
even take the trouble
to write that down.

121
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,490
Let me just keep going.

122
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,070
I'll switch colors.

123
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,210
So the next term, you could
probably pause it and guess

124
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,110
it, is going to be 4 choose 2.

125
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,825
And I know you're wondering
well, what is this 4 choose 1

126
00:05:17,825 --> 00:05:18,510
and 4 choose 2?

127
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,280
Well, we saw it in the last
problem, but I'll calculate

128
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,680
them in a second.

129
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:32,290
That's going to be 3y squared
times negative 1 squared.

130
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:37,330
And we have two more terms.
Plus 4 choose 3

131
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:41,450
times 3y to the 1.

132
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,020
And just so you know, the
exponents of these two should

133
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,000
always add up to 4.

134
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,940
So you have 4 and 0, you
have 3 and 1, 2 and 2.

135
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,790
So in this case, you have
times negative 1 to the

136
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:59,380
third-- and this 3 is that 3--
plus 4 choose 4 times negative

137
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,630
1 to the fourth power.

138
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,470
   

139
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,550
So what do each of these
binomial coefficients equal?

140
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:11,060
4 choose 0, that is equal to--
I'll do it in yellow.

141
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:17,190
That's equal to 4 factorial over
0 factorial, which, you

142
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:20,570
may or may not know, is defined
to be 1, over 0

143
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:25,310
factorial divided by 4
minus 0 factorial.

144
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,790
And so that just turns
into 1, right?

145
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,890
4 minus 0 is 4.

146
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,530
So you get 4 factorial
over factorial.

147
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,700
So this is equal to 1.

148
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,440
So let me write it out.

149
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,520
So 3y the fourth.

150
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,340
3 to the fourth power is what?

151
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,200
It's 81.

152
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:45,080
So we get 81 y to the fourth.

153
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,640
All right.

154
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,890
Next term.

155
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,220
Well, the first thing that you
see is you have this negative

156
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,170
1 to the first power.

157
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,610
This negative 1 is just going
to keep flipping the sign.

158
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,820
So negative 1 to the first
power, that's just going to

159
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,370
make this whole term negative
and then we can

160
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,170
ignore it from there.

161
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,790
So we're going to get a negative
there because of this

162
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,055
negative 1 to the first power.

163
00:07:00,055 --> 00:07:02,030
And what's 4 choose 1?

164
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:07,860
So that's 4 factorial over 1
factorial, which is also 1,

165
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,470
divided by 4 minus
1 factorial.

166
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:13,210
   

167
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:16,010
So that's 4 factorial
over 3 factorial.

168
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,420
So it's 4 times 3 times
2 times 1 divided by 3

169
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,880
times 2 times 1.

170
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,190
So that just equals 4.

171
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,300
Try it out if you don't
believe me.

172
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,010
4 times 3 times 2 times 1
divided by 3 times 2 times 1,

173
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,780
you're just left with a 4.

174
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,270
So you get 4.

175
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,820
This coefficient becomes 4.

176
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,230
But it's 4 times 3 to
the third power.

177
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,690
So maybe I'll just write it.

178
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:45,060
The binomial coefficient is
4 times 27y to the third.

179
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,430
And we already took care
of the negative 1.

180
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,900
Negative 1 to the first
power is negative 1.

181
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,500
And that's why I put
the negative there.

182
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,100
So the next term.

183
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,790
We have a negative 1 to the
second power, so it's going to

184
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,710
be a positive.

185
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,370
This is going to
turn into a 1.

186
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,680
That turns into a 1.

187
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,750
So it's plus-- what's
4 choose 2?

188
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:05,570
4 choose 2 is-- I'm already
running out of space.

189
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,460
I'll write it up here.

190
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,370
It's 4 factorial over
2 factorial

191
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,830
times 4 minus 2 factorial.

192
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:17,460
4 minus 2 factorial, that's
also 2 factorial.

193
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:22,520
So it's equal to 4 times 3 times
2 times 1 divided by 2

194
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,440
factorial is 2 and
2 factorial is 2.

195
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,080
Let's say this 2 cancels
out with that 2.

196
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,120
This 2 cancels-- let's see, if
you cancel out that 2, that

197
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,470
becomes a 2.

198
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:36,090
So you get 2 times 3
just becomes a 6.

199
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:39,350
So that third term
just becomes a 6.

200
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,840
4 choose 2 is 6.

201
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,440
I know this is messy.

202
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,810
So you have a plus 6
times 3y squared.

203
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:53,040
So 9 times 9y squared.

204
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,110
And we could go keep going.

205
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,320
And actually, the binomial
coefficient, the next one's

206
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,400
going to be a 4, and it's
negative 1 to the third, so

207
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,260
it's going to be a minus
4 times 3y to the 1.

208
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,650
I mean, we could keep going.

209
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,660
Actually, let's just
keep going.

210
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,670
So the next term, 4 choose 3,
I'll leave that for you to

211
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,890
calculate it, but I already know
that since we're kind of

212
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,790
past the middle point, the
binomial coefficient is going

213
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,020
to be the same as 4 choose 1.

214
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,005
So it's going to be a 4 and we
have a minus 1 to the third,

215
00:09:19,005 --> 00:09:19,750
so this is minus 1.

216
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:26,890
So it's minus 4 times 3y
to the 1, so times 3y.

217
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,020
And then we have
the last term.

218
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,120
4 choose 4-- you could calculate
it using this

219
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,660
formula, but that turns out to
be 1 as well-- plus 1 times

220
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,580
negative 1 to the fourth,
so that's just plus 1.

221
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,010
And let's see what
this is equal to.

222
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:39,980
Let's see if we can
simplify it.

223
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:45,740
This is equal to 81y to the
fourth minus-- let's see, 4

224
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:50,600
times 20 is 80, 4 times
7 is 28, so it'd be

225
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,930
108, 108y to the third.

226
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:59,930
6 times 9 is 54, so
plus 54y squared.

227
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,610
Minus 12y plus 1.

228
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:08,750
And if we look at the choices,
only choice A

229
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,400
is the right answer.

230
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,990
And actually, we could have
figured out it was choice A

231
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:16,730
just by going one term deep,
because that's where all of

232
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,130
the choices- became different,
so we could have

233
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,420
saved a lot of work.

234
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,240
Another option: Instead of
evaluating each of the

235
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,970
binomial coefficients, another
option would have been to do a

236
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:32,910
Pascal's triangle, where you
say, OK, if I have a plus b to

237
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,880
the first power, the
coefficients are 1 and 1,

238
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,500
right, 1a plus 1b.

239
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,170
If I take it to the second
power, a plus b squared, the

240
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:46,430
coefficients become
1 plus 1 is 2.

241
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,440
You bring down a
1 both places.

242
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,520
And that makes sense because a
plus b squared is 1a squared

243
00:10:54,520 --> 00:11:00,930
plus 2ab plus 1b squared.

244
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,240
And then we could
have kept going.

245
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,360
This would have been
to the third power.

246
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,480
You had a 1, a 3, a 3 and a 1.

247
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,630
And then the fourth power is
what this problem was about.

248
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,860
So you get a 1, you get a 4.

249
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,030
3 plus 3 is 6.

250
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,180
3 plus 1 is 4, and
you get a 1.

251
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,460
And so these would be the
coefficients, and in this

252
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:27,070
case, we were doing 3y minus
1 to the fourth power.

253
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:30,350
   

254
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,460
If we had just drawn this out
really fast, we would have

255
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:39,730
said, well, this becomes 1 times
3y to the fourth plus 4

256
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:45,160
times 3y to the third-- I just
keep decrementing the 3y--

257
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:52,510
times negative 1 to the 1 plus
6 times 3y squared--

258
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,340
this 6 is this one.

259
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:58,790
I'm getting a little
misaligned-- 3y squared times

260
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,700
negative 1 squared.

261
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,230
So every time I increment the
power on negative 1 and I

262
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,840
decrement the power on 3y.

263
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,240
And then plus 4.

264
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,410
Now I'm at this one.

265
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:15,010
Plus 4 times 3y negative
1 to the third.

266
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:23,270
And then finally plus 1 times
3y to the 0 is just 1 times

267
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,270
negative 1 to the the
fourth power.

268
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,720
And I would have evaluated it.

269
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,100
And that might have been
a slightly faster

270
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,630
way of doing it.

271
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,130
But I wanted to do this a
couple of different ways

272
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,360
because I think the binomial
theorem and binomial expansion

273
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,520
is something that people forget,
and it's important to

274
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,170
kind of have the neurons make a
lot of cross-connections so

275
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,590
that you don't forget it when
you're 30 years old.

276
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:44,040
Anyway, this was the least
number of problems I've done

277
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,670
in a video, but I think
it was worth it.

278
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,820
I'll see you in the
next video.

279
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,400
