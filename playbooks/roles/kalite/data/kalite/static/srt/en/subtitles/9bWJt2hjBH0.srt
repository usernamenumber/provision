1
00:00:04,493 --> 00:00:08,071
- This is one that actually does speak to me 
in a very powerful way

2
00:00:08,134 --> 00:00:10,024
but when you look at something
like an American flag

3
00:00:10,086 --> 00:00:11,655
I think I kinda get it,
I mean...

4
00:00:11,748 --> 00:00:15,172
it's such a powerful icon or image

5
00:00:15,218 --> 00:00:16,893
and it evokes so many things

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:21,187
and it's something that you see
so frequently, at least if you're an American

7
00:00:21,326 --> 00:00:25,285
and if you're not American
it's something you still see relatively frequently

8
00:00:25,377 --> 00:00:27,353
and probably does represent something to you

9
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:32,394
but then to have it imaged and reimaged
in this, I don't know... antiqued way

10
00:00:32,455 --> 00:00:37,379
I can't fully articulated it,
I won't claim that it's somehow challenging

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,900
my philosophy in some profound way

12
00:00:39,962 --> 00:00:43,843
but I kind of get it at a base level
what's trying to go on here

13
00:00:43,966 --> 00:00:47,169
I think that's why this painting
has got some popular traction

14
00:00:47,246 --> 00:00:49,981
it was on a cover of my history books
when I was in high school

15
00:00:50,027 --> 00:00:52,453
there's shirts made with this image

16
00:00:52,499 --> 00:00:56,241
and I'm not seeing the full "there"
when I'm describing that

17
00:00:56,334 --> 00:00:58,092
there is even more to it

18
00:00:58,138 --> 00:00:59,662
- I think you're absolutely right

19
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:02,857
I think Jones would be very happy
to hear what you've just said

20
00:01:02,917 --> 00:01:08,910
I think he wanted this painting to function as something that did raise all kinds of meanings

21
00:01:09,018 --> 00:01:10,572
in a person who walked up to it

22
00:01:10,634 --> 00:01:14,686
in a sense what he's shown us
is not so much a flag

23
00:01:14,779 --> 00:01:16,360
as a mirror, right?

24
00:01:16,421 --> 00:01:18,573
because it's such a potent symbol

25
00:01:18,681 --> 00:01:22,627
and we all walk up to it with
a lot of personal life experiences

26
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,282
and it can mean very different things
to many very different people

27
00:01:25,328 --> 00:01:28,094
and in a sense he's given us a very neutral field

28
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,723
so let's look at it really closely

29
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:35,998
we're not looking at a printed American flag
we're not looking at a flag of cloth

30
00:01:36,136 --> 00:01:39,276
and in fact some critics of the time asked:

31
00:01:39,317 --> 00:01:41,791
"Is this a painting or is this a flag?"

32
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:45,522
in other words: is it a representation,
or is it an actual flag

33
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,416
of course something that is symbolic 
like a flag can raise that kind of issue

34
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:53,543
which I think is one of the reasons
I think that Jones was interested in it

35
00:01:53,635 --> 00:01:56,280
but let's just look at the surface for a moment

36
00:01:56,327 --> 00:01:59,613
this is an object 
that actually stands off the wall a few inches

37
00:01:59,674 --> 00:02:02,301
it's canvas that's on top of plywood

38
00:02:02,393 --> 00:02:05,817
so it's slightly shallow box-like form

39
00:02:05,863 --> 00:02:09,455
then when you look at the surface
it's really heavily worked

40
00:02:09,578 --> 00:02:13,701
it's not traditional oil paint
or even the more modern acrylic

41
00:02:13,794 --> 00:02:16,704
this is something called encaustic

42
00:02:16,781 --> 00:02:20,521
which is an ancient Egyptian painting technique
that Jones revived

43
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:25,674
other people has used it in history
but it's ancient and it's translucent and it's lumpy

44
00:02:25,797 --> 00:02:28,375
but it also allows you to see through it

45
00:02:28,468 --> 00:02:31,779
and when you look through this lumpy surface of wax

46
00:02:31,948 --> 00:02:34,384
what you see are strips of newspapers

47
00:02:34,461 --> 00:02:38,633
it's sort of torn up so you really can't read it,
it's not a continuous story

48
00:02:38,756 --> 00:02:42,225
but it is clearly this pigment, this wax

49
00:02:42,317 --> 00:02:46,050
on top of the debris of our political life

50
00:02:46,142 --> 00:02:50,394
- Yeah, I think that's why, 
maybe you guys are just doing good job training me

51
00:02:50,487 --> 00:02:52,315
I mean, this one really speaks to me

52
00:02:52,392 --> 00:02:56,224
because especially the texture
and the fact that it is not printed

53
00:02:56,363 --> 00:02:59,345
it is... handmade and it has those layers to it

54
00:02:59,422 --> 00:03:01,068
it's a very powerful idea

55
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:05,179
when you just have a printed flag
it simplifies what a country is

56
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:08,665
or what the ideas the country represents are
and its history

57
00:03:08,727 --> 00:03:12,065
and when you look at this painting,
yes, it's an American flag

58
00:03:12,142 --> 00:03:16,828
but you appreciate it...
there's context to America

59
00:03:16,935 --> 00:03:20,620
there's a history, depth, texture to America

60
00:03:20,682 --> 00:03:24,486
you look closer at America,
it's not this simple idea

61
00:03:24,578 --> 00:03:26,228
there's many, many, many layers to it

62
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,950
and I think this does a really good job
this is why it's a painting a lot of people respond to

63
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:34,097
even the people that might be
traditionally sceptical to modern art

64
00:03:34,174 --> 00:03:36,375
I think this really feels a lot of those things
when they see that

65
00:03:36,468 --> 00:03:39,657
they feel a depth, 
the connection to the nation of America

66
00:03:39,764 --> 00:03:43,522
more than this very
red, white, and blue simple idea of it

67
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,673
- I think that's exactly right

68
00:03:45,735 --> 00:03:50,925
I think that Jones has taken
this opportunity to reimagine them

69
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:55,388
what is conveyed,
art can still in a very fundamental way

70
00:03:55,464 --> 00:03:57,772
represent really complex things

71
00:03:57,864 --> 00:04:02,479
not necessarily through the careful
rendering or the careful representation

72
00:04:02,556 --> 00:04:05,255
of objects on the table or human face

73
00:04:05,363 --> 00:04:07,767
but through kind of symbolic language

74
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:14,229
actually reference and in some ways
depict a very complex American history

75
00:04:14,352 --> 00:04:16,003
I think that's exactly right

76
00:04:16,096 --> 00:04:20,715
- We talked about a lot of artists...
what's really of note...

77
00:04:20,854 --> 00:04:22,523
although I think this is one of these pieces

78
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,750
that I don't need that much context to really appreciate it

79
00:04:25,873 --> 00:04:28,009
but to go to the next level of context...

80
00:04:28,225 --> 00:04:35,239
Was Jasper Jones really one of the first
to take really powerful images like an American flag

81
00:04:35,346 --> 00:04:38,071
and kind of rerender them in this type of way?

82
00:04:38,118 --> 00:04:42,758
- He was and in fact this is the art 
that's being produced before pop-art exists

83
00:04:42,857 --> 00:04:47,093
so this idea about of 
turning his canvas and paintbrush

84
00:04:47,155 --> 00:04:51,832
on a visual form that is itself fixed
is a fascinating idea

85
00:04:51,894 --> 00:04:53,590
think about what's he's giving up

86
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:55,540
the things that we value in painting

87
00:04:55,617 --> 00:04:59,746
traditionally have to do 
with artist choice of colour, of composition

88
00:04:59,792 --> 00:05:02,369
and those things are given here

89
00:05:02,446 --> 00:05:05,270
those are already set,
he's not messing with that

90
00:05:05,393 --> 00:05:09,125
and yet this is still not entirely a flag

91
00:05:09,264 --> 00:05:12,170
so much a representation of a flag

92
00:05:12,293 --> 00:05:16,040
and in that way he is walking
on his very narrow edge

93
00:05:16,178 --> 00:05:20,269
- It's really strange to me
because we've talked about traditional art

94
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:24,417
if you go five or eight hundred years ago,
it was always representational

95
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:29,116
then the Renaissance and then the more modern art 
is all about ideas and pushing our thinking

96
00:05:29,193 --> 00:05:31,889
and this definitely falls into that latter category

97
00:05:32,012 --> 00:05:36,849
it really does... maybe it's just me,
it emotes something in me

98
00:05:36,941 --> 00:05:40,352
that is aesthetic,
that is as powerful as any of these

99
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,154
obviously, it's an American flag
and that by itself can create powerful emotions

100
00:05:44,216 --> 00:05:46,807
but just the way it was rendered

101
00:05:46,915 --> 00:05:50,686
also creates feelings and depth 
that I haven't actually felt

102
00:05:50,855 --> 00:05:54,139
from a lot of the modern pieces we've looked at

103
00:05:58,785 --> 00:06:04,153
A conversation with Sai Khan and Steven Zucker discussing Jasper Johns, Flag, 1954-55
