1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,740
   

2
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,370
Problem number 1.

3
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:09,400
It gives a series--
2, 6, 14, 30.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,770
And they say in the sequence
above the first term is 2.

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,540
Each number after the first if
obtained by adding 1 to the

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,150
preceding number and then
doubling the result.

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,840
So you add 1, so you
get 3, and then you

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,240
double it you get 6.

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,230
You add 1 to 6 to 7, right, this
is plus 1 and then you

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,500
multiply it by 2.

11
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,030
You get 7 times 2 is 14.

12
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,770
14 plus 1 is 15 times 2 is 30.

13
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,380
And they want the sixth term.

14
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:42,730
So then 30 plus 1 is 31 times
2 is 62 and then you add 1.

15
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,290
We add 1 first. So
you get to 63.

16
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,875
And then you multiply
that times 2.

17
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:49,140
That's what, 126.

18
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,660
So that is choice E.

19
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,910
Problem 2.

20
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,250
   

21
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:06,540
If a times x plus y is equal to
45, and ax is equal to 15,

22
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,290
what is ay equal?

23
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:10,630
So let's just distribute
this a here.

24
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:15,640
You get ax plus ay
is equal to 45.

25
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,350
They tell us ax is
equal to 15.

26
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,730
So that is equal to 15--
ax is equal to 15.

27
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,790
So you get 15 plus ay
is equal to 45.

28
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:30,590
Subtract 15 from both sides and
you get ay is equal to 30.

29
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,210
That's our answer.

30
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,200
They want to know what ay is.

31
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,820
You don't have to solve for
a or y, just ay, so

32
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,640
that's choice E.

33
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,890
Next problem.

34
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,890
   

35
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,460
Before drawing this let me read
it so I can figure out

36
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,560
what I have to draw.

37
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,780
On the speedometer above what is
the speed in miles per hour

38
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,580
indicated by the needle
position?

39
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,010
So let me see if I
can draw this.

40
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:59,860
So they give the bottom one
like that, that's given in

41
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,580
feet per second.

42
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,540
And then the next one
up is this one,

43
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,960
that's miles per hour.

44
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,170
And then the top one is
kilometers per hour.

45
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,340
I'm going to write it on this
side, although they write it

46
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,640
up here-- kilometers per hour.

47
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,800
And then they indicate-- and on
the miles per hour thing--

48
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,700
I don't know what you actually
call this measurement.

49
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:32,290
So there's 30 and then there's
one slash, two slash, three

50
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,350
slash, and then they go to 60.

51
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:39,720
And then the line that they
draw is right here.

52
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,010
It goes like that.

53
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,450
   

54
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,550
And they say in the speedometer
above what is the

55
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,460
speed in miles per
hour indicated

56
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,510
by the needle position.

57
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,290
And the reason why I didn't do
much detail on this line or on

58
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,090
this line is because this one's
kilometers per hour and

59
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:58,880
this is feet per second.

60
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,890
So I don't care about those, I
just care about the miles per

61
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,970
hour, and that is this one.

62
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,520
And let's see, they
drew it here.

63
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,690
So how big is each
of these slashes?

64
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,510
1, 2, 3, 4.

65
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:16,460
So each of these go 1/4 of the
distance between 30 and 60.

66
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,200
Each of them goes 1/4
of the distance.

67
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,200
So you could say, for example,
this is halfway between 30 and

68
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,540
60, so this is going to be 45.

69
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,940
And so what's halfway between
30 and 45, which is

70
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,490
where the thing is?

71
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,920
Well 45 is 15 more than 30, so
this is going to be 7 and 1/2

72
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,050
more than 30.

73
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:37,040
So this point right here
is going to be 37.5.

74
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,820
And how do I know that?

75
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:42,060
If you just say, well if I just
take 30 divided by 4-- 1,

76
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,050
2, 3, 4-- each of these are
going to be 7.5-- right, 30

77
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,940
divided by 4 is equal to 7.5.

78
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,520
Or you could say well this
middle one's definitely going

79
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,120
to be 45 because 45 is right
in between 30 and 60.

80
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,360
And then what's right in
between 30 and 45?

81
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,760
Well that's 37.5 again.

82
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,320
So the speedometer's indicating
37.5 miles per

83
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,160
hour, that's choice B.

84
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,560
Next problem, problem 4.

85
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,390
How many different positive
three-digit integers can be

86
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:17,910
formed if the three digits, 4,
5 and 6, must be used in each

87
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,160
of the integers.

88
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,580
   

89
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,220
So they're essentially saying
how many combinations can you

90
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,480
get of the number 456?

91
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,310
So I could write out all those
combinations if you like.

92
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,870
I mean you could 456, 465--
right, those are all of the

93
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,650
ones that if you have
4 in front.

94
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:41,670
Then if you have 5 in front,
you have 546 or

95
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,180
you can have 564.

96
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,210
I just switched them.

97
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:50,920
And if you have 6 in front you
could have 645 or 654.

98
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,170
So those are 6.

99
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,880
The other way I think
about it is I have

100
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,270
three numbers, right?

101
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,860
I can put one of three in
the first position.

102
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,880
I can put one of two in
the second position.

103
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,250
And then I would have one left
over in the last position.

104
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,790
I'd have three choices
to put in the first

105
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,680
number, 4, 5 or 6.

106
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,890
Then after I put one in that
first position I have two

107
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,300
left, so there's two more
possibilities, and then I have

108
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,290
one left over for the
third position.

109
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,410
So you could also think
of it this way.

110
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,520
You could just write
them out-- 1,

111
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,440
2, 3, 4, 5, 6 numbers.

112
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,360
Or you could use that latter
technique I just talked about

113
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,180
and it would be 3 times
2 times 1, which is

114
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,720
also equal to 6.

115
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,970
Next problem.

116
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,660
   

117
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,120
Let me draw what they
have drawn.

118
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,400
   

119
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,570
Well I'll try my best. This
line goes like this.

120
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:48,160
   

121
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,270
And then there's
a dotted line.

122
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,610
Let me just see if
I can do that.

123
00:05:51,610 --> 00:06:00,190
   

124
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,490
The hard part of these problems
is drawing them.

125
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,380
Good thing you don't have
to do that on the SAT.

126
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,490
The three-dimensional figure
represented above consists of

127
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,520
rectangular and triangle
faces.

128
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,270
Fair enough, triangular faces.

129
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,720
Each rectangular face
has area r.

130
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,430
So this is a rectangular face
here, there's three

131
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,110
rectangular faces.

132
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:24,190
So area of the rectangle
is equal to r.

133
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,980
And each triangular
face is area t.

134
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,130
So area of each of the triangle
is equal to t.

135
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,350
What is a total surface
area of the figure in

136
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,410
terms of r and t?

137
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,510
So how many rectangular
surfaces are there?

138
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,470
Well there's this one in back.

139
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,660
   

140
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,350
It's kind of behind the thing.

141
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:46,550
You have this base that
I'll drawn in magenta.

142
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,610
This is the base rectangular
surface.

143
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,510
And then you have this one
that's closest to us, which I

144
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,760
could-- this one-- that's the
closest. So you have three

145
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,560
rectangular surfaces.

146
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,895
So it's 3 times r, because each
rectangular surface has

147
00:06:59,895 --> 00:07:01,110
an area or r.

148
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,230
And then how many of
the triangular

149
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,130
surfaces do you have?

150
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:06,020
You have the one in the back,
back here, and then you have

151
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,210
the one of the front
right here.

152
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,220
So you have two triangular
surfaces.

153
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:15,010
So it's 3 times the rectangular
areas plus 2 times

154
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,770
the triangular areas because
there's two triangular areas.

155
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,980
So 3r plus 2t, and
that's choice B.

156
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,230
Next problem.

157
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,730
   

158
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,150
Problem 6.

159
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:35,100
If n is a positive integer and
n plus 1 over 2 to the n is

160
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:42,380
equal to 1/2, n equals what?

161
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,530
So let's think about
how we can do this.

162
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:49,110
Let's multiply both sides of
this equation by 2 to the n.

163
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,130
So if you multiply both sides of
the equation times 2 to the

164
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:59,090
n, you get n plus 1 is equal
to 1/2 times 2 to the n.

165
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,940
Let me think about this
a little bit.

166
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,210
Let's see, 1/2 times
2 to the n.

167
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:07,150
1/2 is the same thing as
2 to the negative 1.

168
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:14,000
So this is n plus 1 is equal
to-- let me think about this.

169
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,920
n plus 1 is equal to 2 to the
negative 1 times 2 to the n.

170
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,680
So n plus 1 is equal
to 2-- sorry.

171
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,260
2 to the n minus 1.

172
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,430
Huh.

173
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,950
So that's where I can get it.

174
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,090
Really at this point, the best
thing I can think of is just

175
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,600
trying out the choices and
see which one works.

176
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:40,080
If you look at choice A, 1--
actually, we could just do it

177
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,679
from the original,
that's faster.

178
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,850
1 plus 1 over 2 to the n is
equal to 2 over 2 to the 1,

179
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:46,820
which is equal to 1.

180
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,790
So it's not 1/2, so it's
not a equals 1.

181
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,970
Choice B is 2.

182
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:57,950
So it would be 2 plus 1, which
is 3 over 2 squared, which

183
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,510
equals 3/4.

184
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,700
So that's not the answer.

185
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,230
If you look at choice
C, choice C is 3.

186
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:10,450
So 3 plus 1 is 4 over
2 to the third.

187
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,670
That's 4 over 8 equals 1/2.

188
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,260
So it's choice C.

189
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,780
And I'm trying to figure out
if there's a way that you

190
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,900
could solve for that easier
other than trying out the

191
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,500
numbers, but for some reason
it's not popping into my head.

192
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,010
Let me know a message if
you figure it out.

193
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,170
But I also do these under
time pressure.

194
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,450
But I will see you in
the next video.

195
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:30,800
