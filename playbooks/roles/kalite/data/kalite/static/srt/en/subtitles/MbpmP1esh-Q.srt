1
00:00:00,907 --> 00:00:06,033
Let's divide 3771 by 8.

2
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:09,633
So I'm going to do a little bit of long division so the way we set it up.

3
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:13,767
So the first we want to do and to think about: Well, does 8 go into 3?

4
00:00:13,767 --> 00:00:16,433
Well, no, 8 does not go into 3 so we'll keep moving.

5
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,767
Does 8 go into 37?

6
00:00:18,767 --> 00:00:23,233
Sure, 8 times 4 is 32. (8 times 5 is 40 so that's too big)

7
00:00:23,233 --> 00:00:28,167
So 8 goes into 37 four times.

8
00:00:28,167 --> 00:00:38,100
4 times 8 is 32 and we subtract and we get 37 minus 32 is 5.

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,633
And just so you have a little glimpse of what's actually going on here:

10
00:00:40,633 --> 00:00:45,167
We're really saying, how many times this 8 go into 3700.

11
00:00:45,167 --> 00:00:50,567
And we're saying that it goes into the 3700 four hundred times as 4 is sitting in the hundreds place.

12
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:57,500
And that 400 times 8 is 3200 and then we subtract 3200 from 3700, we're getting 500.

13
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,700
But we'll revert back just to traditional long division mechanisc.

14
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,833
But that's what's really going on here:

15
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:08,367
When we say: "8 goes into 37 four times.", we're really saying: "8 goes into 3700 four hundred times."

16
00:01:08,367 --> 00:01:09,767
But let's keep going.

17
00:01:09,767 --> 00:01:15,167
So now we have this 5 to deal with (which is as we already talked about it, it's in the hundreds place so it's really a 500.)

18
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:18,633
But now let's bring down another place value.

19
00:01:18,633 --> 00:01:23,633
So let's bring down the 7 and let's think about how many times does 8 go into 57.

20
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:27,033
(And we're really thinking about how much the 8 goes into 570.)

21
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:38,967
But 8 goes into 57... let's see. 8 times 5 is 40, 8 times 6 is 48, 8 times 7 is 54.

22
00:01:38,967 --> 00:01:41,033
So let's go 7 times.

23
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:44,979
7 times 8, we've already (Oh, actually I did that wrong)...

24
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:52,177
8 times 7 (my multiplication tables are weak!) it is... so does go into seven times,

25
00:01:52,177 --> 00:01:57,300
but 7 times 8 isn't 54, it's 56.
(I always have trouble with that one.)

26
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,567
It is 56.
And so now we subtract again.

27
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:07,433
And 57 minus 56 is 1. And now we have one more place value to bring down.

28
00:02:07,433 --> 00:02:13,433
We have (let me do that in a color I haven't used yet... I'll do blue.) a 1 to bring down.

29
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:16,967
And now we're literally saying: "How many times does 8 go into 11?"

30
00:02:16,967 --> 00:02:22,033
Well, 8 goes into 11 one time, 1 times 8 is 8

31
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:28,100
and we are left with (because we have no more places to bring down): 11 minus 8 is 3.

32
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,100
So 8 goes into 3771 four hundred seventy one times and the remainder here is 3.
