1
00:00:00,952 --> 00:00:03,533
"The owner of a restaurant wants to find out

2
00:00:03,533 --> 00:00:06,067
more about where his patrons are coming from.

3
00:00:06,067 --> 00:00:08,533
One day he decided to gather data about the distance

4
00:00:08,533 --> 00:00:11,540
in miles that people commuted to get to his restaurant.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,933
People reported the following distances traveled."

6
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:16,862
This is our data right over here.

7
00:00:16,862 --> 00:00:19,262
"He wants to create a graph that helps him understand

8
00:00:19,262 --> 00:00:23,754
the spread of the distances and the median distance that people travel.

9
00:00:23,754 --> 00:00:26,467
What kind of a graph should he create?"

10
00:00:26,467 --> 00:00:29,600
And you can plot this data in many different types of graphs,

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,765
but they tend to depict things in different ways.

12
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:34,200
For example, a line graph shows a trend over time.

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,933
He's not interested in a trend over time, so a line graph doesn't make sense.

14
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:40,754
Or a line graph could be a trend of one variable with respect to another variable;

15
00:00:40,754 --> 00:00:42,985
it doesn't just have to be time.

16
00:00:42,985 --> 00:00:44,933
But he doesn't want to see a trend here.

17
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:47,090
A bar graph is good when you're trying to bucket things,

18
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,085
put things into buckets and see how those buckets are performing.

19
00:00:50,085 --> 00:00:53,000
Once again, that's not exactly what he wants to see.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,841
A pie graph, you want to see kind of how things make up a whole.

21
00:00:57,841 --> 00:01:00,267
That's not what he wants to see right over here.

22
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:04,277
A stem and leaf plot does help with distributions a little bit,

23
00:01:04,277 --> 00:01:09,067
but it really doesn't tackle the median distance and the spread really, really well.

24
00:01:09,067 --> 00:01:12,841
So the one that does -- and especially when people talk about medians and spread --

25
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:14,918
is a box-and-whiskers plot.

26
00:01:14,918 --> 00:01:16,417
I'll show you how to do it right now.

27
00:01:16,417 --> 00:01:20,829
Box-and-whiskers. And what a box-and-whiskers plot literally does is

28
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:24,067
it shows the spread of the data, it splits it into quartiles

29
00:01:24,067 --> 00:01:25,426
(I'll talk about that in a second),

30
00:01:25,426 --> 00:01:28,764
and it also shows you where the median of the data actually is.

31
00:01:28,764 --> 00:01:31,510
And that's one of the things that the owner of the restaurant cares about.

32
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,507
So whenever you're dealing with medians --

33
00:01:33,507 --> 00:01:36,000
And box-and-whiskers plots deal with medians --

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,667
the first thing you want to do is order all the numbers.

35
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:41,733
'Cause a median is really the middle number when you order them all up.

36
00:01:41,733 --> 00:01:44,420
So let's order this; let's write it in order.

37
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,333
So, first we have 1 (so get rid of that 1).

38
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:50,400
Then we have one 2 right over here.

39
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,533
And then we have another 2, right over there; that's all of our 2's.

40
00:01:55,533 --> 00:02:00,667
Then we have this 3 (that 3) and then we have that three;

41
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:03,867
so those are two people who've traveled three miles to the restaurant.

42
00:02:03,867 --> 00:02:05,544
And let's see, do we have any 4's?

43
00:02:05,544 --> 00:02:11,600
We have one 4 right over there, and then we have another 4 right over there.

44
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,838
And then, let's see, do we have any 5's?

45
00:02:14,838 --> 00:02:19,267
(Actually I just realized that I skipped one of the 1's. We have another 1 right over there.

46
00:02:19,267 --> 00:02:22,867
So let's write that 1 right over there. We actually had two 1's.)

47
00:02:22,867 --> 00:02:27,533
And then let's see. Do we have any 5's? We do not have any 5's over here.

48
00:02:27,533 --> 00:02:34,180
Do we have any 6's? We have one 6 right over here. Then we have no more 6's.

49
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,267
Do we have any 7's? We have one 7 right over there.

50
00:02:38,267 --> 00:02:42,933
8's? We have an 8 right over there; that's the only one.

51
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:45,210
Let's see. Do we have any 9's? No nines.

52
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:48,533
Any 10's? Yes, we have a 10.

53
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:52,000
Do we have an 11? Yup. 11.

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,600
Do we have any 12's? No 12's, no 13's.

55
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,333
14. And we have a 15.

56
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:03,400
(People must like this restaurant; they're traveling a good bit.)

57
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,800
And we have a 20, and then we have a 22.

58
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,000
So I've ordered all the numbers. Let me make sure I haven't skipped or gotten some duplicates.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:21,400
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 people were surveyed,

60
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,846
seventeen patrons of the restaurant.

61
00:03:22,846 --> 00:03:30,400
And we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

62
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,904
Alright. It seems like I got all of them, and I've ordered them now.

63
00:03:32,904 --> 00:03:34,867
Now the median is the middle number.

64
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:39,133
We just said that we had seventeen of these numbers. So we want the number --

65
00:03:39,133 --> 00:03:44,667
And since it's an odd number of numbers, the median actually will be one of these numbers.

66
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:49,000
It's actually the middle number. It'll be the number where eight are larger and eight are smaller.

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:57,290
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. It looks like this is our median. It will be the ninth number.

68
00:03:57,323 --> 00:04:02,241
And then you have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 that are larger.

69
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:05,867
So eight are smaller than 6; eight are larger than 6.

70
00:04:05,867 --> 00:04:07,827
So 6 is the middle number.

71
00:04:07,827 --> 00:04:09,754
If we had an even number of numbers here,

72
00:04:09,754 --> 00:04:13,231
we had two middle numbers, then we would take the average of them.

73
00:04:13,231 --> 00:04:17,416
But when you have an odd number of data points, then you can just take the middle one.

74
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:21,400
So this right over here is our median.

75
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,600
And then when you do a box plot,

76
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,748
what you want to do is you want to find the median of the set of numbers that are smaller than the median.

77
00:04:28,748 --> 00:04:32,231
And you also want want to find the median of the set of numbers that are larger than the median.

78
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:35,900
And these are called the first quartile and the second quartile.

79
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,400
Because when you do that, you split your data into four sections, or quartiles.

80
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,562
"Quar-" you normally associate with four.

81
00:04:43,562 --> 00:04:47,467
So let's look at this set that's smaller than 6.

82
00:04:47,467 --> 00:04:51,467
So we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 numbers.

83
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:55,867
So if you have eight data points, you're going to actually have two middle numbers.

84
00:04:55,867 --> 00:05:00,600
So, for example, you have these two right over here are the two middle numbers.

85
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,251
Three less, three more. You can't just pick the 2,

86
00:05:04,251 --> 00:05:07,667
because if you just pick the 2, you would have three less and four more.

87
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:11,667
And you can't just pick the 3, because then you'd have three more and four less.

88
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:13,333
So these are our two middle numbers.

89
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,767
So the median of this group right over here is 2.5.

90
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:18,933
I averaged these two middle numbers.

91
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:24,733
And then let's do it over here with this group. (I'll do it in blue.)

92
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:28,237
So once again we have eight numbers, we're going to have two middles,

93
00:05:28,237 --> 00:05:33,200
and so it's going to be the third and the fourth number, which is 11 and 14.

94
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,933
And if you average 11 and 14 --

95
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:42,813
let's see 11+14 is 25, divided by 2 is 12.5.

96
00:05:42,813 --> 00:05:46,933
So this essentially divides the data into four sections.

97
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:52,884
You have everything up to this first quartile -- so you have this first section,

98
00:05:52,884 --> 00:05:55,667
or this first median of the lower half of the data is 2.5.

99
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:58,067
Then you have everything between 2.5 and 6.

100
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:59,313
Then 6 to 12.5,

101
00:05:59,313 --> 00:06:01,667
and then everything more than 12.5.

102
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:07,267
And so a box-and-whiskers plot is essentially a graphical depiction of this over here.

103
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:17,692
So let's do that. I'm going to set up a number line.

104
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:20,800
And let's say that this is 0.

105
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,733
And let's say that this is 10,

106
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:28,667
And this would be 20,

107
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:32,955
And this would be 5 (a little bit cleaner than that).

108
00:06:32,955 --> 00:06:35,333
And this would be 15.

109
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:38,133
25 would be right around there.

110
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:41,914
So first thing on the box and whiskers plot, you want to show the entire range of data.

111
00:06:41,914 --> 00:06:44,533
So our smallest data point starts at 1.

112
00:06:44,533 --> 00:06:49,933
So 1 is right about here. (This is 2-1/2, so 1 is right about here.)

113
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:52,333
And then our largest data point is 22.

114
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:55,067
22 would sit right about there.

115
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:58,818
And I'll even label it, although you often won't see it labeled like that.

116
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:01,200
That's 1, and then that is 22.

117
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,482
And the middle half of the data we do in the box.

118
00:07:05,482 --> 00:07:09,600
So the middle half is this quartile, and this quartile right over there.

119
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:17,867
So the second quartile starts at 2.5. So 2.5 is right there.

120
00:07:17,867 --> 00:07:22,067
This is where we start our box, 2.5.

121
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:26,357
And then our third quartile ends at 12.5.

122
00:07:26,357 --> 00:07:32,533
12.5 is right over there.

123
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:40,777
And then we can draw the box here.

124
00:07:40,777 --> 00:07:44,267
So the box shows where the middle half of our data is.

125
00:07:44,267 --> 00:07:45,867
Now I can draw these two arrows.

126
00:07:45,867 --> 00:07:48,000
So that's the box part.

127
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,017
And then these two arrows are what you would call the whiskers,

128
00:07:51,017 --> 00:07:52,689
and that shows where all the other data is.

129
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:54,941
It's really showing the spread of the data.

130
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:57,467
And then the last thing we need to show is the actual median.

131
00:07:57,467 --> 00:08:01,187
And the median (I'll do it in purple) we already figured out is 6.

132
00:08:01,187 --> 00:08:03,347
So the median sits right about

133
00:08:03,347 --> 00:08:05,018
(so let's see, this is 5, this would be 7-1/2)

134
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:09,361
6 would be right over there.

135
00:08:09,361 --> 00:08:12,200
So with this one diagram, we've actually depicted all of this information,

136
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:18,200
in terms of where is the median? The median is at 6; that is 6 right over there.

137
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:27,333
Where is the middle half of the data? Well, it's between 2-1/2 and 12-1/2.

138
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:33,091
And all of the data, the entire spread, for all of the customers,

139
00:08:33,091 --> 00:08:36,830
sits between -- and this is what the whiskers do for us --

140
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:41,334
it sits between 1 and 22.

141
00:08:41,334 --> 00:08:45,133
And if you wanted to color-code it a little bit better, we could do that just 'cause it's fun.

142
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:46,333
We could make ---

143
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,418
So, this data right over here --

144
00:08:47,418 --> 00:08:51,533
and really, if you think about it, it's kind of inluding this data too --

145
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:56,000
that's what this whisker is depicting.

146
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,420
This data right over here (I'll do that in a different color.)

147
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:07,867
is kind of the first half of the box,

148
00:09:07,867 --> 00:09:10,267
then you have your median in magenta,

149
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:15,421
then this data right over here is the second part of the box.

150
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:19,267
So that's all of this stuff, right over here.

151
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,503
And then finally (let me pick a new color that I haven't used yet)

152
00:09:22,503 --> 00:09:30,654
this data is kind of represented by this part, by this whisker, right over here.

153
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:32,600
Now there's one thing I want to leave you with.

154
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:39,756
I use a method for this box-and-whisker diagram where for the two halves,

155
00:09:39,756 --> 00:09:42,751
I got rid of the median and I found the median of this part,

156
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:44,168
and I found the median of that part.

157
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:46,933
And that's the more typical method for box-and-whisker plots.

158
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:49,903
Sometimes, when you find the median for the lower half and the upper half,

159
00:09:49,903 --> 00:09:54,500
some people will include this median in both sets when they calculate it.

160
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,000
I just want you to know that's out there.

161
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,610
But the way I did it is actually more the mainstream way.

162
00:09:58,610 --> 99:59:59,999
That's the way most calculators, I believe, actually will do a box-and-whisker plot.
