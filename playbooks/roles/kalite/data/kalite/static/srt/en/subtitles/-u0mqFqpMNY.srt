1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
Before we move on to other
functions, let's also take the

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:08,090
partial derivative of our
function here, f of xy, or the

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,000
partial derivative of
z with respect to y.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,520
So let's do it in magenta.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:20,310
So the partial derivative
of z with respect to y.

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,220
Well, now we're saying how much
does z change with respect

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,570
y if x is constant.

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,560
So this x squared we
treat as a constant now.

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,513
So the derivative of a
constant with respect to

11
00:00:30,513 --> 00:00:32,500
y is 0, so ignore it.

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,650
Now this xy term.

13
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,140
The way we're doing it
now is, y is a variable,

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,520
x is a constant.

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,040
So what is the derivative
of, I don't know, 5y

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,920
with respect to y?

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,680
Well it's 5.

18
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,930
So the derivative of xy with
respect to y is just x.

19
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,650
And what's the derivative of
y squared with respect to y?

20
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,430
Well it's just 2y.

21
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,520
So you can see it's
quite symmetric.

22
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,900
The partial of z with respect
to x is 2x plus y, the

23
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,380
partial of z with respect
to y is x plus 2y.

24
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,280
That's because this equation
is pretty symmetric.

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,330
The x's and the y's kind
of do the same thing.

26
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,900
Now, we picked the point x is
equal to 0.2 y is equal to 0.3.

27
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,140
Actually let me erase this,
because I picked a different

28
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,110
point where I graph, and I
graphed it ahead of time

29
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:21,600
just to save time.

30
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,870
So I don't think I have
to include this anymore.

31
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:35,560
So what I did, I picked
the point x is equal to

32
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,760
0.3, y is equal to 0.3.

33
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,510
And when x is equal to
0.3, y is equal to 0.3,

34
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,310
what is z equal to?

35
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,970
Let's see, 0.3 squared is
0.09, 0.3 times 0.3 0.09.

36
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,130
So it's z is equal
to 0.27, right?

37
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,860
Just substitute 0.3
in for x and y.

38
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,020
z is equal to 0.27.

39
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,700
So what is the partial
of z with respect

40
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,080
to x at that point?

41
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:06,190
Or we could write, f
sub x at the point y.

42
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,990
x is equal to 0.3,
y is equal to 0.3.

43
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,450
It equals, we figured that,
let's see 2 times 0.3 is 0.6,

44
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,870
plus 0.3, that's equal to 0.9.

45
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,720
So the slope in the x direction
at that point is 0.9.

46
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,300
And if we take the partial with
respect to y at that same

47
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:29,440
point, 0.3 plus 0.6,
that's also equal to 0.9.

48
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,160
Let's see if we can
visualize this.

49
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,330
Let me bring in my graph.

50
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,340
   

51
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:36,880
There we go.

52
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,880
So this is, this surface once
again is the surface of z is

53
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,430
equal to x squared plus
xy plus y squared.

54
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,320
And this box is kind of the
domain, and the x and y

55
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,590
dimensions that I define.

56
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,040
Kind of, I bounded it because
it starts to increase really

57
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,130
fast, and you wouldn't be able
to see all this interesting

58
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,100
stuff that happens closer in.

59
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,190
But this, what I did, so this
vertical line, I just wanted

60
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,160
to show you that when x is
equal to 0.3, y is equal

61
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,770
to 0.3, z is equal to 0.7.

62
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,740
So that just kind of helps show
you that, ok, that shows what

63
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,950
point we're working with.

64
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,620
And then these two lines, this
is, if you think about it, this

65
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:23,080
is the line where y
is constant, right?

66
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,810
So this is the slope in the
z, or as the surface changes

67
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,580
with respect to x at
this point, right?

68
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,005
This is the tangent
line relative to x.

69
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:37,520
So you could kind of view
it as, if you hold y

70
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,220
constant, here's a tangent
line at that point.

71
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,420
And if you hold x constant,
here's a tangent

72
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,510
line at that point.

73
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,870
And like I said in the last
video, you can actually have

74
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,980
infinite tangent lines.

75
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,300
You have to pick the direction
that you want to go in the xy

76
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,390
plane, and then you could
plot a tangent line.

77
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,790
And so that's why we did
partial derivatives

78
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:57,440
to begin with.

79
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,470
Actually, this is pretty cool.

80
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:08,890
We can actually take, we can
actually zoom in on this.

81
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,230
Zoom it a little bit more.

82
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,460
I want to zoom in on the
part that is interesting,

83
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,660
let me translate this.

84
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,170
   

85
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,960
So that's the part
that's interesting.

86
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,830
And now let me rotate it.

87
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,120
So you can actually rotate.

88
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,652
So this is the tangent.

89
00:04:24,652 --> 00:04:28,140
This shows that the partial
of the function with respect

90
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,790
to y, the slope is 0.9.

91
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,640
And this line shows that the
partial of the slope, or the

92
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,135
partial the function, sorry the
partial of z, or the partial of

93
00:04:38,135 --> 00:04:41,560
the function with respect to
x is 0.9, at this point.

94
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:47,790
At the point x is 0.3, y is
0.3, right? x is 0.3, y is

95
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,830
0.3, z is equal to 0.27.

96
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:55,960
And we can rotate it just
to get more intuition.

97
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,690
I think it's, the graphing
thing looks a little

98
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,460
bit funny sometimes.

99
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,810
But you see that both
of those lines are

100
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,960
tangent at that point.

101
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,807
And in fact, two lines define a
plane, and the plane that's

102
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:09,960
defined by those two lines, or
any of the two tangent lines to

103
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,230
that point, defines a tangent
plane to the surface.

104
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:17,290
So a does have only one tangent
plane, but within a tangent

105
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,990
plane, there are an infinite
number of tangent lines.

106
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,380
Well anyway, that's the
fun with graphing.

107
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,500
Now let's just chug through a
bunch of partial derivative

108
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,680
problems just so that you get
used to the mathematics of it.

109
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,420
Delete that.

110
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,120
   

111
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,340
Let's do some that might
confuse you, so you

112
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,720
see how to do them.

113
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,040
Let's say that f of xy,
and I'm confining it

114
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,630
to three dimensions.

115
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,360
Although we can do it more.

116
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,700
Actually, maybe I'll do it more
dimensions now that we're not

117
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,180
going to try to visualize it.

118
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:59,550
Let's say it's x sine
of x, cosine of y.

119
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,160
So let's take the partial
of f with respect to x.

120
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,080
This is still going to be
a function of x and y.

121
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,200
So we treat y like a constant
So cosine of a constant, this

122
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,820
is just going to be a constant.

123
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,110
So we can almost ignore that.

124
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,220
We could put that out front.

125
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,740
We could say that it's going
to be cosine of y times the

126
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,930
derivative of this
with respect to x.

127
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,690
So you could say, cosine
of y, it's just a number.

128
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,725
This cosine of y could
just be, I don't know,

129
00:06:25,725 --> 00:06:28,200
5 or pi, or whatever.

130
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,380
Cosine of y.

131
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,680
And then, because when you take
the derivative the constant

132
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,140
just comes out of
the derivative.

133
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,940
And then we would take the
derivative of the x's.

134
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,410
So the derivative of the
first term with respect

135
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,780
to x, well that's just 1.

136
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,795
Times the second expression.

137
00:06:39,795 --> 00:06:44,250
So sine of x, I'm just doing
the product rule here.

138
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,820
Plus the derivative of
the second expression,

139
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,000
that's cosine of x.

140
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,710
   

141
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,720
Cosine of x is the derivative
of the second expression, times

142
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,460
the first expression, times x.

143
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,570
So If we wanted to expand it
all out, the partial of f

144
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:07,380
with respect to x, this is
the function of x and y.

145
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:17,910
It equals sine of x, cosine of
y, plus, let's put this x out

146
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:22,690
front, just so we change the
order. x, cosine of

147
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,270
x, cosine of y.

148
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,120
Not too difficult.

149
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,740
You just have to realize
that anything with

150
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,890
the y is a constant.

151
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,540
So let's reverse it.

152
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,260
Well, not reverse it.

153
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,080
Let's take the partial
now in the y direction.

154
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,760
How much does f change
in the y direction if

155
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,350
we hold x constant.

156
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:44,170
So the partial of f with
respect to y, still a

157
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,080
function of x and y.

158
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,790
The derivative in
that direction is a

159
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,930
function of x and y.

160
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,550
So now x is a constant.

161
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,560
So this actually becomes
pretty straightforward.

162
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,170
This whole x, sine of x,
if x is some number, 5,

163
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,080
this is just a constant.

164
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,750
So we can just write
that out front.

165
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,420
So that's just x, sine of x.

166
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:06,770
I know it's hard for you to get
used to saying that, oh, x sine

167
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,020
of x, that's just a
constant number.

168
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,240
Because you're so used to
taking the derivative

169
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,950
with respect to x.

170
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,290
And that's the hardest
part about doing these

171
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,430
partial derivatives.

172
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,950
But anyway, this is
just a constant term.

173
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,290
And now we just take
the derivative of this

174
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,690
with respect to y.

175
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,610
The derivative of cosine
of y with respect to

176
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:21,190
y is minus sine of y.

177
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:21,950
I'll do that in yellow.

178
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,730
Minus sine of y.

179
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,770
I just want to put
the minus out front.

180
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,000
Minus sine of y.

181
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,030
There you have it.

182
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:33,260
Let's do another one.

183
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,050
And actually I'm going
to add more variables.

184
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,680
   

185
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,200
Let's say that, I don't know,
just so you get used to

186
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,260
the different notation.

187
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:54,780
x is equal to a squared times,
I don't know, a squared times b

188
00:08:54,780 --> 00:09:00,360
to the third, times
c to the 1/2 power.

189
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,250
Now what is the partial
derivative of x

190
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:07,560
with respect to a?

191
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,300
Well everything else
is just a constant.

192
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,440
What's the partial of a
squared with respect to a?

193
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,050
Well it's 2a.

194
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,060
So it'll just be 2a
times the constants.

195
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,580
Times b to the third,
c to the 1/2.

196
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,010
I can actually get rid of
my parentheses there.

197
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:26,420
What's the partial derivative
with respect to b?

198
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:31,260
Ah, sorry, what's the partial
of x with respect to b?

199
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,360
Well now, a squared and c to
the 1/2 are just constants.

200
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,170
We can just write that. a
squared, c to the 1/2.

201
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,710
And now we just take the
derivative with respect to b.

202
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,850
Well that's 3b squared.

203
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,160
Times 3b squared.

204
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,390
If I just want to rearrange
it, that's 3a squared, b

205
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,410
squared, c to the 1/2 power.

206
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,160
Not too difficult.

207
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,640
You just have to keep in mind
what's constant and what's not.

208
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,290
And then finally, the partial
of x with respect to c.

209
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,480
a squared, b to the third,
those are both constants.

210
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,560
a squared, b to the third
times derivative of

211
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,960
this with respect to c.

212
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,120
1/2 c to the minus 1/2.

213
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,510
Or we could rewrite this as
a squared, b to the third,

214
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,710
over 2 square root of c.

215
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,770
Just a little bit of
algebraic manipulation.

216
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:25,560
Anyway, I will see you
in the next video.
