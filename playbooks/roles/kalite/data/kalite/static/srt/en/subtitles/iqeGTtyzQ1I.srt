1
00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:02,405
So this diagram over here

2
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:06,969
I have this big triangle and I have all of these other little triangles inside this big triangle

3
00:00:06,969 --> 00:00:11,645
What I want to do is see if I can figure out the measure of this angle right here

4
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:13,619
We will call them measure theta

5
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:15,426
They tell us a few other things

6
00:00:15,426 --> 00:00:18,163
They use this symbol. You might have seen them before

7
00:00:18,163 --> 00:00:21,617
They mean that these are right angles or they have a measure of 90 degrees

8
00:00:21,617 --> 00:00:26,967
So that is a 90 degree angle, a 90 degree angle and that is a 90 degree angle over there

9
00:00:26,967 --> 00:00:30,012
They also tell us this angle over here is 32 degress.

10
00:00:30,012 --> 00:00:32,270
Let's see what we can do

11
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,120
We can solve this in different multiple ways. That's what's really fun about these

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,678
There are multiple ways to solve these problems

13
00:00:37,678 --> 00:00:43,345
So this angle is theta, we have theta is adjacent to this angle

14
00:00:43,345 --> 00:00:49,030
Is adjacent to this green angle and if you add them together you're going to get this right angle

15
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:57,571
So this pink angle theta plus this green angle must be equal to 90 degrees

16
00:00:57,571 --> 00:01:00,913
When you combine them you get a right angle

17
00:01:00,913 --> 00:01:04,645
So you could call this one, its measure is going to be 90 minus theta

18
00:01:04,645 --> 00:01:11,862
And now we have three angles in the triangle and we just have to solve for theta

19
00:01:11,862 --> 00:01:17,010
Cause we know this angle and this angle are going to be equal to 180 degrees

20
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:26,636
So you have 90 minus theta, plus 90 degrees, plus 32 degrees`

21
00:01:26,636 --> 00:01:34,469
Let me do this in a different color. Plus 32 degrees is going to be equal to 180 degrees

22
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:38,765
The sum of the measures of the angle inside of a triangle add up to 180 degrees

23
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,298
That's all that we are doing over here

24
00:01:40,298 --> 00:01:42,347
And so lets see is we can simplify this a little bit.

25
00:01:42,347 --> 00:01:45,247
So if we subtract these two guys

26
00:01:45,247 --> 00:01:54,215
90 plus 90 is going to be 180. So you get 180 minus theta plus 32 is equal to 180 degrees

27
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:57,851
And then we have, what else do we have?

28
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:01,231
We have 180 on both sides. We can subtract that fromboth sides, so that cancels out

29
00:02:01,231 --> 00:02:01,731
That goes to zero

30
00:02:01,731 --> 00:02:02,669
and it would be negative theta plus 32 degrees is equal to zero

31
00:02:02,669 --> 00:02:12,075
You can add theta to both sides and you get 32 degrees is equal to theta

32
00:02:12,075 --> 00:02:15,018
Or theta is equa to 32 degrees

33
00:02:15,018 --> 00:02:19,663
So it's going to actually be the same measure as this angle right over here

34
00:02:19,663 --> 00:02:23,504
That's one wat to do the problem. There are other ways we could have done the problem

35
00:02:23,504 --> 00:02:27,840
We could have said, and actually there are a ton of ways that we could have done this

36
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,751
We could have looked at this big triangle over here and said

37
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:35,377
Look if this is 90 degrees over here, this is 32 degrees over here

38
00:02:35,377 --> 00:02:41,796
This angle up here is going to be 180 minus 90 degrees minus 32 degrees

39
00:02:41,796 --> 00:02:45,942
because they all have to add up to 180 degrees

40
00:02:45,942 --> 00:02:49,900
And I just kind of skipped a step there, obviously this.. actually let me not skip a step

41
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,113
Let me call this "x". If we call the measure of that angle "x"

42
00:02:53,113 --> 00:02:59,207
We have "x" plus 90. I'm looking at the biggest triangle in this diagram right here

43
00:02:59,207 --> 00:03:06,222
"X" plus 90 plus 32 is going to be = to 180 degrees

44
00:03:06,222 --> 00:03:10,029
And so is you subtract 90 and 32 from both sides

45
00:03:10,029 --> 00:03:15,109
So if you subtract 90 from both sides you get "x" plus 32 is equal to 90

46
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:20,751
and then if you subtract 32 from both sides you get "x" is equal to 58 degrees

47
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:24,280
"X" is = to 58 degrees

48
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:30,349
Now what else can we figure out?

49
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:34,477
Now if this angle over here is a right angle

50
00:03:34,477 --> 00:03:37,778
And I'm just re-doing the problem all over again to show you that there are multiple ways to get the

51
00:03:37,778 --> 00:03:38,773
answer

52
00:03:38,773 --> 00:03:43,456
We were given if that is 90 degrees then this angle over here is supplementary to it

53
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:51,648
and it also has to be 90 degrees. So then we have this angle plus 90 degrees plus this angle

54
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:56,278
have to equal 180. Maybe we could call that "y"

55
00:03:56,278 --> 00:04:02,770
So "y" plus 58, plus 90 is equal to 180

56
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:08,109
You can subtract 90 from both sides, this will become 90

57
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:13,300
Subtract 58 from both sides and you will get "y" is = 32 degrees

58
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:18,958
Well if "y" is 32 degrees, it is complementary.

59
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:22,415
It adds up, it's complementary to this angle right over here

60
00:04:22,415 --> 00:04:25,860
Let me do that in a new color

61
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,259
It adds up to 90 degrees

62
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:32,546
It is complementary to this angle right over here

63
00:04:32,546 --> 00:04:34,174
We can call it "z"

64
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:39,106
So these two combined are going to add up to 90 degrees.

65
00:04:39,106 --> 00:04:42,543
Or "z" is going to be equal to 58 degrees

66
00:04:42,543 --> 00:04:44,776
And now we are inside the triangle we care about to figure out theta

67
00:04:44,776 --> 00:04:46,907
Theta that we have already figured out earlier in this video

68
00:04:46,907 --> 00:04:48,939
Well this here is 58 degrees

69
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:54,185
If this angle here is 90 then this angle over here is also going to be 90 because they are supplementary

70
00:04:54,185 --> 00:05:00,186
So you ahve 58 degrees (I wanted to do that in that orange color)

71
00:05:00,186 --> 00:05:10,733
So if you have 58 degrees plus this 90 plus theta

72
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:13,459
this is going to be equal to 180 degreees

73
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:16,400
You can subtract 90 from both sides

74
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,225
that becomes 90

75
00:05:18,225 --> 00:05:21,530
Then you add 58 plus theta is = to 90

76
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,554
Subtract 58 from both sides and you get theta is equal to 32 degrees again

77
00:05:25,554 --> 00:05:31,724
I just wanted to do that to show you that there are multiple ways to do this problem

78
00:05:31,724 --> 00:05:34,653
and as long as you are doing things that are logically consistent

79
00:05:34,653 --> 00:05:36,584
and making assumptions that you can make

80
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:38,603
and then logically deducing step by step

81
00:05:38,603 --> 99:59:59,999
there are multiple ways to get that right answer
