1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,020
We are asked to solve log of x plus log of 3 is equal to

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,040
2 log of 4 minus log of 2.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,160
So let's just rewrite it.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,780
So we have the log of x plus the log of 3

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:20,770
is equal to 2 times the log of 4 minus the log of 2.

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,590
And this is reminder: whenever you see logarithm

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,320
written without a base, the implicit base is 10.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,430
So we could write 10 here, here, here and here.

9
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:32,790
But for the rest of this example,

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,430
I'll just skip writing 10 just cause it'll save a little bit time.

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,570
But remember it only means log base 10.

12
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:39,880
So this expression right over here

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,120
is the power I have to raise 10 to get x.

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,840
Power I have to raise 10 to get 3.

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,900
Now that out of the way,

16
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,440
let's see what logarithm properties we can use.

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,490
So we know -- and these are all the same base --

18
00:00:52,490 --> 00:01:00,490
we know that if we have log base a of b plus log base a of c

19
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:06,040
that this is the same thing as log base a of bc.

20
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,200
And we also know --

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,710
so let me write all of the logarithm properties that we know,

22
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:10,040
over here.

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:16,330
We also know that if we have a logarithm --

24
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,990
let me write it this way actually times log base a of c

25
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:26,530
this is equal to log base a of c to the b-th power.

26
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:27,660
And we also know --

27
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,100
and this is derived really straight from both of these, is:

28
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:36,890
that log base a of b minus log base a of c

29
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:41,430
that this is equal to log base a of b over c.

30
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,500
And this is really straight derived from these two right over here.

31
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,000
Now with that out of the way let's see what we can apply.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,340
So right over here we have -- all of the logs are the same base --

33
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,350
we have logarithm of x plus logarithm of 3,

34
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,140
so by this property right over here --

35
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,510
the sum of the logarithms of the same base

36
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:11,010
this is going to be equal to log base 10 of 3 times x of 3x.

37
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:14,000
Then based on this property right over here

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,010
this thing can be rewritten, this is going to be equal to

39
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:26,500
this can be written as log base 10 of 4 to the second power,

40
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,420
which is really just 16.

41
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:39,130
and then we still have minus logarithm base 10 of 2.

42
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,130
And now using this last property --

43
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:45,010
we know we have one logarithm minus another logarithm.

44
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:50,460
This is going to be equal to log base 10 of 16 over 2,

45
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:56,010
16 divided by 2, which is the same thing as 8.

46
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,030
So right-hand side simplifies to log base 10 of 8

47
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:04,020
the left-hand side is log base 10 of 3x.

48
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,590
So if 10 to some power is going to be equal 3x,

49
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,030
10 to the same power is going to be equal to 8.

50
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,440
So 3x must be equal to 8.

51
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:20,060
3x is equal to 8.

52
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:26,000
And then we can divide both sides by 3.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,520
You get x is equal to 8 over 3.

54
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,050
One way this little step here I said: look this is an exponent.

55
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,570
If I raise 10 to this exponent I get 3x,

56
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,690
10 to this exponent I get 8.

57
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,030
So 8 and 3x must be the same thing.

58
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,050
One other way you could've thought about is:

59
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:46,630
let's take 10 to this power on both sides.

60
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:53,010
So you could say 10 to this power and then 10 to this power over here.

61
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:58,440
If I raise 10 to the power that I need to raise 10 to get 3x

62
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,020
well I'm just going to get 3x!

63
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,610
If I raise 10 to the power that I need to raise 10 to get 8

64
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,270
I'm just going to get 8.

65
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,550
So once again you get 3x is equal to 8.

66
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:12,010
And you can simplify,you get x is equal to 8/3.
