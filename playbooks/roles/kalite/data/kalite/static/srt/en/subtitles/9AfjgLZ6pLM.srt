1
00:00:00,037 --> 00:00:03,143
We'll return back to 1770, and look at what

2
00:00:03,143 --> 00:00:07,173
Leonard Euler said at the time.

3
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:09,332
"Mathematicians have tried in vain

4
00:00:09,332 --> 00:00:10,770
to discover some order

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,375
in the sequence of prime numbers.

6
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:13,828
But we have every reason to believe

7
00:00:13,828 --> 00:00:15,035
that there are some mysteries

8
00:00:15,035 --> 00:00:18,351
which the human mind will never penetrate."

9
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,419
Okay?

10
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:23,422
And thirty years later, here's a quote from Gauss.

11
00:00:23,422 --> 00:00:25,578
"The problem of distinguishing

12
00:00:25,578 --> 00:00:27,504
prime numbers from composite numbers,

13
00:00:27,504 --> 00:00:29,192
and resolving composite numbers into their

14
00:00:29,192 --> 00:00:31,313
prime factors, is known as one of the most

15
00:00:31,313 --> 00:00:34,769
important and useful [problems] in the arithmetic.

16
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:38,359
All methods that have been proposed thus far

17
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:41,578
are either restricted to very special cases,

18
00:00:41,578 --> 00:00:45,042
or are so difficult that they try the patience

19
00:00:45,042 --> 00:00:48,026
of even the practiced calculator.

20
00:00:48,026 --> 00:00:50,657
The dignity of science itself seems to require

21
00:00:50,657 --> 00:00:53,140
that every possible means be explored

22
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,501
for the solution of a problem

23
00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:58,145
so elegant and so celebrated."

24
00:00:58,145 --> 00:00:59,510
Wow!

25
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,753
So these two great thinkers have really

26
00:01:01,753 --> 00:01:04,561
set the stage for the challenge ahead of us.

27
00:01:04,561 --> 00:01:08,308
And now, I'm going to fast-forward to 2010,

28
00:01:08,308 --> 00:01:09,561
and show you a paper

29
00:01:09,561 --> 00:01:11,573
that came out of the 'RSA competition' --

30
00:01:11,573 --> 00:01:14,188
which is a competition that no longer runs.

31
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:16,275
But the purpose of the competition was

32
00:01:16,275 --> 00:01:17,759
to put out a large number and say,

33
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,707
"Can anyone factor it?"

34
00:01:19,707 --> 00:01:23,118
So in 2010, this winning team

35
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,500
factored a 768-bit number.

36
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,110
(And that means it was a 232-digit number,

37
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,179
if you're thinking in base ten.)

38
00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:35,865
So this team -- in 2010 -- they won the competition

39
00:01:35,865 --> 00:01:39,381
by factoring a 232-digit number.

40
00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:44,152
So that's how far we have come from Euler to --

41
00:01:44,152 --> 00:01:45,668
(Or we can go back to Euclid.)

42
00:01:45,668 --> 00:01:47,424
But from from Euler to 2010,

43
00:01:47,424 --> 00:01:49,258
we're at 232-digit numbers.

44
00:01:49,258 --> 00:01:51,327
And here was the answer in their paper.

45
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:54,822
So this was the first prime.

46
00:01:55,237 --> 00:01:56,855
This was p1.

47
00:01:57,163 --> 00:01:59,312
And this was p2.

48
00:01:59,312 --> 00:02:03,174
So this is the state of the art right now.

49
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,626
Okay. How did they factor this number?

50
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,369
And what are the state-of-the-art techniques?

51
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:08,637
Well, we're going to go back

52
00:02:08,637 --> 00:02:10,152
and build from the beginning.

53
00:02:10,152 --> 00:02:13,766
And this kind of defines 'computational number theory.'

54
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:16,980
That is the topic of this adventure.

55
00:02:17,118 --> 00:02:19,726
So what does computational number theory mean?

56
00:02:19,726 --> 00:02:23,328
Well, 'computation' comes from the Greek word for 'gravel.'

57
00:02:23,328 --> 00:02:25,379
Stones were used for counting.

58
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,594
Computation is any type of calculation --

59
00:02:27,594 --> 00:02:30,127
whether you're using stones, or a ruler,

60
00:02:30,127 --> 00:02:31,978
or a slide rule, or a calculator,

61
00:02:31,978 --> 00:02:34,365
or this cool looking machine --

62
00:02:34,365 --> 00:02:37,279
which is Babbage's 'Difference Engine' --

63
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:40,657
which was a hand-powered calculator.

64
00:02:40,657 --> 00:02:42,311
It doesn't matter what you're using

65
00:02:42,311 --> 00:02:44,128
or [if] you're using a computer -- [or not].

66
00:02:44,128 --> 00:02:46,058
You're doing some sort of computation.

67
00:02:46,058 --> 00:02:48,953
And now, what kind of computation are we doing?

68
00:02:48,953 --> 00:02:51,587
Number theory.

69
00:02:51,587 --> 00:02:55,271
And that involves this mysterious distribution

70
00:02:55,271 --> 00:02:58,392
of prime numbers -- studying this distribution.

71
00:02:58,392 --> 00:02:59,731
And what we're actually looking at

72
00:02:59,731 --> 00:03:02,107
is 'multiplicative' number theory --

73
00:03:02,107 --> 00:03:03,052
which is questions of

74
00:03:03,052 --> 00:03:05,493
"How do you factorize numbers?"

75
00:03:05,493 --> 00:03:07,401
"How do you tell me if a number is prime?"

76
00:03:07,401 --> 00:03:09,331
-- and so forth.

77
00:03:09,332 --> 00:03:13,659
And we begin with a very simple question, or --

78
00:03:14,075 --> 00:03:16,624
not a question -- a challenge.

79
00:03:16,624 --> 00:03:20,061
We need to build a machine which takes an input --

80
00:03:20,077 --> 00:03:22,344
(And that input is some integer, 'x.')

81
00:03:22,344 --> 00:03:24,929
And all that machine needs to do

82
00:03:24,929 --> 00:03:31,533
is output 'true' or 'false.'

83
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:34,329
And that is the first step.

84
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:35,706
Now we will use the

85
00:03:35,706 --> 00:03:36,840
[Khan Academy] computer-science tool

86
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,939
to actually build this machine together.

87
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:40,981
And one of the questions

88
00:03:40,981 --> 00:03:44,596
that we will be asking is two things --

89
00:03:44,596 --> 00:03:46,370
two aspects to this machine.

90
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,715
How much time --

91
00:03:48,715 --> 00:03:49,876
That's a clock. [CHUCKLES]

92
00:03:49,876 --> 00:03:53,282
How much time does it take to get the solution?

93
00:03:53,282 --> 00:03:56,890
And how much space does it need?

94
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,543
And when I say 'space,'

95
00:03:58,543 --> 00:03:59,873
I mean -- for example, in the case of

96
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:01,696
this mechanical calculator -- physical space.

97
00:04:01,696 --> 00:04:04,082
How many rooms do we need to hold our machine?

98
00:04:04,082 --> 00:04:05,798
Or if we're using a computer,

99
00:04:05,798 --> 00:04:10,066
how much memory does it need?

100
00:04:10,066 --> 00:04:11,566
So we will be returning

101
00:04:11,566 --> 00:04:14,000
to these two ideas as we go.
