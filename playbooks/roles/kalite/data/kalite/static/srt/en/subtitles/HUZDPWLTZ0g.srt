00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:09,154
We are looking at a painting by Salvador Dali in the Tate Modern.

2
00:00:09,154 --> 00:00:14,297
It’s Methamorphosis of Narcissus and it dates to 1937. It’s pretty well painted.

3
00:00:14,297 --> 00:00:19,937
So what I see is this hand that seems to be emerging from the earth

4
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:24,606
that holds an eggfrom which seems to be hatching Narcissus.

5
00:00:24,606 --> 00:00:29,169
Except that so many of Dali’s paintings and rendering in Dali’s paintings

6
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:33,979
which are painted in a kind of classical manner in terms of it’s sort of… It’s very realistic.

7
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:38,851
It’s precision, it’s careful, it’s rendering of space even if that space is distorted of shadow, of line,

8
00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:44,205
If we look at the egg from which the flower is emerging it seems to be emerging from a crack

9
00:00:44,205 --> 00:00:47,798
that is also the shadow of the flower at the same moment.

10
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,928
And so it’s both of those things simultaneously.

11
00:00:50,928 --> 00:00:56,607
And in fact the whole painting seems to be about forms being one thing and at the same moment another.

12
00:00:56,607 --> 00:01:03,238
Because there is behind that hand another hand that seems to be emerging from a pool of water.

13
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:08,352
This time not rock, but something because it’s brown and seems more earth – like

14
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:13,761
and holding also an egg- like shape but actually looks a bit more like a walnut

15
00:01:13,761 --> 00:01:19,048
but it also has a crack and from seems to emerge hair that looks like a flame.

16
00:01:19,048 --> 00:01:25,369
Because the hand is in that second iteration not so much hand as actually a crouching body.

17
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:29,543
The body of Narcissus. You can see knees and arms.

18
00:01:29,543 --> 00:01:33,029
But what’s wonderfull is that whereas the figure that is yellow on the left

19
00:01:33,029 --> 00:01:36,820
slightly further back is the body where the head is a walnut,

20
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:41,942
on the right it’s more clearly a close up of a hand holding an egg

21
00:01:41,942 --> 00:01:45,053
and yet there are precisely the same forms.

22
00:01:45,053 --> 00:01:48,591
It’s that doubling, it’s that mirror that is so incredibly disconcerting.

23
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:52,451
All these needs to be contextualized – what in the world is Dali doing.

24
00:01:52,451 --> 00:01:56,906
Well, what he said he was doing, while Andre Breton have lauded him for,

25
00:01:56,906 --> 00:02:00,533
he was writer and often seen as one of the leaders or the surrealism movement.

26
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:05,671
And he wrote the surrealism Manifesto. Right, all of those surrealism Manifestos, there is a number of them, yes.

27
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:11,670
They called the ability of Dali to do this, to see things simultaneously, as more than one thing.

28
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:17,085
It is a result of a psychological state, which they call a paranoid critical activity. Sounds scary and dangerous.

29
00:02:17,085 --> 00:02:26,151
Well I think they loved the fact that it was scary and dangerous and it was based on some kind of willful misreading of Freud.

30
00:02:26,151 --> 00:02:31,727
You know, Freud talked about the filters that kept the conscious and unconscious mind apart.

31
00:02:31,727 --> 00:02:36,218
But Dali claimed that in the state of paranoid critical activity

32
00:02:36,218 --> 00:02:41,268
he could actually embrace both the conscious and unconscious simultaneously

33
00:02:41,268 --> 00:02:44,296
so that his conscious mind could actually do the painitng,

34
00:02:44,296 --> 00:02:47,976
the brilliance of understanding that form is both the hand and the body,

35
00:02:47,976 --> 00:02:54,902
it’s flash and stone simultaneously, that Dali would have claimed was absolutely result not of a rational mind,

36
00:02:54,902 --> 00:03:01,059
impossible in the rational it was a result of the irrational, of a conversation between those two states.

37
00:03:01,059 --> 00:03:08,336
In the state of paranoid critical activity… Ok, it was incredibly important to the surrealists

38
00:03:08,336 --> 00:03:16,804
– to access that unconscious, to access something that was more authentic, that lacked the control of the conscious mind.

39
00:03:16,804 --> 00:03:22,450
– And for them that was the engine of creativity, absolutely, it was this motherload of the creative,

40
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:27,324
I mean, when we think back to the nineteenth century, we think back to the artist like Gauigain, wanting to get back to nature,

41
00:03:27,324 --> 00:03:34,451
of Courbet wanting to get back to the nature – the unconscious for the surrealists that was the great goal, you know, that was it.

42
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:38,568
So what is so interesting is the surrealists go after this, for a number of different points of view.

43
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:46,876
People like Miro will try to, in a sense of – allow for the unconscious to emerge and paint using the automatic methods

44
00:03:46,876 --> 00:03:52,768
that is not allowing the conscious mind to interpret, whereas Dali is sort of wanting both

45
00:03:52,768 --> 00:03:56,768
– he wants the perfection of the academic style to render the inspiration of the unconscious.
