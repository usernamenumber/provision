1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,687
I've got a handful of matrices here - I have the matrix A, that's an M by N matrix.

2
00:00:05,692 --> 00:00:09,913
You can see it has N columns and M rows.

3
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:12,933
And actually let me throw in one entry there, it might be useful.

4
00:00:12,933 --> 00:00:14,756
This is the...

5
00:00:14,756 --> 00:00:17,748
This is the Jth column, so the Mth row is gonna look like this

6
00:00:17,748 --> 00:00:20,692
A m j. That's that entry right there.

7
00:00:20,692 --> 00:00:23,475
And then I have matrix B defined similarly

8
00:00:23,475 --> 00:00:24,600
but instead of being an

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,198
m by n matrix, B is an n by m matrix.

10
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:31,852
So this entry right here

11
00:00:32,005 --> 00:00:33,600
let me just, I might

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,000
I realize this might be useful

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,800
this is going to be my nth row,

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,311
this is going to be my jth column

15
00:00:39,311 --> 00:00:41,842
And then I also wrote out their transposes

16
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:44,333
so if you look at the transpose of B

17
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:47,467
B was an N by M matrix

18
00:00:47,467 --> 00:00:51,267
now the transpose is going to be M by N matrix.

19
00:00:51,267 --> 00:00:53,667
And each of its rows become its columns

20
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:56,133
and the same thing I did for A,

21
00:00:56,133 --> 00:00:57,800
its transpose is right there

22
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,137
A was M by N, the transposes N by M

23
00:01:02,137 --> 00:01:05,251
and each of these rows become each of these columns.

24
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:06,692
Now, fair enough.

25
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:10,333
Let's define two new matrices right now.

26
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:13,839
Let's define the matrix C.

27
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:15,356
Let's define the matrix C.

28
00:01:15,356 --> 00:01:16,513
Let me do it over here where

29
00:01:16,513 --> 00:01:17,515
Let me do it over here

30
00:01:17,515 --> 00:01:19,933
I think...I think the real estate well be valuable

31
00:01:19,933 --> 00:01:21,292
in this video

32
00:01:21,323 --> 00:01:22,880
Let's define my matrix C as being equal to

33
00:01:23,064 --> 00:01:26,098
the product of A and B

34
00:01:26,205 --> 00:01:29,513
So what's...what are going to be the dimensions of C?

35
00:01:29,513 --> 00:01:33,089
Well an M by N matrix times an N by M matrix,

36
00:01:33,089 --> 00:01:35,086
these two have to be equal

37
00:01:35,086 --> 00:01:37,748
even for the matrix...matrix product to be defined.

38
00:01:37,748 --> 00:01:38,405
And it's going to result

39
00:01:38,482 --> 00:01:40,821
with an M by N matrix.

40
00:01:41,052 --> 00:01:43,700
So it's going to be an M by M matrix.

41
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,333
Now's let define another matrix,

42
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,846
let's call it D. D...

43
00:01:47,846 --> 00:01:51,467
And it's equal to B tranpose

44
00:01:51,467 --> 00:01:54,885
B transpose times A transpose.

45
00:01:54,977 --> 00:01:57,113
And the dimensions are going to be the same

46
00:01:57,113 --> 00:02:00,604
because this is an M by N times an N by M.

47
00:02:00,604 --> 00:02:02,246
So these are the same.

48
00:02:02,246 --> 00:02:04,433
which is a requirement for this product to be defined

49
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:06,224
and so the dimensions of B

50
00:02:06,224 --> 00:02:10,652
are going to be M by M. M by M.

51
00:02:10,652 --> 00:02:13,817
So let's explore a little bit what the different entries

52
00:02:13,817 --> 00:02:16,067
of C are going to look like.

53
00:02:16,067 --> 00:02:18,153
So let me write my matrix C

54
00:02:18,153 --> 00:02:19,662
right here.

55
00:02:19,662 --> 00:02:20,605
So it's just going to have

56
00:02:20,605 --> 00:02:21,318
a bunch of entries

57
00:02:21,364 --> 00:02:26,007
C one one, C two two, C one two...

58
00:02:26,007 --> 00:02:29,291
all the way to C one M.

59
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,400
You can imagine it's cause its an M by N matrix

60
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,043
you're going to have C M M over here

61
00:02:33,043 --> 00:02:36,133
you know how the...you know how this drill goes.

62
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:37,113
But what I'm curious about is

63
00:02:37,498 --> 00:02:41,533
how do we figure out what C...the general C, i, j is?

64
00:02:41,533 --> 00:02:44,478
How do we figure out what a particular entry is?

65
00:02:44,478 --> 00:02:46,013
We know that C

66
00:02:46,013 --> 00:02:47,852
is the products of A and B.

67
00:02:47,852 --> 00:02:50,385
So to get to a particular entry in C...

68
00:02:50,385 --> 00:02:51,585
and we've seen this before

69
00:02:51,585 --> 00:02:52,512
so let's...

70
00:02:52,681 --> 00:02:54,069
a particular entry in C

71
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:56,436
so C, i, j

72
00:02:56,436 --> 00:02:58,001
it's going to be

73
00:02:58,001 --> 00:02:59,005
you can view it as

74
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:03,733
the dot product of the ith row in A

75
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:05,783
the ith row in A

76
00:03:05,783 --> 00:03:10,357
with the jth column in B

77
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,679
with the jth column in B

78
00:03:12,679 --> 00:03:14,200
just like that

79
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,200
And what's that going to be equal to?

80
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,160
It's going to be equal to

81
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,171
A, i,1...

82
00:03:19,171 --> 00:03:23,151
A, i, 1 times B, 1, j

83
00:03:23,151 --> 00:03:25,218
B, 1, j

84
00:03:25,218 --> 00:03:27,401
plus A, i, 2

85
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:29,000
A, i, 2

86
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,400
times B, 2, j...B, 2, j

87
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,559
and you're just going to keep going

88
00:03:33,652 --> 00:03:34,774
until you get to the last term here

89
00:03:34,774 --> 00:03:36,874
A, i, n

90
00:03:36,874 --> 00:03:37,692
A, i, n

91
00:03:37,692 --> 00:03:41,031
times the last term here B, n, j.

92
00:03:41,031 --> 00:03:42,400
B, n, j.

93
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,098
Fair enough.

94
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:46,467
Now, what about our matrix D...

95
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:49,267
What are its entries going to look like?

96
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:52,800
So D, similarly, it's going to look like

97
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,733
you know, you are going to have

98
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,613
d 1 1, d 1 2

99
00:03:55,613 --> 00:03:59,700
sorry...d, 1, 2, all the way to

100
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,785
d 1 m, you're going to have d m n

101
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:04,303
I could keep putting entries here,

102
00:04:04,472 --> 00:04:05,616
but I'm curious about just the

103
00:04:05,616 --> 00:04:07,133
some general entry here

104
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:08,462
let's say I want to find

105
00:04:08,462 --> 00:04:13,867
D sub j i

106
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:14,902
D sub j i

107
00:04:14,902 --> 00:04:16,154
That's what I want to find.

108
00:04:16,154 --> 00:04:17,445
So I want to find a general way

109
00:04:17,445 --> 00:04:20,133
for any particular entry of D.

110
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:22,200
The jth row and the ith column

111
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,995
which is a little bit different than

112
00:04:22,995 --> 00:04:24,354
the convention we normally use

113
00:04:24,369 --> 00:04:26,313
for these letters...but it's fine.

114
00:04:26,313 --> 00:04:28,287
The first one is D's row

115
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,952
the second one is D's...is this entry's column.

116
00:04:31,952 --> 00:04:34,367
So how do we figure that out?

117
00:04:34,367 --> 00:04:39,290
So D sub j i

118
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,400
It's going to be equal to

119
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,871
D is the product of these two guys.

120
00:04:41,871 --> 00:04:44,279
So to get the jth row

121
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:47,067
and ith column entry here

122
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:48,302
we essentially take the dot product

123
00:04:48,302 --> 00:04:50,129
of the jth row here

124
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:54,005
So we're going to take the dot product of the jth row here.

125
00:04:54,005 --> 00:04:56,400
Which is is that right there.

126
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,067
With the ith column of A,

127
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:01,067
with the ith column A.

128
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,831
which is that right there.

129
00:05:02,892 --> 00:05:05,133
So I'm going to take the dot product of that.

130
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:07,067
And you might already see something interesting here.

131
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:11,333
This thing right here is equivalent to

132
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,933
that thing right there.

133
00:05:13,933 --> 00:05:15,373
And this thing right here

134
00:05:15,373 --> 00:05:16,800
is equivalent to that thing right there,

135
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,333
because we took the transposes.

136
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,298
But let's actually

137
00:05:19,298 --> 00:05:21,052
just write it out.

138
00:05:21,052 --> 00:05:22,821
So what is this dot product

139
00:05:22,821 --> 00:05:24,843
going to be equal to?

140
00:05:24,843 --> 00:05:25,800
Well it's going to be

141
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,853
B, i, j

142
00:05:26,853 --> 00:05:27,815
well let me write it this way

143
00:05:27,815 --> 00:05:28,989
it's going to be B i j times

144
00:05:28,989 --> 00:05:29,658
A

145
00:05:29,658 --> 00:05:30,173
i

146
00:05:30,173 --> 00:05:31,183
one.

147
00:05:31,183 --> 00:05:32,529
Or we could write it as

148
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:37,600
A i one times B one j.

149
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,894
And it's going to be plus B 2 j times

150
00:05:39,894 --> 00:05:41,217
A i 2, which is

151
00:05:41,217 --> 00:05:43,667
the same thing as A i 2 times B 2 j.

152
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:47,556
A i 2 times B 2 j.

153
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:48,400
And you are going to keep going

154
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,223
until you get B n j times A i n.

155
00:05:52,223 --> 00:05:53,292
Or, you could write that as

156
00:05:53,292 --> 00:05:56,267
A i n times B n j.

157
00:05:56,267 --> 00:05:58,980
B n j.

158
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,333
Now, notice something.

159
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,867
These two things are equivalent.

160
00:06:01,867 --> 00:06:03,333
They are completely equivalent statements.

161
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,131
The...

162
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:08,333
D sub j i is equivalent to C sub i j.

163
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,405
Let me write that.

164
00:06:10,405 --> 00:06:14,267
So D....or I could write C sub i j,

165
00:06:14,267 --> 00:06:15,667
is equivalent to

166
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,973
D sub j i.

167
00:06:18,973 --> 00:06:20,200
Or another way you could say it is

168
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,897
anything that's at row...

169
00:06:22,897 --> 00:06:24,667
all that entries that's at row i

170
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:26,403
column j,

171
00:06:26,403 --> 00:06:31,175
in C, is now in row j column i in D.

172
00:06:31,175 --> 00:06:33,810
And this is true for all the entries.

173
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,897
True for all entries.

174
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,648
I stayed as general as possible.

175
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:40,975
So what does this mean?

176
00:06:40,975 --> 00:06:43,733
This is the definition of a transpose.

177
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:45,733
So we now get that C

178
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:49,400
C transpose is equal to D.

179
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,595
Or you could say that C is equal to

180
00:06:51,595 --> 00:06:53,604
D transpose.

181
00:06:53,604 --> 00:06:54,882
Now this is pretty interesting,

182
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:56,515
cause how did we define these two?

183
00:06:56,515 --> 00:07:01,233
We said that our matrix C

184
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:03,278
is equal to our matrice...

185
00:07:03,477 --> 00:07:06,481
our matrice...the matrix product A and B.

186
00:07:06,481 --> 00:07:07,405
And we said that D

187
00:07:07,405 --> 00:07:09,407
is equal to, our matrix product

188
00:07:09,407 --> 00:07:12,733
B transposed times A transposed.

189
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:16,000
I did that...those definitions right there.

190
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,733
Here are the definitions.

191
00:07:17,733 --> 00:07:19,867
Now we just found out that

192
00:07:19,867 --> 00:07:23,153
D is equal to the transpose of C.

193
00:07:23,153 --> 00:07:26,200
So we could write that C transpose

194
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,933
which is the same thing as A times B

195
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:32,800
transposed, is equal to D.

196
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,902
So it is equal to D, which is just

197
00:07:34,902 --> 00:07:38,060
B transpose, A transpose.

198
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,400
And this is a pretty neat takeaway.

199
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,425
This is a pretty neat takeaway here.

200
00:07:43,425 --> 00:07:47,394
If I take the product of two matrices, and then

201
00:07:47,394 --> 00:07:49,600
transpose it, it's equivalent to

202
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,735
switching the order, or transposing them

203
00:07:52,735 --> 00:07:55,893
and then taking the product of the reversed order.

204
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:58,667
B transpose, A transpose.

205
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:01,234
Which is a pretty pretty neat takeaway.

206
00:08:01,234 --> 00:08:03,579
And you can actually extend this to an arbitrary

207
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:06,319
number of matrices that you are taking the

208
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,735
product of. If you're taking...

209
00:08:07,735 --> 00:08:09,533
I'm not proving it here, but it's actually

210
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:12,733
a very simple extension from this right now.

211
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:15,000
If you take the matrices, let's say,

212
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,102
A...let me do a different...different letters.

213
00:08:18,102 --> 00:08:23,000
X Y Z. If you take their product and then

214
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,333
transpose it, it's equal to Z transpose, Y transpose,

215
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:30,000
X transpose.

216
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,733
I haven't proven this general case

217
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:33,556
and you could keep doing it with 4 or 5

218
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:36,800
or N matrices multiplied by each other.

219
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,269
But it generally works.

220
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:40,057
And you could...essentially prove it

221
00:08:40,057 --> 00:08:42,333
using what we proved in this video right here.

222
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,400
That you take the product of two matrices,

223
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,067
take their transposes equal to

224
00:08:46,067 --> 99:59:59,999
the product of their transposes in reverse order.
