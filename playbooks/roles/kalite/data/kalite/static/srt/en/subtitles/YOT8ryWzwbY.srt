1
00:00:00,677 --> 00:00:01,852
What I want to do in this video is

2
00:00:01,852 --> 00:00:04,224
focus a little bit more on the results of the last video.

3
00:00:04,224 --> 00:00:07,799
Make sure that they make intuitive and mathematical sense to us

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,307
because something slightly strange happened.

5
00:00:10,307 --> 00:00:13,724
We had a linear demand curve right over here,

6
00:00:13,724 --> 00:00:17,726
which means for any given change in price right over here.

7
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,116
So in all of the examples,

8
00:00:19,116 --> 00:00:22,149
whether we went from A to B or C to D or E to F,

9
00:00:22,149 --> 00:00:25,349
we had a $1 drop in price.

10
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:30,126
we had a $1 drop in price.....a $1 drop in price.

11
00:00:30,126 --> 00:00:32,228
And every time we had a $1 drop in price

12
00:00:32,228 --> 00:00:34,188
we had a $2 increase, oh sorry,

13
00:00:34,188 --> 00:00:37,362
we had a 2 unit increase in quantity demanded.

14
00:00:37,362 --> 00:00:40,734
So we had a 2 unit increase in quantity demanded.

15
00:00:40,734 --> 00:00:43,030
This is a linear demand curve.

16
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:48,331
But despite the fact that for each dollar drop in price,

17
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:50,319
we had the same increase in quantity demanded.

18
00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:53,275
The slightly maybe un-intuitive thing that happened

19
00:00:53,275 --> 00:00:55,598
was that we had a slight, we had a different -

20
00:00:55,598 --> 00:00:58,740
actually very different elasticity of demand.

21
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,177
And you might imagine that

22
00:01:00,177 --> 00:01:01,872
it probably had something to do with the fact that

23
00:01:01,872 --> 00:01:03,792
elasticity of demand is based on

24
00:01:03,792 --> 00:01:09,407
% change in quantity relative to % change in prices,

25
00:01:09,407 --> 00:01:12,168
instead of just change in quantity over change in price.

26
00:01:12,168 --> 00:01:14,538
If it was just change in quantity over change in price,

27
00:01:14,538 --> 00:01:16,838
we would get something...it would be constant.

28
00:01:16,838 --> 00:01:19,468
But we saw very very different results.

29
00:01:19,468 --> 00:01:21,337
When you look closely at these,

30
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:25,455
so let's focus on this region between A and B right over here,

31
00:01:25,455 --> 00:01:27,391
we had a $1 change in price.

32
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:30,669
Our $1 change in price was on a relatively large base,

33
00:01:30,669 --> 00:01:32,087
our price was already high.

34
00:01:32,087 --> 00:01:35,153
Remember we used to figure out the % change,

35
00:01:35,153 --> 00:01:37,068
we use a dollar over the average,

36
00:01:37,068 --> 00:01:38,876
the average of our 2 points.

37
00:01:38,876 --> 00:01:40,464
so we don't do $1 over 9

38
00:01:40,464 --> 00:01:42,700
because then we would have a different elasticity

39
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,584
when we went from A to B

40
00:01:44,584 --> 00:01:46,150
then when we went from B to A.

41
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,042
A dollar over 9 versus a dollar over 8

42
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:49,908
would give you 2 different percentages.

43
00:01:49,908 --> 00:01:52,090
Instead we say a dollar over eight and a half.

44
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,547
So this per price % change was in the teens

45
00:01:55,547 --> 00:02:00,122
while this quantity % change is going to be with 67%

46
00:02:00,122 --> 00:02:03,698
2 over an average quantity of 3

47
00:02:03,698 --> 00:02:05,480
in this region right over here.

48
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,557
So you had a relatively large,

49
00:02:07,557 --> 00:02:09,786
actually quite large % change in quantity

50
00:02:09,786 --> 00:02:13,492
over relatively small % change in price.

51
00:02:13,492 --> 00:02:16,203
67% over something that's in,

52
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:19,171
roughly in the mid-teens percentage.

53
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:22,933
And so that's why the absolute value of our elasticity of demand

54
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:24,651
was a relatively large number.

55
00:02:24,651 --> 00:02:26,426
If you don't think about the absolute value,

56
00:02:26,426 --> 00:02:27,287
you get a negative number

57
00:02:27,287 --> 00:02:31,052
because this is a downward sloping line.

58
00:02:31,052 --> 00:02:32,972
But if you focus on the absolute value,

59
00:02:32,972 --> 00:02:35,926
it's a - the magnitude of it- is a relatively large number,

60
00:02:35,926 --> 00:02:39,174
a relatively large % change in quantity

61
00:02:39,174 --> 00:02:41,635
relative to your % change in price.

62
00:02:41,635 --> 00:02:43,713
And it all comes out of, your quantities are low here.

63
00:02:43,713 --> 00:02:45,787
So if you move 2 on a low base,

64
00:02:45,787 --> 00:02:48,199
you are going to have a large % change in quantity

65
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:50,334
and your prices are relatively high here.

66
00:02:50,334 --> 00:02:53,666
So a change in 1 isn't going to be that large of a percentage.

67
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,892
But what you have,

68
00:02:55,892 --> 00:02:58,831
when your absolute value of your elasticity of demand

69
00:02:58,831 --> 00:03:01,693
is greater than 1, like it is right over here,

70
00:03:01,693 --> 00:03:04,884
so when your absolute value of your elasticity of demand

71
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,542
is greater than 1,

72
00:03:06,542 --> 00:03:09,791
it's usually called, at this point in the curve,

73
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:15,386
is ELASTIC or generally elastic. So this is elastic.

74
00:03:15,386 --> 00:03:18,028
You get some nice % movements in quantity

75
00:03:18,028 --> 00:03:20,830
for given % change in price.

76
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:24,318
Then when you go over here, our prices have gone -

77
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:26,055
our prices are lower

78
00:03:26,055 --> 00:03:28,407
when we are in this region between C and D.

79
00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:30,536
So that dollar difference is going to be

80
00:03:30,536 --> 00:03:32,578
a larger % change in price

81
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:34,528
and our quantities are higher,

82
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:37,902
so that $2 change is going to be a lower change in quantity,

83
00:03:37,902 --> 00:03:39,836
and actually end up being the same thing,

84
00:03:39,836 --> 00:03:41,465
because you have a dollar change in price

85
00:03:41,465 --> 00:03:44,094
over an average base of 5, right?

86
00:03:44,094 --> 00:03:46,758
The average between 5.50 and 4.50 is 5.

87
00:03:46,758 --> 00:03:50,846
So if you have a 20% change in price, a 20% drop in price,

88
00:03:50,846 --> 00:03:54,504
and you have a 20% increase in quantity -

89
00:03:54,504 --> 00:03:58,108
a 20% increase in quantity.

90
00:03:58,108 --> 00:04:00,365
So let me write, this isn't the teens over here,

91
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,926
my writing fitting is too small so I won't do that.

92
00:04:02,926 --> 00:04:04,785
So you have a 20% change in price

93
00:04:04,785 --> 00:04:06,550
and a 20% increase in quantity.

94
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,999
That's 20% because you have 2 over the average here.

95
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,961
2 over 10, so 20% increase.

96
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,423
So that's why your elasticity of demand or

97
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,793
the magnitude of your elasticity of demand is exactly 1.

98
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:23,303
And if your magnitude of your elasticity of demand is exactly 1,

99
00:04:23,303 --> 00:04:26,852
we say that you have UNIT ELASTICITY at that point,

100
00:04:26,852 --> 00:04:29,030
elasticity.

101
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,980
And then finally if you go all the way down here,

102
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,040
our prices end up being quite low -

103
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,496
our prices are quite low

104
00:04:35,496 --> 00:04:39,948
so a dollar change is actually a huge % price change, right?

105
00:04:39,948 --> 00:04:44,700
Our average base here is $1.50 in this region right over here.

106
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,191
And so a dollar over a $1.50.

107
00:04:47,191 --> 00:04:54,541
It's a huge, it's actually a 67% change in price.

108
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:57,978
67, yep that's right. yeah $1 is a 2/3 change in price.

109
00:04:57,978 --> 00:04:59,970
it's a huge % change in price.

110
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,909
But once again now our quantity is much larger

111
00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:06,080
so $2 increase isn't that large of a change in quantity.

112
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,100
So you have a smaller % change in quantity

113
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,387
over a large % change in price.

114
00:05:11,387 --> 00:05:14,154
So that just means you're relatively inelastic.

115
00:05:14,154 --> 00:05:17,194
You are not getting a lot of change in quantity

116
00:05:17,194 --> 00:05:20,617
for the magnitude of your change in price.

117
00:05:20,617 --> 00:05:21,782
So if your -

118
00:05:21,782 --> 00:05:25,004
If the magnitude of the elasticity of demand

119
00:05:25,004 --> 00:05:27,138
is less than 1 over here,

120
00:05:27,138 --> 00:05:30,984
we call that either relatively inelastic or just inelastic.

121
00:05:30,984 --> 00:05:34,588
In...elas...tic.

122
00:05:34,588 --> 00:05:36,210
So I'll leave you there in this video,

123
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,854
and just I want you to really kind of internalize

124
00:05:38,854 --> 00:05:40,581
what we're doing here, especially with the maths.

125
00:05:40,581 --> 00:05:43,804
And especially understanding why the elasticity is changed here.

126
00:05:43,804 --> 00:05:46,003
Get you thinking in terms of percentages.

127
00:05:46,003 --> 00:05:48,585
And also make you, hopefully you'll appreciate

128
00:05:48,585 --> 00:05:51,341
why we're taking the average of these 2 points.

129
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:54,306
When we find the denominator for the percentages

130
00:05:54,306 --> 00:05:56,600
instead of just taking 1 of the 2 points,

131
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,405
we get the same elasticity of demand

132
00:05:58,405 --> 00:06:01,000
either direction we go in.
