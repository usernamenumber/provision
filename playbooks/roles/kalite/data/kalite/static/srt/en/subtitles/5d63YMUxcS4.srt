1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
   

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,670
In the last video, we named
some fairly simple ethers.

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,900
In this video, we're going to
think about slightly more

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,750
complicated ones.

5
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,110
In particular, what happens if,
in the process of having

6
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:15,970
an ether, we actually have
a ring as opposed

7
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,500
to just a long chain?

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,140
So you can imagine a
molecule that looks

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,060
something like this.

10
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,500
You have your oxygen.

11
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,860
On this side of the oxygen,
you have this carbon chain

12
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,030
right here.

13
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,310
You have a carbon
chain like this.

14
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:30,540
But then that chain bonds
back to the oxygen.

15
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,590
So we have a ring here.

16
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,180
It's not obvious how
to name this.

17
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,540
You can't just look it this
side and call it methyl.

18
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,250
And then that side, and call
it a methyl as well.

19
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,440
It's the same side.

20
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,040
It connects back to itself.

21
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,640
How do you name this
type of ether?

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,060
What you do is, you
just number it.

23
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,750
You number the longest carbon
chain, like we've always done

24
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,640
in the case of an alkane.

25
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,970
We can start numbering here.

26
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:01,240
1, 2, 3, 4.

27
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,550
If we just think about the
carbon chain by itself.

28
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:06,940
We know if it's one carbon,
the prefix is meth-.

29
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,670
Two, it's eth-.

30
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,980
Three, it's prop-.

31
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,260
Four, it's but-.

32
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,850
So if this was just
a carbon chain, we

33
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,530
would call this butane.

34
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:20,760
If we only looked at this carbon
chain right here, you

35
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,010
would call this butane.

36
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:25,760
   

37
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,710
But obviously this
isn't butane.

38
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,390
We have this oxygen that's
bonding to the 1 and 4 carbons

39
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,830
of the butane.

40
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:38,830
To make that clear, we call
this-- Let me color code this

41
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,270
part right here, this
oxygen right there.

42
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,180
It's bonded to the 1
and the 4 carbon.

43
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,090
So we call this 1 comma 4.

44
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,820
And this is our new word
that we're going to

45
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,860
learn in this video.

46
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,110
1,4-epoxybutane.

47
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:55,290
   

48
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,500
And it doesn't just apply when
the ether forms a large ring.

49
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,750
It can actually form a
little subset ring

50
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,390
on a regular chain.

51
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,030
So you could imagine something
like this.

52
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,660
Let me draw a chain
of carbons.

53
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,970
Let's say we have
five carbons.

54
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:16,280
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, just like that.

55
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,840
Let's say that between this
carbon and this carbon,

56
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,210
instead of having a double bond,
this carbon actually

57
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,420
bonds to an oxygen, which
then bonds to

58
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,270
this carbon over here.

59
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,375
Obviously, every carbon has
four bonds, the ones that

60
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,900
we're not drawing, those
are hydrogens.

61
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,970
How do we name this?

62
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,120
Well, same exact process.

63
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,070
We actually start numbering the
chain closer to where the

64
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,730
oxygen is bonded.

65
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,830
So we start numbering at
this end over here.

66
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:47,190
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

67
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,440
So this is pentane.

68
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,220
   

69
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,110
The oxygen is bonded to the
1 and the 2 carbons.

70
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,800
So we call this
1,2-epoxypentane.

71
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,140
1 comma 2-epoxypentane.

72
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,980
   

73
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,910
Now, in the last video, I told
you that, in general, ethers

74
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,410
are fairly nonreactive.

75
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,010
They actually make for
good solvents.

76
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:14,000
But, what I've just drawn here
is a special case of ethers

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,070
called epoxides.

78
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:19,480
When you just have this three
atom chain right here, where

79
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,180
it's two carbons
and an oxygen.

80
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,930
This is a special case of an
ether called an epoxide.

81
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,660
This is called an epoxide.

82
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,380
And this, unlike most ethers,
is very reactive.

83
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,380
   

84
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:39,330
Another way you could think
about it, it's very unstable.

85
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,010
This is very reactive.

86
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,250
Sometimes people consider these
separate from ethers.

87
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,970
The reason why they're very
reactive, is this three member

88
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,370
ring right here.

89
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,260
There's a lot of strain
on these bonds.

90
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,350
These electrons, these bonds
don't like to be that close to

91
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:55,730
each other.

92
00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:01,200
If you actually tried to make
it with an actual model set

93
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,390
with molecules, you would have
trouble making it bend enough

94
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,900
to actually make this bond.

95
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,110
So this is highly, highly,
highly unstable.

96
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:13,560
There's actually an alternate
way to name epoxides.

97
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,070
The alternate way, so this is
a completely legitimate way.

98
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,300
You could name it just like
an ether with a ring.

99
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,380
This is 1,2-epoxypentane.

100
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,020
But the alternate way is
to pretend like you had

101
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,030
a double bond here.

102
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,450
That instead of this oxygen
here, you had a double bond.

103
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:34,340
If you had a double bond here,
this thing would be called,

104
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,350
depending how you want
to name it, it

105
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,600
could be called 1-pentene.

106
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,220
   

107
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,170
That's if there was not this
oxygen here, but if there was

108
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,070
a double bond here.

109
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,350
1-pentene would look
like this.

110
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,530
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

111
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,690
This is the 1 carbon.

112
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,110
So, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

113
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,250
This is what 1-petene
looks like.

114
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,490
We've learned that many,
many, many videos ago.

115
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,800
Sometimes it's called
pent-1-ene, depending on which

116
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,260
convention.

117
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,760
This is the more common one.

118
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,490
We have this oxygen here,
instead of this double bond.

119
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:09,850
   

120
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,170
Instead of calling it just
1-pentene, we call it

121
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,420
1-pentene oxide.

122
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:21,500
   

123
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,410
Just like that.

124
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:26,340
So both of these are the names
for the same exact molecule.

125
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,850
This makes it clear that
it's an epoxide.

126
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:31,230
That's kind of the special ether
that is more reactive.

127
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,870
This is just the general way
that we name any type of

128
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,340
cyclic ether.

129
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,770
So let's just do one more just
to make the point clear.

130
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,200
Let's have a cycle branching
off of a cycle.

131
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,100
Let's have an epoxide
off of another ring.

132
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,860
Just to make the point clear.

133
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,090
These aren't too hard to name.

134
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,340
But the first time you seen
them, a little daunting.

135
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,020
Let's say we have a cyclohexane
ring right here.

136
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,760
   

137
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,170
So this is cyclohexane.

138
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,900
But let's say we have a little
epoxy branching off of it,

139
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,940
just like this.

140
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,080
We have that going on.

141
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,830
If we wanted to make it clear
that this is an epoxide, we

142
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,660
would essentially pretend.

143
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,610
First pretend that this
is just a double bond.

144
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,150
If this was just a double
bond, this would be

145
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,400
cyclohexene.

146
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:21,570
   

147
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,830
If this oxygen wasn't there,
and instead we just had a

148
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,330
double bond here.

149
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,130
You actually don't have to
specify the number when you

150
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,050
only have one double
bonded cyclohexene.

151
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,690
Because it could have been
anywhere, and it would have

152
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,640
essentially been the
same molecule.

153
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,720
But since we have this oxygen
here, instead of a double bond

154
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,940
that's bonding to both of these
carbons, we call this

155
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,605
cyclohexene oxide.

156
00:06:41,605 --> 00:06:44,730
   

157
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,530
This part, right here,
makes us name

158
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,040
this cyclohexene oxide.

159
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:57,170
Or if we wanted to just name
this as a traditional ether,

160
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:08,910
we would just name this
cyclohexane and put the epoxy

161
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,160
in front of it.

162
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,270
   

163
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,640
Either of these are valid.

164
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,100
Once again, you don't
have to number it.

165
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,320
Because you could call it,
1,2-epoxycyclohexane, if you

166
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,930
made this the 1 or
the 2 carbon.

167
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:26,880
But you know it's going to
be on adjacent carbons.

168
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,610
And it could have really been
on any of these two.

169
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,160
It could have been on the 3 and
the 4, and it would have

170
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,780
essentially been the
same molecule.

171
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,850
So this actually makes it
clear exactly what the

172
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,150
molecular structure of
the molecule is.

173
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,220
So anyway, I thought you
would enjoy that.

174
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,920
And in the next video,
I told you that

175
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,270
epoxides are reactive.

176
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,400
So I'll actually show
you a reaction

177
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,650
dealing with epoxides.

178
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,134
