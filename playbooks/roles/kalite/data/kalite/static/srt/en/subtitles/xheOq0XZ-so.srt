1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,650
   

2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:01,920
Let's see if we can
learn thing or two

3
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,810
about carboxylic acids.

4
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:09,440
   

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,700
They have the general form of
the carbonyl group, just like

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,540
we've seen in aldehydes and
ketones, and they will be part

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,590
of a longer carbon chain.

8
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,930
But instead of having a hydrogen
here, as the case

9
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,280
with an aldehyde, or having
another carbon chain here,

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:30,170
with the case of a ketone,
we have an OH group.

11
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,330
And you're probably saying,
hey, why is

12
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,390
this called an acid?

13
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,930
It must be called an acid
because it is an acid, and

14
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,130
you'd be right.

15
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,360
And the reason why it is an
acid, and why it is more

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,160
acidic that just something
with an OH group, it's

17
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:53,420
actually a good bit more acidic
than alcohols, is

18
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,170
because once this thing loses
its hydrogen-- remember,

19
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,550
depending on what type of acid
you want to think about, acid

20
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,060
in the Lewis sense could be an
electron taker, and this

21
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,990
oxygen can take the electron
of this hydrogen.

22
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,370
Or if you think about the
Arrhenius definition of an

23
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,530
acid, it is a proton donor,
and this OH group

24
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,120
can donate a proton.

25
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,760
It takes away the electron of
this hydrogen, gives the way

26
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,640
the proton, either way.

27
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,690
But the reason why this is more
acidic than alcohol is

28
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,510
once it gives away this
proton, it is actually

29
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,830
resonance stabilized.

30
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:25,840
So let me show you
what that means.

31
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,480
To do that, let me actually show
you the bond between this

32
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,730
oxygen and this hydrogen.

33
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:36,450
   

34
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,540
The oxygen has this pink
electron, and the hydrogen has

35
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,200
that magenta electron
right there.

36
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,260
If you put this in a solution of
water, so you have some H2O

37
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:57,480
over here, this oxygen right
here really wants to take back

38
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,370
this magenta electron.

39
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,400
   

40
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,900
And as it takes back that
magenta electron, it would

41
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,660
essentially donate the hydrogen

42
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,395
proton to a water molecule.

43
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:13,650
So the water molecule would give
one of its electrons to

44
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,980
the hydrogen proton and
then become positive.

45
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,890
So once this happens, the next
step would look like this.

46
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,940
What was our carboxylic acid
will now turn into the

47
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:28,190
carboxylate ion, so it will now
look like this, so it has

48
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,740
our carbonyl group.

49
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,910
Now, this oxygen just took
an extra electron.

50
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,360
   

51
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,455
So if I want to draw it,
I have that one.

52
00:02:38,455 --> 00:02:40,060
Actually, let me draw.

53
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,270
So this is the oxygen.

54
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,980
To start off with, the oxygen
had two lone pairs, so I want

55
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,490
to draw those two lone pairs
first. So to start off with,

56
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:51,000
it had those two lone pairs,
and now it had this pink

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,590
electron from the get go, and
now it took this magenta

58
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,310
electron, so now it has one
extra valence electron.

59
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,720
We can even draw them here.

60
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,440
We can count them: one, two,
three, four, five, six.

61
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,730
Six is just a neutral oxygen,
but now it gained another one.

62
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,570
It has seven.

63
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,580
It now has a negative charge,
and then the water has now

64
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,330
become a hydronium ion.

65
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,040
So you have the water here.

66
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,630
We've increased the proton
or the hydronium

67
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,970
concentration in the water.

68
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:25,750
This one water molecule is now
a hydronium molecule, so this

69
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,900
is now bonded with
this hydrogen

70
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,130
proton just like this.

71
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:35,010
This oxygen gave away an
electron to this proton, so

72
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,810
now it has a positive charge.

73
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:49,160
And this right here, this
carboxylate ion right over

74
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,810
here, the reason why this thing
was a stronger acid than

75
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,920
something that just had an OH
group is because the conjugate

76
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,230
base, the carboxylate ion, is
actually resonance stabilized.

77
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,610
It is more stable than the
conjugate base of an alcohol,

78
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,080
and let me show you that.

79
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,150
This thing can share its
negative charge.

80
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,900
   

81
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,330
Let me draw it.

82
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,240
It can take this magenta
electron, give it to this

83
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,480
carbon, then this carbon will
have an extra electron, so

84
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,390
then it can give back an
electron to this top oxygen.

85
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:27,260
   

86
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,400
So it is resonance stabilized
with this

87
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,260
structure right over here.

88
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:35,565
Let me draw the same so it
could look like this.

89
00:04:35,565 --> 00:04:36,410
That's too big.

90
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,110
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

91
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,510
It could look like this.

92
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:46,290
And now, this took back this
blue electron, so now one of

93
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,880
the bonds is gone, and it
started off with two lone

94
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,560
pairs, so I want to draw that
there, and now it has

95
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,360
another lone pair.

96
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,970
It has this electron, this
electron, and now it has that

97
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,390
blue electron over there.

98
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:04,140
And now this oxygen, this top
oxygen, has a negative charge,

99
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,810
and now the carbon
has a double bond

100
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,610
with this side oxygen.

101
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:10,600
So now the carbon-- let me go
back to the yellow-- that's

102
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,190
the first bond with
that oxygen.

103
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:16,510
It had one, two lone pairs to
begin with, and now it has

104
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,620
this magenta bond.

105
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,900
So this pink electron
is at this end.

106
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,280
And now this purple electron is
at the other end, or this

107
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,080
magenta electron, and
now it has a double

108
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,930
bond with this oxygen.

109
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,160
And we know that when you have
resonance stabilization, it's

110
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,360
not like you're going
back and forth.

111
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,050
The reality is that you have a
half double bond between both

112
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,250
oxygens, that the electrons are
just flowing across the

113
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,920
whole place, and that stabilizes
the molecule.

114
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,220
And so to show that this is a
resonance structure, let me

115
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,570
put some brackets around it.

116
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,400
   

117
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,160
And, in general, if this R group
right here is actually

118
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,750
even better at withdrawing
electrons, so if you put

119
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,570
something that was really
electronegative here,

120
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,530
something that likes to hog
electrons, it would make the

121
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:02,130
carboxylate ion even
more stable.

122
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:05,500
It would make the carboxylic
acid even a better acid.

123
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,630
So if you put something
electronegative here, then you

124
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,050
could imagine that some of this
negative charge that we

125
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:14,640
drew in these two resonance
structures, can be sucked to

126
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,070
that R group, and then that
would make it even more

127
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,850
stable, and would make
the carboxylic

128
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:23,000
acid even more acidic.

129
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,530
Now, like in everything we've
looked at, there are some

130
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,930
common carboxylic acids that are
not systematically named,

131
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,090
that it's probably a
good idea to know.

132
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,230
And I'll start with one, just to
see the pattern that we've

133
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,470
seen in other things.

134
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:41,590
We've seen that this thing over
here, if we have this, we

135
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,260
call this acetaldehyde.

136
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,380
   

137
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,250
This was the very simple
aldehyde we studied.

138
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:56,170
we saw that if we have something
like this, which is

139
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,720
a ketone, we called
this acetone.

140
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,950
   

141
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,930
So you could imagine what we're
probably going to name--

142
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,760
let me do this in a different
color-- this

143
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:14,050
molecule right over here.

144
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,930
This is a carboxylic acid,
clearly, and it has just that

145
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,950
one methyl group, just like the
acetaldehyde, just like

146
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,545
the acetone, and so this
is acetic acid.

147
00:07:23,545 --> 00:07:28,270
   

148
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,210
So the acetaldehyde, acetone,
and acetic acid for me are

149
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,980
fairly easy to memorize just
because they all have the

150
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,420
acet- part.

151
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,870
They all have that as their
prefix, and this part of the

152
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,280
molecule is identical
in every case.

153
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,290
And the difference is the
hydrogen, the methyl group

154
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:47,080
over here, or the OH group,
making this one a carboxylic

155
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,370
acid, an acetone,
and all that.

156
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,360
Now, a couple of other ones that
it wouldn't hurt for you

157
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,850
to know is this one
right over here.

158
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,950
This is, you could argue, even
simpler than acetic acid, and

159
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,205
this formic acid.

160
00:08:01,205 --> 00:08:05,325
   

161
00:08:05,325 --> 00:08:08,800
And then another one, and
actually, I recently did a

162
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,290
general chemistry video with
this, where we did a titration

163
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:15,970
example, but this is essentially
two carboxyl

164
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,130
groups attached to each other.

165
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:23,440
It looks like this, two carboxyl
groups attached to

166
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,280
each other and you
can see them.

167
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,250
This is one carboxyl group right
over here, and then you

168
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,200
have another carboxyl group
right over here.

169
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,470
And so this actually can
be deprotonated twice.

170
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:37,510
This hydrogen can be lost, and
that hydrogen can be lost, and

171
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,760
this is oxalic acid.

172
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,669
   

173
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:44,490
I'll leave you there.

174
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,370
And in the next video, we'll
learn how to systematically

175
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,230
name carboxylic acids.

176
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:50,667
