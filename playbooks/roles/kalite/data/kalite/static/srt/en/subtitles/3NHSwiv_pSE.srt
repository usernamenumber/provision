00:00:00,571 --> 00:00:01,605
I've gotten feedback

2
00:00:01,605 --> 00:00:03,769
that all the Chuck Noris imagery in the last video

3
00:00:03,769 --> 00:00:05,703
might have been a little bit too overwhelming.

4
00:00:05,703 --> 00:00:07,105
So, for this video, I've included

5
00:00:07,105 --> 00:00:09,769
something a little bit more soothing.

6
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:11,770
So let's try to simplify some more expressions.

7
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,370
and we'll see we're just applying ideas

8
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,272
that we already knew about.

9
00:00:15,272 --> 00:00:20,998
So, let's say I want to simplify the expression 2(3x + 5).

10
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:23,703
Well, this literally means two "3x + 5".

11
00:00:23,703 --> 00:00:25,855
So, this is the exact same thing as...

12
00:00:25,855 --> 00:00:28,032
So this is one "3x + 5",

13
00:00:28,032 --> 00:00:30,639
and then to that, I'm going to add another "3x + 5".

14
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:33,904
This is literally what 2(3x + 5) means.

15
00:00:33,904 --> 00:00:36,104
Well this, is the same thing as...

16
00:00:36,104 --> 00:00:37,688
if we're gonna just have a look right over here,

17
00:00:37,688 --> 00:00:40,005
we have now two "3x".

18
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:49,014
So, we can write it as 2(3x), plus we have two "5".

19
00:00:49,087 --> 00:00:52,171
So, plus 2(5).

20
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:53,188
But, you might say: "Hey Sal,

21
00:00:53,188 --> 00:00:55,704
isn't this just the distributive property

22
00:00:55,704 --> 00:00:57,037
that I know from arithmetic?

23
00:00:57,037 --> 00:01:05,324
I've essentially just distributed the two "2(3x)" plus "2(5)",

24
00:01:05,324 --> 00:01:08,434
And I would tell you: "Yes, it is!"

25
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:09,854
And, the whole reason why I'm doing this,

26
00:01:09,854 --> 00:01:10,780
is just to show you that it is

27
00:01:10,796 --> 00:01:12,769
exactly what you all already know.

28
00:01:12,769 --> 00:01:14,355
But with that out of the way,

29
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:15,704
let's continue to simplify it.

30
00:01:15,704 --> 00:01:21,270
So, when you multiply the 2(3x), you get 6x.

31
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,703
If you multiply the 2(5), you get 10.

32
00:01:24,703 --> 00:01:28,482
So, this simplifies to 6x + 10.

33
00:01:28,482 --> 00:01:30,317
Now, let's try something that's a little bit more evolved.

34
00:01:30,396 --> 00:01:34,230
Once again, really just things that you already know.

35
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:54,591
So, let's say I had 7(3y - 5) - 2(10 +4y).

36
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:56,503
Let's see if we can simplify this.

37
00:01:56,503 --> 00:01:59,638
Well, let's work on the left-hand side of the expression.

38
00:01:59,638 --> 00:02:01,571
The 7(3y - 5).

39
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:03,438
We just have to distribute the "7".

40
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:06,038
So, this is gonna be 7 times 3y,

41
00:02:06,038 --> 00:02:08,188
which is going to give us 21y,

42
00:02:08,188 --> 00:02:11,761
Or, if I had three "y" seven times, this is going to be 21y

43
00:02:11,771 --> 00:02:13,190
(either way you want to think about it).

44
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,187
And then I have "7" times...

45
00:02:15,187 --> 00:02:16,271
We're going to be careful with the sign.

46
00:02:16,271 --> 00:02:18,370
This is "7" times negative 5.

47
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,521
"7" times "-5" is "-35".

48
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:24,038
So, we simplified this part of it.

49
00:02:24,038 --> 00:02:25,271
Let's simplify the right hand side.

50
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:27,605
So, you might be tempted to say:

51
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,701
"Oh, "2" times "10" and "2" times "4y",

52
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:31,472
and then subtract them,

53
00:02:31,472 --> 00:02:33,996
and if you do that right and distribute the subtraction,

54
00:02:33,996 --> 00:02:35,035
it would work out.

55
00:02:35,035 --> 00:02:39,478
But, I like to think of this as... "-2".

56
00:02:39,478 --> 00:02:42,103
And we're just going to distribute the "-2" times "10",

57
00:02:42,103 --> 00:02:46,938
and then we're going to distribute the "-2" times "4y".

58
00:02:46,938 --> 00:02:53,303
So, "-2" times "10" is "-20".

59
00:02:53,303 --> 00:02:56,303
(minus 20, right over here).

60
00:02:56,303 --> 00:02:58,945
And then "-2" times "4y"...

61
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:00,493
"-2" times "4" is "-8",

62
00:03:00,493 --> 00:03:03,299
so it's going to be "-8y".

63
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:06,438
So, let's write a "-8y" right over here.

64
00:03:06,438 --> 00:03:08,521
And now we're done simplifying.

65
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,770
Well no, there's a little bit more that we can do.

66
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,570
We can't add the "21y" to the "-35" or the "-20",

67
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,355
because these are adding different things

68
00:03:16,355 --> 00:03:17,605
or subtracting different things.

69
00:03:17,605 --> 00:03:20,606
But we do have two things that are multiplying "y".

70
00:03:20,606 --> 00:03:22,303
We have the...

71
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:24,571
Let me do them all in this green color.

72
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,105
You have 21y, right over here.

73
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:33,170
And then, from that we are subtracting 8y.

74
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,903
So 21 of something...

75
00:03:34,903 --> 00:03:37,520
If I have 21 of something and I take 8 of them away,

76
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,188
I'm left with 13 of that something.

77
00:03:39,188 --> 00:03:42,438
So, those are going to simplify to 13y.

78
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:51,715
And then, I have "-35" minus "20".

79
00:03:51,715 --> 00:03:56,216
And so, that's just going to simplify to "-55".

80
00:03:56,216 --> 00:03:57,837
So, this whole thing simplified,

81
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,769
using a little bit of distributive property

82
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:01,938
and combining similar or like terms,

83
00:04:01,938 --> 00:04:06,400
we got to "13y - 55".
