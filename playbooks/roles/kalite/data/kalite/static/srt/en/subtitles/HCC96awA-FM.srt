1
00:00:00,335 --> 00:00:07,886
Use less than or greater than for this little brackets thing to write a true sentence.

2
00:00:07,886 --> 00:00:22,349
So they essentially want us to say whether 45.675 is greater than or less than 45.645.

3
00:00:22,365 --> 00:00:25,875
So let's look at each of these numbers. 
I'm just going to write them on top of each other.

4
00:00:25,887 --> 00:00:33,995
So the first a number is forty-five and six hundred and seventy-five thousandths.

5
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:42,730
and the second number is
forty-five and six hundred and forty-five thousandths.

6
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,920
Now when you look at everything, here, the only place,

7
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:51,070
where these two numbers are different is in the hundredths place.

8
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:55,980
We have 7 hundredths here and
we have 4 hundredths here.

9
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,682
Everything is the same, so this number is going to be greater.

10
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:06,933
This number is a greater than 45.645, 
or six-hundred and forty-five thousandths.

11
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,172
Let me write that down just to make sure, 
we know what we're doing.

12
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:14,910
Forty-five and six hundred and
seventy-five thousandths,

13
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:21,669
or 45.675, is definitely greater than 45.645,

14
00:01:21,716 --> 00:01:28,416
or forty-five and six hundred and forty-five
thousandths.
