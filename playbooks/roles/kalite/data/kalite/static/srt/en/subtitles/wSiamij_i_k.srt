1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,830
   

2
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:05,770
So we have f of x is equal to
negative x plus 4, and f of x

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,460
is graphed right here on
our coordinate plane.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,690
Let's try to figure out
what the inverse of f is.

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,770
And to figure out the inverse,
what I like to do is I set y, I

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:18,590
set the variable y, equal to f
of x, or we could write that y

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,130
is equal to negative x plus 4.

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,040
Right now, we've solved
for y in terms of x.

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,750
To solve for the inverse,
we do the opposite.

10
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,600
We solve for x in terms of y.

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,570
So let's subtract 4
from both sides.

12
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:36,160
You get y minus 4 is
equal to negative x.

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,000
And then to solve for x, we can
multiply both sides of this

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,960
equation times negative 1.

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,530
And so you get negative
y plus 4 is equal to x.

16
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,390
Or just because we're always
used to writing the dependent

17
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,770
variable on the left-hand side,
we could rewrite this as x is

18
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,620
equal to negative y plus 4.

19
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,300
Or another way to write it
is we could say that f

20
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:06,840
inverse of y is equal
to negative y plus 4.

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,470
So this is the inverse function
right here, and we've written

22
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:13,360
it as a function of y, but we
can just rename the y as x

23
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,950
so it's a function of x.

24
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,080
So let's do that.

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:23,120
So if we just rename this y as
x, we get f inverse of x is

26
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,780
equal to the negative x plus 4.

27
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,540
These two functions
are identical.

28
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,730
Here, we just used y as the
independent variable, or

29
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:31,760
as the input variable.

30
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,660
Here we just use x, but they
are identical functions.

31
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,840
Now, just out of interest,
let's graph the inverse

32
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,220
function and see how it
might relate to this

33
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,190
one right over here.

34
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,250
So if you look at it,
it actually looks

35
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,510
fairly identical.

36
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,010
It's a negative x plus 4.

37
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,395
It's the exact same function.

38
00:01:48,395 --> 00:01:51,630
So let's see, if we have-- the
y-intercept is 4, it's going

39
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,950
to be the exact same thing.

40
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,810
The function is
its own inverse.

41
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,990
So if we were to graph it,
we would put it right

42
00:01:58,990 --> 00:01:59,930
on top of this.

43
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,560
   

44
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,730
And so, there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

45
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,530
In the first inverse function
video, I talked about how a

46
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,390
function and their inverse--
they are the reflection

47
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,030
over the line y equals x.

48
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,220
So where's the line
y equals x here?

49
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,445
Well, line y equals
x looks like this.

50
00:02:16,445 --> 00:02:20,540
   

51
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:25,710
And negative x plus 4 is
actually perpendicular to y is

52
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,780
equal to x, so when you reflect
it, you're just kind of

53
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,830
flipping it over, but it's
going to be the same line.

54
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,670
It is its own reflection.

55
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,470
Now, let's make sure that
that actually makes sense.

56
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,700
When we're dealing with the
standard function right

57
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,480
there, if you input a 2,
it gets mapped to a 2.

58
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,750
If you input a 4, it
gets mapped to 0.

59
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,370
What happens if you
go the other way?

60
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,460
If you input a 2, well, 2
gets mapped to 2 either

61
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,870
way, so that makes sense.

62
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,180
For the regular function,
4 gets mapped to 0.

63
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,320
For the inverse function,
0 gets mapped to 4.

64
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,710
So it actually makes
complete sense.

65
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,610
Let's think about
it another way.

66
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,770
For the regular function-- let
me write it explicitly down.

67
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,390
This might be obvious to
you, but just in case it's

68
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,950
not, it might be helpful.

69
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,440
Let's pick f of 5.

70
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,020
f of 5 is equal to negative 1.

71
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:23,900
Or we could say, the function f
maps us from 5 to negative 1.

72
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,230
Now, what does f inverse do?

73
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:31,190
What's f inverse of negative 1?

74
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,325
f inverse of negative 1 is 5.

75
00:03:33,325 --> 00:03:36,200
   

76
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,000
Or we could say that f maps
us from negative 1 to 5.

77
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,140
So once again, if you think
about kind of the sets, they're

78
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,370
our domains and our ranges.

79
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,070
So let's say that this is
the domain of f, this

80
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,760
is the range of f.

81
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:59,040
f will take us from
to negative 1.

82
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,960
That's what the
function f does.

83
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,920
And we see that f inverse takes
us back from negative 1 to 5.

84
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,720
f inverse takes us back
from negative 1 to 5, just

85
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,320
like it's supposed to do.

86
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,200
Let's do one more of these.

87
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,070
So here I have g of x is equal
to negative 2x minus 1.

88
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:23,000
So just like the last problem,
I like to set y equal to this.

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,340
So we say y is equal to g
of x, which is equal to

90
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,740
negative 2x minus 1.

91
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,950
Now we just solve for x.

92
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,910
y plus 1 is equal
to negative 2x.

93
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,920
Just added 1 to both sides.

94
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,050
Now we can divide both sides of
this equation by negative 2,

95
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:46,630
and so you get negative y over
2 minus 1/2 is equal to x, or

96
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:52,420
we could write x is equal to
negative y over 2 minus 1/2, or

97
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,260
we could write f inverse as a
function of y is equal to

98
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:02,435
negative y over 2 minus 1/2, or
we can just rename y as x.

99
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:08,270
And we could say that f inverse
of-- oh, let me careful here.

100
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,250
That shouldn't be an f.

101
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,300
The original function was
g , so let me be clear.

102
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:21,850
That is g inverse of y is equal
to negative y over 2 minus 1/2

103
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,340
because we started with a
g of x, not an f of x.

104
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,120
Make sure we get our
notation right.

105
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,010
Or we could just rename the y
and say g inverse of x is equal

106
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:34,320
to negative x over 2 minus 1/2.

107
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,140
Now, let's graph it.

108
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,970
Its y-intercept
is negative 1/2.

109
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,970
It's right over there.

110
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,460
And it has a slope
of negative 1/2.

111
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:48,940
   

112
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,760
Let's see, if we start at
negative 1/2, if we move over

113
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,500
to 1 in the positive direction,
it will go down half.

114
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,770
If we move over 1 again, it
will go down half again.

115
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,650
If we move back-- so
it'll go like that.

116
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,440
So the line, I'll try my
best to draw it, will

117
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,830
look something like that.

118
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,580
It'll just keep going, so it'll
look something like that, and

119
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,170
it'll keep going in
both directions.

120
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,400
And now let's see if this
really is a reflection over y

121
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:21,910
equals x. y equals x looks
like that, and you can see

122
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:22,750
they are a reflection.

123
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,440
If you reflect this guy, if you
reflect this blue line, it

124
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,220
becomes this orange line.

125
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,885
But the general idea, you
literally just-- a function

126
00:06:30,885 --> 00:06:34,460
is originally expressed, is
solved for y in terms of x.

127
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,530
You just do some algebra.

128
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,750
Solve for x in terms of y, and
that's essentially your inverse

129
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,120
function as a function of y,
but then you can rename

130
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,700
it as a function of x.
