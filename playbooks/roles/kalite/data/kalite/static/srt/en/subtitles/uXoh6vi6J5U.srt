1
00:00:00,934 --> 00:00:02,870
Are Shakespeare's plays encoded within Pi?

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,872
The truth is, we don't know, but we suspect

3
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:06,773
They're somewhere in those digits. And now I

4
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:08,575
Will show why we don't know if we're correct.

5
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:10,577
You see we think the digits do behave

6
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:12,346
As if they were a random sequence, and

7
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,214
And so many mathematicians try to brave

8
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:16,583
This question, but we still don't understand.

9
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,319
Pi isn't random. Each digit must be

10
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:21,388
Exactly what the definition states.

11
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:23,156
It's pseudo-random as far as we can see,

12
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:25,592
But it's a subject of intense debates.

13
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:27,461
Now I'll explain with this parameter:

14
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,696
It's all in iambic pentameter.

15
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,965
You may have heard of this scenario:

16
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:34,101
A thousand monkeys type at keyboards 'till

17
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:35,769
They write the words of Shakespeare. Even though,

18
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:38,539
In one life, it's a task they can't fulfill.

19
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,707
If you allow their kids to carry on,

20
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,376
All through the generations, working hard,

21
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,444
They will evolve before they come upon

22
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,346
A single sonnet written by the Bard.

23
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:48,415
But still the theory's sound! And it is true

24
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:51,351
That with a random and infinite set

25
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:53,153
Of letters, that eventually you

26
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:55,455
Will find whatever words you want to get.

27
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:57,758
However, on this thing you can depend:

28
00:00:57,758 --> 00:01:01,261
Before you do, the universe will end.

29
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,297
Pi is a number, and that's why

30
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:05,132
I can completely guarantee no part will be

31
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:07,301
9-1-3-7-5-2-2-8-ten

32
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:09,503
4-7-9-H-A-M-L-E-T.

33
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:11,538
You'd have to make up something, like a code

34
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:14,041
Where zero-one is A, Oh-three is C,

35
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,043
Or you could also choose some other mode:

36
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:18,745
Oh-2 could be "to be or not to be."

37
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,414
But let's go with this system, where a Y

38
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,649
Is 2-5, O's one-five, and R's eighteen,

39
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,451
And next comes zero-nine, which is an I

40
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:27,454
Oh-three, eleven. Yorick's name is seen!

41
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:29,289
Does Pi say anything? How does it go?

42
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:32,459
1-4-1-5. I guess the answer's "no."

43
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,495
If you desire to search Pi for a thing

44
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,130
Like Hamlet, as if you'd 'discover' it,

45
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,266
Without a copy used for referencing,

46
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,534
You wouldn't know if you'd recovered it.

47
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:42,302
In fact, it's almost certain, so beware:

48
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,838
Before you get to Hamlet, if you slog

49
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,406
Through all the digits, you'll find versions where

50
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:50,077
There's just one thing changed: Hamlet is a dog.

51
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:52,679
Dog Hamlet is so awesome, and he goes

52
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,615
On infinitely many adventures.

53
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,450
In this infinite space, everyone knows

54
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,753
Dog Hamlet's king. Sometimes he has dentures.

55
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:01,521
Unless Pi isn't normal. I'll admit,

56
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,924
Pi might not have a single "Dog Hamlet."

57
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:06,360
A normal number is a number where,

58
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,161
If you take any pattern of length Z

59
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,330
You'll definitely find the pattern there,

60
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,699
And others that length with same frequency.

61
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:15,302
Length 1 would just be every digit, so

62
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,704
All digits happen infinity times.

63
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,506
And all two-digit numbers also go

64
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,441
In there somewhere. If you list all the primes,

65
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:22,743
You get the Copeland-ErdÅ‘s constant,

66
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:25,379
which is one of few known normal numbers. Or

67
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,414
Take every number in order and stitch

68
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:30,117
Them all together. And we know there's more.

69
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:33,020
Most numbers must be of the normal kind.

70
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,156
But somehow, they are hard for us to find.

71
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,760
We think that Pi is normal. Also e,

72
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,029
And square root 2 and other stuff like that.

73
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:44,064
We don't know how to prove that they must be,

74
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:47,467
That Pi contains Macbeth where he's a cat.

75
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,436
If you've got every combination of

76
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:51,071
Digits of every length, that will include

77
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:53,407
A Romeo and Juliet in love

78
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:56,576
who meet in time and live and end the feud.

79
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,712
And since this string of numbers must occur

80
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:00,347
With equal frequency to other strings

81
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,382
Of the same length, it don't matter whether

82
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:05,018
You choose this code or other permutings.

83
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,921
Perhaps somewhere, Dog Hamlet and Catbeth

84
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,957
Are chillin', bustin' ghosts, avoiding death.

85
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:14,194
There's simple open problems about Pi,

86
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,896
Like whether every digit, oh through nine,

87
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:18,031
Keeps happening. We can't figure out why

88
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,201
6 shouldn't stop appearing down the line.

89
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,303
It seems ridiculous to think that 2

90
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,605
Occurs finitely many times. I fear,

91
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,874
That without proof, we can't say it's not true.

92
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,510
Alas, poor Yorick may never appear.

93
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,846
But the exciting thing is that I think

94
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:35,682
These problems will be solved before too long.

95
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,684
And then this video will really stink,

96
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,953
Because all this not knowing will be wrong.

97
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,988
Don't worry. I look forward to its fall.

98
00:03:41,988 --> 99:59:59,999
Till then, a Happy Pi Day to you all.
