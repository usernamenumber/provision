1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,460
We're on 121.

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:17,880
It says, if x/2 is equal to 3/y, is x less than y?

3
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,450
So this is essentially saying that x times y is equal to 6.

4
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,210
I just cross multiplied. Or you could do that step by step.

5
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,020
Multiply both sides by 2. Then, multiply both sides by y.

6
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,060
And you get xy is equal to 6.

7
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,660
And they want to know whether x is less than y.

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:45,050
Statement 1 says, y is greater than or equal to 3.

9
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,060
If y is greater than or equal to 3, what does that mean?

10
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:57,120
So let's think about this. x is equal to 6 divided by y.

11
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,480
If y is greater than or equal to 3-- so if it's 3,

12
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,640
that's the largest that x can be if y is 3.

13
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,640
If y is any larger number, then x will only be smaller.

14
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,980
So x will be less than or equal to 6/3.

15
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,000
Or x will be less than or equal to 2.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,530
And just, I want you to understand why I said that.

17
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,180
Think about this. It says, y is greater than or equal to 3.

18
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,010
If y is 3, x is going to be 2.

19
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:31,530
If y is 4, x is going to be 1 and 1/2.

20
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,230
If y is 6, x is going to be 1.

21
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:38,040
So the highest value for x happens when y is equal to 3.

22
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,750
And then, as y gets larger and larger, x just gets smaller.

23
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:46,540
So y being greater than or equal to 3 says that x is less

24
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,070
than or equal to 2. So statement 1, alone,

25
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,120
is sufficient to say that x is less than y.

26
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,500
If x is less than 2 and y is greater than 3,

27
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,070
then x is definitely less than y.

28
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:02,400
Statement 2 tells us, y is less than or equal to 4.

29
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,090
So this is interesting.

30
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:12,370
It's really just the inverse of this statement right here.

31
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,330
Now, you're saying, instead of y being greater than a certain

32
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,490
number, y is less than a certain number.

33
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,400
So if you think about it this way-- so let's go

34
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,280
back to this equation.

35
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:34,040
If y is 4, x is going to be-- let's do a little table. y, x.

36
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:39,050
If y is equal to 4, x is equal to 1.5.

37
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,000
If y is equal to 3, x is equal to 2.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,460
If y is equal to 2, then x is equal to 3.

39
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,880
So actually, this constraint, I can pick a bunch of

40
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,040
different y's that meet this constraint.

41
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,590
But it still doesn't tell me about anything whether x is

42
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,400
greater than or less than y. Here, x is less than y.

43
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,020
And here, x is greater than y. So this statement is useless.

44
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:07,430
So statement 1, alone, is sufficient to answer this question.

45
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:12,030
Statement 2 doesn't help us much. 122.

46
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:18,670
If v and w are different integers, does v equal 0?

47
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,000
Different integers. Remember, it says, different.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:34,410
They say that vw is equal to v squared.

49
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,800
Now, let's think about this.

50
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:46,020
This doesn't tell me for sure that v is equal to 0.

51
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,640
And, in fact, as long as-- well, let's think about this.

52
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:55,060
The only way that this could be true is if v is equal to 0,

53
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:58,870
that's one case. Now, if v does not equal to 0--

54
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:04,990
So if v does not equal to 0, then this case implies what?

55
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,880
That soon. w equals v. Think about it.

56
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,650
If v doesn't equal 0, we can divide both sides by v.

57
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,700
Because we know we're not dividing by 0.

58
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,840
You divide both sides by v,you get, on the left-hand side, w.

59
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,010
Because this v cancels out.

60
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,000
And then v squared divided by v, you get v.

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,030
And so you are left with--

62
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,500
Well, I want to be careful here, though.

63
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:35,270
Because w would have to equal v. And

64
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:38,000
they already told us that w and v are two different numbers.

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,640
So we know that this situation-- if w equals v,

66
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,030
then v does not equal 0.

67
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,070
But they tell us in the problem statement that w and v

68
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,570
are two different integers.

69
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,020
They tell us that w does not equal v.

70
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,550
So we know that the only way that this could be satisfied,

71
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:01,010
if w does not equal v, is if v is equal to 0.

72
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:05,010
So statement 1, alone, is sufficient to answer this question.

73
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:09,450
Statement 2. w is equal to 2.

74
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,770
Well, that doesn't do anything for me.

75
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:19,560
I mean w could be 2 and v could be 0. Or v could be 3.

76
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,450
All they told us was that v and w are different integers

77
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,000
and that they don't equal each other.

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,240
So this doesn't help me at all in determining whether

79
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,410
v is equal to 0. So statement 1, alone, is sufficient.

80
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,100
I just want to make sure I got that first part right.

81
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,690
I mean the only way that this is true,

82
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,400
this is true if v is equal to 0.

83
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,020
Or it's true if w is equal to v.

84
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:47,600
Either of those cases are true. That's the only way it works.

85
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:51,790
And we know w does not equal v. So v has to be equal to 0.

86
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,750
What are we on? 123.

87
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:15,040
What is the value of 36,500 times 1.05 to the nth power?

88
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,050
All right, statement number 1 tells us,

89
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:25,470
n squared minus 5n plus 6 is equal to 0.

90
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,170
So we could solve for n. There will be two solutions.

91
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:34,350
So this is n minus 2 times n minus 3. I just factored it.

92
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,830
I said, what two numbers, when I multiply them,

93
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,380
equal positive 6? So I said, minus 2, minus 3.

94
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,050
And when you add them become minus 5.

95
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,250
That's why I picked the minuses, as opposed to plus 2

96
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,040
and plus 3 or some other combination. Equals 0.

97
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:50,280
So statement 1 tells us that n is equal to 2 or

98
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,120
n is equal to 3. So statement 1, by itself, isn't enough.

99
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,000
Because I don't know whether

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,930
I should put a 2 here or a 3 here.

101
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,060
So I can't determine this value just yet.

102
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:07,060
Statement 2 tells us, n minus 2 does not equal 0.

103
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,840
This statement, by itself, is fairly useless.

104
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,420
Because it just tells me that n does not equal 2.

105
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,030
So n could be any other number.

106
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,010
So I don't know what number to put here.

107
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,830
But used in conjunction, these two statements--

108
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,440
statement 1 says that n is either 2 or 3.

109
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,120
Statement 2 says, well, it's not 2.

110
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,980
So if you use both of these together,

111
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,760
we know that n is equal to 3.

112
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,000
And then we can, obviously, solve this problem.

113
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,010
Taking 1.05 to the third power and multiplying by 36,500,

114
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:38,470
which I won't do because it would be a waste of time. 124.

115
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,860
In the rectangular coordinate system above--let me draw that.

116
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:53,450
They have the y-axis. They have the x-axis.

117
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,250
Then, they draw on a triangle.

118
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:01,470
I'll do that in a different color. That and like that.

119
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:14,020
And the letters are O, P, you and Q.

120
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:18,180
In the rectangular coordinate system above, if OP is less

121
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,010
than PQ-- so OP is less than PQ. Let me write that down.

122
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:31,370
OP is less than PQ. Is the area of OPQ greater than 48?

123
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:36,200
So we want to know, is area greater than 48?

124
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,920
OP is less than PQ.

125
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,400
So the way I drew this actually isn't right.

126
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,010
It's probably a little bit shifted to the left a little bit.

127
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:46,760
But fair enough. We can visualize. We can imagine that.

128
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,950
So let's see. Statement number 1.

129
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:53,000
The coordinates of point P are 6 comma 8.

130
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,450
So this is 6 comma 8. Let's see. That tells us the height.

131
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,160
When we figure out the area of a triangle,

132
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,140
we need to know the base times the height.

133
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,070
And then multiply that times 1/2.

134
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,360
The height of this triangle is the y-coordinate,

135
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,590
which is 8. So the altitude of this triangle is 8.

136
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,640
So we have the height, but we still don't know the distance

137
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,020
from O to Q.

138
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,590
So statement 1, by itself, isn't much information.

139
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:26,010
So that tells that the point was 6, 8. That P was 6, 8.

140
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:32,080
Statement 2 says, the coordinates of point Q are 13 comma 0.

141
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,000
Well, this is helpful. 13 comma 0.

142
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,080
So this distance right here is 13.

143
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,000
So by itself, that's useless.

144
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,810
Because if I didn't have the height, I still wouldn't be

145
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,410
able to figure out the area of this triangle.

146
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,390
But now, if I use both statements,

147
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,130
I know the base times the height.

148
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,820
So the area is going to be the base times the height times1/2

149
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:56,010
So 8 times 1/2 is 4. Times 13 is 52.

150
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,050
And so 52 is clearly greater than 48. Let me make sure.

151
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,640
Because I didn't use this information.

152
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:08,660
I didn't use that information at all.

153
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,230
Let's see. Let me think about it. Actually, no.

154
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:18,430
I think I'm wrong.I think statement 1,alone, might be enough.

155
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,580
Let's assume that we don't have-- these are tricky.

156
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,070
Let's assume that we don't have statement 2 there.

157
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,550
Let me see if I can figure out whether the area is greater

158
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,080
than 48 without it.

159
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:35,730
Let me see. Yeah, I think I'm wrong. I caught myself.

160
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:39,510
OK, so if this is 6 comma 8,

161
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,540
the area of this triangle right here,

162
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,000
well, this distance right here is going to be 6.

163
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,630
This distance right here is 6. 6 comma 8. Right.

164
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:57,560
OK, so the area of this triangle is 6 times 8. 48 times 1/2.

165
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,050
So the area of this triangle is 24.

166
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,780
But they told us that OP is less than PQ.

167
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:08,350
That this distance is less than this distance.

168
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,290
Maybe I should draw it like that, so you can kind of see it.

169
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,860
And the only way that this distance is less than this

170
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:20,010
distance is if this distance is less than this distance.

171
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:25,030
This is a tricky problem. This has to be less than this.

172
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,740
Q has to be further away.

173
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,530
Because that's the only way you're going to get this

174
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,530
altitude to be longer than this altitude.

175
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,000
Because you're assuming that Q is along the axes.

176
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,080
So that's the only thing that you can shift back and forth.

177
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,600
So if this distance is larger than this distance,

178
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,640
then the area of this triangle is going to be at least 24.

179
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,020
So the area is going to be greater than 48.

180
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:50,420
So actually, all you needed was statement 1

181
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,530
to solve this problem. That's all you needed.

182
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,010
Statement 1 gave you enough information.

183
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:59,350
Statement 2 does not, by itself, give you enough

184
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,800
information because you don't know how high P is.

185
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,110
It could be really low down here, in which case the area

186
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,080
is going to be less than 48.

187
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,000
It could be really high, in which case the area would be

188
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,810
greater than 48.

189
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,000
But anyway, see, I almost got that one wrong.

190
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,870
But I'll leave you there. I'll see you in the next video.

191
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,910
Statement 1, alone, was sufficient for this one.

192
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,000
See soon.
