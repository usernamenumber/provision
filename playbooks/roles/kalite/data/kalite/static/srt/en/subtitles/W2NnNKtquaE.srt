1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,190
I'm going to construct a sequence where
I start with some number ,,

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,180
let's say I start with the number a ,,

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,610
and then each successive term of the
sequence,

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,020
I'm gonna to multiply the pre ,,

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,720
to get each successive term of the
sequence,

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,980
I'm gonna multiply the previous term
by some fixed non zero number.

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,080
And I'm gonna call that r.

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,370
So the next term is going to be a ,,

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,100
is going to be a times r.

10
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,740
And then the term after that I'm gonna
apply ,,

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,880
I'm going to multiply
this thing times r.

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,580
So it's going to be a ,,

13
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,870
if you took ,, if you multiply a r
times r,

14
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,140
that's going to be a r ,,

15
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:40,260
a r squared. And then if you were
to multiply this turned ,,

16
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,440
term times r, you would get
a times r to the third power.

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,310
And you could keep
going on and on and on and on.

18
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:53,120
And this type of sequence ,,

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,220
or

20
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,550
this type of progression ,,

21
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,330
is called a geometric ,,

22
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,110
geometric sequence or progression ,,

23
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,019
geometric sequence. You
start with some first value.

24
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:06,620
Let me circle that in a different color,

25
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,730
since I already used the green.

26
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,900
So you start with some first value.

27
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,200
And then each success ,,

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,380
to get each successive term,

29
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,970
you multiply by this fixed number.

30
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,510
And in this case,

31
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,790
this fixed number is r.

32
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,570
And so we call our common ratio ,,

33
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:26,140
our common ratio. Why is it called
a common ratio?

34
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,530
Well take any two successive terms.

35
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,400
Take this term and this term,

36
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,170
and divide this term by
this term right over here.

37
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:35,380
a r to the third divided by a r squared.

38
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,320
So if you find the ratio
between these two things a ,,

39
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,780
Let me rewrite this. Same colors.

40
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,280
So if you took a r to the third power,

41
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,570
and were to divide it by
the term before it ,,

42
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,530
so if you were divide
it by a r squared,

43
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:57,440
what are you gonna be left with?

44
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,090
Well, a divided by a is 1.

45
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,880
r to the third divided by r squared
is just going to be r.

46
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,670
And this is true if you divide any term
by the term before it.

47
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,220
Or if you find the
ratio between any term and the

48
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,270
term before it, it's going to be r.

49
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,060
And so that's why it's called
a common ratio.

50
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,580
And so let's ,, go look some ,,

51
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,890
look at some examples of
geometric sequences.

52
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,410
So if I start with the number ,,

53
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,390
if I start with the number 5 ,,

54
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,280
so my a is five ,, and then each time,

55
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,740
I'm gonna multiply ,,

56
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,560
I'm going to multiply by ,,

57
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,040
I don't know ,, Let's say I multiply by
1/7.

58
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,130
So then the next term is going to be
5 over 7 ,,

59
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,830
5 over 7. What's the next term going to
be?

60
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,650
Well, I'm going to multiply
this thing times one_seventh.

61
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,370
So that's going to be
5 7ths times one 7th is 5 49ths.

62
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:57,400
So it's going to be 5 over ,,

63
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,950
5 over 7 squared ,,

64
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,960
or 49. If I'm oh ,, were to multiply
this times 1 7th,

65
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,940
what am I going to get?

66
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,130
And I'll just change the notation.

67
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,710
I'll just get 5 times,

68
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,820
I don't actually know in my head what
7 to the third power is.

69
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,420
I guess I could calculate it.

70
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,560
Two hundred and eighty plus 63 ,,

71
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:32,190
Let's see. So that would
be see 7 times 40 is 280.

72
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,410
7 times 9 is 63. So you're going to
get to 343,

73
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,200
I believe. Let's see.

74
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:45,430
Did I do that right? 7 times 280 plus
63 is 343.

75
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,710
And you can just keep going.

76
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:53,080
So this right over here is an example
of a geometric ,,

77
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,270
of a geometric sequence.

78
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:54,870
Started with some first value,

79
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,280
and each successive value I
multiplied by 1 7th.

80
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,410
1 7th is the common ratio here.

81
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,230
Let me give you another one.

82
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,150
Let's say I have this.

83
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,450
Let's say I have 3.
And then let's say I have 6.

84
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,910
And let's say I have 12.

85
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,340
Then I have 24. Then I have 48.

86
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,900
Is this a geometric series?

87
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,140
And if it is, what is
the common ratio here?

88
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,529
Well, you could figure out
the common ratio by just taking any two

89
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:20,890
successive terms and dividing.

90
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,840
Well first you could ,,

91
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,240
you could try it with two terms.

92
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,230
So 12 divided by 6 is 2.

93
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,630
So we have to multiply by 2.

94
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,040
To go from 12 to 24, you multiplied by
2.

95
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,890
To go from 24 to 48, you have
to multiply by 2.

96
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,030
To
