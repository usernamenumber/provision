1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,181
So you, as the ancient philosopher in mathematics

2
00:00:03,181 --> 00:00:07,185
have concluded in order for the multiplication of positive and negative numbers to be

3
00:00:07,185 --> 00:00:10,177
consistent with everything you've been constructing so far

4
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:13,502
with all the other properties of multiplication that you know so far

5
00:00:13,502 --> 00:00:17,178
that you need a negative number times a positive

6
00:00:17,178 --> 00:00:20,770
number or a positive times a negative to give you a negative number

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,181
and a negative times a negative

8
00:00:24,181 --> 00:00:27,846
to give you a positive number and so you accept

9
00:00:27,846 --> 00:00:30,845
it's all consistent so far.. this deal does not make complete concrete

10
00:00:30,845 --> 00:00:35,770
sense to you, you want to have a slightly deeper institution than just having to accept its

11
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,369
consistent with the distributive property and whatever else and so you try another

12
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:45,377
thought experiment, you say "well what is just a basic multiplication way of doing it?"

13
00:00:45,377 --> 00:00:47,369
So if I say, two times

14
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:51,183
three, one way to

15
00:00:51,183 --> 00:00:55,103
to conceptualize is basic multiplication is really repeating

16
00:00:55,103 --> 00:00:58,036
addition, so you could view this as two threes

17
00:00:58,036 --> 00:01:02,351
so let me write three plus three

18
00:01:02,351 --> 00:01:05,703
and notice there are two of them, there are two of these

19
00:01:05,703 --> 00:01:09,770
or you could view this as three twos, and so this is the same thing as

20
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,434
two plus two plus two and there are

21
00:01:13,434 --> 00:01:17,100
three of them, and either way you can conceptualize

22
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,602
as you get the same exact answer. This is going to be equal

23
00:01:20,602 --> 00:01:24,597
to six, fair enough!

24
00:01:24,597 --> 00:01:27,569
Now, you knew this before you even tried to tackle negative numbers.

25
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:30,518
Now let's try to make one of these negatives and see what

26
00:01:30,518 --> 00:01:33,369
happens. Let's do two

27
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:35,516
times negative

28
00:01:35,516 --> 00:01:42,103
three, I want to make the negative into a different color. Two times

29
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:46,309
negative three.

30
00:01:46,309 --> 00:01:49,851
Well, one way you could view this is the same analogy

31
00:01:49,851 --> 00:01:52,853
here, it's negative three twice so it would be

32
00:01:52,853 --> 00:01:56,767
negative.. I'll try to color code it

33
00:01:56,767 --> 00:02:01,042
negative three and then another negative

34
00:02:01,042 --> 00:02:05,180
three or you could say negative three minus three

35
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,568
or, and this is the interesting thing, instead of

36
00:02:08,568 --> 00:02:11,036
over here there's a two times positive three

37
00:02:11,036 --> 00:02:14,310
you added two, three times.

38
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,262
But since here is two times negative three

39
00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:19,036
you could also imagine you are going to subtract two, three times

40
00:02:19,036 --> 00:02:21,700
So instead of up here, I could

41
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,519
written two plus two plus two because this is a positive

42
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:29,436
two right over here, but since we're doing this over negative three

43
00:02:29,436 --> 00:02:33,702
we could imagine subtracting two, three times, so this would be

44
00:02:33,702 --> 00:02:37,930
subtracting two (repeated)

45
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:43,186
subtract another two right over here, subtract another two

46
00:02:43,186 --> 00:02:46,102
and then you subtract another two

47
00:02:46,102 --> 00:02:54,936
notice you did it, once again, you did it

48
00:02:54,936 --> 00:02:59,932
three times, so this is a negative three, so essentially you are subtracting

49
00:02:59,932 --> 00:03:03,770
two, three times. And either way, you can conceptualize

50
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,264
right over here, you are going to get negative six

51
00:03:07,264 --> 00:03:10,186
negative six is the answer.

52
00:03:10,186 --> 00:03:16,264
Now, so you are already starting to feel better about this part right over here

53
00:03:16,264 --> 00:03:18,369
negative times a positive, or a positive times a negative

54
00:03:18,369 --> 00:03:21,600
is going to give you a negative. Now lets take to the really un-intuitive one

55
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,685
and measure negative times a negative, and all of a sudden negatives kind of cancel

56
00:03:24,685 --> 00:03:28,037
to give you a positive. Now why is that the case? Well we can just build from

57
00:03:28,037 --> 00:03:30,969
this example right over here. Let's say we had

58
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:35,934
a negative two, lets say we had

59
00:03:35,934 --> 00:03:38,103
negative two, let me do it a different color,

60
00:03:38,103 --> 00:03:42,851
let's say we had a negative two, I already used this color

61
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:45,239
negative two times

62
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:48,702
negative three.

63
00:03:48,702 --> 00:03:53,975
So now, we can d- actually I'll do this one first.

64
00:03:53,975 --> 00:03:57,775
Let's do multiplying something by negative three so we'll

65
00:03:57,775 --> 00:04:01,234
repeatedly subtract that thing three times whatever that thing is

66
00:04:01,234 --> 00:04:05,769
so now the thing isn't a positive two so the thing over

67
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:08,636
here is a positive two but the thing we're going to subtract is a negative two

68
00:04:08,636 --> 00:04:10,902
So let me make it clear, this says we are going to subtract something

69
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:13,969
three times, so we subtract something three times, so

70
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:17,104
subtracting something (repeatedly) three times

71
00:04:17,104 --> 00:04:20,642
That's what this part right over here tells us

72
00:04:20,642 --> 00:04:24,302
and we'll do this, exactly three times

73
00:04:24,302 --> 00:04:28,369
Over here, it was a positive two we subtracted three times, now we're going to

74
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:32,271
do a negative two, now we're going to do a negative two

75
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:35,770
and we know from subtracting negative numbers, we already

76
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,434
built this intuition that subtracting a negative is the same thing

77
00:04:40,368 --> 00:04:46,105
it's the same thing as adding a positive, and so this

78
00:04:46,105 --> 00:04:50,370
this is going to be the same thing as two plus two plus two and

79
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,606
we're told once again, gives you a positive

80
00:04:53,606 --> 00:04:56,901
six, you can same use the same logic over here, now

81
00:04:56,901 --> 00:05:00,302
instead of adding negative three twice, really I could have written this as

82
00:05:00,302 --> 00:05:03,854
negative three as this example

83
00:05:03,854 --> 00:05:05,569
negative three

84
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:11,523
negative three, and we added it

85
00:05:11,523 --> 00:05:15,299
we added it, now let me put a plus here to make it clear

86
00:05:15,299 --> 00:05:18,602
over here we added it twice, we added negative three

87
00:05:18,602 --> 00:05:23,349
two times, or here since we have a negative two, we're going to subtract

88
00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:26,184
to negative three twice, so we're going to subtract something

89
00:05:26,184 --> 00:05:30,102
and we're going to subtract something again, and that something is going to be

90
00:05:30,102 --> 00:05:33,440
our negative three, it's going to be our negative three, so

91
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,036
negative, negative and put our three right over here

92
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:41,241
and once again, subtracting negative three is like taking away

93
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:43,182
someone's debt, which is essentially giving them money,

94
00:05:43,182 --> 00:05:48,274
this is the same thing as adding three plus three which is once again six. So now

95
00:05:48,274 --> 00:05:51,439
you, the ancient philosopher, feel pretty good. Not only this

96
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:55,105
all consistent with all the mathematics you know

97
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:58,369
the distributive property is also the property of multiplying something

98
00:05:58,369 --> 00:06:00,767
times something all these things you already know, and now

99
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:04,772
this actually makes conceptual sense to you, this is actually very consistent with

100
00:06:04,772 --> 00:06:08,108
with your notations, your original notations, or one of the positive notations

101
00:06:08,108 --> 00:06:12,108
of multiplication which is as repeated addition
