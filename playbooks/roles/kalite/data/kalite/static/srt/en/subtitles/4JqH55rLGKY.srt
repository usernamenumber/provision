00:00:00,998 --> 00:00:03,971
For the past year a travel agency has collected data

2
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:06,393
about the number of individual tickets that

3
00:00:06,393 --> 00:00:10,243
it sells for its signature product - a Mediterranean cruise.

4
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:13,879
The monthly data on ticket sales is shown below.

5
00:00:13,879 --> 00:00:17,252
What are the best and worst months for cruise sales?

6
00:00:17,252 --> 00:00:18,349
So what they have given us

7
00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:19,111
This diagram --

8
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:22,287
This is usually called a pie chart or pie graph

9
00:00:22,287 --> 00:00:25,183
because it looks like a pie that is sliced up in pieces.

10
00:00:25,183 --> 00:00:27,728
Sometimes this is called a circle graph,

11
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:29,497
but pie graph is much more common

12
00:00:29,497 --> 00:00:31,482
And then they say its monthly ticket sales

13
00:00:31,482 --> 00:00:34,926
So each of these slices represent the sales in a given month.

14
00:00:34,926 --> 00:00:40,333
So for example, this blue slice over here represents the sales in January.

15
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:42,564
And they way that a pie chart is set up

16
00:00:42,564 --> 00:00:44,745
each slice is bigger or smaller

17
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:48,154
depending on what fraction of the whole it represents.

18
00:00:48,154 --> 00:00:51,525
So, for example, they're telling us in January they sold

19
00:00:51,525 --> 00:00:55,658
18% of the total years' ticket sales, in January.

20
00:00:55,658 --> 00:00:56,837
So if you add up all these percentages

21
00:00:56,837 --> 00:00:59,656
it should add up to 100%

22
00:00:59,656 --> 00:01:01,869
And not only do they tell us they sold 18%,

23
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:04,410
but the slice of this pie should be

24
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,310
18% of the area of the entire pie.

25
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,790
It is literally 18% of the pie.

26
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,101
If you were to eat this slice,

27
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:13,449
you would have eaten 18% of the pie.

28
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:14,954
Now with that out of the way,

29
00:01:14,954 --> 00:01:16,456
let's think about their questions:

30
00:01:16,456 --> 00:01:20,135
What are the best and worst months for cruise sales?

31
00:01:20,135 --> 00:01:22,656
So the best month is obviously the month

32
00:01:22,656 --> 00:01:25,240
where they sell, where they have the largest

33
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,467
percentage of their tickets were sold.

34
00:01:27,467 --> 00:01:29,513
And actually, I started with January

35
00:01:29,513 --> 00:01:30,660
and if you just ...

36
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,178
and this is what's neat about pie graphs.

37
00:01:32,178 --> 00:01:33,971
You wouldn't even have to look at numbers.

38
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:36,232
January just jumps out as the biggest slice of pie

39
00:01:36,232 --> 00:01:37,193
If you didn't even see the numbers,

40
00:01:37,193 --> 00:01:38,756
if you couldn't even read,

41
00:01:38,756 --> 00:01:40,561
and you just looked at this, and someone said

42
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:41,260
"what is the largest slice of pie?"

43
00:01:41,275 --> 00:01:42,839
you would immediately say,

44
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,117
"Hey, this is the largest slice of pie right over there."

45
00:01:45,117 --> 00:01:48,261
And so, that is actually the best month for cruise sales

46
00:01:48,261 --> 00:01:49,887
cuz they sold 18%.

47
00:01:49,887 --> 00:01:51,995
You see this 18% is larger than

48
00:01:51,995 --> 00:01:53,820
all of the other percentages over here.

49
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,907
But it's clear, just by looking at the graph

50
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,528
this is the largest slice.

51
00:01:57,528 --> 00:01:59,201
Now, what is the worst month

52
00:01:59,201 --> 00:02:02,432
for cruise ticket sales?

53
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:03,817
Well, then we just have to find

54
00:02:03,817 --> 00:02:05,471
the thinnest slice of pie.

55
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:08,659
And, if we look over here the slices of pie

56
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:10,579
get very thin out down here.

57
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:13,361
This is the summer, in June and July,

58
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,384
and in May.

59
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,956
But the smallest are actually July and June

60
00:02:16,987 --> 00:02:18,907
And this is where the numbers become useful.

61
00:02:18,907 --> 00:02:21,163
Because when you just look at it,

62
00:02:21,163 --> 00:02:22,002
when you just eyeball it,

63
00:02:22,002 --> 00:02:24,182
you're not sure, are these exactly the same,

64
00:02:24,182 --> 00:02:25,803
or do they just look exactly the same?

65
00:02:25,803 --> 00:02:27,625
This is where these numbers are valuable.

66
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,059
And based on the data they've given us,

67
00:02:29,059 --> 00:02:32,671
it looks like these are tied for the worst in ticket sales.

68
00:02:32,671 --> 00:02:34,396
In both of these months they sell

69
00:02:34,396 --> 00:02:36,312
only 3% in each month.

70
00:02:36,312 --> 00:02:39,031
So the worst months for cruise sales are

71
00:02:39,031 --> 00:02:41,165
July and June.

72
00:02:41,165 --> 00:02:44,578
July and June are tied for the worst.

73
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:46,800
The best is clearly January.

74
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,668
And then after January, the next best ...

75
00:02:49,668 --> 00:02:51,405
they're not really asking us that,

76
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:52,952
but since we have the pie chart in front of us

77
00:02:52,952 --> 00:02:54,319
might as well ask ourselves that.

78
00:02:54,334 --> 00:02:56,227
What's the next best?

79
00:02:56,227 --> 00:02:58,167
It looks like November is slightly better than December,

80
00:02:58,167 --> 00:03:01,232
but in general, it's pretty clear that the winter months,

81
00:03:01,232 --> 00:03:04,400
the winter months do much better in terms of cruise sales

82
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,969
than these over here.

83
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:07,441
I guess people are looking

84
00:03:07,441 --> 99:59:59,999
to get away from the cold.
