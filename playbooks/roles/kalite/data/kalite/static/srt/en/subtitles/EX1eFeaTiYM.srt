1
00:00:00,533 --> 00:00:06,533
let's see if we can understand the structure of a hedge fund (a little bit) and also how the management

2
00:00:06,533 --> 00:00:09,733
and the performance fees work out.

3
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:13,867
so most hedge funds, the funds themselves, are set up as limited partnerships.

4
00:00:13,867 --> 00:00:16,333
so this is the hedge fund that Pete set up.

5
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:21,933
we'll call it the Pete Capital Fund 1, maybe in the future, we're going to start Fund 2 and 3 and all the rest.

6
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:25,333
and he's able to raise $100 million

7
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:29,067
10% of that $100 million, or 10 million of it, is coming from him

8
00:00:29,067 --> 00:00:35,867
- or to be more exact, coming from Pete Capital Management, LLC (limited liability company)

9
00:00:35,867 --> 00:00:41,067
which he starts off as the general partner of this fund.

10
00:00:41,067 --> 00:00:45,800
and this might be a little bit confusing, but this one company, this is another company over here.

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,533
this company is going to manage the assets of that company.

12
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:55,000
and in return, it will be able to get management fees and it will able to get a performance fee

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,733
that we will talk about in a couple of seconds.

14
00:00:56,733 --> 00:00:59,667
and probably Pete owns this entire company,

15
00:00:59,667 --> 00:01:02,867
but he might have a couple of employees, probably four or five.

16
00:01:02,867 --> 00:01:07,400
now the way it works with a limited partnership is that they dont call it necessarily shares, but it's

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,333
essentially the same thing.

18
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:12,267
someone who, out of this $100 million, contributed $30 million

19
00:01:12,267 --> 00:01:15,533
would get 30% in limited partner interest,

20
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:19,867
someone who contributed 10% would get $10 million in limited partner interest

21
00:01:19,867 --> 00:01:24,933
so let's just say that he does really good over the next year, that he's able to,

22
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:28,000
on a gross basis - before we take out his management fee or anything else -

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,267
grow the fund by $20 million,

24
00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:32,600
so roughly on a gross basis, 20%

25
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:38,867
so this is net of trading fees, all the stuff he has to pay the broker, and all of that type of thing.

26
00:01:38,867 --> 00:01:43,867
to understand, kind of what goes to Pete Capital Management,

27
00:01:43,867 --> 00:01:46,333
that Pete can use to pay himself and his handful of employees,

28
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:48,400
first he gets the management fee,

29
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,067
and the management fee will be on the average net asset value

30
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:54,400
and i'm going to do it a little "back of the envelope" right over here,

31
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,267
it's normally done on a monthly basis, but i dont want to go into all of that accounting

32
00:01:57,267 --> 00:02:00,400
but if he did this fairly linearly, consistently,

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,667
the average net asset value over the year would be $110 million

34
00:02:10,344 --> 00:02:12,900
and so he'll get about 2% of that,

35
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,267
we're assuming he gets the 2% management fee,

36
00:02:15,267 --> 00:02:20,200
and 20% performance fee (carried interest as sometimes called)

37
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,667
so if the average net asset value = $110 million

38
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:26,867
you multiply that times 2%

39
00:02:26,867 --> 00:02:28,600
and that means that

40
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,667
he's going to get $2.2 million in management fees

41
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:39,667
this is for his salary, his employee's salaries, to pay the rent, to get some fancy computers

42
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:40,667
whatever it might be

43
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:44,000
this is kind of viewed as the cost to just manage the fund.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,467
so we need to subtract that from the total amount to the fund,

45
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:50,867
because that's going to management companies

46
00:02:50,867 --> 00:02:52,333
so instead of $120 million over here, we're going to have

47
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:57,867
what is that, $117.8 million

48
00:03:02,836 --> 00:03:04,982
and then we'll have to calculate how much he's going to get in performance fee

49
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:09,267
so in this situation, net of his management fee,

50
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:15,400
we have a $117.8 million gain.

51
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,267
(in profit)

52
00:03:18,267 --> 00:03:21,733
the way that we set up the performance fee, or the carried interest, is that

53
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:24,333
Pete gets 20% of it,

54
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:29,400
or more particular, the general partner, the Pete Capital Management, LLC,

55
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,200
the partner that is controlling, managing, this fund will get 20%

56
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,133
so lets multiply that by 20%,

57
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,267
and what does that give us,

58
00:03:38,267 --> 00:03:43,800
that gives us 3.56 million

59
00:03:46,308 --> 00:03:51,477
will also go to Pete Capital Management.

60
00:03:51,646 --> 00:03:54,467
so not bad, this year, he made

61
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:57,400
a little over $6 million

62
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,133
so that's going to him and his four or five employees,

63
00:04:01,133 --> 00:04:06,933
so if someone performs well, it can be a very profitable business.

64
00:04:06,933 --> 00:04:09,333
and just to make it clear how the mechanics works here,

65
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:14,000
these funds tend to be open-end funds, like open-end mutual funds,

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,867
well not like them, they have to be private,

67
00:04:15,867 --> 00:04:19,800
they can only take money from credited investors, they cant market themselves,

68
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,867
they dont have to register with the SEC

69
00:04:22,867 --> 00:04:26,133
when i say that they are open-ended, it means that

70
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,733
at any point, well not at any point, usually there are restrictions.

71
00:04:28,733 --> 00:04:34,867
at certain points in time, the investors are allowed to redeem or kind of add investments to what's going

72
00:04:34,867 --> 00:04:36,867
on in the fund.

73
00:04:36,867 --> 00:04:42,600
so let's say at the end of the year, so instead of $117.8, we're going to have to subtract 3.56 from that

74
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Pete's Capital Management.

75
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,267
so what's left of the fund is going to be, and he could leave it in there to reinvest but that would just

76
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:50,333
increase his share.

77
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:55,467
but let's say, Pete's Capital Management takes it out, so we would be left with .. let's see, we have

78
00:04:55,467 --> 00:05:07,775
117.8 - 3.56, right?

79
00:05:08,298 --> 00:05:16,600
gives us $114.24

80
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,867
and let's see this period, investors are allowed to redeem their interest.

81
00:05:20,867 --> 00:05:25,800
and this guy right over here, this guy with the 30% interest, he says you know what, that was a pretty

82
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,600
good year. I want to take 10% of my interest out... so instead of having a 30% interest, he wants to

83
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,600
have a 10% interest.

84
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,600
so what happens is... so instead of a 30% interest, this is now a 20% interest. he'll take 10% out

85
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,200
so he'll 10% of a 114.24, so he's going to take out... that's essentially going to be,

86
00:05:44,923 --> 00:05:49,852
you just have to move the decimal place, one place over.

87
00:05:49,852 --> 00:05:55,933
so he's going to take out 11.424 million, that's this guy over here.

88
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:58,667
he's going to take out 11.424 million, and then the fund will

89
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:00,333
decrease by that amount.

90
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:04,600
so he can, at these specific periods, people can redeem, usually at the end of the month, at the end of

91
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,600
the quarter, or at the end of the year.

92
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,764
so the fund will be left with... let me take the calculator out again,

93
00:06:11,856 --> 00:06:15,000
the fund will no be left with

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:23,133
114.24 - 11.424

95
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:26,133
which is going to be 102.816.

96
00:06:27,656 --> 00:06:33,000
and at the same time, other poeple might say hey! that was a pretty good return, i'm going to now, contribute

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,600
to the fund.

98
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,467
so either way, it's not like a closed-end fund, where just at the beginning, people can commit their capital,

99
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:43,067
and they cant take it out until the end of the fund and they cant add more

100
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:47,200
during the life of most hedge funds, at specific periods

101
00:06:47,200 --> 99:59:59,999
people are allowed to redeem their funds, or they're allowed to add more funds.
