1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
   

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,980
In this video, I want to
introduce you to a mechanism

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,875
called the aldol reaction.

4
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:11,890
And it's easily one of the most
important mechanisms and

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,250
reactions in all of organic
chemistry because it's a

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,350
powerful way to actually create
carbon-carbon bonds.

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,290
And it'll actually be a little
bit of a review of what we saw

8
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:26,390
with enol and the enolate ions
and the keto-enol tautomerism.

9
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,640
I have trouble saying that.

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,049
Anyway, let's start with
a couple of aldehydes.

11
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:34,430
And just for convenience I'll
make them identical.

12
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,020
So let's say that this is one
of aldehydes, it just has a

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,080
carbon chain there.

14
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,980
That's what the r is, it
could be of any length.

15
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,290
Who knows what's there.

16
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,950
And then I have another
carbon here.

17
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,295
And then this is bound to the
carbonyl group and we're going

18
00:00:46,295 --> 00:00:48,920
to make it an aldehyde, although
you could do this

19
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,380
reaction with a ketone
as well.

20
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:55,050
And just to make things clear,
this carbon right here-- which

21
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,680
is going to be involved in a lot
of the business here-- let

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,080
me draw it's hydrogens.

23
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,030
Normally we don't have to
draw its hydrogens.

24
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,000
And just as a bit of review, the
carbon that is next to the

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,430
carbonyl carbon is called
an alpha carbon.

26
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,890
If this was a ketone, this would
have also been an alpha

27
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,330
carbon if this was a carbon.

28
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,630
And we're going to see in this
reaction, besides just

29
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,620
exploring the reaction, is
that these hydrogens are

30
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,360
actually much more acidic then
traditional hydrogens attached

31
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,910
to carbons on the rest
of the chain.

32
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:26,150
And it comes from the fact that
this proton can be given

33
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,020
to something else, the electron
can go to that

34
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,590
carbon, and then it'll be
resonance stabilized.

35
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,340
And we're going to see
that in a second.

36
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,620
Now I said I would draw two
molecules of that, because we

37
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,490
need two molecules.

38
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,150
We're actually going to
be, to some degree,

39
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,800
joining the two molecules.

40
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,580
So let me draw another aldehyde
right over here.

41
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,310
And I'm going to draw it
symmetric to this, because

42
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,750
it'll make it, I think, a little
bit easier to visualize

43
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,290
the two molecules.

44
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,935
Actually, let me just draw
it the same way.

45
00:01:52,935 --> 00:01:54,440
But I'll draw it in
a different color.

46
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,140
So you have the r group
and then you have the

47
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:58,980
oxygen right there.

48
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,260
And I won't draw all of the
hydrogens on this guy, but

49
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,470
this and this are the
exact same molecule.

50
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,300
It's just the hydrogens
are implicit here.

51
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,509
Now, the aldol reaction I'll
show you will be in a basic

52
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:11,130
environment.

53
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,500
So you could imagine that it'll
be catalyzed by a base.

54
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,320
And so, imagine we have some
hydroxide laying around.

55
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,790
Some of the hydroxide anion.

56
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,410
   

57
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,870
Let me do that in a
different color.

58
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,910
So let's say we have some
hydroxide anion floating

59
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,260
around-- negative charge,
just like that.

60
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:35,350
I just told you that these
hydrogens are much more acidic

61
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,020
then hydrogens anywhere else
on a carbon chain-- these

62
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,240
alpha hydrogens.

63
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,770
So you could imagine a situation
where an electron

64
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:47,750
from the hydroxide is given to
one of these hydrogen protons

65
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:53,350
and then the electron that was
associated with that hydrogen

66
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,900
is now given back to
this alpha carbon.

67
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,220
And so if that were to happen,
the next step in our reaction

68
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,460
would look like this.

69
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,740
And I'll draw it
in equilibrium.

70
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,480
Actually, let me draw
it this way.

71
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,540
So the products of that step
would be in equilibrium, with,

72
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,010
you have your carbon chain or
the rest of your molecule

73
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:15,530
right there.

74
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,930
And that's just to show that
it could be anything.

75
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,600
It's attached here to the alpha
carbon, which is now

76
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,760
going to be negative-- I'll show
that in a second-- which

77
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,160
is attached to the carbonyl
group, which is

78
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,535
attached to a hydrogen.

79
00:03:28,535 --> 00:03:31,350
And actually, I'll
stop drawing that

80
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,700
hydrogen for now, too.

81
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,420
Just, we know it's there.

82
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,080
But I'll keep drawing this
hydrogen right over here.

83
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,960
The other hydrogen was taken
away and this alpha carbon now

84
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,940
has a negative charge
because it got the

85
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,820
electron from that proton.

86
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:52,740
And of course, we have
the hydroxide.

87
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,510
It grabbed this hydrogen
and it is now water.

88
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,540
Now the reason why this was
acidic to begin with is

89
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,600
because this is resonance
stabilized.

90
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,750
And I'll show you that
it's resonance

91
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,570
stabilized right now.

92
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:10,460
This alpha carbon right here can
give its electron to the

93
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,970
carbonyl carbon.

94
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,260
And if the carbonyl carbon gets
an electron, it can give

95
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,250
an electron to this
oxygen up here.

96
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,600
It'll break the double bond.

97
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,700
So this configuration
is resonance

98
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,450
stabilized with this.

99
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,800
So I could draw it like this.

100
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,430
You have your r and then
you have a single

101
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,550
bond to this oxygen.

102
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,210
It now gained an electron.

103
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,710
It is now negative.

104
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:40,190
And you now have a double
bond, just like that.

105
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:43,120
And I could draw this hydrogen
if I like, or I don't have to.

106
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,590
It's implicitly over
there now.

107
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,270
And you might be familiar
with this.

108
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,380
This is the Enolate anion.

109
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:57,540
This right here is
the enolate ion.

110
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,230
If we had a hydrogen right here,
it would be enol, and we

111
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,760
would say hey, this
is the keto form,

112
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,990
this is the enol form.

113
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,660
We've seen this before.

114
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,610
Now, what's interesting about
the enolate ion is it can act

115
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,970
as a nucleophile.

116
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:15,300
It can do a nucleophilic attack
on the other aldehyde's

117
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,680
carbonyl group.

118
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,770
But it does it in kind of
a non-conventional way.

119
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,800
And I'll show you how it
does it right now.

120
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,955
So it does the attack
like this.

121
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:25,220
So let me draw this
guy over here.

122
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:31,420
So you have the carbonyl group
and then you have its alpha

123
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,430
carbon and then you have an
r group right over there.

124
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,220
There's actually a hydrogen
right over here, as well.

125
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,230
I just flipped it over.

126
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,120
This and this are the
same molecule.

127
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,960
And let me make it clear-- these
two guys right here are

128
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,480
residence forms. And, once
again, this is the reason why

129
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,090
it's easier to take this
hydrogen than other hydrogens

130
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,200
on a traditional carbon chain.

131
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,640
Easier to take an alpha hydrogen
to a carbonyl group

132
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,730
because you have this
resonance structure.

133
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,030
But this enolate ion, especially
this configuration

134
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,530
of it, you can imagine it doing
something like this.

135
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:07,300
You can imagine this oxygen
giving back the electron to

136
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,970
the carbonyl carbon-- to
this carbon right here.

137
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:17,500
And when that happens, then this
guy is going to be giving

138
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,650
up an electron.

139
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,520
And that electron that he gives
up-- let me do it in a

140
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,400
new color-- this electron that
he gives up could go and do a

141
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,050
nucleophilic attack on
this carbonyl group.

142
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:34,960
And so if that carbonyl carbon
gets-- let me do this in a new

143
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,305
color-- if this carbonyl carbon
gets an electron, then

144
00:06:38,305 --> 00:06:42,230
it could give away an electron
to that oxygen right up there.

145
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,270
So the next step after
this, we would have

146
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,940
something like this.

147
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,810
And once again, I'll show it as
happening in equilibrium.

148
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:53,130
So from here we go right over
there, and what we have is a

149
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:57,470
situation-- let me draw this guy
on the left first. So we

150
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,190
have a double bond to
this oxygen now.

151
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:04,310
Actually, let me draw
the second.

152
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,400
So this is this oxygen.

153
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,675
We now have a double bond.

154
00:07:06,675 --> 00:07:09,970
And let me do it in this same
purple color right over here.

155
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,400
And then we have the rest
of what was an aldehyde.

156
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,770
   

157
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:22,010
Where you have-- let me do it in
that same color-- and then

158
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,880
you have your r group
right over there.

159
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,520
But now this electron
gets in an attack

160
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,860
on this other aldehyde.

161
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,880
So this guy right here, this
alpha carbon is that same

162
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,030
alpha carbon we've been dealing
with, is now bonded to

163
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,260
this carbonyl carbon.

164
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:42,100
So it is now bound
to this carbonyl

165
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,910
carbon right over here.

166
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:48,100
And so it will look like this.

167
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,470
Let me draw it with
the right colors.

168
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,740
Get the orange out.

169
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,660
So that carbonyl carbon,
it now has a single

170
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,370
bond to this oxygen.

171
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,490
This electron was taken
back by it.

172
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,150
So this oxygen now has
a negative charge.

173
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:05,950
And it is bound to
its alpha carbon.

174
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:13,860
And then that is bonded to
another group, probably a

175
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,710
carbon chain or something that
contains a carbon chain or

176
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,620
another function or group.

177
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,000
Whatever you want to call it.

178
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,990
And then the final step.

179
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:25,840
This anion can get rid of its
negative charge by essentially

180
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,330
grabbing a hydrogen maybe
from this water

181
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,150
that was formed before.

182
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,179
Obviously, not going to be the
same molecule, but it could

183
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,510
grab it from this in
a previous step.

184
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:38,830
This water molecule that was
formed in a previous step.

185
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,929
And of course, this is all
in a basic environment.

186
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:46,980
So it can give an electron to
this hydrogen, and then the

187
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,910
hydrogen proton would lose an
electron to the hydroxide and

188
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,770
the hydroxide will become
negative again.

189
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,910
And so what will be
the final product?

190
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:59,600
The final product will be-- and
I'm just going to try my

191
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,500
best to redraw this thing
right over here.

192
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,970
You have this part of the
molecule, so you have this

193
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:09,400
carbonyl group right
over here.

194
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,760
It is attached to this radical
group right over there.

195
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,110
So that is this part.

196
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,250
And I can even do
the same colors.

197
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,130
This bond right over here is
this bond right over here.

198
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:25,670
And then this carbon is attached
to a carbon that's

199
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,250
attached to a hydroxyl
group now.

200
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,280
So it'll look like this.

201
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,280
And let me draw it.

202
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:37,690
So this oxygen is now this
oxygen, and it just captured

203
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:38,850
this hydrogen.

204
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,640
So it is now a hydroxyl group.

205
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,830
It's now an -OH group.

206
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:48,630
And then, finally, this
guy is bound to what

207
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,390
was an alpha carbon.

208
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,590
It's not anymore.

209
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,780
What was an alpha carbon,
which is then bound to a

210
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,520
radical group.

211
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,150
And if we want, we can remember
that there was

212
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:00,660
always, from the get-go,
there was always a

213
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,110
hydrogen over here.

214
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,400
So why is this called
the aldol reaction

215
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,440
and why does it matter?

216
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,510
Well, it's called the aldol
reaction because what we

217
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:12,130
formed is both an aldehyde--
notice this is an aldehyde--

218
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,900
and it's an alcohol.

219
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,220
So that's where the word
aldol comes from.

220
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,240
But the more important thing
about this-- and I don't want

221
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,060
to mislead you-- could have also
done this with a ketone

222
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,400
You could have had a methyl
group or a ethyl group.

223
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,830
You could have had a big
carbon chain here.

224
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,920
It still would've worked.

225
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,180
So the aldol reaction doesn't
only form things that are

226
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,310
aldehydes and alcohols.

227
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,510
It could have formed something
that's both a

228
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,160
ketone and an alcohol.

229
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,520
But that's why it's called
the aldol reaction.

230
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,120
But the more important thing
about the aldol reaction is,

231
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,840
one, it shows you how the
enolate ion can be a

232
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,810
nucleophile.

233
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:48,750
It shows you why the alpha
hydrogens are more acidic than

234
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,150
hydrogens on other parts
of carbon chains.

235
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,310
But the most useful aspect of
it is it's a useful way to

236
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:57,090
actually join two carbon
chains together.

237
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,790
Notice, we were able to join
this alpha carbon right here

238
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:05,940
to this carbonyl carbon over
here to form this aldol.

239
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,210
Or sometimes this will be
called-- because this is still

240
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,900
an alpha carbon right here, this
is an alpha carbon, this

241
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,320
is a beta carbon-- and so
sometimes this will be

242
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,780
referred to as a beta hydroxy.

243
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:24,250
And we've probably used things
from the pharmacy that has

244
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,260
this word in it.

245
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,710
This is also called
a beta hydroxy.

246
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,985
This is alpha, this is beta.

247
00:11:28,985 --> 00:11:31,610
It has a hydroxyl group
on the beta carbon.

248
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,430
Beta hydroxy aldehyde.

249
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:37,910
   

250
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,290
Anyway, hopefully you found
that entertaining.

251
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:40,599
