1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:01,660
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:04,185
I'm now going to take a slight
tangent and cover a topic

3
00:00:04,185 --> 00:00:06,794
that, I think, this is probably the single most important video

4
00:00:06,794 --> 00:00:08,860
that really anyone can watch.

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,184
I go to all of these parties
where I go see family.

6
00:00:11,184 --> 00:00:14,688
And my wife and I right now,
we live in Northern California.

7
00:00:14,703 --> 00:00:15,934
And we're renting.

8
00:00:15,934 --> 00:00:18,120
And I like to point out, by choice.

9
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,360
And I have family members,
why don't you buy?

10
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,808
You're at that stage in life,

11
00:00:21,808 --> 00:00:23,160
that's a major milestone, all of this.

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,380
There's a lot of pressure
to buy.

13
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,749
And when I tell friends,

14
00:00:25,749 --> 00:00:26,720
I tell them I'm not going to buy.

15
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,756
Because I think I'm pretty
convinced,

16
00:00:30,756 --> 00:00:32,256
almost 100% convinced,

17
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,574
that housing prices
are going to revert back.

18
00:00:34,574 --> 00:00:36,107
And I'm going to do a bunch
of presentations

19
00:00:36,107 --> 00:00:37,690
to justify why they will.

20
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:38,723
But then my friends,

21
00:00:38,723 --> 00:00:41,853
they'll just throw out the statement that I hear from them,

22
00:00:41,853 --> 00:00:43,320
that you hear from real estate agents,

23
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,810
because obviously
they want you to buy.

24
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,850
Well, isn't buying always
better than renting?

25
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,231
And I think that kind of common
wisdom

26
00:00:51,231 --> 00:00:52,048
comes out of the notion of,

27
00:00:52,048 --> 00:00:56,634
when you have a mortgage or when you borrow money to live in a house,

28
00:00:56,634 --> 00:00:59,213
every month that money that you give to the bank

29
00:00:59,213 --> 00:01:01,267
is kind of going into savings.

30
00:01:01,267 --> 00:01:02,760
That's the perception.

31
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,590
While when you rent,
that money's just

32
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,160
disappearing into a vacuum.

33
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,410
In this video I'm going to work
through that assumption,

34
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,360
and see if that actually
is the case.

35
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,050
So let's say I have a choice.

36
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,346
Let's say there are
two houses.

37
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:20,940
This is house number one.

38
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,870
And this is house number two.

39
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,670
And let's say that they're
identical houses.

40
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:31,433
These are three bedroom, two
bath, townhouses some place in Silicon Valley,

41
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:32,960
which is where I live.

42
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,090
And I want to live in
one of these houses.

43
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,970
I'm indifferent as to which
house I live in,

44
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:38,770
because they are identical.

45
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,300
So living in them is the
identical experience.

46
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:54,320
I can rent this house
for $3,000 a month.

47
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,890
Or I could buy this house
for $1 million.

48
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:03,100
And let's say that in my bank
account right now,

49
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,970
let's say I have $250,000 cash.

50
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,979
So let's see what happens
in either scenario.

51
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:13,470
Let's see how much money
is being burned.

52
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,817
So in this scenario
what happens?

53
00:02:15,817 --> 00:02:17,400
I'm renting.

54
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,767
So in a given year,

55
00:02:18,767 --> 00:02:20,910
let's just see how much money comes out of my pocket.

56
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,790
So in a given year
I pay $3,000.

57
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:28,455
$3,000 times 12 months,
so I lose $36,000.

58
00:02:28,455 --> 00:02:30,270
So I'll put a negative there,

59
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,460
because that's what I spend in rent.

60
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:37,550
$36,000 per year in rent.

61
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,640
And then of course I
have that $250,000.

62
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,783
I'm going to put that into the
bank,

63
00:02:43,783 --> 00:02:45,930
because I have nothing else to do with it.

64
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,640
I didn't buy a house with it.

65
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,480
And let's say that I can,
in the bank,

66
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,210
let's say I put it in a CD.

67
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,800
And I get 4% on that.

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,942
So let's see, 250, that's
what? $10,000, I think.

69
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:58,600
That's 0.04.

70
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,800
Right, I get $10,000 in interest
a year on that.

71
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,890
So I get $10,000.

72
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:07,840
So plus $10,000 a year
in interest.

73
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,666
So out of my pocket,

74
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:13,505
for the privilege of living in this house, in Silicon Valley,

75
00:03:13,505 --> 00:03:15,120
with beautiful weather,

76
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,970
out of my pocket every year goes $26,000.

77
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,780
So that's scenario one.

78
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,215
So what happens if I give in

79
00:03:27,215 --> 00:03:33,890
to the peer pressure of family, and realtors, and the
mortgage industry,

80
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,230
and I buy this house for $1 million?

81
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,180
Well I only have $250,000, which
is more, frankly,

82
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,110
than most people who buy $1 million
houses have.

83
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,330
But I have $250,000 cash.

84
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,550
So I need to borrow $750,000.

85
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:57,970
So I take out a mortgage
for $750,000.

86
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,630
And I'm going to do a slight
simplification.

87
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,282
And maybe in a future
presentation,

88
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,070
I'll do kind of a more complicated one.

89
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,830
In a lot of mortgages, when you
pay your monthly payment,

90
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,930
most of your monthly payment,
at least initially,

91
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,600
is the interest on the amount that
you're borrowing.

92
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,800
And you pay a little bit
extra on that,

93
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,080
to bring this value down.

94
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,850
That's called paying
off the principal.

95
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,850
You can also take an
interest-only loan,

96
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,779
but the component of the interest
is the same.

97
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:22,710
Essentially, when you take a
traditional mortgage,

98
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,198
kind of a 30-year fixed,

99
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:26,663
every month you're paying a little bit more than the interest,

100
00:04:26,663 --> 00:04:28,815
just to take down the balance.

101
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:30,679
But for the simplicity of this
argument,

102
00:04:30,679 --> 00:04:33,110
I'm just going to say that we're doing an
interest-only mortgage.

103
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,970
And then maybe with any
extra savings,

104
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,190
I can pay down the principal.

105
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,440
And that's the same notion.

106
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,669
And right now, if I do 25% down,

107
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:41,669
and I'm buying a $1 million house,

108
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:45,318
I'll have to take a $750,000 mortgage.

109
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,450
I don't know what a
good rate is, 6%?

110
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:53,202
So let's say at 6% interest.

111
00:04:53,202 --> 00:04:54,768
So to live in this house,

112
00:04:54,768 --> 00:04:58,350
how much am I paying just in interest?

113
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:05,850
Well I'm paying $750,000
times 6% a year.

114
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:18,510
So $750,000 times 0.06 is equal
to $45,000 in interest.

115
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,810
That's coming out
of my pocket.

116
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,895
And of course, on a monthly
basis,

117
00:05:22,895 --> 00:05:24,594
that means in interest per month, I'm paying,

118
00:05:24,594 --> 00:05:26,161
just to get an idea.

119
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:29,570
I'm paying about $3,700, $3,800
in interest a month.

120
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,180
My mortgage actually might be
something like $4,000 a month.

121
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,852
So I pay the interest.

122
00:05:33,852 --> 00:05:35,095
And then I pay a little bit

123
00:05:35,095 --> 00:05:39,480
to chip away at the whole value of the loan.

124
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,540
It takes 30 years to chip
away at the whole thing.

125
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,670
And over time, the interest
component becomes less,

126
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,540
and the principal becomes more.

127
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,440
But for simplicity, this is the
interest that I'm paying.

128
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,420
$45,000 a year.

129
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,570
And then of course at a party,
when I start to explain this,

130
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:52,740
it's like, ah-ha.

131
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,220
But interest on a mortgage
is tax deductible.

132
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,750
And what tax deductible means,
is that this amount of money

133
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,400
that I spend on interest
on my mortgage,

134
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,870
I can deduct from my taxes.

135
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,228
I can tell the IRS that

136
00:06:06,228 --> 00:06:10,860
I make $45,000 less than I actually did.

137
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,366
So if I'm getting taxed at,
let's say 30%,

138
00:06:14,366 --> 00:06:16,060
what is the actual cash savings?

139
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,940
Well I'll save 30% of this.

140
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,030
I'll have to pay $15,000
less in taxes.

141
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,080
How does that work?

142
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,720
Well, think about it.

143
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,070
Let's say I earned $100,000
in a year.

144
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,980
And I normally have
to pay 30%.

145
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,610
So I normally pay $30,000
in taxes.

146
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:31,290
Right?

147
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,800
This is, if I didn't
have this

148
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,410
great tax shelter with this house.

149
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:37,720
Now I have this interest
deduction.

150
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,910
So now I tell the IRS
that I'm actually

151
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:46,475
making $55,000 a year.

152
00:06:46,475 --> 00:06:48,990
And let's say my tax
rate is still 30%.

153
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,420
it actually will probably go
down since I'm

154
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,648
-- but let's, just for simplicity,

155
00:06:52,648 --> 00:06:54,698
assume my tax rate is still $30,000.

156
00:06:54,698 --> 00:07:02,710
So now I'm going to pay $16,500
in taxes to the IRS.

157
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:06,939
So how much did I
save in taxes?

158
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,380
So I saved $13,500 from taxes,

159
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,030
from being able to deduct this $45,000 from my income.

160
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:33,090
So let's say tax savings,
plus $13,500.

161
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,410
Now what else goes into
this equation?

162
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,167
Do I get any interest
on my $250,000?

163
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:36,836
Well, no.

164
00:07:36,836 --> 00:07:38,880
I had to use that as part of the
down payment on my house.

165
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,730
So I'm not getting
interest there.

166
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,390
But what I do have to
do is,

167
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:46,160
I have to pay taxes on my property.

168
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,340
In California, out here we have
to pay 1.25% in taxes,

169
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,890
of the value of the house.

170
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:52,910
So what's 1.25%?

171
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,270
So, taxes, this is
property tax.

172
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,597
And that's actually tax
deductible too,

173
00:07:57,597 --> 00:08:00,750
so it actually becomes more like 0.75% or 1%.

174
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,540
So let's just say 1% just
for simplicity.

175
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,610
Property taxes.

176
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,200
So 1% times $1 million.

177
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,254
That equals what?

178
00:08:11,254 --> 00:08:14,100
1% of $1 million is
another $10,000 a year

179
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,730
in property taxes.

180
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,568
And notice, I'm not talking
about

181
00:08:17,568 --> 00:08:19,490
what percent of my mortgage goes to pay principal.

182
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,980
I'm just talking about money
that's being burned

183
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,210
by owning this house.

184
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,460
So what is the net effect?

185
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:33,080
I have a $13,500 tax savings.

186
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,976
I have to pay $10,000

187
00:08:34,976 --> 00:08:36,064
--actually I have to pay a little bit more than that,

188
00:08:36,064 --> 00:08:37,780
but we're getting a little bit of income tax savings

189
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:41,294
on the deduction on the property taxes.

190
00:08:41,294 --> 00:08:45,170
And then I actually have to pay
the $45,000 of interest

191
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,270
that just goes out the door.

192
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:51,759
So I'm paying $41,500.

193
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:57,494
Notice, none of this $41,500
is building equity.

194
00:08:57,494 --> 00:08:58,577
None of it is getting saved.

195
00:08:58,577 --> 00:09:03,010
This is money that is
just being burned.

196
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,680
So this is a completely
comparable value

197
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,970
to this $26,000.

198
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,169
So in this example

199
00:09:08,169 --> 00:09:11,649
-- this example is not that far off from real values.

200
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:12,783
Out here in the Bay area,

201
00:09:12,783 --> 00:09:16,700
I can rent a $1 million house for about $3,000.

202
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:21,020
But in this situation I am
burning, every year $41,500,

203
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,279
where I could just rent the same
house for $26,000 out of my pocket,

204
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:26,360
when I adjust for everything.

205
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,748
And then people a couple of
years ago said,

206
00:09:28,748 --> 00:09:29,750
oh, but houses appreciate.

207
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,000
And that's what would
make it up.

208
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,940
But now you know, very recently

209
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,455
-- we know that that's not the case.

210
00:09:34,455 --> 00:09:36,540
And in the next video, I'll
delve into this,

211
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,480
and a little bit more.

212
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,080
I'll see you soon.
