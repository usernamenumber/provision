1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:06,877
What I want to explore in this video is the different ways of measuring the amount of money we have in circulation.

2
00:00:06,877 --> 00:00:13,585
So we're going to start things with our Central Bank (in the US, this would be the US Federal Reserve.)

3
00:00:13,585 --> 00:00:17,769
And let's say that they print $4.

4
00:00:17,938 --> 00:00:21,625
And we're going to focus just for visualisation purposes, on them doing it phyisically,

5
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:25,764
they could also do it electronically, but we're just going to focus on the physical.

6
00:00:25,764 --> 00:00:29,118
And they way they get this into circulation is that they'll take these four dollars

7
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:35,200
and they'll go buy securities in the open market, normally very safe and very liquid securities

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,200
Liquid means it's very easy to buy and sell those securities in large quantities.

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,267
For example, government treasuries is a liquid security or a liquid asset,

10
00:00:44,267 --> 00:00:46,533
Pez dispensers would not be a liquid asset --

11
00:00:46,533 --> 00:00:48,800
If i bought a billion dollars worth of pez dispensers

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,333
it would be very hard for me to sell.. one, it would be very hard for me to buy a billion dollars worth

13
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:55,533
and it would probably be even harder for me to sell a billion dollars worth

14
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:58,600
in any short or medium time frame.

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,431
So the central bank goes out, and let's say they go and buy 1 liquid security for $4,

16
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:05,659
[so this is the security right over here]

17
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:09,610
and the person they bought the security from decides to deposit it in a bank.

18
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:13,067
They could either directly deposit it in a bank or they could use that money

19
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:15,267
that they got from selling their security to buy things

20
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:17,667
and they person they bought things from could deposit in a bank...

21
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:21,067
but one way or another we can imagine it all gets deposited in a bank.

22
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:27,267
[So this is our private bank, I'll call this private bank number number 1]

23
00:01:27,267 --> 00:01:37,108
So now all of these dollars are transferred to PB#1, and they are no longer...

24
00:01:37,154 --> 00:01:42,867
the Fed Reserve or the central bank (the general case) is no longer in posession of them.

25
00:01:42,867 --> 00:01:48,800
They've been transferred right over here (to PB #1). [I'm going to cross these out so we can keep track of things.]

26
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:55,200
Now, when they deposit in PB#1, they say "well, I need 3 of these dollars on demand

27
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,133
and I want to write cheques against them."

28
00:01:57,133 --> 00:02:14,200
So they put $3 in a chequeing account, so they can write cheques up to $3..

29
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,800
and so they can get a little bit more interest, and the banks will even

30
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,600
give a little bit more interest on a savings account cos they don't have to keep the reserves;

31
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,600
they put $1 into a savings account.

32
00:02:25,738 --> 00:02:28,159
And they cannot write cheques against that savings account

33
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:33,369
Now, there are special circumstances, but for simplicity, let's just say that they cannot write cheques

34
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:36,769
there are some that have restricted cheque writing and things like that...

35
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:40,867
So the banks says "ok, this dollar, I dont have to have

36
00:02:40,867 --> 00:02:43,056
any reserves against it, and I can loan out this dollar

37
00:02:43,056 --> 00:02:46,800
and the person they lend it to, let's say they immediately go deposit it into another bank

38
00:02:47,036 --> 00:02:52,882
so they immediately go and deposit this in private bank 2 (PB#2)

39
00:02:53,159 --> 00:03:00,648
So it's no longer in PB#1 [Let me draw PB#2... PB#2 is right over here...]

40
00:03:05,294 --> 00:03:10,748
And they deposit it into a savings account in PB#2

41
00:03:10,917 --> 00:03:13,515
and let's say that out of all of these

42
00:03:13,515 --> 00:03:17,648
the bank says "well this is a demand deposit, I have to keep some reserves

43
00:03:17,648 --> 00:03:19,274
(this is a fractional reserve system)

44
00:03:19,274 --> 00:03:22,385
but I can lend out -- in the US I can lend out up to 90% of this

45
00:03:22,385 --> 00:03:26,267
and maybe this bank is a little bit more conservative, and they only lend out two-thirds of these,

46
00:03:26,267 --> 00:03:28,600
so they lend out 2 out of these 3 dollars.

47
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,867
And lets say the person they lend out to also happens to deposit it in PB#2, just coincidentally.

48
00:03:33,867 --> 00:03:46,082
so this $2 also ends up in PB#2, and so they are no longer in PB#1,

49
00:03:46,082 --> 00:03:49,933
although this person (PB#1) can still write cheques up to $3.

50
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:58,600
And here in PB#2, let's say these are deposited in a chequeing account.

51
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,502
Now, PB#2 can do a couple of things:

52
00:04:01,502 --> 00:04:03,600
In this chequeing account, it has to keep some reserves,

53
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,544
let's say its even more conservative, it only decides to lend out half of this

54
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,410
(even though it could lend out 90%)

55
00:04:08,425 --> 00:04:11,979
and so it lends out one of these dollars

56
00:04:11,995 --> 00:04:18,067
and the person they lend it to just takes that dollar and puts it in their wallet.

57
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:20,729
They can also lend out this entire savings, and let's just say

58
00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:29,067
that person that they lend that $1 in savings to also puts it in their wallet.

59
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:33,354
Notice, the original $4 is still there..

60
00:04:33,354 --> 00:04:38,179
Now, and just to be clear, this person (PB#1) right over here can write cheques up to $3,

61
00:04:38,179 --> 00:04:54,133
and this person over here (PB#2) can write cheques up to $2 [Let me do this in the same chequeing colour]

62
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:57,462
Now, let's think about the different forms of money there are here.

63
00:04:57,462 --> 00:05:02,867
We could think of money in a very, very narrow way, which is 'Just what did the central bank print?'

64
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:08,533
or create electronically (as electronic reserves of its member banks' account)

65
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:13,133
but for simplicity here, you could just think of the physical currency it printed - it's base money.

66
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:17,764
And so that is often referred to as Base Money

67
00:05:17,764 --> 00:05:21,964
and in the US (and other countries), it's often the same thing as M0...

68
00:05:21,964 --> 00:05:23,785
(there are slight differences from country to country)

69
00:05:23,785 --> 00:05:27,846
and in this example, as soon as they printed and put it into circulation...

70
00:05:27,846 --> 00:05:31,867
(that was $4) we had $4 of base money...

71
00:05:31,867 --> 00:05:35,733
and that's obvious because as soon as they printed this and bought the security with it

72
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:39,333
and it was in circulation, that $4 could be used to buy things,

73
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:42,400
it could be used to facilitate transactions.

74
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,738
Now, that clearly isn't all of the stuff that can be used as money in this little universe we created..

75
00:05:47,738 --> 00:05:53,246
You have the $4, but these people (PBs) can also write cheques over here...

76
00:05:53,246 --> 00:05:55,779
so we can have a slightly boarder definition of money

77
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:57,508
and over here we will call it M1,

78
00:05:57,569 --> 00:06:00,129
and here, there's a couple of ways you could think about it

79
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:04,190
you could think about it as all of the currenncy that's in people's pockets

80
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,615
plus all of the cheque-writing capabilities, so if you view it that way

81
00:06:07,631 --> 00:06:13,231
it would be these $2 plus $5 of cheque-writing capabilities over here.

82
00:06:13,231 --> 00:06:18,015
So you could have $2 of physical currency that's in people's wallets (not in bank reserves)

83
00:06:18,015 --> 00:06:27,133
plus the $5 of cheque-wrinting capability, which would give you $7.

84
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:40,733
Another way you could view it, is M0 plus cheque-able deposits [I'll just write 'cheques' here]

85
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,723
but if you do that, you are now double counting

86
00:06:42,723 --> 00:06:46,575
because some of the M0 is reserves in the cheque-able deposits!

87
00:06:46,575 --> 00:06:50,559
Or I could just say that some of the cheque-able deposits is held as reserves for M0

88
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:57,467
so you would have to subtract out the bank reserves...

89
00:06:57,467 --> 00:06:59,544
and so then you would get $4..

90
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:05,026
cos we don't want to double count these over here... you'd get M0 is $4...

91
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:07,292
[I'm gonna do that in white]

92
00:07:07,292 --> 00:07:11,438
M0 is $4

93
00:07:11,438 --> 00:07:15,154
The cheque-able deposits is $5..

94
00:07:15,154 --> 00:07:18,310
[Let me do that in pink.]

95
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,804
Plus the $5

96
00:07:19,804 --> 00:07:22,775
and then you would want to subtract out the reserves...

97
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:27,552
and the reserves here, there are $2 of the reserves... so minus $2

98
00:07:27,567 --> 00:07:31,538
and you would get yourself back to the $7.

99
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:34,867
The whole point of this is so that you are not double-counting something.

100
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:42,313
You are not double-counting this right over here as part of cheque-able deposits and part of the M0,

101
00:07:42,313 --> 00:07:45,800
you are not using this twice.

102
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,113
It is both base money and chequeable deposits so we don't want to count it twice.

103
00:07:50,113 --> 00:07:55,277
The simplest way to think about this is: 'What can be used in this boarder definition to facilitate transactions?'

104
00:07:55,462 --> 00:08:00,162
These $2 in people's pockets and this ability to write up to $5 of cheques.

105
00:08:00,162 --> 00:08:02,477
[So that's this view over here]

106
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:06,477
and if we want to get even boarder than that, we can get to something called M2

107
00:08:07,332 --> 00:08:12,999
And here we could say, what is immediately usable to facilitate transactions right now,

108
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:20,199
so that would be our $7 of M1, plus things that can be easiliy converted to M1.

109
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:23,653
For example, these savings account can be easily converted to chequeing accounts

110
00:08:23,653 --> 00:08:28,066
it might only take a couple of days (there might be resrictions) but it can be converted

111
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:32,332
and when it get converted, it will change the bank's reserve requirements a little bit, but it will allow

112
00:08:32,332 --> 00:08:36,866
.. if this person converts it.. they will have the ability to write more cheques

113
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:41,666
so M2 includes M1 plus things that are very easy to convert to M1,

114
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:48,199
so they will include savings accounts, money-market accounts (which I won't go into detail here,

115
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:51,799
but they are really kind of similar that you get slightly higher interest but there are restrictions

116
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:56,137
on your ability to access it, but it is not too hard to turn it into chequing accounts...)

117
00:08:56,137 --> 00:09:00,491
and things like small dollar-value time-deposit accounts.

118
00:09:00,491 --> 00:09:04,319
But for the sake of simplicity in this example, it would be the saving accounts...

119
00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:16,150
so it will be our $7 of M1, plus the $2 of savings account over here.

120
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:17,997
So this is just to give you a picture:

121
00:09:17,997 --> 00:09:20,797
when someone talks about the money supply, you really have to say, 'what are you talking about?'

122
00:09:20,797 --> 00:09:24,418
The most typical one is that you are talking about M1,

123
00:09:24,418 --> 00:09:27,977
because this is the stuff that is directly usable to facilitate transactions.

124
00:09:27,977 --> 00:09:32,059
Things like the ability to write a cheque or dollar bills in someone's wallet.

125
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:34,392
But they might be talking about base money...

126
00:09:34,392 --> 00:09:38,864
(M0, narrow money are all ways of referring to the same thing especially in the Unites Sates)

127
00:09:38,895 --> 00:09:40,892
or they might be referring to something even boarder

128
00:09:40,892 --> 00:09:46,267
and there are boarder definitions even than M2, although M3, they've stopped reporting about it

129
00:09:46,267 --> 00:09:50,800
but M3 would have things that are a little bit further from being true money,

130
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,533
from being a chequing account, but they are already fairly liquid

131
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:56,800
so they will include other types of assets,

132
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,133
but the Fed has already stopped reporting this in the recent past,

133
00:10:01,133 --> 99:59:59,999
so these are the ones that are typically referred to.
