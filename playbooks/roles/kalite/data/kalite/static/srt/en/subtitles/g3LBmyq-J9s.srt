00:00:05,764 --> 00:00:09,799
This is Steven Zucker and with Matthew Postal
who is an architectural historian,

2
00:00:09,799 --> 00:00:15,476
we are looking at Lever House,
we are on Park Avenue, 53rd Street in New York City.

3
00:00:15,476 --> 00:00:19,831
Lever House is really one of 
the great iconic post-war international style buildings.

4
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:22,877
It's georgeous and it's so perfect.

5
00:00:22,877 --> 00:00:27,421
It was restored several years ago by the architects 
who designed it - Skidmore, Owings and Merril.

6
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:31,540
So they brought back, well not the original team, 
but they brought back the original firm.

7
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:37,831
The chief designer Gordon Bunshaft had
passed away but they had the original blueprints

8
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:39,815
and they could get it back to where it was.

9
00:00:39,815 --> 00:00:43,865
It is so pristine 
and it's so much about reflectivity and about light.

10
00:00:43,865 --> 00:00:45,849
What makes this building signifcant?

11
00:00:45,849 --> 00:00:50,070
It is the first 
glass curtain wall office building in Manhattan.

12
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,166
This building is now completely inundated 
by much larger buildings that are also glass and steel.

13
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:58,555
But what did this look like 
originally in 1952 when it was finished?

14
00:00:58,555 --> 00:01:02,780
Can you imagine when it was finished, 
all of the buildings that surrounded it

15
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,615
were faced in brick and stone.

16
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:07,413
This really must have stood out,
it must have been incredibly radicle.

17
00:01:07,413 --> 00:01:11,896
How is it that corporation could have been 
that brave to do somethinng so extraordinary.

18
00:01:11,896 --> 00:01:13,823
Not to mention Skidmore, Owings and Merril.

19
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:16,219
I think a lot of it has to do with the patron.

20
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:20,358
One of the chief officers at Lever 
was the man named Charles Luckman.

21
00:01:20,358 --> 00:01:24,666
Not only had Luckman trained 
as an architect, but he had been at Johnson Wax

22
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:28,533
when they worked with 
Frank Loyd Wright on their signature headquarters.

23
00:01:28,533 --> 00:01:29,665
So that's really interesting.

24
00:01:29,665 --> 00:01:34,100
He saw first time the value that 
really innovative architecture might have on a company

25
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,302
and the way that could produce 
really sort of important public face for the firm.

26
00:01:38,302 --> 00:01:40,486
Yeah, it's definitely about populistic.

27
00:01:40,486 --> 00:01:45,665
And of course Lever interestingly enough made so 
that building really just speaks of a kind of cleanness,

28
00:01:45,712 --> 00:01:48,179
and a kind of sharpness and a kind of clarity.

29
00:01:48,194 --> 00:01:51,209
And that feeling would have been 
even stronger when it was completed

30
00:01:51,224 --> 00:01:54,928
because the limestone
in brick buildings that surrounded it

31
00:01:54,928 --> 00:01:59,388
would have been 30 or 40 years older that time 
and they probably would have needed a good cleaning.

32
00:01:59,388 --> 00:02:05,223
And so this building is georgeous 
with reflective green glass, clear glass,

33
00:02:05,223 --> 00:02:10,379
this steel trim aluminum 
and then there is this beautiful marble,

34
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:16,189
this is white marble that just amplifies the sense 
of modernity and any kind of its industrial nature.

35
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:21,673
It's really very strict in its geometry 
in the way in which it is balanced.

36
00:02:21,673 --> 00:02:24,202
The building is really made up of two buildings, isn't it?

37
00:02:24,202 --> 00:02:26,950
It's two forms. 
One horizontal and the other vertical.

38
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:33,187
Of course it is actually integrated physically but visually 
it really does look like two objects, one stuck on the other.

39
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:35,270
Almost one floating over the other.

40
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,766
I have found them balanced against each other.

41
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:43,550
So was Gordon Bunshaft really developing his ideas
himself or were there ideas that he was borrowing?

42
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,854
Where does this come from?

43
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:49,127
It's in the air. When I look at 
this building rather than pointing at one source,

44
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:52,124
I'd rather point to two different sources.

45
00:02:52,124 --> 00:02:57,643
And that would be the ideas of the French architect 
Le Corbusier and the architect Mies van der Rohe.

46
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:02,345
Both of them were really
interested in taking in industrial culture

47
00:03:02,345 --> 00:03:07,271
and introducing that, do I have it up to that point 
that the architecture was fairly old fashioned

48
00:03:07,286 --> 00:03:09,403
and really historical in its view.

49
00:03:09,403 --> 00:03:14,547
And so it is really interesting that we have 
an American and putting into practice these European ideas.

50
00:03:14,547 --> 00:03:15,908
How did that work?

51
00:03:15,908 --> 00:03:18,823
The great depression of the thirties, the second world war.

52
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:24,499
We are one of a few places 
where one could attempt to put those ideas into place.

53
00:03:24,499 --> 00:03:26,700
But now here in a corporate environment, right?

54
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,719
They used these ideas 
at the United Nations a year or two earlier

55
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:35,954
but this is the first time that
American corporation embraces these ideas.

56
00:03:35,954 --> 00:03:37,841
Kind of set the trend.

57
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:43,722
One of the things I'm really interested in
about this building is its interior, but still exterior space.

58
00:03:43,722 --> 00:03:46,300
Because you know, 
when you look at the building from across the street,

59
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:51,751
it's the horizontal slab, it's the vertical slab
but you come underneath into the courtyard

60
00:03:51,751 --> 00:03:53,318
and the whole space openes up.

61
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:56,167
Where else in New York can you sit in a centre...
