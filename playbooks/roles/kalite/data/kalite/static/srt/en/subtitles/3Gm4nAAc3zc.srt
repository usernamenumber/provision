1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,950
SAL: In the last video we
learned that if I had some--

3
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:04,420
let's say I have
some weak acid.

4
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:08,770
So it's hydrogen plus some--
the rest of whatever the

5
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:09,790
molecule was called.

6
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,550
We'll just call it A.

7
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,370
And I think this tends to be
the standard convention for

8
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,890
the rest of the acid.

9
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,580
They can disassociate, or
it's in equilibrium

10
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:19,630
because it's a weak acid.

11
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,660
So it can be in equilibrium
with-- since it's a weak acid,

12
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,270
it's going to produce some
hydrogen proton.

13
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,790
And then the rest of
the molecule is

14
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,170
going to keep the electrons.

15
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,650
So it's going to be
plus-- oh, this is

16
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:32,780
in an aqueous solution.

17
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:33,480
Let me do that.

18
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,660
Aqueous solution.

19
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,050
And then you're going to have
the rest of the acid, whatever

20
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:40,730
it might be.

21
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,170
A minus, and that's also going
to be in an aqueous solution.

22
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,540
And that's the general
pattern.

23
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:56,750
We've seen the case where A
could be an NH3, right?

24
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,620
If A is an NH3, then when you
have this, you have an NH4

25
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,880
plus, and this would
be ammonia.

26
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,460
And this is just NH3.

27
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:12,450
A could be a fluorine molecule
right there, because then this

28
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,800
would be hydrogen fluoride
or hydrofluoric acid.

29
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:22,340
And this would just be the
negative ion of fluorine.

30
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,350
Or a fluorine with an
extra electron.

31
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,170
So it could be a
bunch of stuff.

32
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,590
You can just throw in anything
there, and it'll work.

33
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,680
Especially for the weak acids.

34
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:39,240
So we learned a last video that
if this is the acid, then

35
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,800
this is the conjugate base.

36
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,340
   

37
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,680
And we could write the same
reactions, essentially, as

38
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,240
kind of more of a
basic reaction.

39
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:55,790
So we could say, if I start
with A minus-- it's in an

40
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:01,290
aqueous solution-- that's
in equilibrium with--

41
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,880
This thing could grab a hydrogen
from the surrounding

42
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,780
water and become neutral then.

43
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,479
It's still in an aqueous
solution.

44
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,620
And then one of those water
molecules that it plucked that

45
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,540
hydrogen off of is now going
to be a hydroxide molecule.

46
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:14,790
Right?

47
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,470
Because it's hydrogen.

48
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,530
Remember, whenever I say pluck
the hydrogen, just the proton,

49
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,450
not the electron for
the hydrogen.

50
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,850
So the electron stays on that
water molecule, so it has a

51
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,570
negative charge.

52
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:25,980
It's in an aqueous solution.

53
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,750
So we could write the same
reaction both ways.

54
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:33,310
And we can write equilibrium
constants for

55
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,470
both of these reactions.

56
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,670
So let's do that.

57
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,510
Let me erase this, just because
I can erase this stuff

58
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,030
right there, and then
use that space.

59
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,590
So an equilibrium reaction
for this first one.

60
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:51,670
I could call this the K sub
a, because the equilibrium

61
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,360
reaction for an acid.

62
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,430
And so this is going to be
equal to its products.

63
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:03,090
So the concentration of
my hydrogen times my

64
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,880
concentration of whatever my
conjugate base was, divided by

65
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,820
my concentration of
my original acid.

66
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,860
My weak acid.

67
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,903
So this would be the
concentration of HA.

68
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:19,130
   

69
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,170
Fair enough.

70
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,470
I could also write an
equilibrium constant for this

71
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,980
basic reaction.

72
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,250
Let me do it right down here.

73
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,360
So I'll call that my K sub b.

74
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,640
This is a base equilibrium.

75
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,700
And so this is equal to the
concentration of the products.

76
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,980
It's becoming tedious to
keep switching colors.

77
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,670
Actually, I'll do it.

78
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,480
Because it makes it easier
look at, at least for me.

79
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:52,340
HA times the concentration of
my hydroxide ions divided by

80
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,820
my concentration of
my weak base.

81
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,440
A minus.

82
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,530
Remember, this can only
be true of a weak

83
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,900
base or a weak acid.

84
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,020
If we were dealing with a strong
acid or is or a strong

85
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,140
base, this would not be an
equilibrium reaction.

86
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,730
It would only go in
one direction.

87
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,380
And when it only goes in one
direction, writing this type

88
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,505
of equilibrium reaction makes
no sense-- or equilibrium

89
00:04:12,505 --> 00:04:14,320
constant-- because it's
not in equilibrium.

90
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,560
It only goes in one direction.

91
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,550
If A was chlorine, if this was
hydrochloric acid, you

92
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,329
couldn't do this.

93
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:22,500
You would just say look, if
you have a mole of this,

94
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,190
you're just dumping a mole of
hydrogen protons in that

95
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:28,420
solution and then a bunch of
chlorine anions who are not

96
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,130
going to do anything.

97
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,990
Even though they are the
conjugate base, they wouldn't

98
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:31,460
do anything.

99
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,100
So you can only do this,
remember, for

100
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,100
weak acids and bases.

101
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,810
So with that said, let's see if
we can find a relationship

102
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,910
between Ka and Kb.

103
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:43,450
   

104
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,290
What do we have here?

105
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,705
We have an A minus on
both sides of this.

106
00:04:46,705 --> 00:04:49,990
   

107
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,003
We have H over-- OH
over A minus.

108
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:57,420
   

109
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,560
Let's solve for A minus.

110
00:04:59,560 --> 00:04:59,850
Right?

111
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:06,450
If we multiply both sides of
this equation by HA over H

112
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:15,980
plus, on the left-hand
side we get Ka times

113
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,710
the inverse of this.

114
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:28,960
So you have your HA over
H plus is equal to your

115
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,620
concentration of your
conjugate base.

116
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,790
A minus.

117
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,905
And let's do the same
thing here.

118
00:05:33,905 --> 00:05:34,900
Solve for A minus.

119
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,100
So to solve for A minus here,
we might have to do 2 steps.

120
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,970
So if we take the inverse of
both sides, you get 1 over Kb

121
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:54,990
is equal to A minus over H,
the concentration of my

122
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,090
conjugate acid times the
concentration of hydroxide.

123
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,130
Multiply both sides by this.

124
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:09,460
And I get A minus is equal
to my concentration of my

125
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,790
conjugate acid times
concentration of hydroxide.

126
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:18,220
All of that over my base
equilibrium constant.

127
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,240
Now, these are the
same reactions.

128
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,820
Right?

129
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,020
In either reaction for given
concentrations, I'm going to

130
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,150
end up with the same
concentration.

131
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,290
This is going to equal that.

132
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:28,850
Right?

133
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,610
These are two different
ways of writing

134
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,110
the exact same reaction.

135
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,410
So let's set them equal
to each other.

136
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,210
So let me copy and paste
it, actually.

137
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:46,120
So I'm saying that this thing,
copy, is equal to this thing

138
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,380
right here.

139
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:58,220
So this is equal to-- let me
copy and paste this-- that.

140
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,230
That's equal to that.

141
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,400
So let's see if we can
find a relationship

142
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,760
between Ka and Kb.

143
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,820
   

144
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,770
Well, one thing we can
do is we can divide

145
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,070
both sides by HA.

146
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,765
Right?

147
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:13,680
So if we divide both
sides by HA.

148
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,580
Actually, I could probably have
that earlier on to the

149
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,830
whole thing.

150
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,850
   

151
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:24,670
If we ignore this part right
here, this is equal to that.

152
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,110
Let me erase all of this.

153
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:26,420
Oh.

154
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,250
I'm using the wrong tool.

155
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,320
So we could say that
they both equal the

156
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,680
concentration of A minus.

157
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,130
So that's equal to that.

158
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,290
We can divide both
sides by HA.

159
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:40,750
   

160
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:46,040
This over here will cancel
with this over here.

161
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,050
And we're getting pretty close
to a neat relationship.

162
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:58,710
And so we get Ka over our
hydrogen proton concentration

163
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:06,100
is equal to our hydroxide
concentration divided by Kb.

164
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,980
You can just cross-multiply
this.

165
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:12,660
So we get Ka, our acidic
equilibrium concentration,

166
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:19,990
times Kb is equal to our
hydrogen concentration times

167
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,480
our hydroxide concentration.

168
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,150
Remember, this is all in
an aqueous solution.

169
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,110
What do we know about this?

170
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:33,470
What do we know about our
hydrogen times our hydroxide

171
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,299
concentration in an
aqueous solution?

172
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:39,909
   

173
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:43,580
For example, let me review just
to make sure I'm jogging

174
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,970
your memory properly.

175
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,560
We could have H2O.

176
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,170
It can autoionize into H plus.

177
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,760
Plus OH minus.

178
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,790
And this has an equilibrium.

179
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,660
K sub w.

180
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,880
You just put the products.

181
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,320
So the concentration of the
hydrogen protons times the

182
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,600
concentration of the
hydroxide ions.

183
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,370
And you don't divide by this
because it's the solvent.

184
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,550
And we already figured
out what this was.

185
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,590
If we have just completely
neutral water, this is 10 to

186
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,910
the minus 7.

187
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,880
And this is 10 to the minus 7.

188
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,130
So this is equal to 10
to the minus 14.

189
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,600
Now, these two things
could change.

190
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,600
I can add more hydrogen, I
could add more hydroxide.

191
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,830
And everything we've talked
about so far, that's what

192
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,470
we've been doing.

193
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,000
That's what acids
and bases do.

194
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,960
They either increase this
or they increase that.

195
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,080
But the fact that this is an
equilibrium constant means

196
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,090
that, look, I don't care
what you do to this.

197
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:43,590
At the end of the day, this
will adjust for your new

198
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,650
reality of hydrogen protons.

199
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,880
And this will always
be a constant.

200
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,200
As long as we're in an aqueous
solution, a solution of water

201
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:58,790
where water is a solvent
at 25 degrees.

202
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,900
I mean, in just pure water
it's 10 to the minus 7.

203
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,090
But no matter what we do to this
and this in an aqueous

204
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,510
solution, the product is always
going to be 10 to the

205
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,550
minus 14th power.

206
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,950
So that's the answer
to this question.

207
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:13,630
This is always going to
be 10 to the minus 14.

208
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,500
If you multiply hydrogen
concentration times OH

209
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,390
concentration.

210
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,140
Now they won't each be 10 to the
minus 7 anymore, because

211
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,010
we're dealing with a weak
acid or a weak base.

212
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,170
So they're actually going
to change these things.

213
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,040
But when you multiply them,
you're still going to get 10

214
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,770
to the minus 14.

215
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:31,910
And let's just take the minus
log of both sides of that.

216
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,800
Let me erase all this stuff
I did down here.

217
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,700
I'll need the space.

218
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,640
Let's say we take the
minus logs of both

219
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,100
sides of this equation.

220
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,120
So you get the-- let me do a
different color-- minus log,

221
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,750
of course it's base 10, of Ka.

222
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,640
Let me do it in the colors.

223
00:10:53,640 --> 00:11:04,970
Ka times Kb is going to be equal
to the minus log of 10

224
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,330
to the minus 14.

225
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,590
So what is this equal to?

226
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:12,590
The log of 10 to the minus 14
is minus 14, because 10 to

227
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,470
minus 14th power is equal
to 10 to the minus 14.

228
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,440
You take the negative of that,
so this becomes 14.

229
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,610
So the right-hand side of your
equation just becomes 14.

230
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,540
And this one, we could
use log properties.

231
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:28,160
This is same thing as
the minus log of Ka.

232
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,270
We use the colors.

233
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:37,640
Ka plus the minus log of Kb.

234
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,260
   

235
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,800
Or, though you could think of
this-- this is your pKa, this

236
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,030
is your pKb.

237
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:51,795
So you can say, this
is pKa plus pKb.

238
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:54,980
   

239
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,610
Oh, I wanted to use blue.

240
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:02,330
Plus pKb, and all of that's
going to be equal to 14.

241
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,420
Now why is this useful?

242
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:09,650
Well, if you know the pKa for
a weak acid-- For example,

243
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:14,500
let's say we have NH4 plus.

244
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,810
This is a weak acid, right?

245
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:19,830
It can donate an H, but it's not
an irreversible reaction.

246
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,980
That H can be gained back.

247
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,390
So this is a weak acid.

248
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:29,150
If you look it up on Wikipedia,
it'll say, hey, the

249
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:38,800
pKa of NH4 is equal to 9.25.

250
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,140
Right?

251
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:42,570
So this is 9.25 for NH4.

252
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,310
For ammonium.

253
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:48,390
So what is going to be
the pKb for ammonia?

254
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:48,720
Right?

255
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,240
Let me write that
reaction down.

256
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,020
So this is NH4.

257
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,100
Is in equilibrium.

258
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:57,810
This is plus.

259
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,290
It can get rid of one of its
hydrogen protons, and you're

260
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:04,000
just left with ammonia.

261
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,420
So this is the acidic
reaction.

262
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,550
So this is what the pKa
is associated with.

263
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:12,790
So the equilibrium constant
for this reaction is-- the

264
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,380
negative log of the equilibrium

265
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,130
constant is equal to 9.25.

266
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:21,230
And if I had the reverse
reaction, the conjugate base

267
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:25,210
reaction, so ammonia converts
to ammonium.

268
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:28,100
   

269
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:33,980
Plus it grabbed that hydrogen
proton from a water molecule.

270
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,680
If I wanted to figure out the
pKb, or the equilibrium

271
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,810
constant, or the negative log
of the equilibrium constant

272
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,860
for this reaction, what is it?

273
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,110
Well, this one's 9.25.

274
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:49,470
And 9.25 plus this pKb have
to be equal to 14.

275
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,500
So what's 14 minus 9.25?

276
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,550
It's what, 4.75.

277
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:58,060
So we immediately know the
equilibrium constant for the

278
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,710
conjugate base reaction.

279
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,840
So it's a useful
thing to know.

280
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,040
That the pKa plus the
pKb is equal to 14.

281
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,190
And always remember, you see
these pKa and pKb, and you

282
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:07,880
say, what is that?

283
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,250
Well, if you see a p, it's a
negative log of something.

284
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,680
And in this case, it's the
negative log of the

285
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,460
equilibrium constant for
an acidic reaction.

286
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,890
Plus the negative log of the
equilibrium basic reaction,

287
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:22,230
where this is the conjugate
base of this acid.

288
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,150
It's always going to be equal to
14 if we're dealing with an

289
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:29,260
aqueous solution at 25 degrees
Celsius, which is essentially

290
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,460
room temperature, which is
usually going to be the case.
