1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,610
   

2
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,450
We're asked to solve for y.

3
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,750
So we're told that the negative
of the cube root of y

4
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,770
is equal to 4 times the
cube root of y plus 5.

5
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,790
So in all of these it's helpful
to just be able to

6
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,400
isolate the cube root, isolate
the radical in the equation,

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,270
and then solve from there.

8
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,960
So let's see if we can
isolate the radical.

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,360
So the simplest thing to do, if
we want all of the radical

10
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,750
onto the left-hand side
equation, we can subtract 4

11
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,355
times the cube root of y from
both sides of this equation.

12
00:00:28,355 --> 00:00:33,570
So let's subtract 4.

13
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,280
We want to subtract 4 times the
cube root of y from both

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,530
sides of this equation.

15
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,750
   

16
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:49,110
And so your left-hand side, you
already have negative 1

17
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,600
times the cube root of y, and
you're going to subtract 4

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,480
more of the cube root of y.

19
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,610
So you're going to have
negative 5 times the

20
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,130
cube root of y.

21
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,690
That's your left-hand side.

22
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,420
Now the right-hand side-- these
two guys-- cancel out.

23
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,220
That was the whole point behind
subtracting this value.

24
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,880
So that cancels out and you're
just left with a 5 there.

25
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,460
You're just left with this
5 right over there.

26
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,855
Now, we've almost isolated
this cube root of y.

27
00:01:16,855 --> 00:01:18,900
We just have to divide both
sides of the equation by

28
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,600
negative 5.

29
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,220
So you just divide both
sides of this

30
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,330
equation by negative 5.

31
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:26,620
And these cancel out.

32
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,700
That was the whole point.

33
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:33,460
And we are left with the cube
root of y is equal to-- 5

34
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,920
divided by negative
5 is negative 1.

35
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,570
Now, the cube root of y is
equal to negative 1.

36
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,440
Well the easiest way to solve
this is, let's take both sides

37
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,420
of this equation to
the third power.

38
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,810
This statement right here is
the exact same statement as

39
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,840
saying y to the 1/3 is
equal to negative 1.

40
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,330
These are just two
different ways of

41
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,240
writing the same thing.

42
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,970
This is equivalent to taking
the 1/3 power.

43
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,150
So if we take both sides of
this equation to the third

44
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:09,160
power, that's like taking both
sides of this equation to the

45
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,410
third power.

46
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,890
   

47
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:16,390
And you can see here, y to the
1/3 to the third-- y to the

48
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,760
1/3 and then to the third,
that's like saying y to the

49
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,830
1/3 times 3 power.

50
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,320
Or y to the first power.

51
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,520
That's the whole point of it.

52
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,840
If you take the cube root of y
to the third power, that's

53
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,580
just going to be y.

54
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,610
So the left-hand
side becomes y.

55
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,190
And then the right-hand side,
what's negative 1

56
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,850
to the third power?

57
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,700
Negative 1 times negative
1 is 1.

58
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,950
Times negative 1 again
is negative 1.

59
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:40,790
So we get y is equal to negative
1 as our solution.

60
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,460
Now let's make sure that
it actually works.

61
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,395
Let's go back to our
original equation.

62
00:02:45,395 --> 00:02:49,170
And I'll put negative
1 in for our y's.

63
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,550
We had the negative of the
cube root of-- this time,

64
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:59,510
negative 1-- has to be equal
to 4 times the cube root of

65
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,560
negative 1 plus 5.

66
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,750
Let's verify that this
is the case.

67
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,210
The cube root of negative
1 is negative 1.

68
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,770
Negative 1 to the third
power is negative 1.

69
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:13,230
So this is equal to the negative
of negative 1 has to

70
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:17,110
be equal to 4 times-- the cube
root of negative 1 is

71
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,870
negative 1 plus 5.

72
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,330
The negative of negative
1 is just positive 1.

73
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,120
So 1 needs to be equal to--
4 times negative 1,

74
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,070
negative 4, plus 5.

75
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,110
This is true.

76
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,260
Negative 4 plus 5 is 1.

77
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,420
So this works out.

78
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,490
This is our solution.

79
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,000
