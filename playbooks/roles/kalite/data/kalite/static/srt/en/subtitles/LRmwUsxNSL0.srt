What I want to do in this video is reconcile the more traditional drake equation with the stuff that

2
00:00:05,941 --> 00:00:10,764
we derived or that we came up with. We kind of thought through it in the last several videos.

3
00:00:10,795 --> 00:00:18,200
So the more known drake equation is this: The number of detectable civilizations in the galaxy is equal

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:25,200
to -- and they'll have this -- and this is not the number of stars in the galaxy -- this is the average

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,148
rate of star formations per year in the galaxy.

6
00:00:29,171 --> 00:00:42,987
So ... let me write this down -- average rate of star formations -- which seems kind-of unintuitive, and it is, but hopefully we'll

7
00:00:43,064 --> 00:00:47,710
reconcile to show you that this and what we are going to show with the traditional drake equation are

8
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,264
actually the same thing.
