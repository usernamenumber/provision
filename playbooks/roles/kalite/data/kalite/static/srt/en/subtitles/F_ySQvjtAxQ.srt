1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,740
In the last video, I talked
about the two campaigns that

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,860
eventually lead to Napoleon's
downfall.

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,510
One of those was the Peninsular
Campaign.

5
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:13,000
   

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,860
Where Napoleon and the French
Empire had to waste a

7
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,060
significant amount of resources
fighting and trying

8
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,460
to hold Spain.

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,530
And the other, almost more
direct catalyst for the fall

10
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:32,630
of Napoleon, was his
invasion of Russia.

11
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,110
We're going to see in this is
video why it was so disastrous

12
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:36,600
for Napoleon.

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,560
This is easily one of the top
five, I would say, famous

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,480
military campaigns in
all of history.

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,970
So let's remind ourselves the
relationship between Napoleon,

16
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,110
or between the French
Empire and Russia.

17
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:54,740
After the Fourth Coalition, you
might remember the Treaty

18
00:00:54,740 --> 00:01:03,100
of Tilsit, they're friends.

19
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,620
   

20
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,440
Russia was part of the
Continental System, which

21
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,700
means that they would boycott
or that they would not trade

22
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,710
with Britain.

23
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,200
Or allow Britain to use
any of Russia's ports.

24
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,090
And Russia was allowed to do
anything that they want with

25
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:18,990
the Ottoman Empire.

26
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,730
So everything was good.

27
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,750
But then we move forward
to 1811.

28
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,090
We're in 1811 and Russia
starts relaxing the

29
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,340
Continental System.

30
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:38,750
   

31
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,240
Essentially meaning that they
started to trade a little bit

32
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:41,840
with Britain.

33
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:48,760
So this all of a sudden begins
to annoy, it angers Napoleon.

34
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,740
In order for an embargo to
work, in order for the

35
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,290
Continental System to work,
everyone on the continent has

36
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,300
to not trade with Britain.

37
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,310
Because if someone trades with
Britain, Britain could just

38
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,560
trade with them and then that
trade could circulate through

39
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,320
the rest of Europe.

40
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,730
So in order for this to work,
it has to be total.

41
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,080
So this already annoys
Napoleon.

42
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,040
Especially because he defeated
the Russians

43
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,199
in the Fourth Coalition.

44
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,650
In the Treaty of Tilsit
he thought he was

45
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,650
being nice to them.

46
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,110
Just don't do any trade with
Great Britain, we're going to

47
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,630
be good buddies.

48
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:21,750
But then what really got
Napoleon is in 1812, he hears

49
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:27,230
that Russia is thinking about
taking the French Empire's

50
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,600
part of Poland, or the
Duchy of Warsaw.

51
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:41,850
So Russia thinking about
taking Poland.

52
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,360
So Napoleon figures, gee, we're
no longer friends, I

53
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,690
better attack them
preemptively.

54
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:52,330
So against the advice of a lot
of people about actually

55
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,820
invading Russia, Napoleon
decides to invade.

56
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:04,290
So this directly leads
to Napoleon invading.

57
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,090
And his other option, obviously,
would have been

58
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,950
just to defend Poland
from Russia.

59
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:13,020
But Napoleon, he just says no,
look if they're going to

60
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,810
double cross me like that, I'm
just going to go full tilt and

61
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:16,790
show them who's boss.

62
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:25,380
So he decides to invade
in April of 1812.

63
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,550
And Napoleon is no dummy.

64
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,980
He realizes that the Russian
winter is really vicious.

65
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,470
So he says, if I start in the
late spring like this and I

66
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,210
engage the Russians and I
decisively defeat them,

67
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,300
everything will be
said and done.

68
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,140
And I'll be Emperor of
Russia, as well.

69
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,960
Before Russia even begins
to get cold.

70
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,330
So what I'm going to do here,
to just understand how

71
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:49,660
devastating this campaign ends
up being to Napoleon, I'm

72
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,750
going to use one of the
most famous charts in

73
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,780
the history of charts.

74
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,060
Some people consider this
to be the best, most

75
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,400
well-designed chart ever.

76
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,050
And this was created
by Charles-- let

77
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:03,910
me use another color.

78
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,325
I keep using this.

79
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:11,310
This was created by Charles
Joseph Minard.

80
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,470
   

81
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,279
You can actually get a bigger
version of this on Wikipedia.

82
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,820
But that was too big
for my screen.

83
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,440
So this is a smaller version.

84
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,770
But it's a fascinating chart.

85
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:28,600
So what it shows is the size
of Napoleon's army as it

86
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,860
invades Russia.

87
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,670
And the size of the army is
shown by the width of this

88
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,330
brown line right here.

89
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:41,900
So when he starts invading
Russia, he has 450,000 men.

90
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,300
If you could read this number,
that's what it says.

91
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,990
And you can find zoomed
versions on the web.

92
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,380
If you just do a search on this
and on the invasion of

93
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,040
Russia, you'll find
this chart.

94
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,400
It's very, very famous.

95
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,370
More than even teaching you the
history, this is also just

96
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,480
a neat chart to look at.

97
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,310
And it's something that
you should be

98
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,030
exposed to at some point.

99
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,660
But as you can see, and just
so you have some scope of

100
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,030
what's going on, not only does
it show you the size of his

101
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,690
forces, it shows the path
that it travels.

102
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:10,040
And you can already see that as
the forces are travelling,

103
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,130
the number of the soldiers in
the force is getting smaller

104
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:14,550
and smaller.

105
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,000
And he keeps updating
the numbers.

106
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,900
So obviously that width is
smaller than that width, by it

107
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,690
looks like it's less than half
the forces at this point than

108
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,300
at this point.

109
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,490
And just to understand where
this is going on, here is a

110
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,840
map of Eastern Europe.

111
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,930
And Charles Joseph Minard's map
starts right around here

112
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,550
in Lithuania.

113
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,750
So this is where the Napoleon
forces were strongest, where

114
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,220
he had 450,000.

115
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,530
And it kind of goes like this.

116
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,830
This is Moscow right here.

117
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,130
So this is kind of
the endpoint.

118
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:53,290
And if I were to trace this
shape onto here, it would look

119
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,650
something like this.

120
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,030
I'm just trying to
show the path.

121
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,940
Roughly like this.

122
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,740
   

123
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,850
And then you get to Moscow.

124
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,130
So that line is the same
thing as that line.

125
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,700
Just so you have some context
within the broader

126
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,800
geography of Europe.

127
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,100
So it's starting off, in what's
almost exactly the

128
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,240
northeastern border of
present-day Poland, or you

129
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,930
could say the southwestern
border

130
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,260
of what's now Lithuania.

131
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,290
Crosses through what
is now Belarus.

132
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,320
And then goes on into Russia.

133
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,770
Now, as you can see here, I
already pointed out, that as

134
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:37,830
he's traveling, as the forces
are travelling, these 450,000

135
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:42,530
men, horses, and armaments, and
cannons, and everything

136
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,110
else is getting thinner
and thinner.

137
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:48,120
And one is, it's just basic
military logistics.

138
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,100
You have to keep your
supply routes open.

139
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:56,310
You have to keep leaving men
behind to essentially guard

140
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,250
the supply routes.

141
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,640
So just as the longer your
campaign, and the further into

142
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,540
enemy territory you have, you
have to keep leaving men

143
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,800
behind to guard it.

144
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,320
And this whole time, Napoleon
kept wanting to engage with

145
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,000
the Russians.

146
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,850
The whole time that he was
travelling, he kept expecting

147
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,060
to engage the Russians.

148
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,460
But just as he was about to
engage the Russians, the

149
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,860
Russians would back
up a little bit.

150
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,800
And this kept happening.

151
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,070
They're were small skirmishes,
so obviously he lost some

152
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,120
troops here or there.

153
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,090
But most of this was just to
maintain the supply line.

154
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:32,560
Eventually, he is able to have,
I guess we could say, a

155
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,520
skirmish, I don't want to say
a skirmish, it was actually

156
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,740
maybe a brief battle
with the Russians

157
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,420
in August in Smolensk.

158
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:46,760
And that is, let me make sure
I get it right on the map,

159
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,530
right there.

160
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,660
But once again, Napoleon
was victorious.

161
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,790
But the Russians retreated, it
wasn't a decisive victory over

162
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,210
the Russian army.

163
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,990
Eventually, he just keeps
chasing them, keeps chasing

164
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:06,870
them, until we get to
September 7, 1812.

165
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:10,360
And now you could imagine that
we're kind of in the fall now.

166
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,620
And it gets cold quickly
out here in Russia.

167
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,050
So already, it's getting to be a
kind of precarious position.

168
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,330
But Napoleon is confident.

169
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,060
He's like, you know what?

170
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,300
If I can decisively defeat the
Russians, I can take Moscow.

171
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,070
Moscow will have food it in.

172
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:25,980
And all will be said and done.

173
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,830
And that's actually brings
up another point.

174
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,020
You might remember when I talked
about the War of the

175
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,140
Third Coalition, that Napoleon,
and in general good

176
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,880
military tactics to invade
during the fall.

177
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,990
Because of fall is the
harvest season.

178
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,440
That way you don't have to
have as many supplies

179
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,179
carried with you.

180
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:45,730
You don't have to guard the
supply routes as carefully.

181
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,600
Because you can just go and take
all of the farmer's crops

182
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,890
to feed your troops.

183
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,420
But what the Russians did is
what they call scorched earth

184
00:08:53,420 --> 00:09:02,620
tactics, which essentially
means exactly

185
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,830
what it sounds like.

186
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:09,050
As the Russians kept retreating
back, they burned

187
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,790
everything that could be of
benefit to Napoleon's troops.

188
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:17,810
So they burned all the fields
as they retreated, so that

189
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,920
Napoleon's troops couldn't
access the local resources.

190
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,600
So they had to keep having a
very-- I guess you could say--

191
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,480
costly supply chain from where
they started, as opposed to

192
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,910
just feeding off of the land.

193
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,890
And the Russians just
continued to do this

194
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,190
on and on and on.

195
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,540
All the way to Moscow.

196
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:39,180
All the way to September 1812,
where we have the Battle of

197
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,000
Borodino, if I'm saying
it correctly.

198
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:52,345
   

199
00:09:52,345 --> 00:09:59,310
And at this point, Napoleon
only had a 135,000 of his

200
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,480
original 450,000 men.

201
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,220
The rest had to be left behind
to guard the supply route.

202
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,820
Or they deserted because they
were starting to get hungry.

203
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,880
Or they were lost just with
minor skirmishes that happened

204
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,580
along the entire way.

205
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,770
And at the Battle of Borodino,
after a long, protracted,

206
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:21,950
super bloody battle, in which--
let me write these

207
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,920
numbers down-- 44-- and these
are all estimates-- 44,000

208
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,940
Russian casualties.

209
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,890
Mostly death, but also
wounded or captured.

210
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:36,850
And 35,000 French.

211
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:39,410
Many historians think this is
the most of bloody day of

212
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,940
battle up to this
day in history.

213
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,960
The French are victorious.

214
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,060
So we have a French
victory here.

215
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,930
   

216
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,900
So Napoleon is feeling
good about himself.

217
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,660
Borodino is right outside
of Moscow.

218
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,260
He's like, you know what?

219
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,850
I'm just going to walk
into Moscow.

220
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,180
They're going to hand the keys
of the city over to me.

221
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,760
And then my troops are going to
have a good time in Moscow

222
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,740
being able to eat all the
food that must be there.

223
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,380
And I will now be Emperor
of Russia, as well.

224
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,600
So about a week later, he walks
into Moscow and it's

225
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,850
completely deserted.

226
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:17,530
   

227
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:20,390
All of the inhabitants have left
and they've taken all the

228
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,860
food with them.

229
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,433
And then on top of that,
Moscow starts burning.

230
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:29,270
   

231
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:32,420
And there's some debate as
to why Moscow burned.

232
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,750
Some historians believe it
is because the Russians

233
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,160
deliberately set fire
to the city.

234
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,780
Some believe that it was just
a tinder box waiting to burn

235
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,410
and Napoleon's troops were just
a little irresponsible

236
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,800
with where they built fires.

237
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,870
It's not clear.

238
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:51,230
But needless to say, it made
Moscow useless to Napoleon.

239
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,880
And this is kind of
a major change.

240
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,900
Napoleon just expected look,
if I beat your army

241
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,300
decisively, like I did it
at Borodino, I won.

242
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,200
I take the city.

243
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,730
Now, you should give me
food and shelter.

244
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:04,750
And I'm your new Emperor.

245
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,740
But the Russians had something
different in mind.

246
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,100
They said, no you will
never take Russia.

247
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,270
You can have Moscow.

248
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,650
You can have a burned Moscow.

249
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:12,590
There's nothing in it.

250
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:17,310
And we'll just like to see you
retreat in the Moscow winter.

251
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:22,020
And by Napoleon's own accounts,
this is a quote that

252
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:26,370
he gave. The most terrible of
all my battles was the one

253
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,750
before Moscow.

254
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,630
The French showed themselves
to be worthy of victory.

255
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,950
This is at Borodino.

256
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,940
But the Russians show themselves
worthy of being

257
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,170
invincible.

258
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:40,510
So with no one to recognize
Napoleon or to help him out or

259
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,440
to feed his troops, he's kind
of in a worthless Moscow.

260
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,090
He decides to just turn around,
especially because the

261
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,580
Russian winter is approaching.

262
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,770
So on this chart you can see
they went all the way to

263
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,610
Moscow, they had
135,000 troops.

264
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,610
They lose 35,000 of them.

265
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,720
So you have 100,000 troops
coming back.

266
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,730
This black line, right here,
this represents the retreat.

267
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,970
And then things start
getting cold.

268
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:05,780
So it's really interesting
about this

269
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,970
chart that Minard made.

270
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,230
It has a couple things.

271
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,940
You see the route that
Napoleon's army took as it

272
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,370
went into Russia.

273
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,130
Then in black, this
is its retreat.

274
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,660
It gets thinner and thinner
and thinner.

275
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,940
And you see where they went.

276
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,770
And on top of that,
he shows the

277
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:24,240
temperature as they retreated.

278
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,470
And this is on something called
a Reaumur scale, but

279
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,120
you can just multiply these
numbers, if you can

280
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,230
see them, by 1.25.

281
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:33,170
So you can see that it was
already, it was not that bad.

282
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,190
But over here, we're already
below freezing.

283
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,340
We're well below freezing
over here.

284
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,620
At the coldest point, if
Minard's numbers are right,

285
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,080
and I've seen some historians
contest the numbers, but it

286
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,490
was cold nonetheless.

287
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,740
It's negative 37 degrees as
we start approaching into

288
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,880
November and December.

289
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,890
So Napoleon's forces, as before,
they had this whole

290
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,110
supply chain.

291
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,950
They had scorched earth.

292
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,020
So there's nothing to eat.

293
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,110
They still had nothing to eat.

294
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,600
Then it started getting cold.

295
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,030
And while it was cold and they
were retreating, some of the

296
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,150
troops would desert.

297
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:04,370
They would be attacked
by peasants.

298
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:07,580
Just little bit by little bit
they'd be attacked by various

299
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,940
Russian forces.

300
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,950
And then kind of the final blow
was when they were trying

301
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,710
to cross the Berezina River.

302
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:18,130
So this right here is
the Berezina River.

303
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:23,620
   

304
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,050
And you can even see from
Minard's chart that the width

305
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,440
was respectable.

306
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,080
But then after trying
to cross that

307
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,260
river, it just got decimated.

308
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,770
Almost half of the soldiers
died or disappeared.

309
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,930
And these are depictions, these
are paintings, of the

310
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,320
retreat of Napoleon's forces
in the winter.

311
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:50,850
This is actually a painting of
the crossing of Berezina.

312
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:54,810
   

313
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,940
And by the time that the forces
got back at the end of

314
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,700
1812-- all the way over here,
by Minard's map-- you only

315
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,970
have 10,000 troops of the
original 450,000.

316
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,930
So only 1 in 45 returned.

317
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,000
The other were either captured,

318
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,620
deserted, or just died.

319
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,210
So when this happened, you could
imagine, not only did

320
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:17,290
Napoleon lose so many soldiers,
also lost on the

321
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,010
order of 200,000 horses.

322
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:24,730
Actually, total casualties for
this one campaign, the

323
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:28,920
estimates are about 300,000
French troops.

324
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,310
The estimates I saw had about
200,000 Russian troops.

325
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:36,310
And just to be clear, a big
portion of the French troops

326
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,450
died as they tried to retreat.

327
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:44,830
And then there was a huge amount
of Russian civilian

328
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,320
casualties.

329
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,460
And there were also soldiers
from other countries

330
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:51,440
participating, especially
on the French side.

331
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:58,390
When all is said and done,
estimates are over 1 million

332
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,000
dead from the French invasion.

333
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,660
But beyond even just the human
casualties, Napoleon lost on

334
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,820
the order of 200,000 horses.

335
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,160
I forgot the exact number,
but thousands of canons.

336
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,250
So you could imagine, that it
was just this huge, huge loss

337
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,440
to the French military.

338
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,750
So by the time this was done,
the rest of the powers of

339
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:23,910
Europe could kind of finally see
Napoleon being weakened.

340
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:26,180
He was already bogged down
in the peninsula.

341
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,140
He had this huge defeat as he
tried to invade Russia.

342
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:33,510
They finally realized that now
is the time that they can form

343
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:38,070
maybe a Sixth Coalition and
really take Napoleon out.

344
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:38,333
