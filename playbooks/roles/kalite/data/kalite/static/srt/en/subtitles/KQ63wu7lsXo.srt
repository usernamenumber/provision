1
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:07,745
Dionysus the god of wine didn't like to be lonely

2
00:00:07,745 --> 00:00:12,360
he was surrounded by the satyrs and by maenads, he loved to party

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,037
--and you can't party alone--

4
00:00:14,037 --> 00:00:18,590
No you can't party alone. And of course the satrys would become tired

5
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,680
sometimes after they drank a bit too much and that's exactly the subject

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,631
of the Barberini Faun that were looking at

7
00:00:25,631 --> 00:00:27,686
Now a satyr is not

8
00:00:27,686 --> 00:00:30,368
a human being he may look human to us but he's

9
00:00:30,368 --> 00:00:33,672
in greek mithology part animal really-- That's right

10
00:00:33,672 --> 00:00:37,964
he's a subhuman in the hierarchy of the gods where, the gods

11
00:00:37,964 --> 00:00:41,487
at mount Olympus at the top, then you had heroes that were half divine

12
00:00:41,487 --> 00:00:45,356
and half human, then you had humans, and then you had subhumans

13
00:00:45,356 --> 00:00:48,939
even below that monsters. A satyr would be a subhuman

14
00:00:48,939 --> 00:00:52,319
and if you look really closely you can tell that although

15
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:55,933
looks quite human in most ways he's got a tail, pointy ears

16
00:00:55,933 --> 00:00:59,238
and sometimes this is even represented with hooves-- Yeah you

17
00:00:59,238 --> 00:01:03,415
can see the tail actually coming from behind his

18
00:01:03,415 --> 00:01:06,489
left thigh, that's where I first noticed it-- And for the greeks

19
00:01:06,489 --> 00:01:10,797
these particular subhumans, the satyrs, were half civilized and half

20
00:01:10,797 --> 00:01:15,273
wild and so it was wonderful way to express the uncultivated

21
00:01:15,273 --> 00:01:18,924
the kind of barbaric qualities of human nature-- His name was the

22
00:01:18,924 --> 00:01:23,406
Barberini Faun, he's not a really faun, he's really maerceder

23
00:01:23,406 --> 00:01:26,939
but he's called the Barberini Faun because when he was discovered

24
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,297
in Rome near the Castle Sant'angelo in 1625

25
00:01:31,297 --> 00:01:34,455
the pope at the time was from the Barberini family

26
00:01:34,455 --> 00:01:38,734
and everyone recognized how spectacular this figure was and the pope

27
00:01:38,734 --> 00:01:42,589
said well I officially declare this to be part of my family collection

28
00:01:42,589 --> 00:01:45,850
He wanted to do that because it was so important, not only

29
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,221
is it just a stellar example sculpture, but we think this actually

30
00:01:49,221 --> 00:01:52,307
dates to the Third century B.C.E and that it is

31
00:01:52,307 --> 00:01:56,352
an original greek sculpture. Although it's always very hard

32
00:01:56,352 --> 00:02:00,456
to tell where something is a greek original or a later roman copy

33
00:02:00,456 --> 00:02:03,702
-- it could be a terrific copy, we do know though that

34
00:02:03,702 --> 00:02:07,753
at least a portion of it has been restored. And you can see those restorations

35
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:11,931
quite clearly in the lower part of the left thigh and almost

36
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:14,615
the entire right leg and foot.

37
00:02:14,615 --> 00:02:18,322
So the spectacular sculpture ended up here in Munich when it was apart by

38
00:02:18,322 --> 00:02:21,997
Prince Ludwig of Bavaria in the early nineteen century

39
00:02:21,997 --> 00:02:25,529
Quite a scultpture to add to his collection for his new museum.

40
00:02:25,529 --> 00:02:30,588
It's an amazing thing to think that his was likely found

41
00:02:30,588 --> 00:02:32,323
in the moat of Hedrian's tomb in what is now

42
00:02:32,323 --> 00:02:34,664
Castle Sant'angelo in Rome. I imagine people were

43
00:02:34,664 --> 00:02:39,438
dying to purchase this-- It's incredibly erotic

44
00:02:39,438 --> 00:02:42,650
this figure has his legs spread he's in a drunken

45
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,916
half sleepy half awake state-- What you see that in his body

46
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:49,523
on the one hand it's absolute exhaustion, he's just

47
00:02:49,523 --> 00:02:52,864
dead tired. But on the other side you can see

48
00:02:52,864 --> 00:02:54,785
the agitation in his body.

49
00:02:54,785 --> 00:02:58,064
There's tension there. Look at right leg, the way it's pushed up

50
00:02:58,064 --> 00:03:01,873
up, now that part is a restoration, but we know that is pretty much

51
00:03:01,873 --> 00:03:05,790
the placement because of a rock on which it sat.

52
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,389
And you can see his face too, that there's a combination of exhaustion and

53
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:13,744
restlesness-- Well look at that face. It is just spectacularly

54
00:03:13,744 --> 00:03:17,264
sensitive and I love the fact that it is not

55
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:21,496
symmetrical, his head is pushed over to the side. And if you look

56
00:03:21,496 --> 00:03:24,933
at his cheeks straight on it you can see the gravity is compressing

57
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:28,817
the right side of his face and is expanding the left side

58
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:32,300
and so there really is this intense naturalism,

59
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,068
this observation of the elastic qualities of the human body.

60
00:03:36,068 --> 00:03:40,297
Now we're in the helenistic period where ancient greek artist

61
00:03:40,297 --> 00:03:43,706
are expanding their subject matter so we don't just have

62
00:03:43,706 --> 00:03:48,169
the heroic ideal athletic nudes that we saw in the classical

63
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:51,498
period, but here the artists explore a more emotional state.

64
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:56,046
More varieties of subjet matter-- That's right sometimes

65
00:03:56,046 --> 00:03:59,222
this is either reffered to as the helenistic baroque because

66
00:03:59,222 --> 00:04:02,805
of it's willingness to remove the reserve that we

67
00:04:02,805 --> 00:04:06,938
associate with the high class of a period before-- He's certainly not reserved

68
00:04:06,938 --> 00:04:08,450
in here-- No, not at all.

69
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:14,144
So what are the other symbols that identify his as a Satyr? As if the tail

70
00:04:14,144 --> 00:04:18,969
and the ears, the want and abandon quality wasn't enough

71
00:04:18,969 --> 00:04:22,622
You can see that he's laid out on leopord skin. He's on a rock

72
00:04:22,622 --> 00:04:26,245
protecting him from the roughness of the rock. And you can see that he's even

73
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:29,617
keeping his heel on it, it's softer, and he's

74
00:04:29,617 --> 00:04:33,033
rolled it up a little bit under his arm

75
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:34,702
so that it functions somewhat like a cushion.

76
00:04:34,887 --> 00:04:39,075
Although it is a little hard for you to imagine him walking up to this rock

77
00:04:39,075 --> 00:04:44,091
laying down the leopard skin then somehow lying on it-- It's a good seat-- It is.

78
00:04:44,091 --> 00:04:47,589
So you said this is helenistic and it certainly is, in so many ways.

79
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:50,273
But it is clearly informed by the

80
00:04:50,273 --> 00:04:53,104
by the classical tradition that had come before it-- In terms of it's

81
00:04:53,104 --> 00:04:56,612
treatment of the human body and it's attention to musculature anatomy.

82
00:04:56,612 --> 00:04:59,761
Absolutely that's really clear in the torso-- We can see the folds

83
00:04:59,761 --> 00:05:04,845
of his flesh in his abodomen or the careful articulation

84
00:05:04,845 --> 00:05:07,737
of the muscles, and the shoulders, and the armpit. This is

85
00:05:07,737 --> 00:05:10,122
amazing understanding of human anatomy-- But it is also

86
00:05:10,122 --> 00:05:14,378
a little bit off kilter. You can see that the

87
00:05:14,378 --> 00:05:19,059
ribcage is pushing a little bit to his left. And so the whole thing

88
00:05:19,059 --> 00:05:22,394
has a gentle turn to it making it even more complex.

89
00:05:22,394 --> 00:05:26,208
There is a turn in the torso and we see that in other

90
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:30,360
ancient greek sculptures like the belvedere torso and although this was found

91
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,241
a hundred years after Michaelangelo or a little bit less, you can see

92
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:38,213
how that kind of twisting and torsion in the body

93
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:41,431
was something that Michaelangelo would pick up on-- I think that if

94
00:05:41,555 --> 00:05:45,760
Michaelangelo had ever have had the opportunity to see this he would absolutely love it.

95
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,545
No question.
