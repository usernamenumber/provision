1
00:00:00,201 --> 00:00:02,178
Let's say I've been researching some

2
00:00:02,178 --> 00:00:04,982
stocks to potentially invest in, and I feel pretty good

3
00:00:04,982 --> 00:00:08,029
at my ability to predict how good a company's

4
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:10,429
going to do, relative to peoples' expectations

5
00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:13,554
or the market's expectations. In particular I focus

6
00:00:13,554 --> 00:00:17,946
on companies A and B. In the case of company A

7
00:00:17,946 --> 00:00:21,139
I think it's going to do a lot worse than the market expects it to do

8
00:00:21,139 --> 00:00:26,410
So, I'm tempted to short it. And in the case of company B

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,479
I think it's going to do much better than the market expects

10
00:00:29,479 --> 00:00:32,677
So, I'm tempted to buy it, or go long.

11
00:00:32,677 --> 00:00:35,637
But, there's one thing about this process that gets

12
00:00:35,637 --> 00:00:38,495
me a little bit uncomfortable. I have confidence

13
00:00:38,495 --> 00:00:40,971
in my ability to pick out companies that are

14
00:00:40,971 --> 00:00:44,095
going to out-perform the market, or are going to under-perform the market

15
00:00:44,095 --> 00:00:46,962
But, I have no confidence in my ability to predict the market.

16
00:00:46,962 --> 00:00:50,863
In general... let me draw a little chart of the market

17
00:00:50,863 --> 00:00:54,327
this is the market price, maybe this is the S&P 500 or the NASDAQ...

18
00:00:54,358 --> 00:00:57,105
And I've just found that it's pretty as good as random

19
00:00:57,105 --> 00:00:59,890
as opposed to me trying to pick out bottoms of the markets

20
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,013
or tops of the markets, and all of the rest

21
00:01:02,013 --> 00:01:04,832
So, my fear is what happens if I buy company B,

22
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:07,125
based on my sound research, and then the market

23
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:10,164
goes down? Then company B will probably still go down.

24
00:01:10,164 --> 00:01:12,160
Maybe it won't go down as much as the market

25
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,091
but it will still go down, and I will lose money.

26
00:01:14,091 --> 00:01:17,097
Or what if I short company A and the market

27
00:01:17,097 --> 00:01:22,018
goes up. Maybe company A won't go up as much

28
00:01:22,018 --> 00:01:24,304
as the market, but I will still lose money on my

29
00:01:24,304 --> 00:01:27,198
short position, which is essentially a bet

30
00:01:27,198 --> 00:01:29,823
that the stock is going to go down.

31
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:33,484
Is there some arrangement I could do, some

32
00:01:33,484 --> 00:01:38,187
combination of buying company B and selling (or shorting) company A

33
00:01:38,187 --> 00:01:42,113
that will essentially hedge out a lot of this market risk?

34
00:01:42,113 --> 00:01:45,152
and as you can imagine, there is! And I won't go into

35
00:01:45,152 --> 00:01:48,100
all the statistics of it, and beta, and how you can

36
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,091
really try to statistically hedge-out the market risk

37
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:54,390
But the general idea is, if you really think this is

38
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,367
going to out-perform the market, or definitely

39
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:58,531
out-perform company A, and if you think A is

40
00:01:58,531 --> 00:02:00,431
going to under-perform the market, or definitely

41
00:02:00,431 --> 00:02:03,344
under-perform relative to company B, you can

42
00:02:03,344 --> 00:02:08,352
buy a similar amount of B as you will short company A

43
00:02:08,352 --> 00:02:10,710
So in this case, let's just do one share

44
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,822
you can obviously do multiples of this

45
00:02:12,822 --> 00:02:22,702
you buy one share of company B, and you sell

46
00:02:22,702 --> 00:02:25,690
or you short one share of company A

47
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,992
you borrow the share, you sell it, and you'll have to

48
00:02:26,992 --> 00:02:32,931
buy it at a future date. So you short

49
00:02:32,931 --> 00:02:37,666
two shares of company A, and the reason why I'm saying

50
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:40,240
two shares of company A instead of one share

51
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,338
is because A is only $5 per share and

52
00:02:43,338 --> 00:02:45,768
B is $10 dollars per share. So I want to do

53
00:02:45,768 --> 00:02:47,879
roughly the same amount, and once again, you can

54
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:51,513
do fancier statistics on it to tweak it, so you can

55
00:02:51,513 --> 00:02:53,197
see how much they actually move in the market

56
00:02:53,197 --> 00:02:55,029
but we're not going to worry about that right here.

57
00:02:55,029 --> 00:02:58,839
So for simplicity, what we've done here is we've taken

58
00:02:58,839 --> 00:03:08,996
a long position in B... and we have a $10 dollar long position

59
00:03:08,996 --> 00:03:12,638
and we've taken a short position in A

60
00:03:12,638 --> 00:03:16,177
and it is also a $10 short position. Once again

61
00:03:16,177 --> 00:03:20,055
because A is $5 per share, so we've taken two shares of A

62
00:03:20,055 --> 00:03:22,872
which makes the same dollar amount.

63
00:03:22,872 --> 00:03:25,454
Now let's think about, and maybe I'll save this for the

64
00:03:25,454 --> 00:03:28,158
next video, I want you to think about what happens

65
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,025
if the market moves up or down, but B out-performs A

66
00:03:32,025 --> 99:59:59,999
or, A out-performs B?
