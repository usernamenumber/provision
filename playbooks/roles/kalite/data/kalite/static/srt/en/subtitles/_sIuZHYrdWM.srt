1
00:00:00,969 --> 00:00:02,864
Factor out the greatest common factor.

2
00:00:02,864 --> 00:00:07,610
And the expression it gives us is 4x^4 y + 8x^3 y.

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,440
When they say to factor out the greatest common factor,

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,948
they're essentially telling us to find the greatest common factor of

5
00:00:11,948 --> 00:00:18,507
4x^4 y and 8x^3 y and factor it out of this expression, kind of undistribute it.

6
00:00:18,507 --> 00:00:24,036
And to find that greatest common factor, now I always put it in quotes when we speak in kind of algebraic terms.

7
00:00:24,036 --> 00:00:27,190
Because we don't really know what "x" and "y" are - whether they're positive or negative,

8
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,369
or whether they are greater than or less than 1.

9
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:32,109
So it's not always going to be the greatest absolute number,

10
00:00:32,109 --> 00:00:38,168
but it's kind of the greatest and it contains the most terms of these two expressions, these two monomials.

11
00:00:38,168 --> 00:00:46,281
So if we were to essentially factor out 4x^4 y, it would look like this.

12
00:00:46,281 --> 00:00:59,865
We do the prime factorization of 4, which is just 2 times 2, times x^4, which is "x" times "x" times "x" times "x",

13
00:00:59,865 --> 00:01:06,302
times "y", and we just kind of expanded it out as the product of its basic constituents.

14
00:01:06,302 --> 00:01:24,302
Now let's do the same thing for 8x^3, so we have in this situation 8x^3 y.

15
00:01:24,302 --> 00:01:28,369
So the prime factorization of 8 is 2 times 2 times 2.

16
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:31,969
It's 2 times 2 times 2.

17
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:36,782
Prime, or I should say, the factorization of x^3, the expansion of it,

18
00:01:36,782 --> 00:01:42,303
is just "x" times "x" times "x", x multiplied by itself 3 times.

19
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:46,969
And then we are multiplying everything by "y" here.

20
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:51,702
So what factors are common to both of these? And you want to I include as many as possible to find

21
00:01:51,702 --> 00:01:54,369
this "greatest common factor".

22
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:57,443
So we have 2 2's here, 3 2's here,

23
00:01:57,443 --> 00:02:02,025
so we only have 2 2's in common in both of them.

24
00:02:02,025 --> 00:02:06,970
We have 4 "x"s here, only 3 "x"s here, so we only have three "x"s in common.

25
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:10,042
3 "x"s and 3 "x"s.

26
00:02:10,042 --> 00:02:14,842
We have a "y" here and a "y" here, so "y" is common to both, to both expressions,

27
00:02:14,842 --> 00:02:24,036
So the greatest common factor here is going to be 2 times 2 times "x" times "x" times "x"

28
00:02:24,036 --> 00:02:31,503
times "y", or 4x^3, 4x^3 y.

29
00:02:31,503 --> 00:02:33,643
So this is what we want to factor out.

30
00:02:33,643 --> 00:02:37,643
So that means that we can write this as
