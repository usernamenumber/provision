1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,950
   

2
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,510
Let's say I have a bucket of
aqueous solution, and it

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,440
contains some weak acid in it.

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,550
And so weak acid.

5
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,080
We've done this multiple
times.

6
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,620
It's in equilibrium with
its dissociated state.

7
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,585
So it would be in equilibrium.

8
00:00:13,585 --> 00:00:15,980
Let me write the aqueous.

9
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,540
So it's a weak acid, where the
A could be any other kind of

10
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,000
molecular group.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,480
That could be the conjugate
base of the weak acid.

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:33,810
So that's in equilibrium with
some hydrogen ions, so it'll

13
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,670
produce some of them, but
some of this is going to

14
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,190
be around as well.

15
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,900
Plus its conjugate base.

16
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,150
A minus.

17
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,740
Aqueous.

18
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,680
And just like we did with the
strong acid titration, let's

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,900
measure it's pH.

20
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,226
So I'll do that right here.

21
00:00:50,226 --> 00:00:52,930
   

22
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,430
Actually, I want to do
it a little higher.

23
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,340
So let's do it right there.

24
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,670
Let me make a little
scale here.

25
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,520
So this is 0.

26
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,920
Let's say that right
there is 7.

27
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,210
That this right here is 14.

28
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,620
So our first measurement of the
pH of our solution-- we

29
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,920
have a maybe a liter of it.

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,370
Let's say we have 1 liter
of our solution.

31
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,680
We don't know the concentration
of this thing.

32
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,000
But let's say our first
measurement, we go and we say

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,470
OK, it's got a pH of--
I don't know.

34
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:23,650
Something here.

35
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,470
Let's say it's got a pH of 3.

36
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,680
So it's acidic, not ultra
acidic, but it's acidic.

37
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,590
So it's got a pH of
3 right there.

38
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,180
This whole scale on the
left-hand side.

39
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,000
This is all pH, just like
in the last video.

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,695
This is pH.

41
00:01:36,695 --> 00:01:39,390
The pH is going up as
you go up the scale.

42
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,740
That's our first measurement.

43
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,790
Now we're going to titrate this
weak acid, just like we

44
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,110
titrated the strong base.

45
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,870
And normally when you do this--
I mean, you can, in

46
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,320
theory, titrate with anything.

47
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,580
But you normally titrate-- if
you're titrating an acid,

48
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,040
whether it's weak or strong--
you always titrate with a

49
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,530
strong base.

50
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,260
And if you are titrating a
base, whether it's weaker

51
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,980
strong, the reagent, or the
thing that you're going to

52
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,640
add, is going to be
a strong acid.

53
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,460
So in this case, even though
we're going to drop some drops

54
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,480
into a weak acid, we're
going to drop

55
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,720
drops of a strong base.

56
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,250
So let's use sodium
hydroxide again.

57
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,520
NaOH.

58
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,420
And just to make things
interesting, to make the math

59
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,052
a little interesting, let's say
it's a 0.5 molar solution.

60
00:02:29,052 --> 00:02:32,620
And we're going to add it
in increments of little

61
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,460
100-milliliter increments.

62
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,050
A tenth of a liter.

63
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,600
But the interesting thing is
really the shape of the curve

64
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,800
that forms, or the titration
curve, or the pH curve.

65
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,140
Let me write what the
reaction of NaOH.

66
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,340
Just so you have that
in your head.

67
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,010
NaOH, sodium hydroxide,
and I did this in

68
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:53,700
the previous video.

69
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,900
It disassociates completely
in water.

70
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,520
And so it turns into Na plus--
all this is aqueous, of

71
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,410
course-- plus OH minus.

72
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:05,870
So when you throw even
a little bit.

73
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:11,175
Let's say you throw in-- this
is 0.5 molar solution-- 100

74
00:03:11,175 --> 00:03:12,425
milliliters.

75
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:16,050
   

76
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:20,180
That's equal to one
tenth of a liter.

77
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,850
This 0.5 molar, that's
its molarity.

78
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,680
So it says hey, I'm going
to have half a

79
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,580
mole of this stuff.

80
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,120
Or really, of this stuff.

81
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,100
I'm going to have half
a mole of hydroxide

82
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,060
ions for every liter.

83
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,690
So in one tenth of a liter,
that means that I'm

84
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,330
going to have what?

85
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,980
I'm going to have
half of that.

86
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:46,480
So I'm going have 1/20,
or 0.05 moles.

87
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,030
So let's say this point right
here's is 100 milliliters.

88
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,510
I've added 100 milliliters
of our solution.

89
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,770
That's going to have
0.5 moles of OH.

90
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,950
Because remember, we could say
it's 0.5 moles of this, but

91
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,870
whenever this is in solution,
it disassociates

92
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,720
completely into this.

93
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,010
So if you have 0.5 moles of
this, you really have 0.5

94
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,220
moles of this.

95
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,860
This will be in this form
completely, because it's a

96
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,280
strong base.

97
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,280
So if I have 0.5 moles of this
and I throw it into the

98
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,040
solution, what's
it going to do?

99
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,769
It's going to start sopping up
some of our hydrogen ions.

100
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:24,690
So it's going to increase the
pH, and it's going to keep

101
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,440
increasing.

102
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,910
Right?

103
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,310
And this is a buffer.

104
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,470
And this is a key thing
to remember.

105
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,730
This is going to sop some
of this thing up.

106
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,690
But this is a buffer.

107
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,740
This is a weak acid.

108
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,730
So it's in equilibrium.

109
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,930
So it has this reserve over
here of the acid form.

110
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:46,830
So when you start lowering this
by adding a strong base

111
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,640
to it, to sop this up, what's
going to happen?

112
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,320
The reaction is going to move
in this direction to kind of

113
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,520
backfill, to fill or
to almost replace.

114
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,170
It won't get quite to where it
was before, but it's going to

115
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,560
dampen the stress on
the equilibrium.

116
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,170
So what's going to happen is the
concentration of your weak

117
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,440
acid is going to go down.

118
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,770
It's going to try to backfill
this stuff.

119
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,980
But every time the reaction goes
in this direction, this

120
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,630
is going to go up.

121
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:16,900
Right?

122
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,140
Remember, nothing is sopping
up the conjugate

123
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,240
base up here, right?

124
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,410
We're just sopping up
the hydrogen ions.

125
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,840
As we sop up more and more
hydrogen ions, this reaction

126
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,560
goes more and more in the
rightward direction.

127
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,380
But as it goes more and more
in the rightward direction,

128
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,550
we're just adding more
and more to this.

129
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,770
And the base just takes more
and more of this out.

130
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,940
So essentially when the base
is taking this out, it's

131
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,160
really taking this out-- or it's
taking half of this out.

132
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,330
It's taking the H part
of this out.

133
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,200
Because that converts to that,
and it gets sopped up by the

134
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,430
by the reagent.

135
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,000
The strong base.

136
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,450
And all of this ends
up on this side, as

137
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,210
the conjugate base.

138
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:02,640
So at some point, when we have
added the exact same amount of

139
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,370
OH as there is of this stuff, as
there is of this stuff plus

140
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,230
the hydrogen.

141
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,900
When we've sopped up all
of the hydrogen,

142
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,590
what's going to happen?

143
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:18,720
Well, right when you get above
that point, when you start

144
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,650
adding even more, you're going
to start getting very basic.

145
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,750
It's just going to skyrocket
up the pH.

146
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,880
Because then you're adding OHs,
and they're not being

147
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,250
canceled out by any hydrogen
over there.

148
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,460
And there's nothing to kind
of backfill the hydrogen.

149
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,140
So you're going to get to
a very high reaction.

150
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:38,610
   

151
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:44,560
When we add enough of the sodium
hydroxide that this

152
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,970
completely neutralizes this
and this, and all we

153
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,070
have left is that.

154
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:54,055
Well, you might say, oh, we have
a pH of 7 because all of

155
00:06:54,055 --> 00:06:54,905
the acid is neutralized.

156
00:06:54,905 --> 00:06:57,560
But we don't have a pH of 7 like
we did with the strong

157
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,990
base, because here, as we
sopped up stuff, we kept

158
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:06,180
adding conjugate
base over here.

159
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,830
Remember, and it's
a real base.

160
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,180
It actually has basic
properties.

161
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:13,690
If this is a strong acid, if
this was hydrogen chloride,

162
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,070
I'd still have the chloride
over here.

163
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,900
But chloride, even though it's
the conjugate base, it has no

164
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,820
basic properties.

165
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,290
It does not increase the
pH of a solution.

166
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:25,360
But this stuff right here does
increase the pH of a solution.

167
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,460
And we've done that in
previous videos.

168
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,750
So once all of this is sopped
up, your equivalence point, or

169
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,900
the point at which the number
of moles of this is equal to

170
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,190
the number of moles of this,
is going to have a high pH.

171
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:42,050
So it's going to be like
right over there.

172
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,380
And then as you add more and
more of your reagent, or your

173
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,420
strong base, your pH is going
to get higher and higher and

174
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,440
approach 14 or even
go above it.

175
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,060
So your titration curve
is going look

176
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,310
something like this.

177
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,410
   

178
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,690
And once again, you look
at the steepest

179
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,940
point on the curve.

180
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,626
It's right there.

181
00:08:01,626 --> 00:08:03,480
And you say, OK, that's
the equivalence point.

182
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,580
That's the point at which
I had an equal amount of

183
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,920
hydroxide having sopped up all
of the hydrogen, and I've run

184
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,800
out of all of this stuff to
backfill the hydrogen.

185
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,210
So you look at your
equivalence point.

186
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,910
And you say, OK, if that
equivalence point was when I

187
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,170
added, I don't know.

188
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:23,500
Maybe that's when you added
2 liters of your reagent.

189
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,900
So you added 2 liters
of your reagent.

190
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,800
Your basic reagent,
right here.

191
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,360
Or your titrant.

192
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,490
Or titrator.

193
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,270
I think that's another
word for it.

194
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,720
How many moles have you added?

195
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,600
Well it's 2 liters, it's 0.5
molar, so you've added 1 mole.

196
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,530
So here you've added
1 mole of OH.

197
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:48,830
   

198
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,250
And when you added 1 mole of OH,
you sopped up all of the

199
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,060
whatever mole you had of this.

200
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,980
So you clearly had
1 mole of that.

201
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:02,660
So over here, your original
concentration of your-- I

202
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,850
mean, you really could say your
concentration of your HA

203
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:10,550
plus your initial equilibrium
hydrogen is equal to 1 molar.

204
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:15,580
Now in most chemistry classes,
this number is way bigger than

205
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,610
this number for most
weak acids.

206
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,460
And you could look at that.

207
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,230
Because if you look at some of
the pKa's for some weak acids,

208
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,590
you'll see that this is some--
well, I won't go into the

209
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,900
math, but this number's
a lot lower.

210
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,010
So this is an indication,
essentially, of your initial

211
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,960
concentration of
your weak acid.

212
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,590
So you essentially just keep
titrating it, figure out the

213
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,070
inflection point, you say, the
inflection point happened when

214
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:40,330
I added 2 liters of the
titrator to it, which

215
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,170
corresponded to 1 mole.

216
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,000
So therefore I must have had 1
mole of my original acid in

217
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,060
the equation.

218
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,060
Another interesting thing.

219
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,800
So if you said OK, I had 1 mole
of my original acid in

220
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,430
the equation.

221
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:58,250
So you say, this was 1 molar
originally, before I started

222
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,520
titrating it all.

223
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,695
And if I said that this is a 1
liter solution-- this is 1

224
00:10:03,695 --> 00:10:04,990
mole, not 1 molar.

225
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,410
But if I know it's a 1-liter
solution, now I know that

226
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,060
originally I had 1 mole
in 1 liter, so I had

227
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,550
a molarity of 1.

228
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:18,020
Now, let me go over something
else that's interesting about

229
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,350
a basic reaction.

230
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,810
Actually, let me do that in
the next video, because I

231
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,960
think this one's getting
a little long.
