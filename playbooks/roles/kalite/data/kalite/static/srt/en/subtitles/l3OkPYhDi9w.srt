1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,430
   

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:04,780
This brain teaser in this video
is once again not one

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:05,620
that I made up.

4
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,370
I actually don't remember the
first time that I heard it.

5
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,330
I think it was in the
back of a magazine.

6
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,280
I want to say Scientific
American.

7
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,110
And me and a bunch of
buddies, we were

8
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,380
traveling through Europe.

9
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,740
And it kind of became our
pastime to do these brain

10
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,150
teasers in the back
of magazines.

11
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,480
And just so you know, I think a
lot of you think that these

12
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,635
type of brain teasers, you can
just read them and solve them.

13
00:00:23,635 --> 00:00:25,650
And if you can't solve them,
then you're not good at this

14
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,560
type of thing.

15
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,920
This brain teaser I'm about to
give you, I just kind of sat

16
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,510
and thought about it, and me
and my buddies, we argued

17
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,330
about it for literally
about a day.

18
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,910
And then I just slept on it.

19
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,060
And then first thing in the
morning, I woke up all my

20
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,340
friends, I was like,
I figured it out!

21
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,250
So this isn't some kind
of easy thing.

22
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,650
And I encourage you, just
listen to the statement,

23
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,310
understand it, and then
pause the video.

24
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,290
And then think about
it for 24 hours.

25
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,670
And then come back to it.

26
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,740
One, you'll probably
solve it yourself.

27
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,970
And if you don't, in 24 or 48
hours, then you'll probably

28
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,570
find the solution that
much more satisfying.

29
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,735
So this is the problem
of the togglers.

30
00:00:59,735 --> 00:01:02,760
   

31
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,170
Not toddlers.

32
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,750
Togglers.

33
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,780
I have an infant, so words like
toddler are in my brain.

34
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,160
But this is the problem
of the togglers.

35
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,750
So there are five guys
in front of you.

36
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,280
That's one of them.

37
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,440
Two.

38
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,360
Three.

39
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,380
Four.

40
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:20,690
Five.

41
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,420
They don't have to be guys.

42
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,720
They can be of any gender.

43
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,050
And four of them are what
we call togglers.

44
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:30,900
So four of them.

45
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,150
Four togglers.

46
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,170
   

47
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,480
And what a toggler does is, the
first time you ask them a

48
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,500
question, they're either going
to tell the truth or they're

49
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,240
going to lie.

50
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,000
So truth or a lie.

51
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,660
But then the second time
that you ask them,

52
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,480
they're going to toggle.

53
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,180
They're going to switch.

54
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,630
So the second time you ask them
a question, if they told

55
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,090
the truth the first time, then
the next time you ask that

56
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,900
same person a question,
they're going

57
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,690
to switch to lying.

58
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,580
But if they lied the first
time you asked them a

59
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,870
question, then they're
going to switch

60
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,790
to telling the truth.

61
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,350
And then it goes on, and
so on, and so forth.

62
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,289
So if you ask the same person
the third question, if they

63
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:10,460
told the truth the first time,
then they'll lie the second

64
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,450
time you ask them a question,
and then the third time

65
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,080
they'll tell the truth again.

66
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,790
It's like, if I was a toggler
and you said, hey you,

67
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,170
what is your name?

68
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,160
And if I said, oh
my name is Bill.

69
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,460
Then clearly I'm lying
that first time.

70
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,760
And then you pointed to
me again, and you say,

71
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,280
what is your name?

72
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,660
And I say, oh my name is Sal.

73
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,350
And if you ask me again,
what is your name?

74
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,040
I would say, oh, my
name is Susan.

75
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,390
And if you ask me again,
my name is Sal.

76
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,510
So the first time, I just
decided to lie.

77
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:45,760
But just as easily, I could've
decided to tell the truth the

78
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,110
first time.

79
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,670
You might have said, hey
you, what's your name?

80
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,470
I would have said, Sal.

81
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,220
And then you ask me, what's
your name again?

82
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,170
And I would have
said Elizabeth.

83
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,410
And then you ask me, what's
my name again?

84
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,820
I would say, oh,
my name is Sal.

85
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,420
And then again, what's
your name?

86
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,220
And I would say, you know,
George Washington

87
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,190
or something arbitrary.

88
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,570
But I think you get the idea.

89
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,590
A toggler-- I don't know
who's a toggler.

90
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,380
Let's say that this
is a toggler.

91
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,090
The first time you ask them a
question, they might lie, they

92
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,550
might tell the truth.

93
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,290
But if they lie, the next time
you ask the same person a

94
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,910
question, they're going
to tell the truth.

95
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,550
But the first time you ask them
a question, and they did

96
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,200
tell the truth, the next time
you ask the same person a

97
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,850
question, he or she
is going to lie.

98
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:30,690
So that's a toggler.

99
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,120
So you can already imagine,
this is-- I don't know.

100
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,050
The first time that I read the
problem it kind of made my

101
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:35,580
brain hurt.

102
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,780
This notion of a toggler.

103
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,410
It's much easier when there's
a reality where people only

104
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,690
lie or only tell the truth.

105
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,700
It's much harder when
they toggle.

106
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,990
And not only do they toggle,
but their initial state,

107
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:47,760
whether they start telling the
truth or they start off lying.

108
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,520
You don't know.

109
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,420
That's arbitrary.

110
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,500
There's no way of predicting
whether this person-- First of

111
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,440
all, we don't know if this
person is a toggler, because I

112
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,080
said there's only
four togglers.

113
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,730
But even if they are toggler, I
don't even know if the first

114
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,280
time I ask them a question
whether they're going to tell

115
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,190
the truth or whether they're
going to lie.

116
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,860
So four of them are togglers.

117
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,790
What's the fifth?

118
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,940
Well, you probably could guess
because this is how these

119
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,270
brain teasers go.

120
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,450
The fifth is a truth teller.

121
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,450
And he is much simpler.

122
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,120
Or he or she.

123
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,680
I don't want to give any clues
on who it might be.

124
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,110
Is a truth teller.

125
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:20,379
And a truth teller always
tells the truth.

126
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:25,340
   

127
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:31,790
So the goal of this brain teaser
is to figure out who is

128
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,200
the truth teller.

129
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,870
So you want to know which of
these five people is-- So

130
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,230
let's say, goal.

131
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:42,790
Who's truth teller?

132
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,760
And as you can imagine, you
don't have infinite questions

133
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,870
to do this with.

134
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,160
You have exactly two questions
to do this with.

135
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,410
And you have two questions.

136
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,860
   

137
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,450
And those two questions, they
can be one question to this

138
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,890
guy and another question
to this guy.

139
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,380
Both questions could
be to this guy.

140
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,210
Both questions could be to
her right over there.

141
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,380
So the questions don't have
to be to the same person,

142
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,730
although they can be
to the same person.

143
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,880
Or they could be to two
different people.

144
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,330
So you have two questions.

145
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:17,480
Any question to ask of any
combination of either two

146
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,100
questions to one person or two
questions to two people.

147
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,670
And by the end of those two
questions, you should know for

148
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:29,570
sure who is the truth teller.

149
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:33,690
And that is the brain
teaser statement.

150
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,320
So pause it now if you don't
want any hints or the

151
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,660
solution, or anything else.

152
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,190
So I encourage you to pause it
and think about it for at

153
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,180
least a day.

154
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,230
And sleep on it.

155
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:46,300
Because a lot of the real math
problems or logic problems

156
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,560
that are worth solving aren't
the ones that you can solve

157
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,520
right when you see them.

158
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,120
They're the ones where you kind
of sit and let your brain

159
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,860
do a little background
processing while you sleep.

160
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,840
So that said, hopefully you've
stopped it and now you've

161
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,220
resumed it after really
struggling with this for a

162
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:01,800
long period.

163
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,260
Not eating and sleeping and
all the things that

164
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,550
normal people do.

165
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,930
And now you're ready
for the solution.

166
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,500
Or even better, you're ready
to confirm your solution.

167
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,070
So first I'll give you a hint.

168
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,720
I mean, it's a tough question.

169
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,890
I struggled with this at first.
I was like, when you

170
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,710
ask someone a question
how do you know if

171
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,380
they're lying or not?

172
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,860
How do you know if they're
the truth teller?

173
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,610
How do you know if they're
a toggler?

174
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,840
You don't have any
information.

175
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,590
So the crux of this problem is,
essentially, it doesn't

176
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,410
matter who you're asking
the question to

177
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,430
the first time around.

178
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,320
And actually the solution is
that it doesn't matter who

179
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,750
you're asking the question to
the second time around.

180
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,640
You want to ask a question so
that no matter what they say,

181
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,650
you know what they're going to
do the second time around.

182
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,000
You know whether they're going
to tell the truth the second

183
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,270
time around, or you know whether
they're going to lie

184
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,000
the second time around.

185
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,980
And that's a hint.

186
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,490
And if you just want a hint
and then to keep thinking

187
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,730
about it, pause it again.

188
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,240
Because I'm about to give
you the solution.

189
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,560
So question one.

190
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,180
   

191
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,890
And you can pick any of the
five people to ask this

192
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:06,280
question to.

193
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,900
And that's kind of the nature
of one of these solutions.

194
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,530
There's no reason for you
to pick one of the

195
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,490
five over the other.

196
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,870
They're all equally likely
to be the truth teller.

197
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,760
So you ask them, are you
the truth teller?

198
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:23,690
   

199
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:27,090
So let's think about a couple
of-- Well first of all,

200
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,960
they're either going to answer
to this, yes or no.

201
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,775
So there could be
two situations.

202
00:07:32,775 --> 00:07:35,350
They're either going to
say yes, or they're

203
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:38,160
going to say no.

204
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,240
So if someone says yes to are
they the truth teller, it

205
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,750
means that either they
are the truth

206
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,000
teller telling the truth.

207
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,510
   

208
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:56,250
Or they are a lying toggler.

209
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:00,710
   

210
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,110
If they say that they are not
the truth teller, they clearly

211
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,330
cannot be the truth teller,
because the truth teller

212
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:09,610
cannot lie about not being
the truth teller.

213
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,790
And so they have to
be a toggler.

214
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,340
And they'd be an
honest toggler.

215
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,260
They'd be a toggler who's
telling the truth.

216
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:16,630
Right?

217
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:23,870
So it would be a truthful
toggler.

218
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,180
Remember, I ask anybody, any
of these five people right

219
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,710
here, say, are you
the truth teller?

220
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,289
If they say yes, I immediately
know that they're either the

221
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:35,309
truth teller telling
the truth, or

222
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:37,070
they're a lying toggler.

223
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:41,260
If they say no, I know that they
are a truthful toggler.

224
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,210
Now, what's interesting is, in
this scenario, if they say

225
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:48,260
yes, what do I know that they're
going to do next?

226
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:52,260
So if this is the truth teller,
and they told the

227
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,970
truth, on the second question,
they're going to tell the

228
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,550
truth again.

229
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:04,330
They're going to tell the truth
on question number two.

230
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,740
If they're the lying toggler,
what are they going to do when

231
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,110
you ask them another question?

232
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:08,910
Well, they toggle.

233
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,890
If they lie the first time you
ask them, they're going to

234
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,840
tell the truth the second
time you ask them.

235
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:20,160
So they're going to tell the
truth on question number two.

236
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,800
So if the person says yes to,
are you the truth teller?

237
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,850
You immediately know that no
matter who they are, that

238
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,870
they're going to tell the truth
on question number two.

239
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,580
So if you can know for a fact
that the person's going to

240
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,630
tell the truth on question
number two, you ask them, who

241
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,190
is the truth teller?

242
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,230
So this is number two.

243
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,300
Who is the truth teller?

244
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:42,960
So it's kind of weird.

245
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,460
You go to someone and say,
are you the truth teller?

246
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,730
And they'll say yes.

247
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,930
And then you ask them again,
who's the truth teller?

248
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,400
And then, because they have to
tell the truth, they will

249
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,020
actually either say, if it was
this case, they'd say I am the

250
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:54,820
truth teller.

251
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,160
Or if it's this case, they'd say
no, that dude over there

252
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,060
is the truth teller.

253
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,060
And then you'll know who
the truth teller is.

254
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,310
Now what happens in
this situation?

255
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,160
That they're a truthful
toggler?

256
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,800
Well on the second question,
what are they going to do?

257
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,680
They're going to lie.

258
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,360
They're going to lie on the
second question, right?

259
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,910
   

260
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,310
On question number two.

261
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,600
So if you know for a fact that
someone's going to lie, how

262
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,120
can you phrase a question so
you can figure out who the

263
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,390
truth teller is?

264
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,530
Well, if they say no to this
first question, and you know

265
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,430
they're going to lie on the
second one, your second

266
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:31,820
question should just be, who
is not the truth teller?

267
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,570
   

268
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:41,590
So the only way to lie on this
question-- and this person has

269
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:45,780
to lie now-- is to tell you
who the truth teller is.

270
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,750
And so, using the first
question, are

271
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,490
you the truth teller?

272
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,720
We can immediately predict what
the person's going to do

273
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,480
on the second question.

274
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,310
And then we can phrase the
second question, depending on

275
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:00,290
that response, to definitely
know who the truth teller is.

276
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,520
Anyway, I thought you'd
enjoy that.

277
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:07,550
And hopefully you see why the
liar game show brain teaser

278
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,750
was a bit of a warm
up for this one.

279
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,680
See you in the next video.

280
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:11,724
