1
00:00:08,785 --> 00:00:10,746
Your observable traits

2
00:00:10,762 --> 00:00:13,537
also known as your phenotypes

3
00:00:13,537 --> 00:00:16,604
result from the interaction between your

4
00:00:16,604 --> 00:00:20,554
genes and the environment.

5
00:00:23,692 --> 00:00:28,242
This interaction begins in the womb

6
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:35,933
and continues throughout your life.

7
00:00:38,764 --> 00:00:42,680
Differences in some phenotypes, like height,

8
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,334
are determined mostly by genes.

9
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:49,669
If you had short parents and grandparents

10
00:00:49,669 --> 00:00:53,101
you probably don't tower over your peers.

11
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:56,626
Though environmental factors, like nutrition,

12
00:00:56,626 --> 00:01:00,584
can have some effect on your height.

13
00:01:01,846 --> 00:01:06,794
Genes also play a role in whether you have a healthy body weight.

14
00:01:07,794 --> 00:01:13,156
But diet and exercise can profoundly affect how much you weigh.

15
00:01:16,455 --> 00:01:22,192
How genes influence your personality is less understood.

16
00:01:23,669 --> 00:01:27,504
You can now learn about over a million SNPs

17
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:30,755
in your genome all at once.

18
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:35,254
And every day, scientists are learning more and more

19
00:01:35,254 --> 00:01:40,487
about how some of these SNPs affect your phenotype.

20
00:01:40,595 --> 00:01:43,829
Getting to know your genome can help you understand

21
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:47,651
a little better why you are the way you are

22
00:01:47,651 --> 00:01:56,212
and in what ways you are similar to, or different from, your family, friends, and neighbors.
