1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:01,840
All right.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:06,520
We're on problem number five.OK,problem number five.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:15,800
If m to the x times m to the 7th is equal to 28.

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,270
They also tell us that m to the 5th,

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,270
and then that whole thing to the y power,

6
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,410
is equal to m to the 15th.

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,830
What is the value of x plus y? x plus y equals what?

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,810
So this is really just a test of whether you know your

9
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:35,600
exponent rules.

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,640
So what is m to the x times m to the 7th?

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,660
So your temptation might have been to say 7x,but no.

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,080
Remember,when you multiply two numbers of the same base,

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,700
and the base is m,you add the exponents.

14
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,880
So it's m to the x plus 7.

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,120
And they actually wanted to tempt you to do 7x

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,360
because they actually use the number 28 here,

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,290
which is a multiple of 7,so they were tempting you to do 7x.

18
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,260
But we know that you add the exponents when you multiply m

19
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,600
to the x times m to the 7th.

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,530
And so we have m to the x times m to the 7th--oh sorry,

21
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,050
I wrote it down wrong.It equals m to the 28.

22
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,730
Sorry,well you knew that.

23
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,930
Anyway,m to the x times m to the 7th is equal to m to the x

24
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,280
plus 7,and that equals m to the 28.

25
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,300
So the exponents have to equal each other,

26
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:30,350
so x plus 7 is equal to 28.x is equal to 21.

27
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,960
Now let's go here.Here we have m to the 5th,

28
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,800
and then we're raising that to the yth power.

29
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,140
So here we actually would multiply the exponents,

30
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,870
if you remember your exponent rules.

31
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:47,320
So you have m to the 5y is equal to m to the 15th.

32
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:56,270
So 5y must equal 15.5y is equal to 15,y is equal to 3.

33
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:02,040
So what's x plus y? It's 21 plus 3,which equals 24.

34
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,650
And that is choice d.Next problem.

35
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,140
Looks like there's going to be some drawing

36
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,350
for Sal in this problem.

37
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:21,070
I'll try my best.Oh,I thought I was using--undo.Edit undo.

38
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,810
I thought I was using the line tool.OK.

39
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,910
That's my y-axis,draw a straight line.

40
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:31,740
I drew a straight line.That's my x-axis.

41
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,590
And then what do they have here?

42
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:50,060
They have 19--let's see,1985,'86,'87,'88,'89,then '90.

43
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:56,530
Let's see,1985 is,maybe,looks about 148,000.

44
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,730
So if this is 150,000,1985 is here.

45
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,780
Let me just draw it all out.

46
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:13,660
1985,then 1986 is up here at 160,000.This is 140,000.soon.

47
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,690
So 1986 is up here at 160,000.

48
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:23,890
1987 is a little bit less,1987 looks like about 150,000,

49
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:29,400
I don't know,eyeballing it at 156,000.1987 is here.

50
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:39,090
1988 looks like a little bit above 140,000.

51
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,430
1989 is between 130,000 and 120,000.

52
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,930
All the work here is drawing

53
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,490
what you hopefully already have in your book.So where was I?

54
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,740
Oh sorry,this is 1988.

55
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:00,780
1988 was a little bit better than 140,000.Ignore that one.

56
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,870
1989 looks like about 126,000.

57
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:13,560
Then 1990 is,I don't know,112,000 or something.

58
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,410
1990 is out here.

59
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,220
And then if I were to connect the dots,

60
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,260
look something like that.

61
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,750
And then let's read the question.

62
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,800
According to the graph above,

63
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,160
which of the following is closest to the decrease per year

64
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,730
in the number of homes sold between 1987 and 1990.

65
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,300
So we're talking about from 1987,

66
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,940
so it's from this year,to 1990.

67
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,350
So how much did we decrease in the first year,right?

68
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,850
The first year we decreased by this much.

69
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:52,960
And I'm going to look in the book

70
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,720
because I don't know how well I drew this graph.

71
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,960
But in 1987,it looks like we're about 156,000.

72
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,680
And then as we go to 1988,

73
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:13,780
it looks like about 142,000 just eyeballing it,right?

74
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,350
So this distance right here is what?

75
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:27,180
It'd be 156,000 minus 142,000.About minus 14,000,right?

76
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,120
That's how much we changed over this one year.

77
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,120
And if I look at the choices,there already is choice c,

78
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,030
which is 14,000,

79
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,930
but let me just do one more just to make sure.

80
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,770
So if we want to figure out from 1988 to 1989,

81
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,030
so we said 1988 is at 142,000,where is 1989?

82
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:53,650
Looks like 128,000,I would say 128,000.

83
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:03,770
And so 142,000 minus 128,000,that's also 14,000.

84
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,550
And if we do the last one,that's 128,000,

85
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,590
and then this looks something about 114,000 right here.

86
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:18,870
So this is also 14,000.So the answer is c,14,000.

87
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,680
Next problem.Problem 7.

88
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:30,640
you Here we have this diagram that shows up actually a lot

89
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,070
when you're taking the SAT.I'll show you why.

90
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,160
This is a very common thing you'll see.

91
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:45,090
A line like that.A line like that.

92
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,720
And then they connect it here.Now let's read the problem.

93
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,950
I already have suspicion what they're going to ask.

94
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:04,140
So this is a,b,c,d,and e.

95
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,500
They tell us this is perpendicular.This is perpendicular.

96
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,850
This is x.This is y.

97
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:18,210
In the figure above,ae and cd are each particular to ce.

98
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:23,430
Fair enough.If x is equal to y,the length of ab is 4,

99
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:31,620
and the length of bd is 8,what is the length of ce?

100
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,680
So we're trying to figure out--let me draw ce,

101
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,830
let's have our gold in a different color--

102
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,010
we're trying to figure out this line right there.

103
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,680
And one thing I didn't write,they told us x is equal to y,

104
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,330
so immediately that should hit a trigger.

105
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,700
x is equal to y and this is a 90-degree angle,

106
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:54,330
so we know that x plus y plus 90 is equal to 180,

107
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,620
or that x plus y is equal to 90.

108
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,880
And if they're equal to each other,x must equal y,

109
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,860
which equals 45 degrees,right?

110
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,950
So this is 45,this is 45,and if y is 45,

111
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,210
what is this angle going to be?

112
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:13,770
Well it's opposite to y,so this will also be 45 degrees.

113
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,560
And this is a right angle too,

114
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,790
so 45 plus 90 plus this angle has to equal 180,

115
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,060
so what's this angle going to be?

116
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,820
Well,that's also going to be 45 degrees.

117
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,480
This also has to be a 45-45-90 triangle.

118
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,950
If you ever see a triangle where one of the angles is 90

119
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,400
and the other is 45,the other one has to be 45

120
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,620
because they add up to 180.

121
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,920
And what we want to figure out is this length here.

122
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,560
So I'm going to show you a little trick,

123
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,550
and this trick--well,it doesn't always work,

124
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,080
it's not really a trick,

125
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,510
it's just a visualization exercise,really--

126
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:46,250
we say,we want to figure out this length.

127
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,360
Well that length,I'm going to say--

128
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,170
I'm going to make the claim,

129
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,370
and I think you'll believe this claim is the same

130
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,850
is this length,I'm essentially creating a rectangle--

131
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,670
is the same as that length,right?

132
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,770
So if we figure out this length,we solve the problem,

133
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,490
this light brown length.

134
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,340
And we also know--let me draw the bottom--

135
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,480
do we know the length?

136
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,530
Actually,we don't even have to know this bottom line.

137
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,060
We don't know the length of that bottom line.

138
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,680
We need to figure out this length.

139
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,720
We know since this line is parallel to this line.

140
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,680
We know this is a 90-degree angle.

141
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,180
Well,do we know the hypotenuse? Sure.

142
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,160
The hypotenuse is 4 plus 8,it's this big red line.

143
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,240
And let me draw the hypotenuse in a different color.

144
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,980
The hypotenuse,right here,that's the hypotenuse.

145
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,050
Actually,I'm running out of time,so I'm going to continue

146
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,280
this in the next video.See you soon.
