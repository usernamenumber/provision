1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710
   

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,620
Let's keep doing some Laplace
transforms. For one, it's good

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,580
to see where a lot of those
Laplace transform tables

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,210
you'll see later on actually
come from, and it just makes

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,780
you comfortable with
the mathematics.

6
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,340
Which is really just kind of
your second semester calculus

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,230
mathematics, but it makes you
comfortable with the whole

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,630
notion of what we're doing.

9
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:21,110
So first of all, let me just
rewrite the definition of the

10
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:21,865
Laplace transform.

11
00:00:21,865 --> 00:00:24,990
So it's the L from Laverne
& Shirley.

12
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,780
So the Laplace transform of some
function of t is equal to

13
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:36,700
the improper integral from 0 to
infinity of e to the minus

14
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,120
st times our function.

15
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,180
Times our function of t, and
that's with respect to dt.

16
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,030
So let's do another
Laplace transform.

17
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:52,830
Let's say that we want to take
the Laplace transform-- and

18
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:58,765
now our function f of t, let's
say it is e to the at.

19
00:00:58,765 --> 00:01:01,640
   

20
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,850
Laplace transform
of e to the at.

21
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,160
Well we just substituted it into
this definition of the

22
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,410
Laplace transform.

23
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,825
   

24
00:01:09,825 --> 00:01:13,040
And this is all going to be
really good integration

25
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,760
practice for us.

26
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,180
Especially integration
by parts.

27
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,910
Almost every Laplace transform
problem turns into an

28
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,370
integration by parts problem.

29
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,740
Which, as we learned long ago,
integration by parts is just

30
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,070
the reverse product rule.

31
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:26,840
So anyway.

32
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,380
This is equal to the integral
from 0 to infinity.

33
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:39,300
e to the minus st times
e to the at, right?

34
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,150
That's our f of t.

35
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,600
dt.

36
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,500
Well this is equal to just
adding the exponents because

37
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,670
we have the same base.

38
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,160
The integral from 0
to infinity of e

39
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:59,630
to the a minus stdt.

40
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:04,350
   

41
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,780
And what's the antiderivative
of this?

42
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:12,400
Well that's equal to what?

43
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,160
With respect to C.

44
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:20,150
So it's equal to-- a minus s,
that's just going to be a

45
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,920
constant, right?

46
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,710
So we can just leave it
out on the outside.

47
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:35,720
1/a minus s times e to the a
minus st. And we're going to

48
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,760
evaluate that from t is equal to
infinity or the limit as t

49
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,940
approaches infinity to
t is equal to 0.

50
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,270
And I could have put this inside
the brackets, but it's

51
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,190
just a constant term, right?

52
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,820
None of them have t's in them,
so I can just pull them out.

53
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:58,260
And so this is equal to 1/a
minus s times-- now we

54
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,340
essentially have to evaluate
t at infinity.

55
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,190
So what is the limit
at infinity?

56
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,400
Well we have two cases
here, right?

57
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:12,510
If this exponent-- if this a
minus s is a positive number,

58
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:17,700
if a minus s is greater than
0, what's going to happen?

59
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,910
Well as we approach infinity,
e to the infinity just gets

60
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,260
bigger and bigger and
bigger, right?

61
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,250
Because it's e to an infinitely
positive exponent.

62
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,540
So we don't get an answer.

63
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,050
And when you do improper
integrals, when you take the

64
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,590
limit to infinity and it doesn't
come to a finite

65
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,850
number, the limit doesn't
approach anything, that means

66
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:42,750
that k the improper
integral diverges.

67
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,025
And so there is no limit.

68
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:46,580
   

69
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:50,250
And to some degree, we can say
that the Laplace transform is

70
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,480
not defined with a minus s is
greater than 0 or when a is

71
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,040
greater than s.

72
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,665
Now what happens if a minus
s is less than 0?

73
00:04:00,665 --> 00:04:05,220
   

74
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,270
Well then this is going
to be some negative

75
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,620
number here, right?

76
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,740
And then if we take e to an
infinitely negative number,

77
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,450
well then that does approach
something.

78
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,690
That approaches 0.

79
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,860
And we saw that in the
previous video.

80
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,820
And I hope you understand
what I'm saying, right?

81
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,830
e to an infinity negative number
approaches 0, while e

82
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,670
to an infinitely positive
number is just infinity.

83
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,980
So that doesn't really
converge on anything.

84
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,420
So anyway.

85
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:36,250
If I assumed that a minus s is
less than 0, or a is less than

86
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:43,990
s, and this is the assumption I
will make, just so that this

87
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,140
improper integral actually
converges to something.

88
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,410
So if a minus s is less than
0, and this is a negative

89
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:53,470
number, e to the a minus s
times-- well t, where t

90
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,700
approaches infinity will be 0.

91
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,230
Minus this integral
evaluated at 0.

92
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,220
So when you value this
at 0, what happens?

93
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,140
T equals 0.

94
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,520
This whole thing becomes
e to the 0 is 1.

95
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,400
   

96
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,980
And we are left with what?

97
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,875
Minus 1/a minus s.

98
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:19,710
And that's just the same
thing as 1/s s minus a.

99
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:26,540
So we have our next entry in our
Laplace transform table.

100
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,670
And that is the Laplace
transform.

101
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:41,800
The Laplace transform of e to
the at is equal to 1/s s minus

102
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,650
a, as long as we make the
assumption that s is

103
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,790
greater than a.

104
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:53,930
This is true when s is greater
than a, or a is less than s.

105
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:54,710
You could view it either way.

106
00:05:54,710 --> 00:06:00,350
So that's our second entry in
our Laplace transform table.

107
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,310
Fascinating.

108
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,460
And actually, let's relate this
to our previous entry in

109
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,970
our Laplace transform
table, right?

110
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,350
What was our first entry in our
Laplace transform table?

111
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:15,810
It was Laplace transform of
1 is equal to 1/s, right?

112
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:19,730
Well isn't 1 just the same
thing as e to the 0?

113
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,930
So we could have said that this
is the Laplace-- I know

114
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,280
I'm running out of space, but
I'll do it here in purple.

115
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,780
We could have said Laplace
transform of 1 is the same

116
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:31,790
thing as e to the 0
times t, right?

117
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,170
And that equals 1/s.

118
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:37,075
And luckily it's good to see
that that is consistent.

119
00:06:37,075 --> 00:06:39,950
And actually, remember, we even
made the condition when s

120
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,350
is greater than 0, right?

121
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,565
We assumed that s is greater
than 0 this example.

122
00:06:43,565 --> 00:06:46,490
   

123
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,820
Here again, you say s
is greater than 0.

124
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,920
This is completely consistent
with this one, right?

125
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,600
Because if a is equal to 0, then
the Laplace transform of

126
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,360
e to the 0 is just
1/s minus 0.

127
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,690
That's just 1/s.

128
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,950
And we have to assume that
s is greater than zero.

129
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:05,895
So really these are kind of the
same entry in our Laplace

130
00:07:05,895 --> 00:07:06,980
transform table.

131
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,840
But it's always nice in
mathematics when we see that

132
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,740
two results we got in trying
to do slightly different

133
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,730
problems actually are,
in some ways,

134
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,660
connected or the same result.

135
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,320
Anyway I'll see you in the
next video and we'll keep

136
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,570
trying to build our table of
Laplace transforms. And maybe

137
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,130
three or four videos from now
I'll actually show you how

138
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:31,180
these transforms are extremely
useful in solving all sorts of

139
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,080
differential equations.

140
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,710
See you soon.

141
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:33,900
