99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
A cylindrical log has a diameter of 12 inches.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
A wedge is cut from the log by making two planar cuts that go entirely through the log.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The first is perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder,

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the plane of the second cut forms a 45 degree angle with the plane of the first cut.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The intersection of these two planes has exactly one point in common with the log.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The number of cubic inches in the wedge can be expressed as n pie, where n is a positive integer.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Find n.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So lets think about it, so lets just draw what they're describing

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we have a cylindrical log that has a diameter of 12 inches so lets draw that

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we have a, let me draw it like this, so that is cross-section of the log

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and it has a diameter of 12 inches

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this is 12.. 12 inches and it is a cylinder so it looks like this

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and here is our log, that is the log in question

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a wedge is cut from the log by making two plainer cuts that go entirely through the log

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the first cut is perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder'

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so it would go.. it really just cut it.. it would just cut it straight
