What I want to do in this video is talk about the difference

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
between vectors, vectors and scalars.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And they might sound like very complicated ideas

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but we'll see over the course of the videos

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but they're actually very simple ideas.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So first, I'll give you a little bit of a definition

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then I'll give you a bunch of examples

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I think the examples will make things super clear.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Hopefully they'll make things super clear.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
A vector is something that has magnitude

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a magnitude, or you can kind of view that as a size

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and it has a direction. So, and it has a direction.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And it has a direction.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
A scalar only has a magnitude or size.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And if that doesn't make sense to you,

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it will hopefully make sense to you in a second when I show you an example.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
For example: Let's say that I have a...

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's say that's the ground right there

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me do the ground in a more appropriate ground-like color.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So,this is green right over here...

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And lets say that I pick and I have a brick here,

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I have a brick here on the ground.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And I pick up that brick, and I move it,

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I move it over to this place right over here.

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So I move the brick right over there,

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I take a ruler out and I say, "Wow! I moved the brick,
