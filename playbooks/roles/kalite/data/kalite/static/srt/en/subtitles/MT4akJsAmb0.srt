1
00:00:00,406 --> 00:00:01,937
We've already spent a lot of time

2
00:00:01,937 --> 00:00:04,351
thinking about these six different scenarios,

3
00:00:04,351 --> 00:00:08,720
all of which sit on the production possibilities frontier,

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,259
which means that in any of these scenarios

5
00:00:11,259 --> 00:00:14,181
we have achieved productive efficiency.

6
00:00:14,353 --> 00:00:16,115
And it's true not just of these scenarios,

7
00:00:16,115 --> 00:00:18,544
it's true of any of the points on this curve.

8
00:00:18,544 --> 00:00:19,831
So you have achieved,

9
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:23,633
[for] any point on that curve, productive...

10
00:00:23,633 --> 00:00:25,335
-Let me give ourselves some real-state on the right-

11
00:00:25,335 --> 00:00:34,948
productive efficiency,

12
00:00:34,948 --> 00:00:36,684
which means.....

13
00:00:36,684 --> 00:00:39,543
Another way to think about it, is that

14
00:00:39,543 --> 00:00:41,431
as soon as you're at any point on that curve,

15
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:43,489
if you want any more of one of these things,

16
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:45,169
you have to give up some of the other.

17
00:00:45,169 --> 00:00:46,989
So for example, if you're at point C,

18
00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:48,812
and you if want more rabbits,

19
00:00:48,812 --> 00:00:50,025
If you want one more rabbit,

20
00:00:50,025 --> 00:00:53,463
you're going to have to give up some berries.

21
00:00:53,463 --> 00:00:54,876
Or, if you're at point C,

22
00:00:54,876 --> 00:00:57,469
and you want more berries,

23
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:00,330
you're going to have to give up some rabbits.

24
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:04,172
That's true of any point on the production possibilities frontier.

25
00:01:04,172 --> 00:01:05,571
A point over here

26
00:01:05,571 --> 00:01:07,392
-let me do this in a different color-

27
00:01:07,392 --> 00:01:09,779
So let's say that [for] this point right over here,

28
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:12,167
you have not achieved productive efficiency here,

29
00:01:12,167 --> 00:01:16,196
because you can get more rabbits

30
00:01:16,196 --> 00:01:18,401
without having to give up any berries.

31
00:01:18,401 --> 00:01:20,266
And you could get to scenario B.

32
00:01:20,266 --> 00:01:24,203
Or, you could get more berries,

33
00:01:24,203 --> 00:01:25,953
and not have to give up any rabbits.

34
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:27,313
And you would get to scenario D.

35
00:01:27,313 --> 00:01:32,306
So this right over here is inefficient.

36
00:01:32,306 --> 00:01:35,041
Now, all of these are all good.

37
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:37,375
[In] all of these six scenarios

38
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:38,514
we have achieved productive efficiency.

39
00:01:38,514 --> 00:01:40,158
But which of these do we pick?

40
00:01:40,158 --> 00:01:43,395
How do we decide [how] to allocate our time?

41
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:45,490
So what I want to talk about in this video is

42
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:52,595
"allocative efficiency".

43
00:01:52,595 --> 00:01:54,641
And it's somewhat subjective,

44
00:01:54,641 --> 00:01:56,450
based on the preferences of ...

45
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,064
if we are the hunter gatherer, based on our preferences.

46
00:01:59,064 --> 00:02:01,635
But at least it gives us a framework for thinking:

47
00:02:01,635 --> 00:02:04,913
which of these meets our preferences the best?

48
00:02:04,913 --> 00:02:07,754
And to do that, I will review a little bit from the last video.

49
00:02:07,754 --> 00:02:09,831
In the last video, we talked about the marginal cost

50
00:02:09,831 --> 00:02:11,480
of each incremental rabbit.

51
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,898
We said the opportunity cost of each incremental rabbit

52
00:02:13,898 --> 00:02:16,678
and the opportunity cost of one incremental unit

53
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,113
that really is just the marginal cost.

54
00:02:19,113 --> 00:02:21,519
So let's just write these different scenarios.

55
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:23,150
So these are the [scenarios],

56
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:27,848
Let's write the scenarios, scene for short.

57
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:29,867
And then let's think about the marginal cost

58
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:33,045
of one incremental rabbit,

59
00:02:33,045 --> 00:02:34,600
-I just draw a rabbit here-

60
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,395
of one incremental rabbit.

61
00:02:36,395 --> 00:02:44,744
And it's going to be given in berries

62
00:02:44,744 --> 00:02:46,597
All right, let's start with scenario F

63
00:02:46,597 --> 00:02:48,814
and this is all review from the last video.

64
00:02:48,814 --> 00:02:50,550
Sitting in scenario F,

65
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,551
if we want to get one extra rabbit

66
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:59,100
we are going to have to give up 20 berries.

67
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,980
In senario E, if we are sitting in scenario E

68
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,061
and we want even one more rabbit,

69
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:09,464
we now have to give up 40 berries.

70
00:03:09,464 --> 00:03:16,231
So the marginal cost of that point of one more rabbit

71
00:03:16,231 --> 00:03:17,469
is forty berries.

72
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:20,792
Now let's go to scenario D

73
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:22,895
and I encourage you to pause and do this yourself.

74
00:03:22,895 --> 00:03:24,882
It'll help if you kind of work it out.

75
00:03:24,882 --> 00:03:26,197
Scenario D

76
00:03:26,197 --> 00:03:33,265
the cost of one extra rabbit is now 60 berries.

77
00:03:33,265 --> 00:03:36,075
You go to scenario C.

78
00:03:36,075 --> 00:03:42,505
The cost is now 80 berries.

79
00:03:42,505 --> 00:03:44,837
Finally we go to scenario B.

80
00:03:44,837 --> 00:03:49,119
And the cost of sitting in scenario B of getting one extra rabbit

81
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:55,084
you are going to give up 100 berries.

82
00:03:55,084 --> 00:03:57,238
And I won't even go into scenario A

83
00:03:57,238 --> 00:04:00,715
because it will be impossible for you to have any more rabbits.

84
00:04:00,715 --> 00:04:02,666
You have no more berries to give up.

85
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,416
So these are all the possible scenarios

86
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,242
and the marginal cost of them

87
00:04:06,242 --> 00:04:08,443
and we can actually plot them on a line.

88
00:04:08,443 --> 00:04:10,422
So let me do that right over here.

89
00:04:10,422 --> 00:04:12,466
This will be useful.

90
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:17,580
And so, let me draw one axis right over here.

91
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,197
One axis over here,

92
00:04:20,212 --> 00:04:23,560
and let's call these the different scenarios.

93
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,669
So let me do it in the same order.

94
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:31,467
Let's call this scenario F,

95
00:04:31,467 --> 00:04:35,661
scenario E (I'll just do this in one color right now),

96
00:04:35,661 --> 00:04:40,822
scenario D, scenario C, and scenario B.

97
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,528
Actually, instead of doing it that way,

98
00:04:42,528 --> 00:04:44,648
let me just talk about it in terms of

99
00:04:44,648 --> 00:04:50,297
the number of squirrels I have.

100
00:04:50,297 --> 00:04:54,599
In scenario F, if you remember...

101
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:56,204
oh, not squirrels, rabbits.

102
00:04:56,204 --> 00:05:02,092
In scenario F, you have zero rabbits.

103
00:05:02,092 --> 00:05:10,233
zero, one, two, three, four, and five.

104
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:12,711
So this is the number of rabbits,

105
00:05:12,711 --> 00:05:14,318
not squirrels,

106
00:05:14,318 --> 00:05:15,282
the number of rabbits

107
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:19,295
that you are able to catch on average each day.

108
00:05:19,295 --> 00:05:23,531
And in the vertical axis,

109
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:27,412
right now, I want to put the marginal cost,

110
00:05:27,412 --> 00:05:32,696
the marginal cost in berries.

111
00:05:32,696 --> 00:05:34,659
Let's see, it goes from 20 up to 100.

112
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:37,327
So let's say that this is

113
00:05:37,327 --> 00:05:44,319
twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, and one hundred.

114
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,346
So scenario F - that's when we had zero rabbits -

115
00:05:48,346 --> 00:05:53,262
and the marginal cost of trying to get another rabbit,

116
00:05:53,262 --> 00:05:54,527
you would have to give up twenty berries.

117
00:05:54,527 --> 00:05:56,828
So that is scenario F right over there.

118
00:05:56,828 --> 00:06:00,661
Scenario E - that's the one

119
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:03,794
where we already had one rabbit

120
00:06:03,794 --> 00:06:05,509
and we are thinking about the marginal cost

121
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:08,340
of getting another one. So that's scenario E.

122
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,012
It's right over there.

123
00:06:10,012 --> 00:06:13,959
This is scenario D - the marginal cost is 60 -

124
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,773
We already have 2 rabbits and

125
00:06:15,773 --> 00:06:17,221
are thinking about getting a third.

126
00:06:17,221 --> 00:06:18,843
That's scenario D.

127
00:06:18,843 --> 00:06:22,563
And then scenario C -

128
00:06:22,563 --> 00:06:23,694
we already have three rabbits

129
00:06:23,694 --> 00:06:25,285
and [we are] thinking about getting a fourth -

130
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:26,705
That's scenario C.

131
00:06:26,705 --> 00:06:30,016
And then finally, we have scenario B,

132
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:31,524
where we already have four rabbits,

133
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:34,294
and we are thinking about getting a fifth

134
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:35,642
and we would have to give up

135
00:06:35,642 --> 00:06:39,319
100 berries to get that fifth rabbit.

136
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:41,463
So that's scenario B right over there.

137
00:06:41,463 --> 00:06:44,278
So what I have just done is plotted the marginal cost

138
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:49,254
along, these are points on our "marginal cost curve",

139
00:06:49,254 --> 00:06:50,681
our marginal cost as a function

140
00:06:50,681 --> 00:06:52,944
of the number of rabbits [that] we have.

141
00:06:52,944 --> 00:06:54,562
So let me connect all the dots.

142
00:06:54,562 --> 00:06:56,745
And in this scenario, it just happened to be a line.

143
00:06:56,745 --> 00:06:58,162
It doesn't always have to be a line,

144
00:06:58,162 --> 00:07:00,841
but in many introductory economics courses,

145
00:07:00,841 --> 00:07:03,160
it's often a line for simplicity.

146
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,112
So let me make this a line right over here.

147
00:07:07,112 --> 00:07:09,815
This is our marginal cost as a function

148
00:07:09,815 --> 00:07:12,864
of the number of rabbits [that] we have.

149
00:07:12,864 --> 00:07:16,481
And actually, I should probably draw this axis.

150
00:07:16,481 --> 00:07:18,859
Let me copy and paste this.

151
00:07:18,859 --> 00:07:23,180
So let me cut that.

152
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,763
And then let me paste it,

153
00:07:24,763 --> 00:07:26,564
because it really should sit

154
00:07:26,564 --> 00:07:29,603
on the zero point right over there.

155
00:07:29,603 --> 00:07:33,497
And ignore that little line right over there.

156
00:07:33,497 --> 00:07:35,840
So there you have marginal cost as a function of berries.

157
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,896
But we still don't know which scenario to pick,

158
00:07:37,896 --> 00:07:39,448
and to think about that,

159
00:07:39,448 --> 00:07:41,464
I want to introduce something called

160
00:07:41,464 --> 00:07:47,563
the "marginal benefit",

161
00:07:47,563 --> 00:07:49,726
and I'll write it as MB.

162
00:07:49,726 --> 00:07:56,147
The marginal benefit of an incremental rabbit,

163
00:07:56,147 --> 00:07:59,181
and once again we're going to write it in berries.

164
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:01,364
The way to think about the margin benefit,

165
00:08:01,364 --> 00:08:03,647
is if we are the hunter-gatherer,

166
00:08:03,647 --> 00:08:04,467
we're saying,

167
00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:06,281
if we're sitting in one of these scenarios,

168
00:08:06,281 --> 00:08:08,314
how much would we pay to

169
00:08:08,314 --> 00:08:11,096
some hypothetical convenience store in berries.

170
00:08:11,096 --> 00:08:14,464
Maybe that convenience store only sells bunnies

171
00:08:14,464 --> 00:08:15,964
and they only accept berries.

172
00:08:15,964 --> 00:08:17,864
How much would we pay to them in berries

173
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,964
for an extra rabbit?

174
00:08:19,964 --> 00:08:22,447
And let's not even look at this thing right over here.

175
00:08:22,447 --> 00:08:26,068
So we're sitting in scenario F -

176
00:08:26,068 --> 00:08:27,831
and you remember scenario F is right over here -

177
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:29,564
We have no rabbits -

178
00:08:29,564 --> 00:08:31,283
how much would we be willing to pay?

179
00:08:31,283 --> 00:08:33,939
We have no rabbits, and we actually have a ton of berries.

180
00:08:33,939 --> 00:08:36,064
So in scenario F, we have no rabbits,

181
00:08:36,064 --> 00:08:38,332
and we have 300 berries.

182
00:08:38,332 --> 00:08:40,106
If we have no rabbits and a lot of berries,

183
00:08:40,106 --> 00:08:42,056
so let's say - we have a lot of berries,

184
00:08:42,056 --> 00:08:44,115
we might be in the mood for a rabbit -

185
00:08:44,115 --> 00:08:46,942
We'd be willing to pay a lot in berries for a rabbit.

186
00:08:46,942 --> 00:08:52,828
So let's say we would pay 100 berries

187
00:08:52,828 --> 00:08:57,704
to that hypothetical convenience store for a rabbit.

188
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:02,397
Now, let's say that we're in scenario E,

189
00:09:02,397 --> 00:09:03,715
how much would we pay to that

190
00:09:03,715 --> 00:09:04,765
hypothetical convenience store?

191
00:09:04,765 --> 00:09:08,131
Well in scenario E, we already have one rabbit

192
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,716
and we have fewer berries,

193
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,554
so we need a rabbit less,

194
00:09:11,554 --> 00:09:13,165
and we have fewer berries to give.

195
00:09:13,165 --> 00:09:14,614
So we're not willing to give

196
00:09:14,614 --> 00:09:16,415
quite as many berries for another rabbit.

197
00:09:16,415 --> 00:09:18,457
So maybe we'll only give 80 berries.

198
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:21,130
Then you go to scenario D,

199
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,915
we already have two rabbits,

200
00:09:22,915 --> 00:09:24,231
and we have even fewer berries.

201
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:27,462
So we're willing to give even fewer berries for another rabbit.

202
00:09:27,462 --> 00:09:29,031
This is what we would pay to a convenience store,

203
00:09:29,031 --> 00:09:32,414
based on our current preferences.

204
00:09:32,414 --> 00:09:34,497
Then we can go all the way to scenario C -

205
00:09:34,497 --> 00:09:36,710
and it is subjective. It's not like a measurable thing.

206
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,938
It's based on this person's preferences,

207
00:09:38,938 --> 00:09:41,167
this hunter-gatherer's preferences.

208
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:43,767
Scenario C - well, even more -

209
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:47,676
they already have more rabbits, even fewer berries.

210
00:09:47,676 --> 00:09:49,348
So they will pay even less.

211
00:09:49,348 --> 00:09:53,992
Then finally scenario B they have a good number of rabbits

212
00:09:53,992 --> 00:09:55,663
and even fewer berries.

213
00:09:55,663 --> 00:10:02,327
They'd be willing to pay very little for an incremental rabbit.

214
00:10:02,327 --> 00:10:04,538
So let's plot the marginal benefit

215
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:08,421
as a function of the number of rabbits that they already have.

216
00:10:08,421 --> 00:10:11,634
So if we go to scenario F, the marginal benefit,

217
00:10:11,634 --> 00:10:14,936
doing that little thought experiment, is 100.

218
00:10:14,936 --> 00:10:17,931
In scenario E, the marginal benefit -

219
00:10:17,931 --> 00:10:20,927
how much you would hypothetically be willing to pay in berries?

220
00:10:20,927 --> 00:10:22,645
It's now 80 berries.

221
00:10:22,645 --> 00:10:25,710
In scenario D, it is 60 berries.

222
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:29,843
In scenario C, it is 40 berries.

223
00:10:29,843 --> 00:10:34,812
So scenario C is right over here, and scenario C is 40 berries.

224
00:10:34,812 --> 00:10:44,433
In scenario B it is 20 berries, just like that.

225
00:10:44,433 --> 00:10:46,979
Now we are not just plotting the marginal cost,

226
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,485
we are plotting the marginal cost

227
00:10:48,485 --> 00:10:51,345
and the marginal benefit in berries.

228
00:10:51,345 --> 00:10:54,456
The marginal benefit curve is really a line here,

229
00:10:54,456 --> 00:10:57,382
once again for simplicity, looks like that.

230
00:10:57,382 --> 00:11:01,004
Now given this, this is the marginal benefit curve.

231
00:11:01,004 --> 00:11:03,724
Marginal benefit is a function of the number of rabbits

232
00:11:03,724 --> 00:11:04,998
that we already have.

233
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,827
And, this is the marginal cost

234
00:11:06,827 --> 00:11:09,456
as a function of the number of rabbits we already have.

235
00:11:09,456 --> 00:11:13,125
So when I say E, this is the situation E.

236
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,797
That's situation D.

237
00:11:14,797 --> 00:11:16,678
This is also situation C.

238
00:11:16,678 --> 00:11:20,966
This is the marginal benefit at situation B.

239
00:11:20,966 --> 00:11:23,156
Given this, what would I rationally do?

240
00:11:23,156 --> 00:11:24,874
These are really my preferences.

241
00:11:24,874 --> 00:11:26,546
What would I rationally do?

242
00:11:26,546 --> 00:11:29,518
If I am sitting here in situation F.

243
00:11:29,518 --> 00:11:31,004
I have no rabbits.

244
00:11:31,004 --> 00:11:34,092
I already know that it'd cost me 20 rabbits

245
00:11:34,092 --> 00:11:37,181
to try to get an incremental one.

246
00:11:37,181 --> 00:11:39,782
But I've already said I am willing to pay 100.

247
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,940
Sorry it costs me 20 berries to get an incremental rabbit.

248
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,714
But I already said I am willing to pay 100 berries

249
00:11:45,714 --> 00:11:47,411
to get an incremental rabbit.

250
00:11:47,411 --> 00:11:51,392
So I would want to move along the curve.

251
00:11:51,392 --> 00:11:57,057
So I would definitely want to get more rabbits.

252
00:11:57,057 --> 00:11:59,519
I said I am willing to pay 100 berries for a rabbit.

253
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,794
It would only cost me 20 berries for a rabbit.

254
00:12:01,794 --> 00:12:06,252
So I definitely...I am saying I want to get more rabbits.

255
00:12:06,252 --> 00:12:08,110
And another way to look at this visually,

256
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,454
marginal benefit is much higher than marginal cost here.

257
00:12:11,454 --> 00:12:14,983
So I am will to go forth and try to get more rabbits.

258
00:12:14,983 --> 00:12:17,119
That's even true in scenario E.

259
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:20,672
The marginal benefit of an incremental rabbit

260
00:12:20,672 --> 00:12:23,273
is worth much more to me than marginal cost.

261
00:12:23,273 --> 00:12:25,618
So I am willing to get more rabbits.

262
00:12:25,618 --> 00:12:29,612
So scenario E, I am still trying to get more rabbits.

263
00:12:29,612 --> 00:12:34,047
I still want to move along the production possibilities frontier

264
00:12:34,047 --> 00:12:37,715
in this general direction.

265
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:41,495
Now what happens when I am in...

266
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:43,613
What happens as I get closer to D?

267
00:12:43,613 --> 00:12:45,262
So if I am in this scenario right over here

268
00:12:45,262 --> 00:12:47,259
This isn't one of my label scenarios.

269
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:49,441
But if I am right over there,

270
00:12:49,441 --> 00:12:53,250
still my marginal cost is lower than my marginal benefit.

271
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,479
I will still want to get more rabbits,

272
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:57,197
all the way to scenario D.

273
00:12:57,197 --> 00:12:58,869
In scenario D I am a little bit neutral.

274
00:12:58,869 --> 00:13:01,051
I am willing to pay 60 berries for a rabbit.

275
00:13:01,051 --> 00:13:02,970
But that's exactly how much I'd have to give up

276
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,410
to get that extra rabbit.

277
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,949
Let's just think about scenario D for a little bit.

278
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:08,300
I just circle it right over here.

279
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,525
It looks kind of interesting.

280
00:13:10,525 --> 00:13:14,519
Now let's go ... now we want to do anything beyond scenario D.

281
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,887
So if I am at this point right over here,

282
00:13:16,887 --> 00:13:20,510
if I am working enough on average to get 2.5 rabbits a day,

283
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,727
would I...

284
00:13:22,727 --> 00:13:25,963
does this make sense for me to try to get any more rabbits?

285
00:13:25,963 --> 00:13:29,124
At that point, the benefit to get an incremental rabbit

286
00:13:29,124 --> 00:13:31,864
is smaller than the cost of getting a rabbit.

287
00:13:31,864 --> 00:13:34,210
At that point, if I try to get another rabbit,

288
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:39,272
I am getting less benefit from it than the cost associated with it.

289
00:13:39,272 --> 00:13:42,244
So I definitely don't want move past D.

290
00:13:42,244 --> 00:13:45,262
I achieve allocative efficiency

291
00:13:45,262 --> 00:13:49,395
where my marginal cost and my marginal benefit is equal.

292
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:52,541
So based on the way that I've rigged the numbers

293
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,179
in this example right over here,

294
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:57,900
you want to settle on scenario D.

295
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,516
We have achieved allocative efficiency over there.

296
00:14:01,516 --> 00:14:05,464
The marginal cost as a function of our rabbits and

297
00:14:05,464 --> 00:14:10,235
the marginal benefit of our function of rabbits is equal.
