1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,350
   

2
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,280
In the video where I first
introduced the concept of

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,430
entropy, I just tried
something out.

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:12,700
I defined my change in entropy
as being equal to the heat

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,250
added to a system, divided by
the temperature at which it

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,700
was added to the system.

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,270
And then I tested to
see if this was

8
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,660
a valid state variable.

9
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,890
And when I did that, I looked
at the Carnot cycle.

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,850
   

11
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,370
And this is a bit of a review.

12
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,340
Never hurts to review.

13
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,240
Let me draw the PV
diagram here.

14
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,670
We saw that we start at this
state here, and then we

15
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,320
proceed isothermically.

16
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,020
We removed little pebbles
off the piston.

17
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,190
So we increased the volume
and lowered the pressure.

18
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:48,170
Then we proceed adiabatically,
where we isolated things and

19
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,750
we moved like that.

20
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,650
That was adiabatically.

21
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,880
Then at this other isotherm,
we added the pebbles back.

22
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,280
   

23
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,590
And then we isolated
the system again.

24
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,160
So adiabatically, we continued
to add more pebbles, and we

25
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,230
got back to our original
state.

26
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,430
And I did a couple of videos
where I show that if you take

27
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,750
the heat added here-- so this is
all being done at some high

28
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,720
temperature, T1.

29
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,320
This is being done at some
low temperature, T2.

30
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,910
There's some heat being added
here, Q1, and that there's

31
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,760
some heat being released
here, Q2.

32
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,110
And since these are adiabatic,
there's no transfer of heat to

33
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,650
and from the system.

34
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,050
And when I looked at this, and
when I looked at the Carnot

35
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,970
cycle, and I used this
definition of entropy, I saw

36
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:42,400
that the total change in S, when
I go from this point all

37
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,780
the way around and got back, the
change in S, was equal to

38
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:55,770
Q1 over T1 plus Q2 over T2.

39
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,220
And then I actually showed you
that this was equal to 0,

40
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,880
which is exactly the result
that I wanted to see.

41
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,690
Because in order for this to be
a state variable, in order

42
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:08,800
for S to be a state variable, it
should not be dependent on

43
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,615
how I got there.

44
00:02:09,615 --> 00:02:12,490
It should only be dependent
on my state variables.

45
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:15,980
So even if I go on some crazy
path, at the end of the day,

46
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,560
it should get back to 0.

47
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,650
But I did something, I guess,
a little bit-- what I did

48
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,870
wasn't a proof that this is
always a valid state variable.

49
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,320
It was only a proof that it's
a valid state variable if we

50
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,850
look at the Carnot cycle.

51
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,070
But it turns out that it was
only valid because the Carnot

52
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,600
cycle was reversible.

53
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,340
And this is a subtle but super
important point, and I really

54
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,920
should've clarified this
on the first video.

55
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,450
I guess I was too caught up
showing the proof of the

56
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,080
Carnot cycle to put the
reversibility there.

57
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,720
And before I even show you why
it has to be reversable, let

58
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,210
me just review what
reversibility means.

59
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:57,600
Now, we know that in order to
even define a path here, the

60
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,640
system has to be pretty close to
equilibrium the whole time.

61
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,230
That's the whole reason why
throughout these videos, I've

62
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,330
been drawing this piston, you
know, have the gases down

63
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,780
here, and then always-- instead
of having one big

64
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,660
weight on top that I took off
or took on, because it would

65
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,550
throw the system out of
equilibrium-- I did it in

66
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,310
really small increments.

67
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,860
I just moved grains of sand, so
that the system was always

68
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,640
really close to equilibrium.

69
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,430
And that's called quasistatic.

70
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,680
and I've defined that before.

71
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,320
   

72
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,440
And that means that you're
always in kind of a

73
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,720
quasi-equilibrium.

74
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,910
So your state variables
are always defined.

75
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:38,280
But that, by itself, does not
give you reversability.

76
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:47,480
You have to be quasistatic and
frictionless in order to be

77
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,650
reversible.

78
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,110
Now, what do we mean
by frictionless?

79
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,720
Well, I think you know what
frictionless means.

80
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,120
Is that like you see in this
system right here, if I make

81
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,590
this piston a little bit bigger,
that when this piston

82
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:04,330
rubs against the side of this
wall, in kind of our real

83
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,950
world, there's always a little
bit of friction.

84
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,730
Those molecules start bumping
against each other, and then

85
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,050
they start making them vibrate,
so they transfer some

86
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,160
kinetic energy.

87
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,000
From just by rubbing into each
other, they start generating

88
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,399
some kinetic energy,
or some heat.

89
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:21,350
So you normally have some heat
generated from friction.

90
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,900
Now, if you have some heat
generated from friction, when

91
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,550
I remove a pebble-- first all,
when I remove that first

92
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,010
pebble, it might not
even do anything.

93
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:33,430
Because it might not even
overcome-- you can kind of

94
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,140
view it as the force
of friction.

95
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,400
But let's say I remove some
pebbles, and this thing moves

96
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,650
up a little bit.

97
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:41,310
   

98
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,210
But because some of the, I guess
you could say, the force

99
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,280
differential, the pressure
differential between the

100
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,800
pebbles and the gas inside, and
the pressure of the gas,

101
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,480
was used to generate heat as
opposed to work, when I add

102
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,360
the pebbles back, if I have
friction, I'm not going to get

103
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,930
back to the same point
that I was before.

104
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,940
Because friction is always
resisting the movement.

105
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,440
So in order for something to be
reversible, when I remove a

106
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,110
couple of pebbles, if I removed
ten pebbles and add

107
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,810
the ten pebbles back, I should
be at the exact same state.

108
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,550
But as, you know, you can just
do the thought experiment.

109
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,520
If there's friction, I won't
be at the exact same state.

110
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:24,470
My piston won't move as much as
you would expect if it was

111
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:24,960
frictionless.

112
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,140
So this is a key assumption
for reversability.

113
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:35,330
Now, the Carnot cycle, by
definition, is reversible.

114
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,500
And that's why no one could
actually really implement an

115
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,490
engine that fully does
the Carnot cycle.

116
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,750
And we even showed that, that
the Carnot cycle is the most

117
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,130
efficient potential engine.

118
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,970
That if anyone made a more
efficient engine, you could

119
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,220
have a perpetual motion
machine, or a

120
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,190
perpetual energy machine.

121
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,820
And the reason why the Carnot
engine is the most efficient

122
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,600
engine-- and there's no secret
here-- it's because it's

123
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,770
frictionless.

124
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,860
Any engineer who makes engines
could tell you, wow, if I

125
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,460
could just remove all of the
friction from my system, I

126
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,410
would get a lot more
efficient.

127
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,610
Now, with that said-- so I've
told you that look.

128
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,570
The definition doesn't have to
be-- it happened to work, Q

129
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,680
divided by T, because
I was dealing with

130
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,380
a reversible system.

131
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,750
And just to hit the point home,
let me show you that it

132
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,520
would not have worked if I had
just defined it Q divided by T

133
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,320
on an irreversible system.

134
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,495
So let's say that I have-- let
me draw another PV diagram.

135
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:38,370
   

136
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:43,550
And I'm going to do almost
a very simple thought

137
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,830
experiment.

138
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,520
Now I'm going to have an
irreversible system.

139
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,410
And I start here at some
point on my PV diagram.

140
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:55,900
And you know, this could be some
type of cylinder, and it

141
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,320
has a piston on top, and I have
my rocks, like always.

142
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,210
But this time, there's a
little bit of friction.

143
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,030
When this thing moves, a
little bit of heat is

144
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,040
generated in this.

145
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,440
And when it moves in
either direction,

146
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,910
some heat is generated.

147
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:11,500
So we can call that the
heat from friction.

148
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,330
When it moves either up
or when it moves down.

149
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,320
So let's do something.

150
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,590
Let's stick this on a big
reservoir, like we tend to do.

151
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,370
So it's an isothermal system.

152
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,780
So let's call this T1.

153
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,220
And let's just start
removing pebbles.

154
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,610
And we'll move along
an isotherm.

155
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:34,070
   

156
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,010
Maybe to that point there.

157
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,900
And then we're going to-- and
I want to make a very

158
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,400
important point here.

159
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,440
Because this is has friction,
I'm not going to get quite as

160
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,830
far along the isotherm than
if I didn't have friction.

161
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,500
If this was a frictionless
system, I would've gotten a

162
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,430
little bit further along
the isotherm.

163
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,460
So the number of rocks isn't
going to be the same as it was

164
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:55,960
frictionless.

165
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,390
But let's just say I
move from here to

166
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,480
here on the PV diagram.

167
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,050
And then we go and add a bunch
of rocks back, and we want to

168
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,450
go all the way back.

169
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,910
And I'm not even saying whether
we have the same

170
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,010
number of rocks or
different rocks.

171
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,860
You're probably going to have to
add a few more rocks to get

172
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,260
back to this point.

173
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,140
But the idea here is, is that
we've gotten back to the same

174
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,090
point on the state diagram.

175
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:22,270
So our delta U total should be
equal to 0, which is equal to

176
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,150
the delta U of expansion.

177
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,350
So the delta U of expansion is
the delta u to go that way,

178
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:33,059
delta U of expansion, plus the
delta U of contraction, which

179
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:36,450
is the delta U of going
back like this.

180
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:40,909
Those have to be equal to
0 by definition, right?

181
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:43,400
Because internal energy is a
state variable, and if we get

182
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,920
to that same point, our delta
U has to be equal to 0.

183
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,290
So what's our delta
U of expansion?

184
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:53,230
What's our change in internal
energy as we expand?

185
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:59,680
Our delta U of expansion is
equal to the heat added to the

186
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:06,965
system minus the work
done by the system.

187
00:09:06,965 --> 00:09:12,280
   

188
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,870
And we know how much
work was done, this

189
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,640
whole area right there.

190
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,670
And then plus the heat added
by the friction.

191
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,550
There's some heat added
by the friction.

192
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,800
Let me do that in brown.

193
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,210
   

194
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,620
What's that?

195
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:34,005
I was on some random website off
the screen, and all of a

196
00:09:34,005 --> 00:09:35,870
sudden that cartoon
sound started up.

197
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,660
I have no idea what that was.

198
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,100
But anyway, where was I?

199
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,120
So I said our change in internal
energy from expansion

200
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,310
is going to be the heat added
to the system from our

201
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:51,360
reservoir minus the work done
by the system, as we expand,

202
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,520
plus the heat added to the
system or generated by the

203
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,220
system-- I guess you could say,
it's not being added.

204
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,650
The system is creating this heat
itself, as it expands.

205
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,300
There's this friction
right there.

206
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:02,920
Fair enough.

207
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,750
So this is the one variation.

208
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,860
Now that we're not dealing with
the reversible process,

209
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,080
we have this friction.

210
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,510
Now what's our change in energy
from contraction?

211
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,740
So our change in internal energy
from contraction is

212
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:19,150
going to be the heat that leaves
the system, that has to

213
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,940
go back into the reservoir
as we contract.

214
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,660
Because otherwise, if we didn't
have the reservoir, the

215
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,950
temperature would go up.

216
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,450
But we want to release heat.

217
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,640
So we want to say, heat
released-- and

218
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,430
I'm going to do something.

219
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,940
Let's just assume that all
of the Q's are positive.

220
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:39,000
So if I'm releasing heat, it's
going to be a minus Q release.

221
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,450
Let's just say that this is a
positive number, and if I'm

222
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,850
releasing it, it's going to
be a minus right there.

223
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,470
And I want to just do that, just
to hopefully make things

224
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,030
little bit clearer.

225
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,350
Plus the work performed
on the system.

226
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,040
I'm assuming that work is always
positive, so if we're

227
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,790
doing work, it'll
be minus work.

228
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,930
If work is being done to
us, it'll be plus work.

229
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,290
But in this situation
as well, we're still

230
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,880
adding heat from friction.

231
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,840
Or heat from friction is still
being generated in the system.

232
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,540
This is still positive.

233
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,230
In either direction, when we
move upwards or downwards, the

234
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,430
system is generating friction.

235
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:14,370
Now, we always said, we went all
the way here, we went all

236
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,300
the way back.

237
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,990
So the sum of these has to be
equal to 0, because this is a

238
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,120
state variable.

239
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,080
So if the sum of all of this
has to be equal to 0, let's

240
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,750
sum this up.

241
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:28,630
So this gets us to
Qa minus Qr.

242
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,900
So the heat accepted minus
the heat released.

243
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,440
The W's cancel out.

244
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:41,870
Plus-- let me see right here--
plus 2 times the heat of

245
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,250
friction in either direction.

246
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,670
All of that has to
be equal to 0.

247
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,290
Let's see.

248
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:51,120
What we can do is, we can
rewrite this as the heat

249
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,210
accepted minus the heat released
is equal to minus 2

250
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:59,760
times the amount of heat
generated from friction.

251
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,240
And then if we just switch these
around, we'll get the

252
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,070
heat released minus the heat
accepted is equal to-- well, I

253
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,580
just wanted to get all positive
numbers-- 2 times the

254
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,560
heat of friction.

255
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,200
Now why did I do all of this?

256
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,450
Because I wanted to do
an experiment with an

257
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:18,810
irreversible system, and this
was a very simple experiment

258
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,580
with an irreversible system.

259
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:25,580
Now, we said that delta S,
which a long time ago I

260
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,090
defined as Q divided by T-- and
in this video, I said it

261
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,380
had to be reversible.

262
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:33,000
And I wanted to show you right
now that what if I didn't make

263
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,830
the constraint that this
has to be reversible?

264
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,000
Because if this doesn't have to
be reversible, and I just

265
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,640
use this definition right here,
you'll see that your

266
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:52,200
delta S here would be-- you just
divide everything by T--

267
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,870
because our temperature was
constant the entire time, we

268
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:58,410
were just on a reservoir--
you'll see that this is going

269
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,260
to be your delta s.

270
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,240
This is your total change in
the, I guess you could say,

271
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,950
your net heat added
to the system.

272
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,090
So this is, let me say,
this is the heat

273
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,012
added to the system.

274
00:13:11,012 --> 00:13:13,290
Let me do it this way.

275
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:19,200
Heat added to the system,
divided by the temperature at

276
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,655
which it was added.

277
00:13:20,655 --> 00:13:24,840
   

278
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,290
Which is a positive number.

279
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,410
Even though we got to
the exact same place

280
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,060
on this date diagram.

281
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,780
So in an reversible system,
this wouldn't be

282
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,220
a valid state variable.

283
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,830
So it's only a valid state
variable if it's reversible.

284
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,670
Now, does that mean that you
can only talk about entropy

285
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:43,950
for reversible reactions?

286
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:44,740
No.

287
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,300
You can talk about entropy
for anything.

288
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,050
But what you do is-- and this
is another important point.

289
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:57,630
So let's say that I have some
irreversible reaction that

290
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:00,730
goes from here to here.

291
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,110
And I want to figure out
its change in entropy.

292
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,370
Right?

293
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,410
And it might have done all
sorts of crazy things.

294
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:08,000
It's an irreversible reaction,
its path might

295
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,630
have gone like that.

296
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,410
That's assuming it's
quasistatic, if we can even

297
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,020
look at its path like that.

298
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,700
If we wanted to figure out its
change in entropy, though, we

299
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,470
wouldn't worry about the heat
that was added to it and the

300
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,130
different temperatures at
which it was added.

301
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,300
We wouldn't worry about that.

302
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,380
We would just say, OK.

303
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:26,900
What would it have taken for a
reversible system to go from

304
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,100
this state to this state?

305
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,290
And then maybe a reversible
system would have done

306
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,490
something like this.

307
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,710
Sorry, I want to make
it a smooth curve.

308
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,060
Maybe a reversible system
might have done

309
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,180
something like that.

310
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:43,540
And this change, this heat added
by the reversible system

311
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,160
divided by the temperature for
the reversible system, would

312
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,090
be the change in entropy.

313
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:56,280
And this change in entropy--
we could call this S final,

314
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:00,540
and this is S initial, it's
going to be the same for both

315
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,060
systems. It's just, we don't use
the irreversible system to

316
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,310
figure out our entropy.

317
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:08,750
We would use the reversible heat
and temperature to figure

318
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,460
out the actual change.

319
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,300
Hopefully that clarifies
something else.

320
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,370
It's, on some level, a subtle
point, but on some level it's

321
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,140
super important.

322
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,160
Because you can't-- the
thermodynamic definition of

323
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,360
entropy has to be this.

324
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,560
It has to be heat added to a
reversible system divided by

325
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,820
the temperature that
was added.

326
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,750
Not just heat to any system.

327
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,870
It just happened to work when
I did it, and I should have

328
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:32,540
been clearer about it when I
first explained it, that it

329
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,790
worked only because it was
a Carnot cycle, which is

330
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,040
reversible.

331
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,321
