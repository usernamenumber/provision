1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,210
Let's add some transformation
that maps elements in

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:06,710
set X to set Y.

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,870
We know that we call
X the domain of T.

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,920
So that's my set X and then my
set that I'm mapping into, set

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,270
Y, that's the codomain.

7
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,750
We know that T is a
transformation that if you

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,510
take any member of X and you
transform it, you'll associate

9
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,230
it with a member of set Y.

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,430
You'll map it to a
member of set Y.

11
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:31,040
That's what the transformation
or the function does.

12
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,740
Now, if we have some subset of
T, let's call A to be some

13
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,245
subset of T.

14
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:40,090
So let me draw A like that.

15
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,570
This notation right here
just means subset,

16
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:44,730
some subset of T.

17
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:50,590
We've defined the notion of an
image of T of A like that,

18
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:59,870
which is the image of A, of
our subset A, under T.

19
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,700
We've defined this to be equal
to the set-- let me write it

20
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:09,010
here-- the set of all-- where if
we take each of the members

21
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:15,390
of our subset, it's the set of
all of their transformations.

22
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,600
   

23
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,060
And, of course, these are going
to be some subset of Y

24
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:22,680
right there.

25
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,140
So we essentially take each
of the members of A.

26
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:25,930
This was one of them.

27
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:26,960
You find its transformation.

28
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,900
It's that point.

29
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,160
You take another member of A.

30
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,790
This is all set A right here.

31
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:32,660
Take another member of A.

32
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,720
Find its transformation.

33
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,740
Maybe it's that point.

34
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,760
You keep doing that.

35
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,580
Find it's transformation.

36
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,600
Maybe it's that point.

37
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,160
And then the set of all of those
transformations, maybe

38
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,400
it's this blob right here,
we call this the

39
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,830
image of A under T.

40
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,630
Now, what if we wanted
to think about

41
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:49,770
the opposite problem?

42
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,340
What if we were to start with
set Y, which is our codomain,

43
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,570
So that's Y, and we were to
have some subset of Y.

44
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:02,980
Let's call our subset of Y S.

45
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:07,520
So S is a subset of
our codomain Y.

46
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,610
And I'm curious about what
subset of X maps into S.

47
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,230
So I'm curious about this set.

48
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:20,170
I'm curious about the set of all
vectors that are members

49
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:27,390
of my domain such that they're
mapping or the transformation

50
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:35,070
of those vectors ends up
in my subset of S.

51
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:40,560
So what I'm saying is, look,
if I take my domain, there

52
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,530
must be some subset of vectors
right here, where if I take

53
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:52,140
any member of this set, it will
map into these guys, and

54
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,690
that's what I'm defining
right here.

55
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,140
This is equal to that guy.

56
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,570
So I'm literally saying what
are all of the members of X

57
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:02,570
where those members of
X all map into S?

58
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:06,710
Now, I want to make a very
subtle nuance here to point

59
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,270
out something here.

60
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,630
I'm not saying that
every point in S

61
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,190
necessarily gets mapped to.

62
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:16,430
For example, maybe there's some
element in S right there

63
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,800
that no element in X ever
gets mapped to from our

64
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,140
transformation T.

65
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,190
That's OK.

66
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:25,760
All I'm saying is that
everything in this set maps to

67
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,460
something within S right here.

68
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:34,970
And what we call this set right
here, the notation is

69
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,000
the inverse T of S, but
this is equal to the

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,540
pre-image of S under T.

71
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,710
So this is S.

72
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:53,530
This is the pre-image
of S under T.

73
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,190
And that makes sense.

74
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,980
The image, we go from a subset
of our domain to a subset of

75
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,050
our codomain.

76
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,250
Preimage, we go from a subset
of our codomain, and we say

77
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,920
what subset of our domain
maps into that

78
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,850
subset of our codomain?

79
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,720
Now let me ask you an
interesting question, and this

80
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,170
is kind of for bonus points.

81
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:17,850
What is the image of our
pre-image under S?

82
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:23,020
   

83
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,210
So if we take this guy, this
is essentially the image of

84
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,050
this guy right here, right?

85
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,455
This part right here is the
pre-image of S right here.

86
00:04:34,455 --> 00:04:37,530
Now, if we take the image of
this, we're saying if we take

87
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,520
every member of this, what
vectors do they map into?

88
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,290
All of them are going to be
within S, so they're going to

89
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,880
map within S, but they don't
necessarily map to

90
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,700
everything within S.

91
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,000
So this is going to be
some subset of S.

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,820
So this right here is going
to be some subset of

93
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,130
our original S.

94
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,870
It's not necessarily equal to
S, but it's a subset of it.

95
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,960
And so this is I think the
motivation for where the

96
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,330
notation comes from.

97
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,950
We can construct a subset of S
by taking the image of the

98
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:05,900
pre-image of S.

99
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,950
We can kind of view the image
and the pre-image kind of

100
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,370
canceling out, and that's why
the inverse notation was

101
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,720
probably introduced.

102
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,560
Now this is all very abstract.

103
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,400
What I'm going to do in the
next video is actually

104
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,930
calculate or determine
the pre-image of some

105
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,430
subset of my codomain.

106
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,735
