1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,510
   

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,070
In the last video I had this 2
by 3 matrix A right here, and

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,820
we figured out all of the
subspaces that are associated

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:09,455
with this matrix.

5
00:00:09,455 --> 00:00:13,370
We figured out its null space,
its column space, we figured

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,260
out the null space and column
space of its transpose, which

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,930
you could also call the left
null space, and the row space,

8
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:23,580
or what's essentially the space
spanned by A's rows.

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,840
Let's write it all in one place,
because I realize it

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,050
got a little disjointed, and see
if we can visualize what

11
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,490
all of these look
like, especially

12
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:31,620
relative to each other.

13
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:36,180
So let me copy and paste
my original matrix.

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,800
Copy, and then let me scroll
down here and paste it over

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,270
here, and hit paste.

16
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:49,190
Let me see if I can find
our key takeaways

17
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,580
from the last video.

18
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:55,410
So our column space right here,
of A, was this thing

19
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:55,900
right here.

20
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,690
Let me write this.

21
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,000
This was our column space.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,320
It was the span of the
R2 vector 2, 4.

23
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,870
Let me copy that.

24
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,366
Copy that and bring it down.

25
00:01:08,366 --> 00:01:10,170
Hit paste.

26
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,000
This was our column space.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,610
Let me write that.

28
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:18,100
This is the column space of A.

29
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,160
It was equal to that
right there.

30
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,290
And now what other things
do we know?

31
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:29,000
Well, we know that the left null
space was a span of 2, 1.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,160
Let me write that.

33
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,880
So our left null space, or the
null space of our transpose,

34
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,895
either way, it was equal to the
span of the R2 vector 2,

35
00:01:41,895 --> 00:01:47,190
1, just like that.

36
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,820
And then what was
our null space?

37
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,020
Our null space we figured
out in the last video.

38
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:54,510
Here it is.

39
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,140
It's the span of these
two R3 vectors.

40
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,440
Let me copy and paste that.

41
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,390
   

42
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,690
Hit copy.

43
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,152
Let me go down here.

44
00:02:05,152 --> 00:02:08,759
Let me paste it.

45
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,620
So that was our null
space right there.

46
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,100
And then finally, what
was our row space?

47
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,860
What was our row space or the
column space of our transpose?

48
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,520
   

49
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,850
So the column space of our
transpose was the span of this

50
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:33,220
R3 vector right there, So it
was this one right here.

51
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,160
So let me copy and paste it.

52
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:44,710
Copy and scroll down, and we can
paste it just like that.

53
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,980
OK, let's see if we can
visualize this now, now that

54
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,990
we have them all in one place.

55
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:57,170
So first of all, if we imagine
a transformation, x, that is

56
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:02,160
equal to A times x, our
transformation is going to be

57
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,630
a mapping from what? x would be
a member of R3, so R3 would

58
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,670
be our domain.

59
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,340
So it would be a mapping from
R3 and then it would be a

60
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,390
mapping to R2 because we have
two rows here, right?

61
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:21,300
You multiply a 2-by-3 matrix
times a 3-by-1 vector, and

62
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,330
you're going to get a 2-by-1
vector, so it's going to be a

63
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,090
mapping to R2.

64
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:26,850
So that's our codomain.

65
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,070
So let's draw our domains
and our codomains.

66
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,940
   

67
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,250
I'll just write them very
generally right here.

68
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:39,660
So you could imagine
R3 is our domain.

69
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:45,320
And then our codomain is going
to be R2 just like that.

70
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,955
   

71
00:03:47,955 --> 00:03:51,020
And our T is a mapping, or you
could even imagine A is a

72
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,750
mapping between any vector there
and any vector there

73
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,340
when you multiply them.

74
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:00,150
Now, what is our column
space of A?

75
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,260
Our column space of A is the
span of the vector 2 minus 4.

76
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,470
It's an R2 vector.

77
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:09,200
This is a subspace of R2.

78
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,340
We could write this.

79
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,430
So let me write this.

80
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:16,420
So our column space of A, these
are just all of the

81
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,089
vectors that are spanned
by this.

82
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:21,490
We figured out that these guys
are just multiples of this

83
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,825
first guy, or we could have
done it the other way.

84
00:04:22,825 --> 00:04:25,820
We could have said this guy and
that guy are multiples of

85
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,810
that guy, either way.

86
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,060
But the basis is just one
of these vectors.

87
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,590
We just have to have one of
these vectors, and so it was

88
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,660
equal to this right here.

89
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,915
So the column space
is a subset of R2.

90
00:04:38,915 --> 00:04:41,800
And what else is
a subset of R2?

91
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,650
Well, our left null space.

92
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,300
Our left null space is
also a subset of R2.

93
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:53,530
   

94
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,570
So let's graph them, actually.

95
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,950
So I won't be too exact,
but you can imagine.

96
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,680
Let's see, if we draw the
vector 2, 4-- let me

97
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,670
draw some axes here.

98
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,220
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

99
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,470
So if you have some vector--
let me draw my-- do this as

100
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,816
neatly as possible.

101
00:05:12,816 --> 00:05:15,200
That's my vertical axis.

102
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,910
That is my horizontal axis.

103
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:23,490
And then, what does the span of
our column space look like?

104
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,820
   

105
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,070
So you draw the vector 2, minus
4, so you're going to go

106
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,740
out one, two, and then you're
going to go down one, two,

107
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,200
three, four.

108
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,800
So that's what that
vector looks like.

109
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,340
   

110
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,420
And the span of this vector
is essentially all of the

111
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,970
multiples of this vector, where
you could say linear

112
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,565
combinations of it, but you're
taking a combination of just

113
00:05:47,565 --> 00:05:49,530
one vector, so it's just going
to be all of the multiples of

114
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,700
this vector.

115
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:55,750
So if I were to graph it, it
would just be a line that is

116
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,030
specified by all of the linear
combinations of that vector

117
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,030
right there.

118
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,665
This right here is a graphical
representation of the column

119
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:07,160
space of A.

120
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,140
Now, let's look at the left null
space of A, or you could

121
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,130
imagine, the null space
of the transpose.

122
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,680
They are the same thing.

123
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,780
You saw why in the last video.

124
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,020
What does this look like?

125
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,830
So the left null space
is a span of 2, 1.

126
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:24,980
So if you graph 2, and then you
go up 1, it's the graph of

127
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,780
2, 1, and it looks like this.

128
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,840
Let me do it in a
different color.

129
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,860
So that's what the vector
looks like.

130
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,700
The vector looks like that,
but of course, we want the

131
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,570
span of that vector, so it's
going to be all of the

132
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,670
combinations.

133
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,800
All you can do when you combine
one vector is just

134
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,640
multiply it by a bunch of
scalars, so it's going to be

135
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,735
all of the scalar multiples
of that vector.

136
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,880
So let me draw it like that.

137
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,110
It's going to be like that.

138
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,980
And the first thing you might
notice, let me write this.

139
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:55,970
This is our left null space
of A or the null

140
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,210
space of our transpose.

141
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:04,965
This is equal to the left
null space of A.

142
00:07:04,965 --> 00:07:07,870
   

143
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,670
And actually, since we're
writing, we wrote this in

144
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,660
terms of A transpose.

145
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,060
It's the null space of A
transpose, which is the left

146
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,060
null space of A.

147
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,900
Let's write the column
space of A also

148
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,640
in terms of A transpose.

149
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:24,600
This is equal to the row space
of A transpose, right?

150
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,400
If you're looking at the columns
of A, everything it

151
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,110
spans, the columns of A are the
same things as the rows of

152
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,450
A transpose.

153
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,510
But the first thing that you
see, when I just at least

154
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:36,710
visually drew it like this, is
that these two spaces look to

155
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,400
be orthogonal to each other.

156
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,670
It looks like I drew it in R2.

157
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,720
It looks like there's a
90-degree angle there.

158
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,000
And if we wanted to verify it,
all we have to do is take the

159
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,230
dot product.

160
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:55,400
Well, any vector that is in our
column space, you could

161
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,110
take an arbitrary vector that's
in our column space,

162
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:02,650
it's going to be equal
to c times 2 minus 4.

163
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,900
So let me write that down.

164
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:08,440
   

165
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,370
I want this stuff up here.

166
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,660
I'll scroll down a little bit.

167
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,780
   

168
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,650
Let's say v1 is a member
of our column space.

169
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,380
   

170
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:23,170
And that means that v1 is going
to be equal to some

171
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:27,270
scalar multiple times the
spanning vector of our column

172
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,470
space, so some scale or
multiple of this.

173
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:36,880
So we could say it's equal
to c1 times 2 minus 4.

174
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,150
That's some member of
our column space.

175
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:44,220
Now, if we want some member of
our left null space-- let's

176
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:44,990
write it here.

177
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:53,900
So let's say that v2 is some
member of our left null space,

178
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,430
or the null space of
the transpose, then

179
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,050
what does that mean?

180
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,820
That means v2 is going to be
equal to some scalar multiple

181
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,130
of the spanning vector of our
left null space of 2, 1.

182
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,480
   

183
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,540
So any vector that's in our
column space could be

184
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,770
represented this way.

185
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,410
Any vector in our left
null space can be

186
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,620
represented this way.

187
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,720
Now, what happens if you take
the dot product of these two

188
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,695
characters?

189
00:09:17,695 --> 00:09:20,570
So let me do it down here.

190
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,850
I want to save some space for
what we're going to do in R3,

191
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,880
but let me take the dot
product of these two

192
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,910
characters.

193
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:33,460
So v1 dot v2 is equal to--
I'll arbitrarily switch

194
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:42,840
colors-- c1 times 2 minus
4 dot c2 times 2, 1.

195
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,630
And then the scalars, we've
seen this before.

196
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:51,420
You can just say that this is
the same thing as c1, c2 times

197
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:56,620
the dot product of 2
minus 4 dot 2, 1.

198
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,600
And then what is
this equal to?

199
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:05,130
This is going to be equal to
c1, c2 times 2 times 2 is 4

200
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:09,090
plus minus 4 times 1: minus 4.

201
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,280
Well, this is going to be equal
to 0, so this whole

202
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,805
expression is going
to be equal to 0.

203
00:10:12,805 --> 00:10:15,350
And this was for any two vectors
that are members of

204
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,090
our column space and our
left null space.

205
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,950
They're orthogonal
to each other.

206
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:22,160
So every member of our column
space is going to be

207
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,660
orthogonal to every member of
our left null space, or every

208
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,980
member of the null space of our
transpose, and that was

209
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,270
the case in this example.

210
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:35,360
It actually turns out this is
always going to be the case,

211
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,530
that your column space of
a matrix, its orthogonal

212
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:43,280
complement is the left null
space, or the null space of

213
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,300
its transpose.

214
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,640
I'll prove that probably in the
next video, either in the

215
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,770
next video or the video after
that, but you can see it

216
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,680
visually for this example.

217
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,620
Now let's draw the other two
characters that we're

218
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,310
dealing with here.

219
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:03,930
So we have our null space, which
is the span of these two

220
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:04,950
vectors in R3.

221
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:08,330
It's a little bit more difficult
to draw it, these

222
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,430
two vectors in R3 right there.

223
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:13,510
But what is the span of
two vectors in R3?

224
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:16,135
All of the linear combinations
of two vectors in R3 is going

225
00:11:16,135 --> 00:11:18,000
to be a plane in R3.

226
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,045
So I'll draw it in just very
general terms right here.

227
00:11:21,045 --> 00:11:25,860
If we draw it in just very
general terms, let me see.

228
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,410
So it's a plane in R3 that
looks like that.

229
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:33,300
Maybe I'll fill in the plane
a little bit, give you some

230
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,370
sense of what it looks like.

231
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:38,640
This is the null space of A.

232
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,960
It's spanned by these
two vectors.

233
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,950
Now, you could imagine these
two vectors look something

234
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,990
like-- I'm drawing it very
general, but if you take any

235
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,800
linear combinations of these two
guys, you're going to get

236
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,040
any vector that's along this
plane that goes in infinite

237
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,480
directions.

238
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,000
And, of course, the origin
will be in these.

239
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,090
All of these are valid
subspaces.

240
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:05,930
Now, what does the row
space of A look like?

241
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:08,820
Or you could say the column
space of A transpose?

242
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:15,000
Well, it's the span of this
vector in R3, but let's see

243
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,580
something interesting about
this vector in R3.

244
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,090
How does it relate to
these two vectors?

245
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,200
Well, you may not see it
immediately, although if you

246
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,910
look at it closely, it might pop
out at you, that this guy

247
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,670
is orthogonal to both
of these guys.

248
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:37,170
Notice, if you take the dot
product of 2 minus 1 minus 3,

249
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:43,360
and you dotted it with 1/2, 1,
0, what are you going to get?

250
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,720
You're going to get 2 times 1/2,
which is 1, plus minus 1

251
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,190
times 1, which is minus
1, plus minus 3

252
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,390
times 0, which is 0.

253
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:55,230
So that's when I dotted that guy
with that guy right there.

254
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,490
And then, when I take the dot
of this guy with that guy,

255
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,150
what do you get?

256
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:04,580
You get 3/2, 0 and 1, dotted
with-- let me scroll down a

257
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,210
little bit.

258
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:11,650
I don't want to write too
small-- dotted with 1, dotted

259
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:16,440
with 2 minus 1 minus 3.

260
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,010
In the row space of A,
I wrote the spanning

261
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,970
vector there this time.

262
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,280
I probably shouldn't have
switched the order.

263
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,230
But here, I'm dotting it with
this guy, and then here, I'm

264
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,110
dotting it with this
guy right there.

265
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:33,860
So if you take it, 3/2 times 2
is equal to 3 plus 0 times

266
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,966
minus 1 is 0, plus 1 times minus
3 is minus 3, so it's

267
00:13:37,966 --> 00:13:39,490
equal to 0.

268
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:44,350
So the fact that this guy is
orthogonal to both of these

269
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,530
spanning vectors, it also means
that it's orthogonal to

270
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,470
any linear combination
of those guys.

271
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:51,410
Maybe it might be useful
for you to see that.

272
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:58,640
So let's take some member
of our null space.

273
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:04,020
So let's say the vector v3 is
a member of our null space.

274
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,320
   

275
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,680
That means it's a linear
combination of that

276
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,340
guy and that guy.

277
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,850
Those are the two spanning
vectors.

278
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,970
I'd written it up here.

279
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,930
These are our two spanning
vectors.

280
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,860
I need the space down here,
so let me scroll

281
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,520
down a little bit.

282
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,840
These are the two spanning
vectors.

283
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,910
So that means that v3 can be
written as some linear

284
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,780
combination of these two guys
that I squared off in pink.

285
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:40,810
So let me just write it as maybe
A times 3/2, 0, 1 plus b

286
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:48,520
times 1/2, 1, 0.

287
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:56,900
Now, what happens if I take the
dot product of v3 and I

288
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:03,110
dot it with any member of
my row space right here?

289
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:08,650
So any member of my row space
is going to be a multiple of

290
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,490
this guy right here.

291
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,170
That is the spanning vector
of my row space.

292
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:13,750
Just let me actually
create that.

293
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:20,750
So let me say that v4 is a
member of my row space, which

294
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,800
is the column space of
the transpose of A.

295
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,500
And that means that v4 is equal
to, let's say, some

296
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,300
scaling vector.

297
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,860
I always use c a lot.

298
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,200
Let me use d.

299
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,490
Let's say it's d times
my spanning vector.

300
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,520
d times 2 minus 1, 3.

301
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,520
So what is v3, which is just
any member of my null space

302
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:50,420
dotted with v4, which is any
member of my row space?

303
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,740
So what is this going
to be equal to?

304
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:57,890
This is going to be
equal to this guy.

305
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,620
So let me write it like this.

306
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:13,850
A times 3/2, 0, 1 plus v times
1/2, 1, 0 dotted with this

307
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:18,830
guy, dot d times 2 minus 1, 3.

308
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,500
Now, what is this going
to be equal to?

309
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,310
Well, we know all of
the properties

310
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,930
of vector dot products.

311
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:26,330
We can distribute it and then
take the scalars out.

312
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,940
So this is going to be equal
to-- I'll skip a few steps

313
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,970
here, but it's going to be equal
to-- ad times the dot

314
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:41,755
product of 3/2, 0, 1, dot 2
minus 1, 3-- just distribute

315
00:16:41,755 --> 00:16:50,790
it out to here-- plus bd times
the dot product of 1/2, 1, 0,

316
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,410
dotted with 2 minus 1, 3.

317
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,660
This is the dot product.

318
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,400
I just distributed this
term along these

319
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,670
two terms right here.

320
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,040
And we already know what these
dot products are equal to.

321
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,410
We did it right here.

322
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,800
This dot product right here
is that dot product.

323
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,420
I just switched the order,
so this is equal to 0.

324
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,700
And this dot product is that dot
product, so this is also

325
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,369
equal to 0.

326
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:17,190
So you take any member of your
row space and you dot it with

327
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:21,819
any member of your null space,
and you're going to get 0, or

328
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:25,690
any member of your row space is
orthogonal to any member of

329
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,170
your null space.

330
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,720
And I did all of that to
help our visualization.

331
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,420
So we just saw that any member
of our row space, which is the

332
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:36,930
span of this vector, is
orthogonal to any member of or

333
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,790
null space.

334
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,200
So my row space, which is just
going to be a line in R3

335
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,550
because it's just a multiple
of a vector.

336
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,800
It's going to look like this.

337
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,780
   

338
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,500
It's going to be a line,
and then it's going to

339
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,170
maybe go behind it.

340
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,100
You can't see it there.

341
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,710
It's going to look like that,
but it's going to be

342
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,605
orthogonal.

343
00:17:51,605 --> 00:17:52,690
So let me draw it.

344
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:59,440
So this pink line right here in
R3, that is our row space

345
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,540
of A, which is equal to the
column space of A transpose

346
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,500
because the rows of A are the
same thing as the columns of A

347
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,820
transposed, and the row space
is just the space spanned by

348
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,030
your row vectors.

349
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:16,850
And then this is the null space
of A, which is a plane.

350
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:19,240
It's spanned by two
vectors in R3.

351
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,750
Or we could also call
that the left

352
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:29,800
null space of A transpose.

353
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,590
And I never used this term in
the last video, but it's

354
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,620
symmetric, right?

355
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,880
If the null space of A transpose
is the left null

356
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,710
space of A, then the null space
of A is the left null

357
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:42,810
space of A transpose, which is
an interesting takeaway.

358
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:50,570
Notice that you have here the
row space of A is orthogonal

359
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,520
to the null space of A.

360
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,640
And here, you have the row
space of A transpose is

361
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,750
orthogonal to the null
space of A transpose.

362
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,750
Or you could say the left null
space of A is orthogonal to

363
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,350
the column space of A.

364
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,220
Or you could say the left null
space of A transpose is

365
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,780
orthogonal to the column
space of A transpose.

366
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,280
So these are just
very interesting

367
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,890
takeaways, in general.

368
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,290
And just like I said here, that
look, these happen to be

369
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:18,830
orthogonal.

370
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,460
These also happen to
be orthogonal.

371
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,590
And this isn't just some
strange coincidence.

372
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:26,490
In the next video or two, I'll
show you that this space, this

373
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:30,780
pink space, is the orthogonal
complement of the null space

374
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:36,710
right here, which means it
represents all of the vectors

375
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,100
that are orthogonal
to the null space.

376
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,110
And these two guys
are orthogonal

377
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,130
complements to each other.

378
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:45,910
They each represent all of the
vectors that are orthogonal to

379
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:49,210
the other guy in their
respective spaces.

380
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:49,333
