1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,133
What I wanna do in this video

2
00:00:02,133 --> 00:00:04,800
is think about the origins of Algebra,

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,019
the origins of Algebra.

4
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:08,533
And the word

5
00:00:08,533 --> 00:00:10,667
especially an association with the ideas

6
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:12,733
that Algebra now represents.

7
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:15,689
comes from, comes from, this book

8
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:18,667
or actually this is a page of the book right over there.

9
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:20,800
The English translation for the title of this book is,

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,662
"The Compendious book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing."

11
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:28,800
And it was written by a Persian mathematician

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,969
who lived in Baghdad, in, in...

13
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:33,615
I believe it was in the 8th or 9th century

14
00:00:33,615 --> 00:00:35,800
I believe it was actually 820 A.D.

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,773
when he wrote this book.

16
00:00:37,773 --> 00:00:38,695
A.D.

17
00:00:38,695 --> 00:00:41,350
And Algebra is the Arabic word

18
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,509
that here is the actual title that he gave to it

19
00:00:43,509 --> 00:00:45,400
which is the Arabic title

20
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,467
"Algebra means restoration or completion"

21
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:55,084
restoration... restoration or completion... completion

22
00:00:55,084 --> 00:00:58,369
And he associated it in his book with a very specific operation,

23
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:01,667
really taking something from one side of an equation

24
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:03,501
to another side of an equation.

25
00:01:03,501 --> 00:01:06,586
But we can actually see it right over here. I don't know Arabic

26
00:01:06,586 --> 00:01:10,400
but I actually do know some languages that seem to have borrowed a little bit from Arabic

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,230
or maybe went the other way around.

28
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,941
But this says Al Kitab and

29
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:18,243
I know just enough Urdu or Hindi to understand a good Indian movie.

30
00:01:18,243 --> 00:01:20,130
But Al Kitab 'Kitab' means "book".

31
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,302
So this part is 'book'.

32
00:01:23,302 --> 00:01:27,163
Al-Muhktasar I think that means 'compendious'

33
00:01:27,163 --> 00:01:29,904
because I don't know the word for compendious and that seems like that.

34
00:01:29,904 --> 00:01:36,585
Fi Hisab, 'Hisab' means 'calculation' in Hindi or Urdu so this is calculation.

35
00:01:36,585 --> 00:01:38,738
Al-Gabr this is the root.

36
00:01:38,738 --> 00:01:41,021
This is the famous Algebra. This is where it shows up.

37
00:01:41,021 --> 00:01:43,533
So this is for 'completion'.

38
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:46,478
You can view that as completion...completion

39
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:49,715
and then Wa...Al-Muqabala

40
00:01:49,715 --> 00:01:52,467
that means essentially 'balancing'

41
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:55,631
completion and balancing.

42
00:01:55,631 --> 00:01:57,133
So if we wanted to translate it

43
00:01:57,133 --> 00:01:58,733
and I know this is not a video on translating Arabic.

44
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:01,947
but the book... the book

45
00:02:01,947 --> 00:02:10,624
I guess this is saying 'compendious on calculation by completion and balancing'

46
00:02:10,624 --> 00:02:12,564
is the rough translation over there.

47
00:02:12,564 --> 00:02:15,412
But that is the source of the word 'Algebra'.

48
00:02:15,412 --> 00:02:18,146
And this is a very very very important book.

49
00:02:18,146 --> 00:02:21,467
Not just because it was the first use of the word Algebra.

50
00:02:21,467 --> 00:02:25,000
But many people viewed this book as the first time

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
that Algebra took on many of its modern ideas,

52
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,533
ideas of balancing an equation,

53
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:36,533
the abstract problem itself,

54
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:38,995
not trying to do one-off problems here and there.

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,800
But Al-Khwārizmī was not the first person.

56
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
And just to get an idea of where all this is happening,

57
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
so he was hanging out in Baghdad.

58
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,200
So this is, and this part of the world shows up

59
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,667
a lot in the history of algebra.

60
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:53,133
But he was hanging out right there in around the 8th or 9th century.

61
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:56,160
So let me draw a little timeline here,

62
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,000
just so we can appreciate everything.

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,431
So that is... timeline.

64
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:05,133
And then whether or not you are religious,

65
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:09,159
most of our modern dates are dependent on the birth of Jesus.

66
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:11,796
So I will put, so that is right there.

67
00:03:11,796 --> 00:03:13,704
Maybe we'll put a cross over there

68
00:03:13,704 --> 00:03:15,462
to signify that, when we wanna be non-religious,

69
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:18,473
we say 'common era' 'before the common era';

70
00:03:18,473 --> 00:03:19,766
when we wanna be religious,

71
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:20,566
we say A.D.

72
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:22,164
which means 'the year of our lord'.

73
00:03:22,164 --> 00:03:25,333
Anno...I don't know the latin...'Anno Domini', I believe

74
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,434
'the year of our lord'

75
00:03:26,434 --> 00:03:28,950
And then when we want to ... in the religious context,

76
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,482
instead of saying 'before common era',

77
00:03:30,482 --> 00:03:32,433
we say 'Before Christ', B.C.

78
00:03:32,433 --> 00:03:36,133
But either way, either way, so this is 1000

79
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,533
in the common era.

80
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:39,667
This is 2000 in the common era.

81
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:41,652
And obviously we are sitting at least

82
00:03:41,652 --> 00:03:44,831
when I'm making this video, I'm sitting right about there.

83
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:48,733
And then... this is 1000 before the common era.

84
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:52,296
And this is 2000 before the common era.

85
00:03:52,296 --> 00:03:55,000
So the first traces, and I'm skipping out in

86
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,234
and really it's just what we can find.

87
00:03:56,234 --> 00:03:57,369
I'm sure if we were able to dig more.

88
00:03:57,369 --> 00:03:58,835
We might be able to find other evidence

89
00:03:58,835 --> 00:04:01,121
of different civilizations and different people,

90
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:04,569
stumbling on many of the ideas in Algebra.

91
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:06,311
But our first records of people

92
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:09,533
really exploring the ideas that are hit upon in Algebra

93
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:12,200
come from ancient Babylon,

94
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,906
around 2000 years before the common era,

95
00:04:14,906 --> 00:04:21,565
before Christ. So right around, right around there

96
00:04:21,565 --> 00:04:23,023
where there were stone tablets

97
00:04:23,023 --> 00:04:24,867
where it looks like people were exploring

98
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:26,253
some of the fundamental ideas of Algebra.

99
00:04:26,253 --> 00:04:27,669
They weren't using the same symbols.

100
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:31,133
They weren't using the same ways of representing the numbers.

101
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:33,200
But it was Algrebra they were working on

102
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,800
and that was once again in this part of the world.

103
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,733
Babylon was right about... right about there.

104
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:42,400
And Babylon has kind of kept the tradition of Sumeria.

105
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,400
This whole region was called Mesopotamia

106
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,186
-- Greek for 'between two rivers' --

107
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:49,733
But that's the first traces of people that we know of

108
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:51,744
that were people who were starting to do

109
00:04:51,744 --> 00:04:54,720
what we would call real real Algebra.

110
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,200
And then you fast forward

111
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,992
and I am sure even our historians don't know

112
00:04:58,992 --> 00:05:03,800
all the different instances of people using Algebra.

113
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,267
But kind of the major contributions to Algebra

114
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:11,533
we saw it here in Babylon 2000 years ago.

115
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:14,171
And then if we fast forward to about 200-300 A.D.,

116
00:05:14,171 --> 00:05:15,582
so right over there,

117
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:18,169
you have a Greek gentleman who lived in Alexanderia.

118
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:22,000
So this is Greece right over here, but he lived in Alexandria

119
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,041
which at the time was part of the Roman Empire.

120
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:28,000
So Alexandria is right over here.

121
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,432
And he was a gentleman by the name of

122
00:05:29,432 --> 00:05:32,041
Diophantus or Diaphantus

123
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,467
or I don't know how to pronounce it.

124
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:36,867
Dio... Diophantus.

125
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:40,244
and he is sometimes credited with being the father of Algebra.

126
00:05:40,244 --> 00:05:44,508
And it's debatable whether it's Diophantus or whether it's Al-Khwārizmī',

127
00:05:44,508 --> 00:05:48,531
Al-Khwārizmī' who kinda started using these these terms of balancing equations

128
00:05:48,533 --> 00:05:50,667
and talking about math in a pure way

129
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:53,548
while Diophantus was more focused on particular problems.

130
00:05:53,548 --> 00:05:57,032
And both of them were kind of beat to the punch by the Babylonians

131
00:05:57,032 --> 00:05:59,061
although they all did contribute in their own way.

132
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:01,361
It's not like they were just copying what the Babylonians did.

133
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,733
They had their own unique contributions

134
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:06,328
to what we now consider 'Algebra'.

135
00:06:06,328 --> 00:06:08,733
But many, especially western historians,

136
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:11,282
associate Diophantus as the father of Algebra.

137
00:06:11,282 --> 00:06:13,816
And now Al-Khwārizmī' is sometimes

138
00:06:13,816 --> 00:06:16,212
what other people would argue as the father of Algebra.

139
00:06:16,212 --> 00:06:18,352
So he made significant contributions.

140
00:06:18,352 --> 00:06:20,347
So if you go to about 600 A.D.

141
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,221
So if you go to about 600 A.D.

142
00:06:22,221 --> 00:06:26,067
another famous mathematician in the history of Algebra

143
00:06:26,067 --> 00:06:29,800
was Brahma Gupta in India

144
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,667
Brahma Gupta... in India.

145
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:34,692
So... obviously and actually I don't know

146
00:06:34,692 --> 00:06:36,431
where in India he lived. I should look that up.

147
00:06:36,431 --> 00:06:39,161
But it's roughly... roughly in that part of the world

148
00:06:39,161 --> 00:06:42,733
And he also made a significant contributions.

149
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:45,768
And then of course you have Al-Khwārizmī'

150
00:06:45,768 --> 00:06:48,667
who shows up right about there.

151
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:52,513
Al-Khwārizmī' and he's the gentleman

152
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:56,329
that definitely we credit with the name Algebra,

153
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:57,862
comes from Arabic for 'Restoration'

154
00:06:57,862 --> 00:07:01,841
and some people also consider him to be, if not the father of Algebra,

155
00:07:01,841 --> 00:07:04,118
although some say he is the father,

156
00:07:04,118 --> 00:07:05,892
he is one of the fathers of Algebra,

157
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:09,278
because he really started to think about Algebra in the abstract sense,

158
00:07:09,278 --> 00:07:11,025
devoid of some specific problems,

159
00:07:11,025 --> 00:07:12,492
and a lot of the ways

160
00:07:12,492 --> 00:07:16,800
that a modern mathematician would start to think about the field.
