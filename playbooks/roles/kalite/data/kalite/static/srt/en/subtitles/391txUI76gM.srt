1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660
   

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,590
We're now going to learn a
little bit about gravity.

3
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,590
And just so you know, gravity is
something that, especially

4
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:08,620
in introductory physics or
even reasonably advanced

5
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,600
physics, we can learn how to
calculate it, we can learn how

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,650
to realize what are the
important variables in it, but

7
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,050
it's something that's really
not well understood.

8
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,940
Even once you learn general
relativity, if you do get

9
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,880
there, I have to say, you can
kind of say, oh, well, it's

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,120
the warping of space time and
all of this, but it's hard to

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:31,190
get an intuition of why two
objects, just because they

12
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,690
have this thing called
mass, they are

13
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,640
attracted to each other.

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,170
It's really, at least to me,
a little bit mystical.

15
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:42,240
But with that said, let's learn
to deal with gravity.

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,140
And we'll do that learning
Newton's Law of Gravity, and

17
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,620
this works for most purposes.

18
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,640
So Newton's Law of Gravity says
that the force between

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,140
two masses, and that's the
gravitational force, is equal

20
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,990
to the gravitational constant G
times the mass of the first

21
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:03,500
object times the mass of the
second object divided by the

22
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,890
distance between the two
objects squared.

23
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:07,860
So that's simple enough.

24
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,320
So let's play around with this,
and see if we can get

25
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,490
some results that look
reasonably familiar to us.

26
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,120
So let's use this formula
to figure out what the

27
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,070
acceleration, the gravitational
acceleration, is

28
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,120
at the surface of the Earth.

29
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,130
So let's draw the Earth,
just so we know what

30
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,380
we're talking about.

31
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,830
   

32
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,630
So that's my Earth.

33
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,060
And let's say we want to figure
out the gravitational

34
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,260
acceleration on Sal.

35
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,510
That's me.

36
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:41,000
   

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,770
And so how do we apply this
equation to figure out how

38
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:49,490
much I'm accelerating down
towards the center of Earth or

39
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,950
the Earth's center of mass?

40
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,890
The force is equal to-- so
what's this big G thing?

41
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,010
The G is the universal
gravitational constant.

42
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,330
Although, as far as I know, and
I'm not an expert on this,

43
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:08,620
I actually think its measurement
can change.

44
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,390
It's not truly, truly a
constant, or I guess when on

45
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,840
different scales, it can be
a little bit different.

46
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,700
But for our purposes, it is a
constant, and the constant in

47
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,520
most physics classes, is this:
6.67 times 10 to the negative

48
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,546
11th meters cubed per kilogram
seconds squared.

49
00:02:24,546 --> 00:02:27,470
I know these units are crazy,
but all you have to realize is

50
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,005
these are just the units needed,
that when you multiply

51
00:02:30,005 --> 00:02:33,040
it times a mass and a mass
divided by a distance squared,

52
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,930
you get Newtons, or kilogram
meters per second squared.

53
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,360
So we won't worry so much about
the units right now.

54
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,610
Just realize that you're going
to have to work with meters in

55
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,420
kilograms seconds.

56
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,620
So let's just write
that number down.

57
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,440
I'll change colors to
keep it interesting.

58
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:55,080
6.67 times 10 to the negative
11th, and we want to know the

59
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,190
acceleration on Sal, so
m1 is the mass of Sal.

60
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,490
And I don't feel like revealing
my mass in this

61
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,240
video, so I'll just leave
it as a variable.

62
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,430
And then what's the mass 2?

63
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,950
It's the mass of Earth.

64
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:08,820
And I wrote that here.

65
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,250
I looked it up on Wikipedia.

66
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,410
This is the mass of Earth.

67
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,890
So I multiply it times the
mass of Earth, times 5.97

68
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,670
times 10 to the 24th kilograms--
weighs a little

69
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:25,700
bit, not weighs, is a little
bit more massive than Sal--

70
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,900
divided by the distance
squared.

71
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,420
Now, you might say, well, what's
the distance between

72
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,990
someone standing on the
Earth and the Earth?

73
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,080
Well, it's zero because they're
touching the Earth.

74
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,130
But it's important to realize
that the distance between the

75
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,570
two objects, especially when
we're talking about the

76
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,910
universal law of gravitation, is
the distance between their

77
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,310
center of masses.

78
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,290
For all general purposes, my
center of mass, maybe it's

79
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,610
like three feet above
the ground, because

80
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,500
I'm not that tall.

81
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,510
It's probably a little bit lower
than that, actually.

82
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,760
Anyway, my center of mass might
be three feet above the

83
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,380
ground, and where's Earth's
center of mass?

84
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,330
Well, it's at the center of
Earth, so we have to know the

85
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:59,800
radius of Earth, right?

86
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,120
So the radius of Earth is--
I also looked it up on

87
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,290
Wikipedia-- 6,371 kilometers.

88
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,490
How many meters is that?

89
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,100
It's 6 million meters, right?

90
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,470
And then, you know, the extra
meter to get to my center of

91
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,079
mass, we can ignore for now,
because it would be .001, so

92
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,970
we'll ignore that for now.

93
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,120
So it's 6-- and soon.

94
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,290
I'll write it in scientific
notation since everything else

95
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:25,230
is in scientific notation--
6.371 times 10 to the sixth

96
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:25,860
meters, right?

97
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,610
6,000 kilometers is
6 million meters.

98
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,660
So let's write that down.

99
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:37,580
So the distance is going
to be 6.37 times 10

100
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,470
to the sixth meters.

101
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,430
We have to square that.

102
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,560
Remember, it's distance
squared.

103
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,830
So let's see if we can simplify
this a little bit.

104
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:52,670
Let's just multiply those top
numbers first. Force is equal

105
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,910
to-- let's bring the
variable out.

106
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,550
Mass of Sal times-- let's
do this top part.

107
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:17,470
So we have 6.67 times 5.97
is equal to 39.82.

108
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,670
And I just multiplied this times
this, so now I have to

109
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,160
multiply the 10's.

110
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,590
So 10 to the negative 11th times
10 to the negative 24th.

111
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,065
We can just add the exponents.

112
00:05:25,065 --> 00:05:26,850
They have the same base.

113
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,360
So what's 24 minus 11?

114
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,030
It's 10 to the 13th, right?

115
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,610
And then what does the
denominator look like?

116
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,510
It's going to be the 6.37
squared times 10

117
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,270
to the sixth squared.

118
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,010
So it's going to be-- whatever
this is is going to be like 37

119
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:44,900
or something-- times-- what's
10 to the sixth squared?

120
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,650
It's 10 to the 12th, right?

121
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,120
10 to the 12th.

122
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,586
So let's figure out what
6.37 squared is.

123
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:56,434
This little calculator I have
doesn't have squared, so I

124
00:05:56,434 --> 00:06:09,650
have to-- so it's 40.58.

125
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,740
And so simplifying it, the force
is equal to the mass of

126
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:31,990
Sal times-- let's divide, 39.82
divided by 40.58 is

127
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:38,290
equal to 9.81.

128
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,130
That's just this divided
by this.

129
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:44,770
And then 10 to the 13th divided
by 10 to the 12th.

130
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,200
Actually no, this isn't 9.81.

131
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,150
Sorry, it's 0.981.

132
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,700
0.981, and then 10 to the 13th
divided by 10 to the 12th is

133
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,560
just 10, right?

134
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,160
10 to the first, times 10,
so what's 0.981 times 10?

135
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:03,710
Well, the force is equal to 9.81
times the mass of Sal.

136
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,550
And where does this get us?

137
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,780
How can we figure out the
acceleration right now?

138
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,220
Well, force is just mass times
acceleration, right?

139
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,800
So that's also going to just be
equal to the acceleration

140
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,790
of gravity-- that's supposed to
be a small g there-- times

141
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,310
the mass of Sal, right?

142
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:25,265
So we know the gravitational
force is 9.81 times the mass

143
00:07:25,265 --> 00:07:27,570
of Sal, and we also know that
that's the same thing as the

144
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,760
acceleration of gravity
times the mass of Sal.

145
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,840
We can divide both sides by the
mass of Sal, and we have

146
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,390
the acceleration of gravity.

147
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,820
And if we had used the units the
whole way, you would have

148
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,470
seen that it is kilograms meters
per second squared.

149
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,880
And we have just shown that, at
least based on the numbers

150
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,090
that they've given in Wikipedia,
the acceleration of

151
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,170
gravity on the surface of the
Earth is almost exactly what

152
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,450
we've been using in all the
projectile motion problems.

153
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:55,290
It's 9.8 meters per
second squared.

154
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,570
That's exciting.

155
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,830
So let's do another quick
problem with gravity, because

156
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,570
I've got two minutes.

157
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:06,390
Let's say there's another
planet called the

158
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,380
planet Small Earth.

159
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:15,760
And let's say the radius of
Small Earth is equal to 1/2

160
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,380
the radius of Earth and the mass
of Small Earth is equal

161
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,280
to 1/2 the mass of Earth.

162
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,750
So what's the pull of gravity
on any object, say same

163
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,170
object, on this?

164
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,880
How much smaller would
it be on this planet?

165
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,952
Well, actually let me save
that to the next video,

166
00:08:33,952 --> 00:08:34,789
because I hate being rushed.

167
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,500
So I'll see you

168
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:36,900
