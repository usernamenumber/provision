1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,040
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,460
So where we left off in the last video, I'd shown you

3
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,020
this thing called the geometric series.

4
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,810
And, you know, we could
have some base a.

5
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:08,620
It could be any number.

6
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,800
It could be 1/2,
it could be 10.

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,870
But that's just--
but some number.

8
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:15,770
And we keep taking it to
increasing exponents, and we

9
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,740
sum them up, and this is
called a geometric series.

10
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:23,810
And so I want to figure out the
sum of a geometric series of,

11
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,940
you know, when I have some base
a, and I go up to some

12
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,440
number a to the n.

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,520
What-- is this a to
the-- why did I write

14
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,690
a to n minus 2 there?

15
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:37,390
That should be a to the big N.

16
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,510
My brain must have been
malfunctioning in

17
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,930
the previous video.

18
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,520
That always happens when I
start running out of time.

19
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,740
But anyway.

20
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,490
Let's go back to this.

21
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:48,170
So I defined s as
this geometric sum.

22
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,160
Now I'm going to
define another sum.

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,170
And that sum I'm going
to define as a times s.

24
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:00,970
And that equals-- well, that's
just going to be a times

25
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:04,110
this exact sum, right?

26
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,540
And that's the same
a as this a, right?

27
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,400
That a is the same as this a.

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,620
So what's a times
this whole thing?

29
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,350
Well, it's the a times a
to the zero is-- let me

30
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,370
write it down for you.

31
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,610
So this'll be a because I just
distribute the a, right? a

32
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:25,460
times a to the zero, plus a
times a to the 1, plus a times

33
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,880
a squared, plus all the way a
times a to the n minus one,

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,260
plus a times a to the n.

35
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,260
I just took an a and I
distributed it along

36
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,540
this whole sum.

37
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,200
But what is this equal to?

38
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,810
Well, this is equal to
a times a to the zero.

39
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:51,220
That's a one-- a to the first
power-- plus a squared, plus a

40
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:55,420
cubed, plus a to the n, right?

41
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,770
Because you just add the
exponents, a to the n.

42
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,600
Plus a to the n plus 1.

43
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,800
So this is as.

44
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,450
And we saw before that s
is just our original sum.

45
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:16,950
That is just a to the zero,
plus a to the 1, plus a

46
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,380
squared, plus up, up, up, up.

47
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:26,120
All the way to plus
a to the n, right?

48
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,680
So let me ask you a question.

49
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,980
What happens if I
subtract this from that?

50
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,120
What happens?

51
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,840
If I say, as minus s.

52
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,980
Well, I subtracted this from
here, on the left hand side.

53
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,032
What happens on the
right hand side?

54
00:02:48,032 --> 00:02:50,120
Well, all of these
become negative, right?

55
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,770
Let me do it in a bold color.

56
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,240
This becomes-- because I'm
subtracting-- negative,

57
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,740
negative, these are
all negatives.

58
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,250
Negative.

59
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,480
Negative.

60
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,270
Well, a to the first,
minus a to the first.

61
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,735
That crosses out. a squared
minus a squared crosses

62
00:03:02,735 --> 00:03:04,530
out. a to the third,
it'll all cross out.

63
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,970
All the way up to a
to the n, right?

64
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:07,920
So what are we left with?

65
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,920
We're just left with minus
a to the zero, right?

66
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,600
We're just left with that term.

67
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,400
And we're just left
with that term.

68
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,225
Plus a to the n plus 1.

69
00:03:19,225 --> 00:03:20,800
And of course, what's
a to the zero?

70
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,240
That's just 1.

71
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:32,240
So we have a times s
minus s is equal to a to

72
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,110
the n plus 1 minus 1.

73
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,850
And now let's
distribute the s out.

74
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:44,180
So we get s times a minus
1 is equal to a to the n

75
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,950
plus 1 minus 1, right?

76
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,500
And then what do we get?

77
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,600
Well, we can just divide
both sides by a minus 1.

78
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,820
Let me erase some of
this stuff on top.

79
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:05,700
I think I can safely erase
all of this, really.

80
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,870
Well, I don't want
to erase that much.

81
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,240
I want to erase this stuff.

82
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,360
That's good enough.

83
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,890
OK.

84
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:24,150
So I have just-- dividing both
sides of this equation by a

85
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:31,520
minus 1, I get s is equal to a
to the n plus 1 minus

86
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,560
1 over a minus 1.

87
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,280
So where did that get us?

88
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,270
We defined the geometric
series as equal to the sum.

89
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:51,700
From k is equal to 0,
to n of a to the k.

90
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,170
And now we've just derived
a formula for what that

91
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,770
sum ends up being.

92
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:03,990
Equals a to the n plus 1
minus 1 over a minus 1.

93
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,600
And why is this useful?

94
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,940
We now know, if I were to say,
well, what is-- let me clean

95
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,490
up all of this, as well.

96
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:17,400
Let me clean up all of
this and we can-- OK.

97
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,260
So if I said, you figure out
the sum of, I don't know, the

98
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:28,277
powers of 3 up to 3 to the, I
don't know, 3 to

99
00:05:28,277 --> 00:05:29,550
the tenth power.

100
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,760
So, you know, 3.

101
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,170
So 3 to the zero, plus 3 to the
one, plus 3 squared, plus all

102
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,280
the way to 3 to the tenth.

103
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,800
So this is the same thing as
the sum of k equals zero

104
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,660
to 10, of 3 to the k.

105
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,520
Right?

106
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,080
So this formula we just figured
out, a is 3 and n is 10.

107
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,620
So this sum is just going to be
equal to 3 to the eleventh

108
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:05,480
power minus 1 over 3 minus 1.

109
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,140
Which equals-- well, I
don't know what 3 to

110
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,420
the eleventh power is.

111
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,350
Minus 1 over 2.

112
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,130
So that's kind of useful.

113
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,050
That is a number.

114
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,460
Although you'd have to memorize
your exponent tables to the

115
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,550
eleventh power to do that.

116
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,880
But I think you get the idea.

117
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,710
This is especially useful if we
were dealing with-- well, if

118
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:27,000
the base was a power of ten,
it would be very, very easy.

119
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,260
But what I actually want to do
now is I want to take this and

120
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,510
say, well, what happens
if n goes to infinity?

121
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,270
Let me show you.

122
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,440
So what happens?

123
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,350
So there's two types of series
that we can take-- that's

124
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,750
not what I wanted to do.

125
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,250
There are two types of series
that we can take that we

126
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,450
can find the sums of.

127
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:51,220
There's finite series,
and infinite series.

128
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:56,310
And in order for an infinite
series to come up to a sum

129
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,950
that's not infinity, they
need to-- what we say--

130
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,150
they need to converge.

131
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,870
And if you think about what has
to happen for them to converge,

132
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,520
every next digit has to
essentially get smaller and

133
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,260
smaller and smaller, as
we go towards infinity.

134
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,910
So let's say that
a is a fraction.

135
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:13,700
a is 1/2.

136
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,870
So how does a geometric series
look like if we have 1/2 there?

137
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,650
So let's say that we're taking
the geometric series from k

138
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,910
is equal to 0 to infinity.

139
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,160
So this is neat.

140
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,890
We're going to take an infinite
sum, an infinite number of

141
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:34,380
terms, and let's see if we can
actually get an actual number.

142
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,950
You know, we take an infinite
thing, add it up, and it

143
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,200
actually adds up to
a finite thing.

144
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,990
This has always amazed me.

145
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:43,130
And the base now is
going to be 1/2.

146
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,410
It's 1/2 and it's going to
be 1/2 to the k power.

147
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:45,770
So this is going to be what?

148
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:50,220
1/2 to the zero, plus 1/2,
plus-- what's 1/2 squared?

149
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,860
Plus 1/4, plus 1/8, plus 1/16.

150
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:59,680
So as you see, each term is
getting a lot, lot smaller.

151
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,900
It's getting half of
the previous term.

152
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,800
Well, let's say, what happens
if this wasn't infinity?

153
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,880
What happens if this was n?

154
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,480
Well, then we'd get plus 1
over 2 to the n, right?

155
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,140
1/2 to the n is the same
thing as 1 over 2 to the n.

156
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,080
And if we look at the formula
we figured out, we would say,

157
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:26,340
well, that is just equal to
1/2 to the n plus 1, minus

158
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:32,960
1, over 1/2 minus one.

159
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,850
And that would be our answer.

160
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,550
We'd have to know what n is.

161
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,280
But now we want to know what
happens if we go to infinity.

162
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,140
So this is essentially
a limit problem.

163
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:45,740
What happens-- what's the
limit, as n goes to infinity,

164
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:52,980
of 1/2 to the n plus one
minus 1 over 1/2 minus 1?

165
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,330
Well, all of these are constant
terms, so nothing happens.

166
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,140
So what happens as this term,
right here, goes to infinity?

167
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,220
What's 1/2 to the
infinity power?

168
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,000
Well, that's zero.

169
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,590
That's an unbelievably
small number.

170
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:08,790
Take 1/2 to arbitrarily large
exponents, this just goes to 0.

171
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,270
And so what are we left with?

172
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:16,060
We're just left with this
equals minus 1 over 1/2 minus

173
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,275
1, or we could multiply the top
and the bottom by negative 1.

174
00:09:19,275 --> 00:09:22,212
And we get 1 over 1 minus 1/2.

175
00:09:22,212 --> 00:09:27,320
Which equals 1 over 1/2,
which is equal to 2.

176
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,810
I find that amazing.

177
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:34,090
If I add 0 plus 1/2 plus 1/4
plus 1/8 plus 1/16 and I never

178
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:37,410
stop-- I go to infinity-- and
not infinity, but I go to 1

179
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,330
over essentially 2 to the
infinity-- I end up with

180
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,080
this neat and clean number.

181
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,530
2.

182
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,350
And this might be a little
project for you, to actually

183
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,070
draw it out into like maybe a
pie and see what happens as

184
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,310
you keep adding smaller and
smaller pieces to the pie.

185
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,550
But it never ceases to amaze
me, that I added an infinite

186
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,520
number of terms, right?

187
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,390
This was infinity.

188
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,530
And I got a finite number.

189
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,930
I got a finite number.

190
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,630
Anyway, we ran out of time.

191
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,132
See you soon.
