1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710
   

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,820
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:04,820
In the last presentation I
showed you that if I had the

4
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:13,530
function f of x is equal to x
squared, that the derivative of

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,980
this function, which is denoted
by f-- look at that, my pen

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,835
is already malfunctioning.

7
00:00:19,835 --> 00:00:26,190
The derivative of that
function, f prime of

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,770
x, is equal to 2x.

9
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,050
And I used the limit
definition of a derivative.

10
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,375
I used, let me write
it down here.

11
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:38,020
   

12
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,540
This pen is horrible.

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,520
I need to really figure out
some other tool to use.

14
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,160
The limit as h approaches 0 --
sometimes you'll see delta x

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,440
instead of h, but it's the same
thing-- of f of x plus

16
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,900
h minus f of x over h.

17
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,890
And I used this definition of a
derivative, which is really

18
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,860
just the slope at any given
point along the curve,

19
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:04,670
to figure this out.

20
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,940
That if f of x is equal
to x squared, that

21
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,970
the derivative is 2x.

22
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,360
And you could actually
use this to do others.

23
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,940
And I won't do it now,
maybe I'll do it in a

24
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:13,710
future presentation.

25
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:21,176
But it turns out that if you
have f of x is equal to x to

26
00:01:21,176 --> 00:01:26,630
the third, that the derivative
is f prime of x is

27
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:32,700
equal to 3x squared.

28
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:39,310
If f of x is equal to x to
the fourth, well then the

29
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:46,550
derivative is equal
to 4x to the third.

30
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,840
I think you're starting
to see a pattern here.

31
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,812
If I actually wrote up here
that if f of x -- let me see

32
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:55,080
if I have space to
write it neatly.

33
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,510
If I wrote f of x -- I hope
you can see this -- f

34
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,340
of x is equal to x.

35
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,000
Well you know this.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,270
I mean, y equals x, what's
the slope of y equals x?

37
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,600
That's just 1, right?

38
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,330
y equals x, that's
a slope of 1.

39
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,820
You didn't need to know
calculus to know that.

40
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,870
f prime of x is
just equal to 1.

41
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,270
And then you can probably
guess what the next one is.

42
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:23,760
If f of x is equal to x to the
fifth, then the derivative is--

43
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,230
I think you could guess--
5 x to the fourth.

44
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:34,730
So in general, for any
expression within a polynomial,

45
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:42,090
or any degree x to whatever
power-- let's say f of x is

46
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:47,000
equal to-- this pen
drives me nuts.

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,380
f of x is equal to
x to the n, right?

48
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,650
Where n could be any exponent.

49
00:02:52,650 --> 00:03:02,430
Then f prime of x is equal
to nx to the n minus 1.

50
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,160
And you see this is what
the case was in all

51
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,700
these situations.

52
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,620
That 1 didn't show up.

53
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,730
n minus 1.

54
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,110
So if n was 25, x to the
25th power, the derivative

55
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,110
would be 25 x to the 24th.

56
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,826
So I'm going to use this rule
and then I'm going to show

57
00:03:18,826 --> 00:03:19,690
you a couple of other ones.

58
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,920
And then now we can figure out
the derivative of pretty much

59
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,270
any polynomial function.

60
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,400
   

61
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,690
So just another
couple of rules.

62
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,180
This might be a little
intuitive for you, and if you

63
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,830
use that limit definition of a
derivative, you could

64
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,630
actually prove it.

65
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:42,170
But if I want to figure out the
derivative of, let's say, the

66
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:51,200
derivative of-- So another way
of-- this is kind of, what is

67
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,730
the change with respect to x?

68
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,620
This is another notation.

69
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,530
I think this is what Leibniz
uses to figure out the

70
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,400
derivative operator.

71
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:08,855
So if I wanted to find the
derivative of A f of x, where A

72
00:04:08,855 --> 00:04:09,910
is just some constant number.

73
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,660
It could be 5 times f of x.

74
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,850
This is the same thing
as saying A times the

75
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:21,460
derivative of f of x.

76
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,400
And what does that tell us?

77
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,880
Well, this tells us that,
let's say I had f of x.

78
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,180
f of x is equal to-- and this
only works with the constants--

79
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,680
f of x is equal to 5x squared.

80
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,460
Right?

81
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,590
Well this is the same thing
as 5 times x squared.

82
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,070
I know I'm stating the obvious.

83
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,510
So we can just say that the
derivative of this is just 5

84
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,970
times the derivative
of x squared.

85
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:53,690
So f prime of x is equal to
5 times, and what's the

86
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,170
derivative of x squared?

87
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,260
Right, it's 2x.

88
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,300
So it equals 10x.

89
00:04:59,300 --> 00:04:59,970
Right?

90
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,700
Similarly, let's say I
had g of x, just using

91
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,910
a different letter.

92
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:08,000
g of x is equal to-- and my
pen keeps malfunctioning.

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:18,090
g of x is equal to, let's
say, 3x to the 12th.

94
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:23,530
Then g prime of x, or the
derivative of g, is equal

95
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,490
to 3 times the derivative
of x to the 12th.

96
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,450
Well we know what that is.

97
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:33,540
It's 12 x to the 11th.

98
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,800
Which you would have seen.

99
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,680
12x to the 11th.

100
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,180
This equals 36x to the 11th.

101
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,190
Pretty straightforward, right?

102
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,540
You just multiply the
constant times whatever the

103
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,250
derivative would have been.

104
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,450
I think you get that.

105
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,050
Now one other thing.

106
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,930
If I wanted to apply the
derivative operator-- let me

107
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,330
change colors just to mix
things up a little bit.

108
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,450
Let's say if I wanted to apply
the derivative of operator-- I

109
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,650
think this is called
the addition rule.

110
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,650
It might be a little
bit obvious.

111
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:13,020
f of x plus g of x.

112
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,910
   

113
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:26,060
This is the same thing as the
derivative of f of x plus

114
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,110
the derivative3 of g of x.

115
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,640
That might seem a little
complicated to you, but all

116
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,290
it's saying is that you can
find the derivative of each of

117
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,920
the parts when you're adding
up, and then that's the

118
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,860
derivative of the whole thing.

119
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,570
I'll do a couple of examples.

120
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,230
So what does this tell us?

121
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,910
This is also the same
thing, of course.

122
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,630
This is, I believe,
Leibniz's notation.

123
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:50,000
And then Lagrange's notation
is-- of course these were the

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,530
founding fathers of calculus.

125
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:57,335
That's the same thing as f
prime of x plus g prime of x.

126
00:06:57,335 --> 00:06:59,910
And let me apply this, because
whenever you apply it, I think

127
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,140
it starts to seem a
lot more obvious.

128
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:19,500
So let's say f of x is equal
to 3x squared plus 5x plus 3.

129
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,080
Well, if we just want to figure
out the derivative, we say f

130
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,445
prime of x, we just find the
derivative of each

131
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,080
of these terms.

132
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,070
Well, this is 3 times the
derivative of x squared.

133
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,200
The derivative of x squared,
we already figured

134
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,930
out, is 2x, right?

135
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,230
So this becomes 6x.

136
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,140
Really you just take the 2,
multiply it by the 3, and

137
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,580
then decrement the 2 by 1.

138
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,120
So it's really 6x to the first,
which is the same thing as 6x.

139
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,182
Plus the derivative of 5x is 5.

140
00:07:45,182 --> 00:07:48,440
And you know that because if I
just had a line that's y equals

141
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,920
5x, the slope is 5, right?

142
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,950
Plus, what's the derivative
of a constant function?

143
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,410
What's the derivative of 3?

144
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,410
Well, I'll give you a hint.

145
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,950
Graph y equals 3 and tell
me what the slope is.

146
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:05,240
Right, the derivative
of a constant is 0.

147
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,230
I'll show other times why that
might be more intuitive.

148
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,500
Plus 0.

149
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,720
You can just ignore that.

150
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,770
f prime of x is
equal to 6x plus 5.

151
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:14,480
Let's do some more.

152
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,260
   

153
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,510
I think the more examples
we do, the better.

154
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:24,470
   

155
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,790
And I want to keep switching
notations, so you don't get

156
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,340
daunted whenever you see
it in a different way.

157
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:39,540
Let's say y equals 10x to
the fifth minus 7x to the

158
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:46,350
third plus 4x plus 1.

159
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,920
So here we're going to apply
the derivative operator.

160
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:55,760
So we say dy-- this
is I think Leibniz's

161
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,040
notation-- dy over dx.

162
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,170
And that's just the change
in y over the change in x,

163
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,960
over very small changes.

164
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,040
That's kind of how I view this
d, like a very small delta.

165
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:17,500
Is equal to 5 times 10 is 50
x to the fourth minus 21 --

166
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:24,530
right, 3 times 7--
x squared plus 4.

167
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,160
And then the 1, the
derivative of 1 is just 0.

168
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:27,650
So there it is.

169
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,340
We figured out the
derivative of this very

170
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,210
complicated function.

171
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,510
And it was pretty
straightforward.

172
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,050
I think you'll find that
derivatives of polynomials are

173
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,570
actually more straightforward
than a lot of concepts that you

174
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,170
learned a lot earlier
in mathematics.

175
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,160
That's all the time I have
now for this presentation.

176
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,820
In the next couple I'll just do
a bunch of more examples, and

177
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,100
I'll show you some more rules
for solving even more

178
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,175
complicated derivatives.

179
00:09:47,175 --> 00:09:49,300
See you in the next
presentation.

180
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:49,500
