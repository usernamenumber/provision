1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,550
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:03,810
I tried to start doing problem number 10 in the last video,

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,840
but I realized I was running out of time,so let me start over

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,360
Problem number 10.

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,970
The Smith Metals Company old machine makes 300 bolts per hour

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,050
Its new machine makes 450 bolts per hour.

7
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,860
If both machines begin running at the same time,

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,960
how many minutes will it take the two machines

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,460
to make a total of 900 bolts?

10
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,920
So the important thing to realize is that they said minutes.

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,790
So we could convert both of these rates to minutes now,

12
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,610
or we could say how many hours is it going to take,

13
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,660
and then convert that to minutes after we have our answer.

14
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,700
Actually, let's do it the second way,

15
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,840
let's say how many hours and then convert that to minutes.

16
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:55,500
So let's say we want to produce 900 bolts.

17
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,460
And how much are we going to produce in each hour?

18
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,500
Well, they're both running at the same time, right?

19
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:08,950
So in every hour, we're going to produce 300 plus 450 bolts.

20
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,950
We're going to produce 750 bolts per hour.

21
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,740
Times, let's say x hours.

22
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,850
The units might confuse you, so just leave out the units.

23
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,330
This is how many hours it takes to produce 900 bolts,

24
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,520
so you divide both sides by 750.

25
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,850
You get x is equal to 900/750.

26
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:37,910
Let's see what I can do here.

27
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:42,440
See, if I divide the top and the bottom by 30,

28
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:50,800
the top will become 30 over-- and then the bottom,

29
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:59,990
75 divided by 3 is 20-- 75 divided by 3 is 25. So 30/25.

30
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,000
Then I could-- let's see, 5 is a common factor.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,150
I can do it all in one fell swoop. So that's 6/5.

32
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,790
So it's going to take 6/5 hours.

33
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,830
That's how long it's going to take us.

34
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,160
How many minutes is that? Every hour is 1 minute--

35
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,380
I mean, sorry, every hour is 60 minutes. It's getting late.

36
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:22,560
So 6/5 hours. You just have to multiply it by 60

37
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,490
to get how many minutes is equal to--

38
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,040
see, you can cancel this 5, make this a 12.

39
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:36,270
You get 6 times 12 is 72 minutes. And that is choice B.

40
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,970
Next problem.

41
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,450
I've been using this yellow a while, let me switch.

42
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,290
Problem 11.

43
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,740
The table above gives the values of the linear function g

44
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:54,270
for selected values of t. Which of the following defines g?

45
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:59,950
OK, so they say t and they say g of t.

46
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:08,230
They go from negative 1, 0, 1, 2, let's see,

47
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:15,900
it's 4, 2, 0, minus 2.

48
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,040
So the one thing I always look at is what g of 0 is because

49
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,240
that tends to be interesting.

50
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,740
Especially when I look at all of the choices.

51
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,300
All of the choices are of this form,

52
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,220
they're all of the form m times t plus B.

53
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,330
Where m is the slope--

54
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,920
if you're familiar with linear equations,

55
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,650
you're familiar with this form. And so when t equals 0,

56
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,590
g of t tells you what the y-intercept is going to be, right?

57
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:41,840
So let's see, g of 0 is equal to 2.

58
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:46,620
So that tells us that this equation g of t is going to be

59
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,810
equal to the slope times t plus 2, right?

60
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,400
Because when t was 0, all we had left with was 2.

61
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,640
And so immediately, we can cancel out all

62
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,310
but the last two choices. So the last two choices,

63
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,300
choice D is g of t is equal to minus t plus 2.

64
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,160
And then the last choice is g of t is equal to

65
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,990
minus 2t plus 2. Let's see which one of these works,

66
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,120
we can try out some numbers.

67
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,690
So what happens when t is negative 1? When t is negative 1,

68
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:26,090
this expression becomes negative 1 times negative.

69
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,800
Negative negative 1 is positive 1, so this becomes 3.

70
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,430
That's not right.

71
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:35,060
This one becomes negative 2 times negative 1 is positive 2,

72
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,780
plus 2. So this becomes 4.

73
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,350
So we can immediately cancel this one out because it didn't--

74
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:46,140
here, for this g of t, g of negative 1 equaled 3,

75
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,970
and they tell us right here it's supposed to equal 4.

76
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:48,850
This one worked.

77
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,340
And this is kind of the only one that still works.

78
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,910
It had a 2 for the y-intercept,

79
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,550
and when you evaluate it for just even the first point,

80
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,690
you got the right answer.

81
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,570
So that's the answer, the answer is E.

82
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,050
Next problem.

83
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,200
OK, survey results. I guess I should draw this.

84
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,020
I haven't read the question, but it's probably important.

85
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,450
Let's see, there's about five squares that way.

86
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:32,080
So that means I have to draw four lines, that's 1, 2, 3, 4.

87
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:37,440
And then eight lines I have to draw. 1--

88
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,880
that's always the hardest part, just drawing these diagrams--

89
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:55,750
2, 3, 4-- and you're learning how to count-- 5, 6, 7--

90
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:00,140
almost there-- and 8. All righty.

91
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:04,300
And then they say, these are the grades-- the y-axis is grade.

92
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:09,210
Grade 9, 10, 11, 12.

93
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,700
The x-axis is distance to school in miles.

94
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:17,540
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. And these are the points.

95
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,640
5-- they have one point at 11.

96
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:46,740
6 has three points right here, 10, 11, and 12. Let's see.

97
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,990
There's a point here, here, here.

98
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,960
And then a point here and here. Now we can start the problem.

99
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,940
The results of a survey of 16 students

100
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,650
at Thompson High School are given in the grid above.

101
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:03,350
It shows the distance to the nearest mile that students

102
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,050
at various grade levels travel to school.

103
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,540
So this is miles. And this is grade.

104
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,330
According to the grid, which of the following is true?

105
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,560
So I'll just read them out.

106
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,250
A, there's only one student who travels two miles to school.

107
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,690
Let's see, two miles. False, there's two students.

108
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:25,330
There is this guy and this guy. So it's not A.

109
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,580
Choice B, half of the students travel less than

110
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:32,310
four miles to school. So that's--

111
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,910
less than four miles is everyone to the left of this line,

112
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:38,020
right? And this is actually 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

113
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:42,860
5 out of 16 is not half, so we know it's not choice B.

114
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:47,870
C, more 12th graders than 11th graders travel six miles or

115
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,100
more to school.

116
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:54,110
So they're saying more 12th graders than 11th graders.

117
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:58,000
So six miles or more. So let's see,

118
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,170
six miles or more is anything to the right of this line,

119
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,610
right? That's six miles or more.

120
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,860
There are three 12th graders.

121
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,420
And how many 11th graders are there?

122
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:14,480
There are two 11th graders. I think that is correct.

123
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,890
More 12th graders than 11th graders travel six

124
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,890
or more miles to school. Six or more miles,

125
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,800
three 12th graders, two 11th graders.

126
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:30,900
That's our answer, our answer is C. Next problem.

127
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,790
I don't know if I'll have time for this one, I'll try.

128
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,640
Problem 13.

129
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,590
How many positive three digit integers have the hundreds

130
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:47,990
digit equal to 3 and the units digit is equal to 4.

131
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,930
So it's going to be like 3 blank 4.

132
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,140
So how many numbers are here?

133
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:57,640
Well, how many digits can we stick in for that?

134
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:03,900
Well, we could put a 0, a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 there.

135
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,820
We could put any of those in that middle spot.

136
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,190
And there are 10 digits we can put there,

137
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,340
so there are 10 possibilities.

138
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,580
There are 10 positive three digit integers that have the

139
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,850
hundreds digit equal to 3 and the units digit equal to 4.

140
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,130
That's choice A.

141
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,910
That's one of those problems that you question yourself

142
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,670
because it seems maybe even too easy.

143
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,630
I'll see you in the next video.
