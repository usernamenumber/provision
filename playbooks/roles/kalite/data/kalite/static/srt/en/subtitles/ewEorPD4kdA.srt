1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
   

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,820
Let's do some problems with
the distributive property.

3
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,750
And the distributive property
just essentially reminds us

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,620
that if we have, let's say, a
times b plus c, and then we

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,570
need to multiply a times this,
we have to multiply a times

6
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:15,870
both of these numbers.

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:21,300
So this is going to be equal to
a times b plus a times c.

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,500
It will not be just a
times b then plus c.

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,690
And that makes complete sense.

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:28,490
Let me give you an example.

11
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:33,450
If I had said 5 times 3 plus
7, now, if you were to work

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,380
this out using order of
operations, you'd say, this is

13
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,252
5 times 10.

14
00:00:37,252 --> 00:00:42,840
So you'd say, this is 5 times
10, which is equal to 50.

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,470
And we know that that's
the right answer.

16
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,870
Now, use the distributive
property, that tells us that

17
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:52,590
this is going to be equal to 5
times 3, which is 15, plus 5

18
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,680
times 7, which is 35.

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,370
And 15 plus 35 is
definitely 50.

20
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,950
If you only multiplied the 5
times the 3, you'd have 15,

21
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,370
and then plus the seven, you'd
get the wrong answer.

22
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,320
You're multiplying 5 times
these things, you have to

23
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,410
multiply 5 times both
of these things.

24
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,610
Because you're multiplying
the sum of these guys.

25
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,370
Anyway.

26
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:16,260
Let's just apply that to a
sampling of these problems.

27
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,040
Let's do A.

28
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,050
So we have 1/2 times
x minus y minus 4.

29
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,270
Well, we multiply 1/2
times both of these.

30
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:30,480
So it's going to be 1/2
x minus 1/2 y minus

31
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,240
4, and we're done.

32
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,540
Let's do C.

33
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:41,330
We have 6 plus x
minus 5 plus 7.

34
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,850
Well, here there's actually
no distributive

35
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:43,940
property to even do.

36
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,800
We can actually just remove
the parentheses.

37
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:51,010
6 plus this thing, that's the
same thing as 6 plus x plus

38
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,610
negative 5 plus 7.

39
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,610
Or you could view this
as 6 plus-- So this

40
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,360
right here is 2, right?

41
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,190
Negative 5 plus 7 is 2,
2 plus 6 is 8, so it

42
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,730
becomes 8 plus x.

43
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:05,450
All right.

44
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,010
Not too bad.

45
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:07,760
That was C.

46
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,970
Let's do E.

47
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:21,140
We have 4 times m plus 7 minus
6 times 4 minus m.

48
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,360
Let's do the distributive
property.

49
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:28,200
4 times m is 4m plus
4 times 7 is 28.

50
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,330
And then we could
do it two ways.

51
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,850
Let's do it this way first.
So we could have minus

52
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,580
6 times 4 is 24.

53
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,030
6 times negative
m is minus 6m.

54
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,930
And notice, I could have just
said, times negative 6, and

55
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,550
have a plus here, but I'm
doing it in two steps.

56
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,350
I'm doing the 6 first, and then
I'll do the negative 1.

57
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:55,520
And so this is going to be
4m plus 28, and then you

58
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,760
distribute the negative sign.

59
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,600
You can view this as a negative
1 times all of this.

60
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,630
So negative 1 times
24 is minus 24.

61
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:06,620
Negative 1 times minus
6m is plus 6m.

62
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:12,920
Now you add the m terms.
4m plus 6m is 10m.

63
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,200
And then add the constant terms.
28 minus 24, that is

64
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,580
equal to plus 4.

65
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,200
Let's go down here.

66
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,610
Use the distributive property
to simplify

67
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,730
the following fractions.

68
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,400
So I'll do every other
one again.

69
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:36,520
So the first one is, a
is 8x plus 12 over 4.

70
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,870
So the reason why they're
saying the distributive

71
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,150
property, you're essentially
saying, let's divide this

72
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,980
whole thing by 4.

73
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,590
And to divide the whole thing by
4, you have to divide each

74
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,440
of the things by 4.

75
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,790
You could even view this as,
this is the same thing as

76
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,440
multiplying 1/4 times
8x plus 12.

77
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,620
These two things
are equivalent.

78
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,680
Here you're dividing each
by 4, here you're

79
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,340
multiplying each by 4.

80
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:02,060
If you did it this way, this is
the same thing as 8x over 4

81
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,810
plus 12 over 4.

82
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,130
You're kind of doing a adding
fractions problem in reverse.

83
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,680
And then this 8 divided
by 4 is going to be,

84
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,360
this'll be 2x plus 3.

85
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,600
That's one way to do it.

86
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,580
Or you could do it this way.

87
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:22,810
1/4 times 8x is 2x, plus
1/4 times 12 is 3.

88
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,960
Either way, we got
the same answer.

89
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,050
C.

90
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,300
We have 11x plus 12 over 2.

91
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,050
Just like here.

92
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,895
We could say, this is the same
thing as 11-- We could write

93
00:04:37,895 --> 00:04:40,480
it as 11 over 2x, if we like.

94
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,950
Or 11x over 2, either way.

95
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:47,620
Plus 12 over 2 plus 6.

96
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,360
And let's just do one more.

97
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,140
E.

98
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:52,810
This looks interesting.

99
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:56,570
We have a negative out in front,
and then we have a 6z

100
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,650
minus 2 over 3.

101
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,140
So one way we can view this,
this is the same thing, this

102
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:09,190
is equal to, negative 1/3
times 6z minus 2.

103
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:13,070
These two things
are equivalent.

104
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:13,340
Right?

105
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,550
This is a negative 1/3.

106
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,650
You could imagine a
1 right out here.

107
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:16,830
Right?

108
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,610
Negative 1/3 times 6z minus 2.

109
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,210
And then you just do the
distributive property.

110
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:28,280
Negative 1/3 times 6z is
going to be minus 2z.

111
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,090
And then negative 1/3 times
negative 2, negatives cancel

112
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:35,530
out, you get plus 2/3.

113
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,180
And you are done.

114
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:38,400
