99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We have now thought a lot about the orange juice market and least firm specific level we see

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in the last week videos we talked about.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what are average total cost and average bearable cost and marginal cost.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or if we are running orange juice making business.Now lets think about what happens

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
at the market level.So we are gonna go back to some of what we thought about in the past

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in terms of supply and demand curves.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is orange juice market and lets just draw some supply and demand curve right over here.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is going to be the price per gallon and lets say this right over here is 1$.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This right over here is 50 cents.and this is 0.and let's say that this is the quantity in gallons per week.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we are going to talk about the entire orange juice market so this is going to be

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
millions of gallons per week.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and that is let's say this is 1,2,3,4,5 and 6.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and let's just say and I am gonna simplified relative to what we saw in the last video

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's just say that the supply curve for the orange juice market careful this time

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this is the near term supply curve or the short term supply curve looks like looks

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
something like this.This is the supply curve .This is the entire market .These are all orange juice producers.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So get to make them produce even that first gallon and looks like we need about

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
20 cents for that first gallon and then each incremental gallon we need more and more money.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The marginal cost for that incremental gallon for the market as whole is going higher and higher

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we have to get orange juice further away and transport them further and further

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so this right over here is supply curve or you can view it as marginal cost.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now let's draw an arbitrary demand curve here so the demand curve let's say it looks something like this.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Say that's our current demand.Now I am going to add to this price at which firms or the

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
suppliers of the orange juice make our neutral with our terms to our economic profit.

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Or when our economic profit is equal to 0.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So let's say right over here which happens to be current equilibrium price.

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is the price 50cents per gallon.This is the price at which economic profit is zero.

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So I just write economic profit=0.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And I want to remind you economic profit being zero does that mean the accounting profit is zero.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
People could be making money at this price it just say that there is neutral whether or not they should be
