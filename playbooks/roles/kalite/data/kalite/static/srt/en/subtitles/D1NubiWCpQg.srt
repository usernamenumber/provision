1
00:00:00,195 --> 00:00:01,589
Now that we know a little bit about

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:02,525
Newton's First Law.

3
00:00:02,525 --> 00:00:04,230
Let's give ourselves a little quiz.

4
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,924
What I want you to do, is figure out which of

5
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:10,410
these statements, are actually true.

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,757
Our first statement is:

7
00:00:11,757 --> 00:00:18,671
"If the net force on a body is zero, its velocity will not change."

8
00:00:18,671 --> 00:00:20,106
Interesting.

9
00:00:20,106 --> 00:00:21,821
Statement number two:

10
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:27,756
"An unbalanced force on a body will always impact the object's speed."

11
00:00:27,756 --> 00:00:29,604
Also an interesting statement.

12
00:00:29,604 --> 00:00:31,421
Statement number three:

13
00:00:31,421 --> 00:00:39,224
"The reason why initially moving objects tend to come to rest in our everyday life is because they are being acted on by

14
00:00:39,224 --> 00:00:41,634
unbalanced forces."

15
00:00:41,634 --> 00:00:43,134
And statement four:

16
00:00:43,134 --> 00:00:49,720
"An unbalanced force on an object will always change the object's direction."

17
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,515
So I'll let you think about that...

18
00:00:56,269 --> 00:00:59,519
So let's think about these statement by statement.

19
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:05,407
Our first statement right over here "If the net force on a body is zero, its velocity will not change."

20
00:01:05,407 --> 00:01:12,824
This is absolutely true. This is actually another way of rephrasing Newton's First Law.

21
00:01:12,824 --> 00:01:20,021
If I have some type of object that's just travelling through space with some velocity.

22
00:01:20,021 --> 00:01:22,557
So it has some speed going in some direction.

23
00:01:22,557 --> 00:01:25,140
And maybe it's "deep space" and we can just for purity assume

24
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,125
that there's no gravitational interaction, there will always be some minuscule one.

25
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:33,354
But we'll assume no gravitational interaction, absolutely no particles that it's bumping into.

26
00:01:33,354 --> 00:01:38,074
Absolute vacuum-less space, this thing will travel on forever.

27
00:01:38,074 --> 00:01:43,332
Its velocity will not change, neither its speed nor its direction, will change.

28
00:01:43,332 --> 00:01:46,066
So this one is absolutely true.

29
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:54,903
Statement number two "an unbalanced force on a body will always impact the object's speed". The key word

30
00:01:54,903 --> 00:01:57,005
right over here is speed.

31
00:01:57,005 --> 00:02:01,471
If I had written "impact the object's velocity", then this would be a true statement.

32
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:07,650
"An unbalanced force on a body will always impact the object's velocity." That would be true

33
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:13,240
but we wrote speed here. Speed is the magnitude of velocity. It doesn't take into account the direction.

34
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,971
And to see why the second statement is false, you can think about a couple of things.

35
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:23,444
We'll do more videos on intuition of centripetal acceleration and centripetal forces, inward forces,

36
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:27,550
if this does not make complete intuitive sense for you at this moment.

37
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:31,000
But imagine we're looking at an ice skating rink from above.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,290
And there is an ice skater, this is the ice skater's head.

39
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,936
And they're travelling in that direction.

40
00:02:36,936 --> 00:02:42,938
Now imagine, right at that moment they grab a rope that is nailed to a stake in the ice skating rink.

41
00:02:42,938 --> 00:02:46,974
We're viewing all of this from above, and this right over here is the rope.

42
00:02:46,974 --> 00:02:49,035
Now what is going to happen?

43
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:55,508
Well the skater is going to travel, their direction is actually going to change.

44
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:59,742
And they can hold onto the rope and as long as they hold onto the rope, they'll keep going in circles

45
00:02:59,742 --> 00:03:07,069
and when they let go of the rope, they'll start going in whatever direction they were travelling in when they let go.

46
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:12,617
They'll keep going on in that direction and if we assume there is a very small amount of friction

47
00:03:12,617 --> 00:03:16,451
from the ice skating rink, they'll have the same speed.

48
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:23,952
So the force, the inward force, the tension from the rope pulling on the skater, in this situation, would have only changed

49
00:03:23,952 --> 00:03:25,539
the skater's direction.

50
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:32,102
So an unbalanced force doesn't necessarily have to impact an objects speed, it often does, but in this situation

51
00:03:32,102 --> 00:03:35,137
it would have only impacted the skater's direction.

52
00:03:35,137 --> 00:03:42,490
Another situation like this, once again this involves centripetal acceleration, inward forces, inward acceleration.

53
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:46,684
Is a satellite in orbit or any type of thing in orbit.

54
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:52,758
So if that is some type of planet, and this is one of the planet's moons right over here.

55
00:03:52,758 --> 00:03:58,636
The reason it stays in orbit is because the pull of gravity keeps making the object

56
00:03:58,636 --> 00:04:04,320
change its direction, but not its speed. Its speed is the exact right speed so as it travels...

57
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,619
So this is its speed right here, if the planet wasn't there it would just keep

58
00:04:06,619 --> 00:04:09,474
going on in that direction forever and ever.

59
00:04:09,474 --> 00:04:12,971
But the planet over here, there is an inward force of gravity.

60
00:04:12,971 --> 00:04:16,172
And we'll talk more the force of gravity in the future.

61
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:21,920
But this inward force of gravity is going to accelerate this object inwards while it travels.

62
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:30,416
So after some period of time, this object's velocity vector, if you add the previous velocity with how much it has changed.

63
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:31,600
It's new velocity vector--

64
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,520
Now this is after it has travelled a little bit.

65
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,015
It's new velocity vector might look something like this...

66
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:44,282
and it's travelling at the exact right speed so that the inward force or the force of gravity

67
00:04:44,282 --> 00:04:50,455
is always at a right angle to its actual trajectory.

68
00:04:50,455 --> 00:04:55,889
It's also at the exact right speed so it doesn't go off into "deep space", and so it doesn't plummet into the earth.

69
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:58,642
And we'll cover off that into much more detail.

70
00:04:58,642 --> 00:04:59,752
But the simple answer is

71
00:04:59,752 --> 00:05:06,039
Unbalanced force on a body will always impact its velocity, it could be its speed, its direction, or both.

72
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:10,966
But it doesn't have to be both, it could be just the speed or just the direction.

73
00:05:10,966 --> 00:05:14,303
So this is an incorrect statement.

74
00:05:14,303 --> 00:05:18,920
Now the third statement "the reason why initially moving objects tend to come to rest in our

75
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:23,488
everyday life is because they are being acted on by unbalanced forces."

76
00:05:23,488 --> 00:05:26,156
This is absolutely true, this is the example we gave.

77
00:05:26,156 --> 00:05:31,572
The reason why, if I take an object, if I take my book, and I try to slide it across the desk.

78
00:05:31,572 --> 00:05:36,784
The reason why it eventually comes to stop is because we have the unbalanced force of friction.

79
00:05:36,784 --> 00:05:40,617
The grinding of the surface of the book with the grinding of the table.

80
00:05:40,617 --> 00:05:47,222
If I'm inside of a pool, even if there is absolutely no current in the pool, and if I were to try and push

81
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:54,588
some type of object inside the water, it eventually comes to a stop because of all of the resistance

82
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:59,908
of the water itself. It's providing an unbalanced force in a direction opposite its motion.

83
00:05:59,908 --> 00:06:01,622
That is what slowing it down.

84
00:06:01,622 --> 00:06:04,674
So in our everyday life, the reason why we don't see these things go on

85
00:06:04,674 --> 00:06:12,643
forever is that we have these frictions, these air resistance or the friction with actual surfaces.

86
00:06:12,643 --> 00:06:19,399
And then the last statement. "An unbalanced force on an object will always change the object's direction."

87
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:22,559
Well this one actually is maybe the most intuitive.

88
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:27,307
We always have the situation, if I have a block over here,

89
00:06:27,307 --> 00:06:31,972
and it's travelling some velocity in that direction 5 metres per second.

90
00:06:31,972 --> 00:06:37,264
If I apply an unbalanced force in that same direction...

91
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:41,336
so that's my force right over there, if I apply it in that same direction I'm just going to

92
00:06:41,336 --> 00:06:44,908
accelerate it in that same direction. So I won't necessarily change it.

93
00:06:44,908 --> 00:06:50,070
Even if I were to act against it I might decelerate it, but I won't necessarily change its direction.

94
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,521
I could change its direction by doing something like this,

95
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:56,807
but I'm not always necessarily changing the object's direction.

96
00:06:56,807 --> 00:07:01,952
So this is not true. An unbalanced force on an object will

97
00:07:01,952 --> 00:07:04,353
not always change the object's direction.

98
00:07:04,353 --> 00:07:07,543
It can like in these circumstances, but not always.

99
00:07:07,543 --> 00:07:13,188
So always is what makes this very very very wrong.
