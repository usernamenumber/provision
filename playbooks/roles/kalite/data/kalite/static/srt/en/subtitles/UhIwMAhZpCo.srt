00:00:00,906 --> 00:00:06,850
We've already talked about the life cycles of stars, roughly the same mass as our sun, give or take a little bit

2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:12,933
what i want to do with this video is talk about more massive stars - massive stars.

3
00:00:12,933 --> 00:00:21,491
When i'm talking about massive stars, I'm talking about stars that have masses great than nine times the sun.

4
00:00:21,491 --> 00:00:28,467
So the general idea is exactly the same, you're going to start off with this huge cloud of mainly hydrogen,

5
00:00:28,537 --> 00:00:34,867
and now the cloud is going to have to be bigger than the clouds that condensed to form stars, like our Sun.

6
00:00:34,867 --> 00:00:43,498
We are going to start with that, and eventually gravity is going to pull it together, and the core of it is going to get hot and dense enough

7
00:00:43,498 --> 00:00:47,948
for hydrogen, to ignite - for hydrogen to start fusing.

8
00:00:48,089 --> 00:01:04,807
And it is now fusing. Hydrogen Fusion. You now have hydrogen fusion in the middle so it's ignited and around it you have

9
00:01:04,807 --> 00:01:12,098
the other material of the cloud, so the rest of the Hydrogen, and now it's so heated it's, really a plasma kind of a soup of electrons

10
00:01:12,098 --> 00:01:16,600
and nucleuses as opposed to well formed atoms, especially close to the core.

11
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,271
So now you have hydrogen fusion, we saw this happen around 10 million Kelvin

12
00:01:20,271 --> 00:01:24,776
and I want to make it very clear, since we are talking about more massive stars, even at this stage,

13
00:01:24,776 --> 00:01:34,250
there is going to be more gravitational pressure, even at this stage, during the main sequence of the star

14
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:40,600
because it is more massive, so this is going to burn faster and hotter.

15
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:51,851
So this will be faster and hotter than something the mass of our Sun. And so, even this stage is going to happen over a much

16
00:01:51,851 --> 00:01:58,533
shorter period of time than a star the mass of our sun. Our Sun's life is going to be 10 or 11 billion

17
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:03,832
total years, here we are going to be talking about things in the 10s of millions of years, so the factor

18
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:07,919
of 1000x shorter life span. But anyway, let's think about what happens

19
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:12,238
and so far just the pattern of what happens is going to happen faster because we have more pressure,

20
00:02:12,238 --> 00:02:17,467
more gravity, more temperature, but its going to happen in pretty much the same way as what we saw in the star the mass of the sun.

21
00:02:20,597 --> 00:02:26,333
Eventually, that hydrogen is going to fuse into a helium core

22
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:32,764
that is going to have a hydrogen shell around it - a hydrogen fusion shell - around it.

23
00:02:32,764 --> 00:02:36,671
then you have the rest of the star around that - so let me label it.

24
00:02:36,944 --> 00:02:42,238
This right here is our helium core

25
00:02:42,238 --> 00:02:46,502
and more and more helium is going to be built up as this hydrogen in the shell fuses,

26
00:02:46,926 --> 00:02:50,504
and this is in a star the mass of our sun,

27
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:56,267
this is when it starts to become a red giant because this core is starting to get denser, and denser,

28
00:02:56,267 --> 00:02:59,188
and denser as more, and more helium is produced

29
00:02:59,188 --> 00:03:01,200
and as it gets denser, and denser, and denser,

30
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,925
there is more and more gravitational pressure

31
00:03:03,925 --> 00:03:09,916
being put on this hydrogen shell out here where we have fusion still happening

32
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:16,836
and that is going to release more outward energy to push out the radius of the actual star

33
00:03:16,836 --> 00:03:22,007
but then when you fast forward there - so the general process - and we're going to see this as the star gets more and more massive,

34
00:03:22,007 --> 00:03:25,845
is we are going to have heavier and heavier elements forming in the core

35
00:03:25,845 --> 00:03:28,818
those heavier and heavier elements as the star gets denser and denser

36
00:03:28,818 --> 00:03:30,867
will eventually ignite kind of supporting the core,

37
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:37,672
but because the core itself is getting denser and denser, and denser, the material is getting pushed further and further out with more and more energy.

38
00:03:37,867 --> 00:03:42,842
Although if the star is massive enough its not going to be pushed out as far

39
00:03:42,842 --> 00:03:46,933
as you would have with a red giant as you would have in a red giant, with kind of a sun-like star

40
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:48,926
but let's just think about how this pattern is going to continue

41
00:03:48,926 --> 00:03:52,594
so eventually that helium, is going to - once it gets dense enough

42
00:03:52,594 --> 00:03:58,260
its going to ignite and its going to fuse into carbon and your going to have a carbon core forming

43
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:08,430
so that is carbon core, around that you have a helium core, and near the center of the helium core,

44
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:15,600
you have a shell of helium fusion turning into carbon, making that carbon core denser and hotter

45
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:28,000
and then around that you have hydrogen fusion, and then around that you have the rest of the star.

46
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,333
And so this process is going to keep continuing

47
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,254
eventually that carbon is going to start fusing,

48
00:04:32,254 --> 00:04:33,926
and you're going to have heavier and heavier elements formed of course

49
00:04:35,598 --> 00:04:39,591
this is a depiction off of Wikipedia of a fairly mature massive star

50
00:04:40,938 --> 00:04:43,446
and you keep forming these shells of heavier and heavier elements

51
00:04:43,446 --> 00:04:47,904
and cores of heavier and heavier elements until eventually you get to iron

52
00:04:47,904 --> 00:04:50,923
and in particular we are talking about

53
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:53,941
iron-56 - iron with an atomic mass of 56.

54
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:57,333
Here on this periodic table, that 26 is its atomic number - its how many protons it has.

55
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:04,251
56 is viewed as a count of protons and neutrons

56
00:05:04,251 --> 00:05:05,923
although its not exact,

57
00:05:05,923 --> 00:05:12,239
but at this point, the reason why you stop here is that you cannot get energy by fusing iron.

58
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:17,161
Fusing iron into heavier elements beyond iron actually requires energy

59
00:05:17,161 --> 00:05:19,530
so it would actually be an endothermic process.

60
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:23,617
So to fuse iron won't help support the core.

61
00:05:23,617 --> 00:05:28,933
So just to be very clear, this is how the heavy elements actually formed

62
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:30,908
we started with hydrogen

63
00:05:30,908 --> 00:05:35,598
hydrogen fusing in to helium, helium fusing in to carbon, and then all of these things

64
00:05:35,598 --> 00:05:38,942
in various combinations, and i won't go into all the details, are fusing heavier and heavier elements:

65
00:05:40,846 --> 00:05:43,261
neon, oxygen, and you see it right over here -

66
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:45,861
silicon - and these aren't the only elements forming, but these are kind of the main core elements forming

67
00:05:48,183 --> 00:05:51,573
but along the way you have all this other stuff, lithium, beryllium, boron,

68
00:05:51,573 --> 00:05:53,849
all of this other stuff is also forming.

69
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:56,264
So this is how you form elements up to iron 56.

70
00:05:57,936 --> 00:06:03,601
And also this is actually how you can form up to nickel 56 just to be exact.

71
00:06:03,601 --> 00:06:06,109
There will also be some nickel 56

72
00:06:06,109 --> 00:06:08,245
which has the same mass as iron56

73
00:06:08,245 --> 00:06:11,267
just has two fewer neutrons and two more protons

74
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:18,183
so its nickel 56, will also form, can also be a nickel-iron core

75
00:06:18,183 --> 00:06:22,800
but that's about how far a start can get regardless of how massive it is

76
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,333
at least by going thru traditional fusion, thru the traditional ignition mechanism.

77
00:06:28,493 --> 00:06:29,933
What i want to do is leave you there,

78
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:36,202
just so you can think about what might happen next now that we can't fuse this

79
00:06:36,202 --> 99:59:59,999
star anymore and what we are actually going to see is it will Supernova.
