00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:03,823
I have two identical rectangles here,

2
00:00:03,823 --> 00:00:05,935
and I want to measure how much each of them,

3
00:00:05,935 --> 00:00:05,936
or how much space each of them takes up on the plane of my screen; The screen you are looking at right now.

4
00:00:05,994 --> 00:00:14,937
And I want to do it using two different units.

5
00:00:14,937 --> 00:00:19,544
It is clear since they are two identical rectangles that they take up the exact, same amount of space.

6
00:00:19,544 --> 00:00:22,210
They will have the same area.

7
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,627
But what we can see is that we can measure that area using different units.

8
00:00:25,627 --> 00:00:31,804
So, first over here. Let's say, this figure is one foot in width.

9
00:00:31,804 --> 00:00:38,070
So, let's say that, it is one foot in width. So that is, one foot in width.

10
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,470
And, it is also one foot in height. One foot in height.

11
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:51,544
So, this right over here is equal to one square foot. It is clearly a square, it has the same width and the same height.

12
00:00:51,544 --> 00:00:55,044
And each of these dimensions are one foot. So, we can call it 'one square foot'.

13
00:00:55,044 --> 00:00:59,627
So, let's see how many square feet we can get on to one of these rectangles.

14
00:00:59,627 --> 00:01:03,210
Essentially, what we will be measuring its area in terms of square feet.

15
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,961
And, so we want to cover the entire space without overlapping, and without going over the boundaries.

16
00:01:07,961 --> 00:01:24,044
So, that is: One...Two...Three...Four...Five...and Six.

17
00:01:24,044 --> 00:01:39,877
Six in that first row. And then I have: Seven...Eight...Nine...Ten...Eleven...and Twelve.

18
00:01:39,877 --> 00:01:46,803
So that looks like this area, which is the same as this area down here, if I were to measure in square feet it is equal to...

19
00:01:46,803 --> 00:02:02,210
The area is equal to (let me write this down)...The area is equal to, we have (let me write it down): One...Two...Three...Four...Five...Six...Seven...Eight...Nine...Ten...Eleven...Twelve

20
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,403
square feet.

21
00:02:04,403 --> 00:02:07,736
12 square feet.

22
00:02:07,736 --> 00:02:12,127
Now, I am going to try to measure that same area in a different unit.

23
00:02:12,127 --> 00:02:14,270
And I am going to make-up this unit.

24
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,136
I am going to call it a: "Furgle."

25
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,137
And a "Furgle" in one-dimension is twice a foot. And this (that) distance over here I am going to call a: "Furgle."

26
00:02:19,137 --> 00:02:29,711
That is one "furgle." This is something that I made up just for the purposes of this video.

27
00:02:29,711 --> 00:02:32,336
Most people will not recognize what a furgle is.

28
00:02:32,336 --> 00:02:35,870
So, its height is one "furgle" and its width is one "furgle."

29
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:42,403
And so we can say that this is, one square "furgle."

30
00:02:42,403 --> 00:02:51,544
One square "furgle." So, let's see how many square "furgles" is this area. That same area that is 12 square feet.

31
00:02:51,544 --> 00:03:01,127
So, let me copy and paste this. So, let me, copy...and then paste.

32
00:03:01,127 --> 00:03:04,877
So let's see, we can get one square"furgle" on there,

33
00:03:04,877 --> 00:03:07,403
another square furgle on there

34
00:03:07,403 --> 00:03:12,470
and we can get a third square "furgle" on there!

35
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:15,293
So, we get one...two...three square furgles.

36
00:03:15,293 --> 00:03:28,003
The area of this figure in "furgles," square "furgles" I should say: The area is three square "furgles."

37
00:03:28,003 --> 00:03:34,960
So it's the same exact area. Three square "furgles" is equal to twelve square feet.

38
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,128
Covering the exact same area.

39
00:03:37,128 --> 00:03:38,710
And, what I encourage you to think about is:

40
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:42,710
How many square feet make a square "furgle"?
