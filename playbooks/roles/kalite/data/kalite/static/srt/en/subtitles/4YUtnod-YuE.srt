1
00:00:00,133 --> 00:00:03,390
In the last video, we talked about the idea that

2
00:00:03,452 --> 00:00:08,398
If I dug up a bone someplace and if I were to measure its

3
00:00:08,398 --> 00:00:13,158
carbon 14 I found that it had half the carbon 14 that I would

4
00:00:13,158 --> 00:00:20,089
expect to find in a living animal or plant. Then I would say hey, maybe 1 half life is gone by

5
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:26,335
or roughly for Carbon 14 one half life is 5,730 years. So I'd say maybe

6
00:00:26,335 --> 00:00:32,812
its 5,730 years since this bone was part of a living animal, or it is roughly that old.

7
00:00:32,812 --> 00:00:35,759
Now when I did that I made a pretty big assumption

8
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:40,705
Some of y'all have touched on this on you tube in the last video

9
00:00:40,705 --> 00:00:45,581
is how do I know that, this this estimate I made is based on the

10
00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:48,762
assumption that the amount of carbon 14 in the atmosphere

11
00:00:48,762 --> 00:00:53,592
is roughly constant from when this bone was living to now

12
00:00:53,592 --> 00:00:59,002
so the question is the amount of carbon 14 in the atmosphere

13
00:00:59,002 --> 00:01:02,183
and in the water and in living plants and animals is it

14
00:01:02,183 --> 00:01:05,133
constant and if it isn't constant how do you calibrate

15
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:07,350
your measurement so you can actually figure out how

16
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,796
much carbon 14 there is relative to living plants and

17
00:01:11,796 --> 00:01:13,735
animals at that time.

18
00:01:13,735 --> 00:01:16,089
The way that you can make that calibration, because it turns

19
00:01:16,089 --> 00:01:19,213
out that it isn't perfectly constant, the way that you can

20
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:21,502
make that calibration, there are two ways, and I have

21
00:01:21,502 --> 00:01:23,917
pictures here of both of them. One is to look at tree rings

22
00:01:25,394 --> 00:01:29,118
and I am told that this will work up to about 10 thousand

23
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:33,762
years, up to ten thousand years old, I don't know of any

24
00:01:33,762 --> 00:01:36,386
ten thousand year old trees, I don't think anyone does

25
00:01:36,386 --> 00:01:39,706
but maybe there are some remains of old trees and you can

26
00:01:39,706 --> 00:01:41,703
look at there tree rings. And I think most of us are

27
00:01:41,703 --> 00:01:44,533
familiar with this idea that every year that a tree

28
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:48,669
grows it forms another layer of bark. And so you can look back

29
00:01:48,669 --> 00:01:51,000
to that layer of bark, adjust for the half life

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,844
of carbon 14, and then figure out how much carbon 14

31
00:01:55,844 --> 00:01:58,724
was there in the atmosphere at that period in time

32
00:01:58,724 --> 00:02:02,267
and so it is kind of a record of the atmosphere up to

33
00:02:02,267 --> 00:02:04,415
ten thousand years. If you want to go even further

34
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:07,448
back you can look at cave deposits. And the fancy word

35
00:02:07,448 --> 00:02:13,324
for these cave deposits are speleothems, speleothems,

36
00:02:13,924 --> 00:02:16,759
speleothems, you might be familiar with stalagmites,

37
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:19,267
those are the speleothems that are kind of coming out

38
00:02:19,267 --> 00:02:22,803
of the bottom of the cave, or stalactites, those are the

39
00:02:22,803 --> 00:02:25,496
speleothems, that are coming from the top of the cave

40
00:02:25,496 --> 00:02:27,174
but the reason why these are useful is

41
00:02:27,174 --> 00:02:30,625
these are formed by calcium carbonate, so they have carbon

42
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:34,933
in them and slowly over really ten thousand years

43
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:37,954
the water in the cave deposits that calcium carbonate

44
00:02:37,954 --> 00:02:41,681
so it is a record of the fraction of carbon 14 in

45
00:02:41,681 --> 00:02:43,724
some of those years. And you can go down to resolutions

46
00:02:43,724 --> 00:02:46,301
of up to as small as ten years.

47
00:02:46,301 --> 00:02:49,533
So this will give us pretty good estimates of over tens

48
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:52,600
of thousands of years (up to 50 thousand years) and

49
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,279
frankly carbon 14 isn't even useful beyond really 50

50
00:02:56,279 --> 00:02:59,210
or 60 thousand years. So this gives us a pretty good,

51
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:04,274
pretty good, this gives us a good record of carbon 14

52
00:03:04,274 --> 00:03:06,959
in the atmosphere. Assuming that it is fairly uniform

53
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:07,848
throughout the atmosphere

54
00:03:07,848 --> 00:03:10,659
and all evidence suggests that and that uniformity

55
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:14,421
through the atmosphere goes into the water supply

56
00:03:14,421 --> 00:03:18,041
and into living plants and animals. Now the other thing

57
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,770
and I looked into this a little bit, it actually turns

58
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,259
out that because we are spewing so much fossil fuel

59
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:28,515
right now, we are changing the amount or proportion

60
00:03:28,515 --> 00:03:32,967
of carbon 14 much much faster than has happened

61
00:03:32,967 --> 00:03:36,800
in other time periods. So just to answer the question

62
00:03:36,831 --> 00:03:39,754
in probably really the last 50 years when the fossil

63
00:03:39,754 --> 00:03:42,733
fuel use has really exploded we've really been changing

64
00:03:42,733 --> 00:03:45,600
the proportion of carbon 14 relative to the other

65
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,533
isotopes of carbon. But anyway, hopefully that

66
00:03:49,764 --> 00:03:53,882
rests some of your worries about the assumptions I

67
00:03:53,882 --> 00:03:57,054
made in the last video about carbon 14 being relatively

68
00:03:57,054 --> 00:04:00,831
constant. There are ways to look back at specific years

69
00:04:00,831 --> 00:04:03,780
and figure out the relative amounts of carbon 14 so

70
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:10,333
it is a pretty good way of estimating how old living things

71
00:04:10,333 --> 99:59:59,999
are especially things that are less than 50,000 years old
