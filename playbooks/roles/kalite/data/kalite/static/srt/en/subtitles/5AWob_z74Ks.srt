1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,950
   

2
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:05,350
A couple of videos ago we
introduced the idea of the

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,240
length of a vector.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,210
That equals the length.

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,560
And this was a neat idea because
we're used to the

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,720
length of things in two- or
three-dimensional space, but

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,730
it becomes very abstract when
we get to n dimensions.

8
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,250
If this has a hundred
components, at least for me,

9
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,210
it's hard to visualize a hundred
dimension vector.

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,410
But we've actually defined
it's notion of length.

11
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,900
And we saw that this is actually
a scalar value.

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,270
It's just a number.

13
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:36,530
In this video, I want to attempt
to define the notion

14
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:40,125
of an angle between vectors.

15
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:45,400
   

16
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,880
As you can see, we're building
up this mathematics of vectors

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,495
from the ground up, and we can't
just say, oh, I know

18
00:00:51,495 --> 00:00:53,590
what an angle is because
everything we know about

19
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,410
angles and even lengths, it
just applies to what we

20
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,650
associate with two- or
three-dimensional space.

21
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,230
But the whole study of linear
algebra is abstracting these

22
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:05,010
ideas into multi-dimensional
space.

23
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,240
And I haven't even defined what
dimension is yet, but I

24
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,030
think you understand that idea
to some degree already.

25
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,020
When people talk about one or
two or three dimensions.

26
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:18,020
So let's say that I have some
vector-- let's say I have two

27
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,530
vectors, vectors a and b.

28
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,940
   

29
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,460
They're nonzero and they're
members of Rn.

30
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,800
   

31
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:36,790
And I don't have a notion of
the angle between them yet,

32
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,430
but let me just draw them out.

33
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,390
Let me just draw them as if
I could draw them in two

34
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:40,870
dimensions.

35
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,960
So that would be vector
a right there.

36
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,400
Maybe that's vector
b right there.

37
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,980
And then this vector right
there would be the

38
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,810
vector a minus b.

39
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,050
And you can verify that just the
way we've learned to add

40
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,200
and subtract vectors.

41
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,310
Or you know, this is
heads to tails.

42
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:03,840
So b plus a minus b is of
course, going to be vector a.

43
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,490
And that all just
works out there.

44
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,050
To help us define this notion
of angle, let me construct

45
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,345
another triangle that's going
to look a lot like this one.

46
00:02:12,345 --> 00:02:17,470
But remember, I'm just doing
this for our simple minds to

47
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,140
imagine it in two dimensions.

48
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,030
But these aren't necessarily
two-dimensional beasts.

49
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,000
These each could have a
hundred components.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,555
But let me make another
triangle.

51
00:02:26,555 --> 00:02:30,150
   

52
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,440
Well, it should look similar.

53
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,000
Say it looks like that.

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,040
And I'm going to define the
sides of the triangles to be

55
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,090
the lengths of each
of these vectors.

56
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,250
Remember, the lengths of each of
these vectors, I don't care

57
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,460
how many components there
are, they're just

58
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,680
going to be your numbers.

59
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,980
So the length of this side right
here is just going to be

60
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,530
the length of a.

61
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,580
The length of this side right
here is just going to be the

62
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,695
length of vector a
minus vector b.

63
00:02:54,695 --> 00:02:57,610
   

64
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,780
And the length of this side
right here is going to be the

65
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,010
length of vector b.

66
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,990
Now the first thing we want to
make sure is that we can

67
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:07,500
always construct a triangle
like that.

68
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,940
And so under what circumstances
could we not

69
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,280
construct a triangle
like this?

70
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,550
Well we wouldn't be able
construct a triangle like this

71
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,820
if this side.

72
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,410
if b, if the magnitude-- so
let me write this down.

73
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,710
It's kind of a subtle
point, but I want to

74
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,520
make this very clear.

75
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,810
In order to define an angle, I
want to be comfortable that I

76
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,300
can always make this
construction.

77
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,680
And I need to make sure that--
let me write reasons why I

78
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:39,490
couldn't make this
construction.

79
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:45,310
Well what if the magnitude of
b was greater than, or the

80
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:49,450
length of vector b was greater
than the length of vector a

81
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,760
plus the length of
vector a minus b?

82
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,260
In two dimensions, I could never
draw a triangle like

83
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,950
that then because you would
have this length plus this

84
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,680
length would be shorter than
this thing right here.

85
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,010
So you could never
construct it.

86
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,200
And I could do with
all the sides.

87
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,470
What if this length was larger
than one of these two sides?

88
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,080
Or what if that length
was larger than one

89
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,760
of those two sides?

90
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,300
I could just never draw
a two-dimensional

91
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,560
triangle that way.

92
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,800
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to use the triangle--

93
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,544
the vector triangle inequality
to prove that each of these

94
00:04:21,544 --> 00:04:27,560
sides is less than or equal to
the sum of the other sides.

95
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,540
I could do the same thing.

96
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,620
Let me make the point clear.

97
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,500
I could show that if a, for
whatever reason, was greater

98
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:39,190
than the other sides plus b,
then I wouldn't be able to

99
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:39,990
create a triangle.

100
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,020
And the last one of course is
if a minus b, for whatever

101
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,200
reason, was greater than the
other two sides, I just

102
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,310
wouldn't be able to draw
a triangle in a plus b.

103
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:53,590
So I need to show that for any
vectors, any real vectors--

104
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,770
nonzero, real vectors that are
members of Rn-- that none of

105
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,180
these can ever happen.

106
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,970
I need to prove that none
of those can happen.

107
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,580
So what does the triangle
inequality tell us?

108
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,680
The triangle inequality tells
us that if I have the sum of

109
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:12,250
two vectors, if I take the
length of the sum of two

110
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:18,400
vectors, that that is always
going to be less than-- and

111
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,360
these are nonzero vectors.

112
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,710
This is always going to be less
than or equal to the sum

113
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,510
of each of their individual
lengths.

114
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:28,220
   

115
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,020
So let's see if we can
apply that to this

116
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,930
triangle right here.

117
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:41,250
So what is the magnitude,
the length of a?

118
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,780
Well I can rewrite vector a.

119
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,110
What is vector a equal to?

120
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:53,380
Vector a is equal to vector
b plus vector a minus b.

121
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,450
I mean I'm just rewriting
the vector here.

122
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,970
I'm just rewriting a here as a
sum of the other two vectors.

123
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:00,910
Nothing fancy there.

124
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,790
I haven't used the triangle
inequality or anything.

125
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:06,060
I've just used my definition
of vector addition.

126
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,630
But here now, if I put little
parentheses here, now I can

127
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,820
apply the triangle inequality.

128
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,760
And I say, well,
you know what?

129
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,440
This is going to be, by the
triangle inequality, which

130
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,180
we've proved, it's going to be
less than or equal to the

131
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,740
lengths of each of
these vectors.

132
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:27,410
Vector b plus the length
of vector a minus b.

133
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:31,400
So we know that the length of a
is less than the sum of that

134
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,560
one and that one.

135
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,980
So we don't have to worry about
this being our problem.

136
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,270
We know that that is not true.

137
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,610
Now let's look at b.

138
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,040
So is there any way that I can
rewrite b as a sum of two

139
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,790
other vectors?

140
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,650
Well sure.

141
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:55,800
I can write it as a sum of a
plus, let me put it this way.

142
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,610
If that vector right there is a
minus b, the same vector in

143
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:03,720
the reverse direction is going
to be the vector b minus a.

144
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:10,770
So a plus the vector
b minus a.

145
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:11,890
That's the same thing as b.

146
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,290
And you can see it right here.

147
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,580
The a's would cancel
out and you're just

148
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,990
left with the b there.

149
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:19,710
Now by the triangle inequality,
we know that this

150
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:25,960
is less than or equal to the
length of vector a plus the

151
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,350
length of vector b minus a.

152
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,930
Now you're saying hey, Sal,
you're dealing with b minus a.

153
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,200
This is the length
of a minus b.

154
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,630
And I can leave this for you
to prove it based on our

155
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:45,400
definition of vector lengths,
but the length of b minus a is

156
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,830
equal to minus 1 times
a minus b.

157
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:54,050
And I'll leave it to you
to say that look,

158
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,250
these lengths are equal.

159
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,780
Because essentially-- I could
leave that, but I think you

160
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:05,030
can take that based on just the
visual depiction of them

161
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,510
that they're the exact same
vectors, just in different

162
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:07,930
directions.

163
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,850
And I have to be careful with
length because it's not just

164
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:10,780
in two dimensions.

165
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,290
But I think you get the idea and
I'll leave that for you to

166
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,450
prove that these lengths
are the same thing.

167
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,850
So we know that b is less
than the length

168
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,270
of those two things.

169
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:25,000
So we don't have to worry about
that one right there.

170
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,595
Finally, a minus b.

171
00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:35,919
The magnitude or the length
of vector a minus b.

172
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,940
Well I can write that as the
length of-- or I can write

173
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,140
that as vector a plus
vector minus b.

174
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,920
   

175
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,610
If we just put a minus b right
there and go in the other

176
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,560
directions, we could say minus
b, which would be in that

177
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:01,550
direction plus a would give
us our vector a minus b.

178
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,680
Actually, I don't even
have to go there.

179
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,650
That's obvious from this.

180
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:06,040
I just kind of put the negative
in the parentheses.

181
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,260
Well the triangle inequality,
and this might seem a little

182
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,050
mundane to you, but it really
shows us that we can always

183
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,970
define a regular planar triangle
based on these

184
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,430
vectors in this way.

185
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:19,070
It tells us this is less than or
equal to the length of our

186
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:24,150
vector a plus the length
of minus b.

187
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,680
And I just said and you could
prove it to yourself, that

188
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,660
this is the same thing
as the length of b.

189
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,130
So we just saw that
this is definitely

190
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:32,870
less than those two.

191
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,480
This is definitely less
than those two.

192
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,290
And that is definitely
less than those two.

193
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:40,130
None of the reasons that would
keep us from constructing a

194
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,080
triangle are valid.

195
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,710
So we can always construct a
triangle in this way from any

196
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:48,340
arbitrary nonzero
vectors in Rn.

197
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,260
We can always construct this.

198
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:57,390
Now, to define an angle, let
me redraw it down here.

199
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,820
Let me redraw the vectors, maybe
a little bit bigger.

200
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,920
That's vector a.

201
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,390
This is vector b.

202
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,680
And then let me just
draw it this way.

203
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,300
This is the vector
right there.

204
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,170
That is the vector a minus b.

205
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,360
And we said we're going to
define a corresponding

206
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,910
regular, run of the mill,
vanilla triangle whose lengths

207
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,600
are defined by the lengths
of the vectors,

208
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,710
by the vector lengths.

209
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,900
So this is the length
of b, that side.

210
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:31,340
This is the length
of a minus b.

211
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,890
And then this is the
length of a.

212
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:37,370
Now that I know that I can
always construct a triangle

213
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,080
like this, I can attempt to
define-- or actually, I will

214
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:45,480
define my definition of an angle
between two vectors.

215
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,860
So we know what an angle
means in this context.

216
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:52,040
This is just a regular, run of
the mill, geometric triangle.

217
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,430
Now, my definition of an angle
between two vectors I'm going

218
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:59,120
to say-- so this is what
I'm trying to define.

219
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,900
This is what I'm going
to define.

220
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,860
These can have arbitrary number
of components, so it's

221
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,720
hard to visualize.

222
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,500
But I'm going to define this
angle as the corresponding

223
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,900
angle in a regular, run of the
mill triangle where the sides

224
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,460
of the run of the mill triangle
are the two vectors

225
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,420
and then the opposite side is
the subtraction, is the length

226
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,720
of the difference between
the two vectors.

227
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,560
This is just the definition.

228
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,935
I'm defining this, the angle
between two vectors in Rn that

229
00:11:28,935 --> 00:11:32,210
could have an arbitrary number
of components, I'm defining

230
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:36,770
this angle to be the same as
this angle, the angle between

231
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:40,860
the two sides, the two lengths
of those vectors in just a

232
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,380
regular, run of the
mill triangle.

233
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,560
Now, what can I do with this?

234
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,300
Well, can we find a relationship
between all of

235
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,230
these things right here?

236
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,780
Well sure.

237
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,910
If you remember from your
trigonometry class, and if you

238
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,810
don't, I've proved it
in the playlist. You

239
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,060
have the law of cosines.

240
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,680
   

241
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,860
And I'll do it with an arbitrary
triangle right here

242
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,320
just because I don't want
to confuse you.

243
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:12,040
So if this is side a, b, and c
and this is theta, the law of

244
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:17,140
cosines tells us that c squared
is equal to a squared

245
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:23,080
plus b squared minus 2ab
cosine of theta.

246
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,220
I always think of it as kind
of a broader Pythagorean

247
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,000
theorem because this
thing does not have

248
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,460
to be a right angle.

249
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,640
It accounts for all angles.

250
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,100
If this becomes a right angle,
then this term disappears and

251
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,130
you're just left with the
Pythagorean theorem.

252
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,050
But we've proven this.

253
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:41,200
This applies to just regular,
run of the mill triangles.

254
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,870
And lucky for us, we have a
regular, run of the mill

255
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,080
triangle here.

256
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,580
So let's apply the law
of cosines to this

257
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,650
triangle right here.

258
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,950
And the way I drew it,
they correspond.

259
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,900
The length of this
side squared.

260
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:03,420
So that means the length
of a minus b squared.

261
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,290
Length of vector a minus vector
b, that's just the

262
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,160
length of that side.

263
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,490
So I'm just squaring
that side.

264
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:16,790
It equals the length of vector
b squared plus the length of

265
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:23,150
vector a squared minus 2 times
the length of-- I'll just

266
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:27,150
write two times length of vector
a times the length of

267
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:31,360
vector b times the cosine of
this angle right here.

268
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,940
Times the cosine
of that angle.

269
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,650
And I'm defining this angle
between these two vectors to

270
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,630
be the same as this
angle right there.

271
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,790
So if we know this angle, by
definition, we know that angle

272
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,970
right there.

273
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:45,210
Well, we know that the square
of our lengths of a vector

274
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:47,525
when we use our factor
definition of length, that

275
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:50,960
this is just the same thing as
a vector dotted with itself.

276
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:58,080
So that's a minus
b dot a minus b.

277
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,530
It's all going to be equal to
this whole stuff on the

278
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,370
right-hand side.

279
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,780
But let me simplify
the left-hand

280
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,230
side of this equation.

281
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:10,350
a minus b dot a minus b, this is
the same thing as a dot a--

282
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:15,180
those two terms--
minus a dot b.

283
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,065
   

284
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,650
And then I have minus b dot a.

285
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:24,680
   

286
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,390
Those two terms right there.

287
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:29,010
And then you have the
minus b dot minus b.

288
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:32,530
That's the same thing
as a plus b dot b.

289
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,260
Remember, this is just a
simplification of the

290
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,640
left-hand side.

291
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,850
And I can rewrite this.

292
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:42,010
a dot a, we know that's just
the length of a squared.

293
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:44,210
a dot b and b dot a are
the same thing, so

294
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,460
we have two of these.

295
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:51,400
So this right here, this term
right there will simplify to

296
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:57,370
minus 2 times a dot b.

297
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:00,090
And then finally, b dot b.

298
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:03,120
We know that that's just the
length of b squared.

299
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,700
I just simplified or maybe I
just expanded-- that's a

300
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,650
better word.

301
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,680
When you go from one term here
to three terms, you can't say

302
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,680
you simplified it.

303
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,400
But I expanded just the
left-hand side and so this has

304
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,520
to be equal to the right-hand
side by the law of cosines.

305
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:21,570
So that is equal to-- I almost
feel like instead of rewriting

306
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,130
it, let me just copy
and paste it.

307
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:28,280
   

308
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,490
What did I just do?

309
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,240
Copy, edit.

310
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,620
Copy and paste.

311
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,810
There you go.

312
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,870
I don't know it that
was worth it.

313
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,350
But maybe I saved a little
bit of time.

314
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:44,810
So that is equal to
that right there.

315
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,170
And then we can simplify.

316
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,610
We have a length of a
squared here, length

317
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,590
of a squared there.

318
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,040
Subtract it from both sides.

319
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,270
The length of b squared here,
length of b squared there.

320
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,120
Subtract it from both sides.

321
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,000
And then, what can we do?

322
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,770
We can divide both sides by
minus 2 because everything

323
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,100
else has disappeared.

324
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,960
And so that term and that term
will both become 1's.

325
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:16,470
And all we're left with is the
vector a dot the vector b.

326
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,490
And this is interesting because
all of a sudden we're

327
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,860
getting a relationship
between the dot

328
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,200
products of two vectors.

329
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,460
We've kind of gone away from
their definition by lengths.

330
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:29,740
But the dot product of two
vectors is equal to the

331
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:36,550
product of their lengths,
their vector lengths.

332
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:39,110
And they can have an arbitrary
number of components.

333
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:43,450
Times the cosine of the
angle between them.

334
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:46,300
Remember, this theta, I said
this is the same as when you

335
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,490
draw this kind of analogous,
regular triangle.

336
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,530
But I'm defining the angle
between them to

337
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,230
be the same as that.

338
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:56,610
So I can say that this is
the angle between them.

339
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:00,290
And obviously, the idea of
between two vectors, it's hard

340
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,110
to visualize if you go beyond
three dimensions.

341
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,289
But now we have it at least,
mathematically defined.

342
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:07,099
   

343
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:11,310
So if you give me two vectors we
can now, using this formula

344
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:14,920
that we've proved using this
definition up here, we can now

345
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,410
calculate the angle between
any two vectors using this

346
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,510
right here.

347
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:28,319
And just to make it clear, what
happens if a is a-- and

348
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,270
maybe it's not clear from that
definition, so I'll make it

349
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:36,020
clearer here that by definition,
if a is equal to

350
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:40,660
some scalar multiple of b where
c is greater than 0,

351
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:46,190
we'll define theta
to be equal to 0.

352
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,000
And if c is less than 0, so a is
collinear, but goes in the

353
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,330
exact opposite direction, we'll
define theta to be equal

354
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,440
to 180 degrees.

355
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,080
And that's consistent with what
we understand about just

356
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,620
two-dimensional vectors.

357
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,220
If they're collinear and
kind of the scalar

358
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:03,790
multiples the same.

359
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:07,460
That means a looks something
like that and b looks

360
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,940
something like that.

361
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,810
So we say oh, that's
a 0 angle.

362
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:15,010
And if they go the other way,
if a looks something like--

363
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,870
this is the case where a is
just going in the other

364
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,130
direction from b.

365
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,540
a goes like that and b goes like
that, we define the angle

366
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,310
between them to be
180 degrees.

367
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,690
But everything else is pretty
well defined by

368
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:27,750
the triangle example.

369
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,880
I had to make the special case
of these because it's not

370
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,620
clear you really get a triangle
in these cases

371
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,870
because the triangle
kind of disappears.

372
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:38,320
It flattens out if a and b are
on top of each other or if

373
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,940
they're going in the exact
opposite direction.

374
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:45,150
So that's why I wanted to make
a little bit of a side note

375
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,080
right there.

376
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:53,130
Now, using this definition of
the angle between the vectors,

377
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:57,440
we can now define the idea
of perpendicular vectors.

378
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,660
So we can now say perpendicular
vectors-- this

379
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:06,100
is another definition-- and
this won't be earth

380
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,220
shattering, but it kind of is
because we've generalized this

381
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,570
to vectors that have an
arbitrary number of

382
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:12,000
components.

383
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,590
We're defining perpendicular
to mean the theta between--

384
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:22,890
two vectors a and b are
perpendicular if the angle

385
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:29,520
between them is 90 degrees.

386
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,550
And we can define that.

387
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:34,880
We can take two vectors,
dot them.

388
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,110
Take their dot product.

389
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,660
Figure out their two lengths and
then you could figure out

390
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,760
the angle between them.

391
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,080
And if it's 90 degrees.

392
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,460
you can say that they are
perpendicular angles.

393
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,880
And I want to be very clear here
that this is actually not

394
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,640
defined for the 0 vector
right here.

395
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:57,240
So this situation right here,
not defined for the 0 vector.

396
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,660
Because if you have the 0
vector, then this quantity

397
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,760
right here is going to be 0 and
then this quantity right

398
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,810
here is going to be 0.

399
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,600
And there's no clear definition
for your angle.

400
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,300
If this is 0 right here, you
did 0 is equal to 0 times

401
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,940
cosine of theta.

402
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,610
And so if you wanted to solve
for theta you'd get cosine of

403
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:19,810
theta is equal to 0/0,
which is undefined.

404
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:24,540
   

405
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:29,200
But what we can do is create a
slightly more general word

406
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,300
than the word perpendicular.

407
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:35,530
So you have to have a defined
angle to even talk about

408
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:36,400
perpendicular.

409
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,010
If the angle between two vectors
is 90 degrees, we're

410
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:43,170
saying by definition, those two
vectors are perpendicular.

411
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:46,360
But what if we made the
statement and we can-- if you

412
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,460
look at them, if the angle
between two vectors is 90

413
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,190
degrees, what does that mean?

414
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,180
So let's say that theta
is 90 degrees.

415
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:56,370
Let me draw a line here.

416
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,060
Let's say that theta
is 90 degrees.

417
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,420
Theta is equal to 90 degrees.

418
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,260
What does this formula
tell us?

419
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:07,960
It tells us that a dot b is
equal to the length of a times

420
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,450
the length of b times cosine
of 90 degrees.

421
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,180
What's cosine of 90 degrees?

422
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,220
It's 0.

423
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,610
You can review your unit circle
if that doesn't make a

424
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:18,850
lot of sense.

425
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,070
But that is equal to 0, so this
whole term is going to be

426
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,370
equal to 0.

427
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:27,400
So if theta is equal to
90 degrees, then a dot

428
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,220
b is equal to 0.

429
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:36,320
And so this is another
interesting takeaway.

430
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:45,690
If a and b are perpendicular,
then their dot product is

431
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:49,020
going to be equal to 0.

432
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,330
Now if their dot product is
equal to 0, can we necessarily

433
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,470
say that they are
perpendicular?

434
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:59,120
Well what if a or b
is the 0 vector?

435
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,820
The 0 vector-- let me call
it z for 0 vector.

436
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,070
Or I could just draw.

437
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:06,350
   

438
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:10,590
The 0 vector dot anything is
always going to be equal to 0.

439
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,970
So does that mean that the 0
vector is perpendicular to

440
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:13,670
everything?

441
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:14,570
Well no.

442
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:19,320
Because the 0 vector I said, we
have to have the notion of

443
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,550
an angle between things in
order to use the word

444
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,170
perpendicular.

445
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:25,340
So we can't use the 0 vector.

446
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,280
We can't say just because two
vectors dot products are equal

447
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,200
to 0 that they are
perpendicular.

448
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,460
And that's because the 0 vector
would mess that up

449
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,500
because the 0 vector
is not defined.

450
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,810
But if we say, and we have been
saying, that a and b are

451
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:47,660
nonzero, if they are nonzero
vectors, then we can say that

452
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,350
if a and b are nonzero and their
dot product is equal to

453
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,370
0, then a and b are
perpendicular.

454
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,190
So now it goes both ways.

455
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,960
But what if we just have this
condition right here?

456
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,440
What if we just have the
condition that a dot b is

457
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,200
equal to 0?

458
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,040
It seems like that's kind of
just a simple, pure condition.

459
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,740
And we can write a
word for that.

460
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,790
And these words are often used
synonymously, but hopefully

461
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,480
you understand the
distinction now.

462
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:17,110
We can say that if two vectors
dot product is equal to 0, we

463
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,930
will call them orthogonal.

464
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:25,580
   

465
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,250
As I always say, spelling
isn't my best subject.

466
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,880
But this is kind
of a neat idea.

467
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,010
This tells us that-- well, that
all perpendicular vectors

468
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,690
are orthogonal.

469
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:50,780
And it also tells us that the
0 vector is orthogonal to

470
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,460
everything else.

471
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,570
To everything, even to itself.

472
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,860
The 0 dot 0 vector
you still get 0.

473
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,820
So by definition,
it's orthogonal.

474
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:03,080
So for the first time probably
in your mathematical career,

475
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,110
you're seeing that the words--
you know, every time you first

476
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,220
got exposed to the words
perpendicular and orthogonal

477
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,950
in geometry or maybe in physics
or wherever else, they

478
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,200
were always kind of
the same words.

479
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,230
But now I'm introducing a nice,
little distinction here

480
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,880
and you can kind of be a little

481
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,610
smart aleck with teachers.

482
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:22,040
Oh, you know, it's perpendicular
only is the

483
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,810
vectors aren't-- if neither
of them are 0 vector.

484
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:27,290
Otherwise, if their dot product
is 0, you can only say

485
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,250
that they're orthogonal.

486
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,730
But if they're nonzero you
could say that they're

487
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,105
orthogonal and perpendicular.

488
00:24:31,105 --> 00:24:33,280
But anyway, I thought that I
would introduce this little

489
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,455
distinction for you in case you
have someone that likes to

490
00:24:35,455 --> 00:24:37,050
trip you up with words.

491
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,900
But it also I think highlights
that we are building a

492
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,310
mathematics from the ground up
and we have to be careful

493
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,270
about the words we use.

494
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:46,040
And we have to be very precise
about our definitions.

495
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,770
Because if we're not precise
about our definitions and we

496
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:50,200
build up a bunch of mathematics
on top of this and

497
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,260
do a bunch of proofs, one day we
might scratch our heads and

498
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,040
read some type of
weird ambiguity.

499
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,660
And it might have all came out
of the fact that we weren't

500
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:01,110
precise enough in defining what
some of these terms mean.

501
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,470
Well anyway, hopefully you
found this useful.

502
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:06,650
We can now take the angle or we
can now determine the angle

503
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:09,340
between vectors with an
arbitrary number of

504
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,590
components.
