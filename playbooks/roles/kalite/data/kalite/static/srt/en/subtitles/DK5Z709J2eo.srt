1
00:00:00,467 --> 00:00:01,982
So you're me, and you're in math class yet again

2
00:00:01,982 --> 00:00:04,104
because they make you go, like, every single day.

3
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:05,105
And you're learning about, I don't know,

4
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:06,803
the sums of infinite series.

5
00:00:06,803 --> 00:00:08,008
That's a high school topic, right?

6
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,943
Which is odd, because it's a cool topic,

7
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:11,945
but they somehow manage to ruin it anyway.

8
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:15,415
So I guess that's why they allow infinite series in the curriculum.

9
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,569
So, in a quite understandable need for distraction,

10
00:00:17,569 --> 00:00:18,882
you're doodling and thinking more about

11
00:00:18,882 --> 00:00:20,650
what the plural of "series" should be

12
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,325
than about the topic at hand.

13
00:00:22,325 --> 00:00:24,743
"Serieses," "seriese," "seriesen," and "serii?"

14
00:00:24,743 --> 00:00:27,144
Or is it that the singular should be changed?

15
00:00:27,144 --> 00:00:28,813
One "serie," or "serus," or "serum?"

16
00:00:28,813 --> 00:00:31,501
It's like the singular of "sheep" should be "shoop."

17
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:33,393
But the whole concept of things like

18
00:00:33,393 --> 00:00:36,573
1/2 +1/4 +1/8 +1/16 and so on, approaching one,

19
00:00:36,573 --> 00:00:38,941
is useful if you wanna draw a line of elephants

20
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:41,024
each holding the tail of the next one:

21
00:00:41,024 --> 00:00:42,223
normal elephant, young elephant,

22
00:00:42,223 --> 00:00:44,621
baby elephant, dog-sized elephant, puppy-sized elephant...

23
00:00:44,621 --> 00:00:46,556
All the way down to Mr. Tusks and beyond.

24
00:00:46,556 --> 00:00:48,602
Which is at least a <i>tiny</i> bit awesome,

25
00:00:48,602 --> 00:00:50,204
because you can get an infinite number of elephants in a line

26
00:00:50,204 --> 00:00:51,405
and still have it fit across a single notebook page.

27
00:00:51,405 --> 00:00:53,607
But there's questions like,

28
00:00:53,607 --> 00:00:55,175
"What if you started with a camel, which,

29
00:00:55,175 --> 00:00:56,308
being smaller than an elephant,

30
00:00:56,308 --> 00:00:58,178
only goes across a third of the page?"

31
00:00:58,178 --> 00:00:59,633
How big should the next camel be

32
00:00:59,633 --> 00:01:01,948
in order to properly approach the end of the page?

33
00:01:01,948 --> 00:01:03,502
Certainly you could calculate an answer to this question,

34
00:01:03,502 --> 00:01:05,003
and it's cool that that's possible,

35
00:01:05,003 --> 00:01:06,805
but I'm not really interested in doing calculations,

36
00:01:06,805 --> 00:01:08,306
so we'll come back to camels.

37
00:01:08,306 --> 00:01:09,307
Here's a fractal.

38
00:01:09,307 --> 00:01:10,542
You start with these circles,

39
00:01:10,542 --> 00:01:11,443
in a circle,

40
00:01:11,443 --> 00:01:12,878
and then keep drawing the biggest circle

41
00:01:12,878 --> 00:01:14,212
that fits in the space in-between.

42
00:01:14,212 --> 00:01:16,882
This is called an "Apollonian Gasket."

43
00:01:16,882 --> 00:01:18,774
And you can choose a different starting set of circles,

44
00:01:18,774 --> 00:01:20,002
and it still works nicely.

45
00:01:20,002 --> 00:01:21,537
It's well known in some circles

46
00:01:21,537 --> 00:01:22,805
because it has some very interesting properties

47
00:01:22,805 --> 00:01:24,776
involving the relative curvature of circles

48
00:01:24,776 --> 00:01:25,608
which is neat and all,

49
00:01:25,608 --> 00:01:26,876
but it also looks cool

50
00:01:26,876 --> 00:01:28,863
and suggests an awesome doodle game.

51
00:01:28,863 --> 00:01:29,699
Step one:

52
00:01:29,699 --> 00:01:31,114
draw ANY shape.

53
00:01:31,114 --> 00:01:32,299
Step two:

54
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:33,968
draw the BIGGEST circle you can within this shape.

55
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,318
Step three:

56
00:01:35,318 --> 00:01:36,637
draw the biggest circle you can

57
00:01:36,637 --> 00:01:37,638
within the space left.

58
00:01:37,638 --> 00:01:38,806
Step four:

59
00:01:38,806 --> 00:01:39,962
see Step three.

60
00:01:39,962 --> 00:01:42,350
As long as there is space left after the first circle,

61
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,736
meaning don't start with a circle,

62
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:46,042
this method turns any shape into a fractal.

63
00:01:46,042 --> 00:01:46,928
You can do this with triangles,

64
00:01:46,928 --> 00:01:49,077
you can do this with stars, and don't forget to embellish!

65
00:01:49,077 --> 00:01:51,193
You can do this with elephants, or snakes,

66
00:01:51,193 --> 00:01:52,810
or profile one of your friends.

67
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,272
I choose Abraham Lincoln!

68
00:01:54,272 --> 00:01:55,473
Awesome.

69
00:01:55,473 --> 00:01:57,407
Okay, but what about other shapes besides circles?

70
00:01:57,407 --> 00:01:59,274
For example, equilateral triangles

71
00:01:59,274 --> 00:02:01,021
say, filling this other triangle, which works

72
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:03,194
because the filler triangles are in opposite orientation

73
00:02:03,194 --> 00:02:05,291
to the outside triangle (and orientation matters).

74
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,507
This yields our friend, "Sierpinski's Triangle,"

75
00:02:07,507 --> 00:02:09,931
which, by the way, you can also make out of Abraham Lincoln.

76
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:12,489
But triangles seem to work beautifully in this case.

77
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:13,605
But that's a special case,

78
00:02:13,605 --> 00:02:14,614
and the problem with triangles is that

79
00:02:14,614 --> 00:02:16,220
they don't always fit snugly.

80
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,584
For example, with this blobby shape,

81
00:02:17,584 --> 00:02:20,374
the biggest equillateral triangle has a lonely hanging corner.

82
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:21,302
And <i>sure</i>, you don't have to let that

83
00:02:21,302 --> 00:02:22,788
stop you in this fun doodle game,

84
00:02:22,788 --> 00:02:25,277
but I think it lacks some of the beauty of the circle game.

85
00:02:25,277 --> 00:02:27,648
Or, what if you could change the orientation of the triangle

86
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,214
to get the biggest possible one?

87
00:02:29,214 --> 00:02:30,807
What if you didn't have to keep it equillateral?

88
00:02:30,807 --> 00:02:32,013
Well, for polygonal shapes,

89
00:02:32,013 --> 00:02:33,829
the game runs out pretty quickly, so that's no good.

90
00:02:33,848 --> 00:02:35,000
But for curvy, complicated shapes,

91
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,832
the process itself becomes difficult.

92
00:02:36,832 --> 00:02:38,569
How do you find the biggest triangle?

93
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:40,842
It's not always obvious which triangle has more area

94
00:02:40,842 --> 00:02:43,273
especially when your starting shape is not very well defined.

95
00:02:43,273 --> 00:02:44,700
This is an interesting sort of question,

96
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,830
because there IS a correct answer,

97
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,414
but if you're going to write a computer program

98
00:02:47,414 --> 00:02:48,881
that fills a given shape with another shape,

99
00:02:48,881 --> 00:02:51,497
following even the <i>simpler</i> version of the rules,

100
00:02:51,497 --> 00:02:53,997
you might need to learn some computational geometry.

101
00:02:53,997 --> 00:02:54,926
I'm certain that you could move beyond

102
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:57,073
triangles, to squares, or even elephants,

103
00:02:57,073 --> 00:02:58,493
but the circle is great because

104
00:02:58,493 --> 00:03:01,064
it's just so fantastically <i>round</i>.

105
00:03:01,064 --> 00:03:03,183
Oh, just a quick little side doodle challenge:

106
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,948
A circle can be defined by three points,

107
00:03:04,948 --> 00:03:06,588
so draw three arbitrary points, and then

108
00:03:06,588 --> 00:03:08,474
try to find the circle that they belong to.

109
00:03:08,474 --> 00:03:10,601
So, one of the things that intrigues me about the circle game

110
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:12,793
is that whenever you have one of these sorts of "corners,"

111
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:13,948
you know there's going to be

112
00:03:13,948 --> 00:03:16,010
an infinite number of circles heading down into it.

113
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,812
Thing is, for every one of those infinite circles,

114
00:03:17,812 --> 00:03:19,714
you create a few more little corners

115
00:03:19,714 --> 00:03:21,900
that are gonna need an infinite number of circles,

116
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,602
and for every one of those and so on.

117
00:03:23,602 --> 00:03:27,027
You just get an incredible number of circles breeding more circles,

118
00:03:27,027 --> 00:03:30,094
and you can see just how dense infinity can be.

119
00:03:30,094 --> 00:03:32,102
Though, the astounding thing is that this kind of infinity

120
00:03:32,102 --> 00:03:34,800
is still the smallest countable kind of infinity, and

121
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,819
there are kinds of infinity that are just mind-bogglingly infinite-er.

122
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,770
But wait, here's an interesting thing:

123
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,706
if you call *this distance* "One Arbitrary Length Unit,"

124
00:03:42,706 --> 00:03:45,208
then *this distance* plus <i>this,</i> dot dot dot...

125
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:48,092
is an infinite series that approaches ONE.

126
00:03:48,092 --> 00:03:51,555
And this is another, different, series that still approaches one.

127
00:03:51,555 --> 00:03:53,333
And here's another, and another,

128
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,974
and as long as the outside shape is well defined,

129
00:03:55,974 --> 00:03:57,238
so will the series be.

130
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:58,740
But if you want the "simple" kind of series

131
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,141
where each circle's diameter is

132
00:04:00,141 --> 00:04:02,411
a certain percentage of the one before it,

133
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:04,316
you get straight lines. Which makes sense

134
00:04:04,316 --> 00:04:06,552
if you know how the slope of the straight line is defined.

135
00:04:06,552 --> 00:04:08,497
This is good, because it suggests a WONDERFUL,

136
00:04:08,497 --> 00:04:11,449
mathematical, and doodle-able way to solve our camel problem

137
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:13,005
with no calculations necessary.

138
00:04:13,005 --> 00:04:14,874
If instead of camels, we had circles,

139
00:04:14,874 --> 00:04:17,419
we could make the right infinite series just by drawing an angle

140
00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:20,073
that ends where the page does, and filling it up.

141
00:04:20,073 --> 00:04:22,337
Replace circles with camels, and voila!

142
00:04:22,337 --> 00:04:23,666
Infinite Saharan caravan,

143
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,346
fading into the distance,

144
00:04:25,346 --> 00:04:27,170
no numbers necessary!

145
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,905
Well, I have an infinite amount of

146
00:04:28,905 --> 00:04:31,330
information I'd like to share with you in this last sentence.

147
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,692
Maybe it'll still fit in the next five seconds

148
00:04:32,692 --> 00:04:33,844
if I say the next phrase twice as fast,

149
00:04:33,844 --> 00:04:34,678
(and the next phrase twice as fast as that)

150
00:04:34,678 --> 00:04:35,955
(and the next... *high pitched garble*)
