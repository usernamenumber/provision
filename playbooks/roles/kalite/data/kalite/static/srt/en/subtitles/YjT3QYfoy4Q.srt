1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690
   

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,050
We're asked to determine the
solution set of this system,

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,700
and we actually have three
inequalities right here.

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,470
A good place to start is just to
graph the solution sets for

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,390
each of these inequalities and
then see where they overlap.

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,250
And that's the region of the
x, y coordinate plane that

7
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,850
will satisfy all of them.

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,450
So let's first graph y is equal
to 2x plus 1, and that

9
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,850
includes this line, and then
it's all the points greater

10
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:25,990
than that as well.

11
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,820
So the y-intercept
right here is 1.

12
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,259
If x is 0, y is 1, and
the slope is 2.

13
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,400
If we move forward in the
x-direction 1, we move up 2.

14
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:40,830
If we move forward 2, we'll
move up 4, just like that.

15
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,920
So this graph is going to look
something like this.

16
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,970
Let me graph a couple more
points here just so that I

17
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,460
make sure that I'm drawing
it reasonably accurately.

18
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,180
So it would look something
like this.

19
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:55,430
   

20
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,380
That's the graph of y is
equal to 2x plus 1.

21
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:02,200
Now, for y is greater than or
equal, or if it's equal or

22
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,879
greater than, so we have to put
all the region above this.

23
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,490
For any x, 2x plus 1 will be
right on the line, but all the

24
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,760
y's greater than that
are also valid.

25
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,240
So the solution set of that
first equation is all of this

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,510
area up here, all of the area
above the line, including the

27
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,650
line, because it's greater
than or equal to.

28
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,900
So that's the first inequality
right there.

29
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,790
Now let's do the second
inequality.

30
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:32,170
The second inequality is y
is less than 2x minus 5.

31
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:35,360
So if we were to graph 2x minus
5, and something already

32
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,280
might jump out at you
that these two are

33
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,150
parallel to each other.

34
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,340
They have the same slope.

35
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,020
So 2x minus 5, the y-intercept
is negative 5. x is 0, y is

36
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,830
negative 1, negative 2, negative
3, negative 4,

37
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:46,950
negative 5.

38
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,710
Slope is 2 again.

39
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,880
And this is only less than,
strictly less than, so we're

40
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,360
not going to actually
include the line.

41
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,240
The slope is 2, so it will
look something like that.

42
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,250
It has the exact same slope
as this other line.

43
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,730
So I could draw a bit of a
dotted line here if you like,

44
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,120
and we're not going to include
the dotted line because we're

45
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,270
strictly less than.

46
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,420
So the solution set for this
second inequality is going to

47
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,130
be all of the area
below the line.

48
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,670
For any x, this is 2x minus 5,
and we care about the y's that

49
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,230
are less than that.

50
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,100
So let me shade that in.

51
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:28,850
So before we even get to this
last inequality, in order for

52
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,610
there to be something that
satisfies both of these

53
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,300
inequalities, it has to be in
both of their solution sets.

54
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,040
But as you can see, their
solutions sets are completely

55
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,640
non-overlapping.

56
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,850
There's no point on the x, y
plane that is in both of these

57
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:42,400
solution sets.

58
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,090
They're separated by this kind
of no-man's land between these

59
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,600
two parallel lines.

60
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,710
So there is actually
no solution set.

61
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,720
It's actually the null set.

62
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,920
There's the empty set.

63
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,430
Maybe we could put an empty set
like that, two brackets

64
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,450
with nothing in it.

65
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,670
There's no solution set
or the solution set of

66
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,290
the system is empty.

67
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,290
We could do the x is
greater than 1.

68
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,955
This is x is equal to 1, so
we put a dotted line there

69
00:03:04,955 --> 00:03:06,930
because we don't want
include that.

70
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,070
So it would be all
of this stuff.

71
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,390
But once again, there's nothing
that satisfies all

72
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,210
three of these.

73
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,630
This area right here satisfies
the bottom two.

74
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,790
This area up here satisfies
the last one

75
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:18,500
and the first one.

76
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,780
But there's nothing that
satisfies both these top two.

77
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,490
Empty set.
