00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,267
In this problem they are telling us the distance the

2
00:00:04,267 --> 00:00:06,733
object travels in outer space is varies directly with

3
00:00:06,733 --> 00:00:13,267
the amount of time it travels. I guess you are talking

4
00:00:13,267 --> 00:00:24,800
about a specific object.

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,600
You think of it in terms of constants of proportionality

6
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:39,333
you can say that the distance = some constant (k) x t

7
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:47,133
t= time it travels for this particular object.

8
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:53,667
if an asteroid travels 3000 miles in 6 hours

9
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:56,333
what is the constant of variation

10
00:00:56,333 --> 00:01:03,800
So the distance is 3000; d = 3000 miles

11
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:13,733
3000 = (k) x 6 hours.

12
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:20,000
So to solve for constant divide both sides by 6hours

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:32,000
so 3000 / 6 = 500 and 6/6 = 1

14
00:01:32,000 --> 99:59:59,999
So the constant of proportionality is 500miles/hour
