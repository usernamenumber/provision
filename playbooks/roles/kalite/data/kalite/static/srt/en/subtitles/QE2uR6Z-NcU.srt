1
00:00:00,015 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's say I have a bag and in that bag I am going to put some green cubes

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,447
and in particular I am going to put 8 green cubes.

3
00:00:11,447 --> 00:00:15,667
I am also going to put some spheres in that bag.

4
00:00:15,667 --> 00:00:20,178
Let's say I am going to put 9 spheres and these are the green spheres

5
00:00:20,178 --> 00:00:22,779
I am also going to put yellow cubes in that bag

6
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:27,867
Some yellow cubes. I am going to put 5 of those.

7
00:00:27,867 --> 00:00:31,067
And I am also going to put some yellow spheres in this bag.

8
00:00:31,067 --> 00:00:35,000
Yellow spheres. Let's say I will put in 7 of those.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,800
I must take them all in this bag. And I am going to shake this bag and

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,519
then I am going to pour them out and I am going to look

11
00:00:40,519 --> 00:00:43,000
at the first object that falls out of that bag.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,667
What I want to think about in this video is:

13
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:48,333
What are the probabilities of getting different types of objects?

14
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,467
So for example what is the probability,

15
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:53,000
what is the probability of getting a cube?

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,800
A cube of any, of any color.

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,800
What is the probability of getting a cube?

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,999
Well to think about that, we should think about what -

19
00:01:00,999 --> 00:01:02,299
Or this is one way to think about it. -

20
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:05,933
What are all of the equally likely possibilities that might pop out of the bag?

21
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:10,200
Well we have 8 plus 9 is 17, 17 plus 5 is 22.

22
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,000
22 + 7 is 29. So we have 29 objects. There are 29 objects in the bag.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,667
Did I do that right? This is 14, yep, 29 objects.

24
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:21,665
So let's draw all of the possible objects.

25
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,867
And I will do this in, I will present this in this big area.

26
00:01:23,867 --> 00:01:26,867
I will represent it as this big area right over here.

27
00:01:26,867 --> 00:01:29,600
So these are all the possible objects.

28
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,800
There are 29 possible objects.

29
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,733
So there is 29 equal possibilities, for the outcome

30
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:38,940
of my experiment of seeing what pops out of that bag.

31
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,933
Assuming that it is equally likely for a cube or a sphere to pop out of that bag first.

32
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:45,067
And how many of them meet our constrain of being a cube?

33
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:49,400
Well I have 8 green cubes and I have 5 yellow cubes.

34
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,943
So there are a total of 13 cubes.

35
00:01:51,943 --> 00:01:54,400
So let me draw that set of cubes.

36
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,467
So there is 13 cubes.

37
00:01:56,467 --> 00:01:57,800
Let's draw it like this.

38
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:03,533
There are 13, 13 cubes.

39
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:06,533
This right here is the set of cubes.

40
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:09,533
And I am not drawing it exact, I am approximating.

41
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:11,000
This represents the set of all the cubes.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,120
So the probability of getting a cube,

43
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,733
is the number of events that meet our criteria,

44
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:19,400
so there is 13 possible cubes that have an equal likely chance of popping out.

45
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,000
Over all of the possible equally likely events, which are 29.

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,067
That includes the cubes and the spheres.

47
00:02:28,067 --> 00:02:29,800
Now let's ask a different question.

48
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,867
What is the probability of getting a yellow?

49
00:02:33,867 --> 00:02:36,333
A yellow object. Either a cube or a sphere.

50
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:40,267
So once again, how many things meet our conditions here?

51
00:02:40,267 --> 00:02:46,200
Well we have 5 plus 7; there is 12 yellows objects in the bag.

52
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,467
So we have 29 equally likely possibilities.

53
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:51,467
I will do that in the same color.

54
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:54,591
We have 29 equally likely possibilities, and of those,

55
00:02:54,591 --> 00:03:01,333
12 meet our criteria. So let's, so let me draw 12 right over here.

56
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:06,108
I will do my best attempt. So that it looks something like...

57
00:03:06,108 --> 00:03:10,533
A set of yellow objects, there are 12.

58
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:14,000
There are 12 objects that are yellow.

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,067
So the 12 that meet our conditions are 12 over all the possibilities, 29.

60
00:03:19,067 --> 00:03:21,400
So probability of getting a cube is 13 over 29.

61
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,133
The probability of getting a yellow 12 29ths.

62
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:28,120
Now let's have something a little bit more interesting.

63
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,000
What is the probability...

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,667
What is the probability of getting a yellow cube?

65
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:35,400
So I will put in yellow. So we care about the color now.

66
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,933
So this thing is yellow.

67
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:41,170
What is the probability of getting a, as my son would say lellow,

68
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:44,514
What is the probability of getting a yellow cube?

69
00:03:44,514 --> 00:03:48,067
Well, there is 29 equally likely possibilities.

70
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:50,800
There is 29 equally likely possibilities.

71
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:56,402
And of those 29 equally likely possibilities, 5 of those are yellow cubes.

72
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,000
Or lellow cubes.

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,186
5 of them. So the probability is 5 29ths.

74
00:04:01,186 --> 00:04:04,808
And where would we see that on this Venn diagram that I have drawn?

75
00:04:04,808 --> 00:04:07,533
And this Venn diagram, this is just a way to visualize the different probabilities.

76
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:11,067
And they become interesting when you start thinking about where sets overlap.

77
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:12,749
Or even where they don't overlap.

78
00:04:12,749 --> 00:04:16,800
So here we are thinking about things that are members of the set yellow,

79
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,600
So there in this set, and they are cubes.

80
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,195
So this area right over here. That is the overlap of these two sets.

81
00:04:25,195 --> 00:04:27,533
So this area right over here.

82
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:31,267
This represents things that are both yellow and a cube.

83
00:04:31,267 --> 00:04:33,067
Because they are inside both circles.

84
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:37,000
So this right over here. Let me write it over here.

85
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,933
So there is 5 objects that are both yellow and,

86
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:45,133
yellow and cubes.

87
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:49,133
Now let's ask, and this is probably the most interesting thing to ask,

88
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:51,400
What is the probability,

89
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:57,400
What is the probability of getting something that is yellow or...

90
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,350
that is yellow or a cube?

91
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,400
A cube of any color.

92
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,867
A cube of any color.

93
00:05:04,867 --> 00:05:08,067
The probability of getting something that is yellow or a cube of any color.

94
00:05:08,067 --> 00:05:11,133
Well we still know that de denominator is going to be 29,

95
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:14,667
these are all of the equally likely possibilities that might jump out of the bag.

96
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:17,933
But what are the possibilities that meet our conditions?

97
00:05:17,933 --> 00:05:20,087
Well, one way to think about it,

98
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:21,666
one way to think about it, is:

99
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:25,467
Well, probably, there is 12 things that would meet the yellow condition.

100
00:05:25,467 --> 00:05:27,657
So that would be this entire circle right over here,

101
00:05:27,657 --> 00:05:29,667
12 things that meet the yellow condition.

102
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:32,000
So this right over here is 12.

103
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,067
This is the number of yellow. That is 12.

104
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:41,171
And then to that, we can't just add the number of cubes.

105
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:43,133
Because if add the number of cubes,

106
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:44,733
we have already counted these 5.

107
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:47,067
With these 5 are counted as part of these 12.

108
00:05:47,067 --> 00:05:48,508
One way to think about it is,

109
00:05:48,508 --> 00:05:51,933
There are 7 yellow objects that are not cubes,

110
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:53,067
those are the spheres.

111
00:05:53,067 --> 00:05:55,846
There are 5 yellow objects that are cubes.

112
00:05:55,846 --> 00:06:00,165
And then, there are 8 cubes that are not yellow.

113
00:06:00,165 --> 00:06:01,200
That is one way to think about it.

114
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,230
So when we counted these 12, the number of yellow,

115
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,133
we counted all of this.

116
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:07,133
So we can't just add the number of cubes to it,

117
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,360
because then we would count this middle part again.

118
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,000
So then we have to essentially count cubes,

119
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
the number of cubes, which is 13,

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,467
13, the number of cubes. Number of cubes.

121
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:20,733
Number of cubes.

122
00:06:20,733 --> 00:06:26,264
I will have to subtract out, this middle section right over here.

123
00:06:26,264 --> 00:06:27,400
Let me do this.

124
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,667
So, subtract out the middle section right over here.

125
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:32,022
So minus 5.

126
00:06:32,022 --> 00:06:39,400
So this is the number, the number of yellow cubes.

127
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,589
It feels weird to write the word yellow in green.

128
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:43,400
The number of yellow cubes.

129
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,329
Or another way to think about it,

130
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:47,000
Or we can just do this math right here.

131
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,459
12 plus 13 minus 5 is what? It is... It is 20.

132
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:54,267
Did I do this right? 12 minus.... Yep it is 20.

133
00:06:54,267 --> 00:06:58,075
So that is one way, you just get this is equal to 20 over 29.

134
00:06:58,075 --> 00:07:00,733
But the more interesting thing than, even than the answer of the probability of getting that,

135
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:05,400
is expressing this in terms of the other probabilities

136
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,800
that we figured out earlier in the video.

137
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,067
So let's think about this a little bit.

138
00:07:10,067 --> 00:07:12,100
We can rewrite this fraction right over here,

139
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:22,933
We can rewrite this as: 12/29, plus 13/29, minus 5/29.

140
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:31,533
And this was the number of yellow over the total possibilities.

141
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:35,133
So this right over here was the probability of getting a yellow.

142
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:39,200
And this right over here was the number of cubes over the total possibilities.

143
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,000
So this is plus the probability of getting, of getting a cube.

144
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,267
The probability of getting a cube.

145
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:50,867
And this right over here was the number of yellow cubes over the total possibilities.

146
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:52,642
So this right over here was

147
00:07:52,642 --> 00:07:59,004
minus the probability of yellow and, and a cube.

148
00:07:59,004 --> 00:07:59,980
And I can write it that way.

149
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,333
The probability of yellow, alright, yellow in yellow,

150
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:10,000
yellow and, yellow and getting a cube.

151
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,667
Yellow and getting a cube.

152
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:14,067
So, and what we have just here,

153
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:15,000
and you can play with the numbers,

154
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,267
the numbers I just used as an example right here.

155
00:08:17,267 --> 00:08:18,400
To make things a little more concrete.

156
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,867
But you can see this is a generalisable thing.

157
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:25,661
If we have the probability of one condition or a number of conditions.

158
00:08:25,661 --> 00:08:26,600
Let me rewrite it.

159
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,608
The probability, and I will just write a little bit more generally here.

160
00:08:29,608 --> 00:08:31,733
This gives us an interesting idea.

161
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:35,067
The probability of getting one condition,

162
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:40,600
of an object being a member of set A, or, or a member of set B,

163
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,494
is equal to the probability that it is a member of set A,

164
00:08:43,494 --> 00:08:47,133
plus the probability that it is a member of set B,

165
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:51,467
minus the probability that it is a member of both.

166
00:08:51,467 --> 00:08:54,933
minus the probability that it is a member of both.

167
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:58,667
This is a really useful result,

168
00:08:58,667 --> 00:09:00,770
and I think it is sometimes called like the addition rule of probability.

169
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,720
But I want to show you it is a completely common sense thing.

170
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,000
The reason why you can't just add these two probabilities,

171
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,067
is because they might have some overlap,

172
00:09:08,067 --> 00:09:09,533
there is a probability of getting both.

173
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:11,467
And if you just added both of these,

174
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,600
you would be double counting that overlap.

175
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,862
Which we have already seen earlier in this video.

176
00:09:15,862 --> 00:09:18,867
So you have to subtract one version of the overlap out,

177
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:21,133
so you are not double counting it.

178
00:09:21,133 --> 00:09:23,200
And I will throw one other idea.

179
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,600
Sometimes you have possibilities that have no overlap.

180
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,000
So let's say this is a set of all possibilities.

181
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,067
This is the set of all possibilities.

182
00:09:32,067 --> 00:09:35,533
And let's say this is the set that meets condition A.

183
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,479
And let's say this is the set that meets condition A.

184
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:40,336
And let's, this is, let me do this in a different color.

185
00:09:40,336 --> 00:09:43,333
And let's say this is the set that meets condition B.

186
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,867
So in this situation there is no overlap.

187
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:48,800
There is no way; nothing is a member of both set A and B.

188
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,667
So in this situation, the probability of A and B is 0.

189
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:53,850
There is no overlap.

190
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:58,355
And these type of conditions, or these two events,

191
00:09:58,355 --> 00:10:00,733
are called mutually exclusive.

192
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:05,646
Mutually Exclusive.

193
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:07,271
So if events are mutually exclusive that means

194
00:10:07,271 --> 00:10:11,219
that they both cannot happen at the same time.

195
00:10:11,219 --> 00:10:15,538
It is... There is no event that meets both of these conditions.

196
00:10:15,538 --> 00:10:17,333
And if things are mutually exclusive,

197
00:10:20,266 --> 00:10:23,200
then you can't say the probability of A or B is a probability of A plus B.

198
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,933
Because this thing is zero.

199
00:10:24,933 --> 00:10:27,000
But if things are not mutually exclusive,

200
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,067
you would have to subtract out the overlap.

201
00:10:29,067 --> 00:10:31,800
And the easiest, probably the best to think about it,

202
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,067
is to just always realize that you have to subtract out the overlap,

203
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:37,504
and obviously if something is mutually exclusive,

204
00:10:37,504 --> 99:59:59,999
The probability of getting A and B is going to be 0.

205
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's say I have a bag and in that bag I am going to put some green cubes
