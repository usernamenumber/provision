99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Today we're going to take a look at this

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
DVD player. We're gonna see what's inside

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and what makes it work.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There are several key components to this.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We'll be looking at the power supply,

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the control board, the CD tray as well as

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the laser itself and the external housing.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, let's go ahead and get started.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This DVD player is actually very low cost.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You can buy it for less than $30.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Part of the way they've been able to reduce the cost

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is that the actual chips inside it, needed to make it run, have come down in price

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and and part of it is that they've been able to simplify

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
the components on the board tremendeously.

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Here we go!

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Alright. Take a look at the insides ther.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This piece of metal is just a flat sheet

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which was run through a press which created these tabs here.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the tabs lock in the housing under the front part.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then it also had these indentation stamped in it,

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the screws would sit flush.

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then the holes were punched in it and it was folded.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Ok, so you can see inside the DVD player here.
