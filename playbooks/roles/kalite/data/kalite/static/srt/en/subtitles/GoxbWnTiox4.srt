1
00:00:00,417 --> 00:00:05,337
Here is the dot structure of ethyne molecule, also called acetylene molecule.

2
00:00:05,337 --> 00:00:07,536
and we can see there is triple bond present now.

3
00:00:07,536 --> 00:00:10,965
and each carbon is only bonded to two atoms this time.

4
00:00:10,965 --> 00:00:12,366
So look at this carbon on the left and

5
00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:14,687
it is bonded to two other atoms.

6
00:00:14,687 --> 00:00:17,612
So I can see that the fact that there is triple bond here

7
00:00:17,612 --> 00:00:20,449
and the fact that is bonded to two other atoms.

8
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:24,401
It would make me think of different type of hybridization, right?

9
00:00:24,401 --> 00:00:27,417
This can't be sp3 or sp2 hybridization.

10
00:00:27,417 --> 00:00:30,195
Let's look at the orbital notation.

11
00:00:30,195 --> 00:00:33,694
This way we can figure out the type of hybridization here.

12
00:00:33,694 --> 00:00:36,367
So once again, this shows the excited states

13
00:00:36,367 --> 00:00:38,064
for the valence electrons of carbon, right?

14
00:00:38,064 --> 00:00:39,947
So the four valence electrons.

15
00:00:39,947 --> 00:00:44,178
One of the electrons on the 2s orbital has already been promoted to 2p orbital.

16
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:46,852
For the example of acetylenes,

17
00:00:46,852 --> 00:00:48,939
its carbons are bonded to two other atoms.

18
00:00:48,939 --> 00:00:52,293
We need to form two, new hybridized orbitals.

19
00:00:52,293 --> 00:00:54,085
and we are going to form those hybridized orbitals

20
00:00:54,085 --> 00:00:56,647
by promoting, the s-orbital.

21
00:00:56,647 --> 00:00:59,264
So, this is the s-orbital with one valence electron.

22
00:00:59,264 --> 00:01:02,617
and demoting this time only one of the p-orbitals.

23
00:01:02,617 --> 00:01:04,942
We are good to demote one of the p-orbitals, right?

24
00:01:04,942 --> 00:01:06,448
with one valence electron.

25
00:01:06,448 --> 00:01:09,744
That leaves two p-orbitals untouched.

26
00:01:09,744 --> 00:01:12,791
So, we are going to leave these two p-orbitals unhybridized up here.

27
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:15,863
So, we are going to take one s-orbital and one p-orbital

28
00:01:15,863 --> 00:01:17,595
and we are going to hybridize them together.

29
00:01:17,595 --> 00:01:21,949
to create two sp-hybrid orbitals.

30
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:23,250
so there is s-orbital on the left,

31
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,722
what used to be s-orbital is now sp-hybrid orbital.

32
00:01:26,722 --> 00:01:29,288
This p-orbital on the right is no longer p-orbital,

33
00:01:29,288 --> 00:01:31,605
it is now sp-hybrid oribital.

34
00:01:31,605 --> 00:01:36,347
Since we formed our new orbitals from one s-orbital and one p-orbital, right?

35
00:01:36,347 --> 00:01:38,065
this is called sp-hybridization.

36
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:42,940
so sp hybri-di-zation, like that.

37
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:47,266
and when you see a triple bond present, right?

38
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:51,001
you know that this carbon on the left is sp-hybridized

39
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:54,384
and the carbon atom on the right is also sp-hybridized.

40
00:01:54,384 --> 00:01:58,215
so we have our new sp-hybrid orbitals

41
00:01:58,215 --> 00:02:01,613
which must therefore have 50% s-character right?

42
00:02:01,613 --> 00:02:04,414
and 50% p-character.

43
00:02:04,414 --> 00:02:09,047
so the shape of sp-hybrid orbital is going to look a little bit more like

44
00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:11,502
like an s orbital than our previous examples.

45
00:02:11,502 --> 00:02:15,749
right? so it's still going to have two lobes.

46
00:02:15,749 --> 00:02:17,580
The front lobe and the back lobe.

47
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,751
Just like we saw in sp3 and sp2.

48
00:02:19,751 --> 00:02:22,744
The difference is we increased the amount of s-character even more.

49
00:02:22,744 --> 00:02:24,874
Now we are up to 50% s-character.

50
00:02:24,874 --> 00:02:29,050
right? and since s-orbitals are spherely shaped and smaller than p-orbitals.

51
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,405
we can expect these lobes to be a little bit smaller as well.

52
00:02:32,405 --> 00:02:34,504
so we can expect the lobe to be a little bit smaller.

53
00:02:34,504 --> 00:02:39,605
once again we are going to ignore the back lobe which we are drawing so that it doesn't confuse us.

54
00:02:39,605 --> 00:02:43,257
All right. So 50 s-character and 50% p-character.

55
00:02:43,257 --> 00:02:49,390
If i want to draw a picture showing the acetylene molecule and showing with its sp-hybridized orbitals right?

56
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,973
So, here is our acetylene molecule.

57
00:02:50,973 --> 00:02:53,843
Now we know that each carbon has sp-hybridized.

58
00:02:53,843 --> 00:02:59,395
which means that each carbon is going to have two sp-hybrid orbitals around it.

59
00:02:59,395 --> 00:03:03,504
So, these maybe two sp-hybrid oribitals around it.

60
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:07,147
Each sp-hybrid orbital contains one valence electron.

61
00:03:07,147 --> 00:03:08,448
Let's go ahead and draw that.

62
00:03:08,448 --> 00:03:12,217
S,o we are going to draw this acetylene molecule showing sp-hybrid orbitals.

63
00:03:12,217 --> 00:03:14,379
Here is one of the carbons of acetylene.

64
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:18,443
and each carbon has two sp-hybrid orbitals

65
00:03:18,443 --> 00:03:20,933
so here is one of the sp-hybrid orbitals.

66
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:23,170
so once again I'm ignoring the back lobe here.

67
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,266
and here is the other sp-hybrid orbital.

68
00:03:27,266 --> 00:03:29,687
Each orbital has one valence electron.

69
00:03:29,687 --> 00:03:33,527
So, we are going to put our valence electrons in there.

70
00:03:33,527 --> 00:03:35,879
For the acetylene molecule, there is another carbon.

71
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,534
It also is sp-hybridized.

72
00:03:38,534 --> 00:03:40,519
So I'm going to draw this carbon with its sp-hybridized

73
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:43,038
meaning, there is one sp-hybrid orbital.

74
00:03:43,038 --> 00:03:45,089
There is another sp-hybrid orbital.

75
00:03:45,089 --> 00:03:47,903
I'm ignoring the back lobe, so it's not confusing.

76
00:03:47,903 --> 00:03:51,210
Each sp-hybrid orbital has one valence electron.

77
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,664
So, I'm going ahead and put one valence electron in each.

78
00:03:53,664 --> 00:03:57,989
Alright. For the acetylene molecule, I have two hydrogens.

79
00:03:57,989 --> 00:03:59,870
One hydrogen is on the carbon on the left.

80
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,731
and one hydrogen is on the carbon on the right.

81
00:04:01,731 --> 00:04:04,389
so I know that hydrogen has one valence electron.

82
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:07,366
and that valence electron is in s-orbital.

83
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:09,096
s-orbitals are shaped like spheres.

84
00:04:09,096 --> 00:04:11,549
so here is the s-orbital for the hydrogen atom.

85
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:15,628
and then here is the valence electron for the hydrogen atom.

86
00:04:15,628 --> 00:04:20,094
So, go ahead and put in hydrogen atom over here, like that.

87
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:23,626
Let's go back up here to our orbital diagram, right?

88
00:04:23,626 --> 00:04:28,673
so we can see that each sp-hybridized carbon has

89
00:04:28,673 --> 00:04:32,386
two un-hybridized p-orbitals.

90
00:04:32,386 --> 00:04:35,078
Each of those un-hybridized p-orbitals

91
00:04:35,078 --> 00:04:37,811
has a valence electron in it.

92
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:40,321
Let's go ahead and draw that down here.

93
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,563
This carbon on the left is sp-hybridized.

94
00:04:42,563 --> 00:04:46,528
Therefore, I know it has two un-hybridized p-orbitals.

95
00:04:46,528 --> 00:04:48,671
Each p-orbital shapes like a dumbbell.

96
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:52,138
So, here is one p-orbital.

97
00:04:52,138 --> 00:04:55,068
and I know it has one valence electron in it, like that.

98
00:04:55,068 --> 00:04:58,915
and so I need to draw another un-hybridized p-orbital, right?

99
00:04:58,915 --> 00:05:01,710
So, here is another un-hybridized p-orbital.

100
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,138
and there is this one valence electron.

101
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:07,727
I do the same thing for the carbon on the right.

102
00:05:07,727 --> 00:05:09,573
So, the carbon on the right is also sp-hybridized,

103
00:05:09,573 --> 00:05:13,329
which means it has two un-hybridized p-orbitals.

104
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:17,449
So, here is one un-hybridized p-orbital with a valence electron in it.

105
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:19,107
and then I need one more.

106
00:05:19,107 --> 00:05:22,150
So here is the other p-orbital,

107
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,969
and here is the valence electron.

108
00:05:23,969 --> 00:05:25,758
Let's analyze our diagram

109
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:28,641
and figure out what types of bonds we have.

110
00:05:28,641 --> 00:05:32,109
So, I can see that between my two carbon atoms

111
00:05:32,109 --> 00:05:35,273
there is an overlap of this sp-hybrid orbitals.

112
00:05:35,273 --> 00:05:40,201
Side, uhm, head-on i should say, so that, of course, is a sigma-bond, right?

113
00:05:40,201 --> 00:05:42,948
The sigma bond comes from the head-on overlapped orbitals.

114
00:05:42,948 --> 00:05:46,381
I can see this is also a sigma-bond

115
00:05:46,381 --> 00:05:50,046
between the sp-hybridized orbital of the carbon,

116
00:05:50,046 --> 00:05:51,972
and s-orbital of the hydrogen.

117
00:05:51,972 --> 00:05:55,270
and there is a sigma-bond over here as well.

118
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,505
So, I can immediately see

119
00:05:56,505 --> 00:06:01,396
there are three sigma bonds in the acetylene molecule.

120
00:06:01,396 --> 00:06:05,641
When I look at the p-orbitals, right?

121
00:06:05,641 --> 00:06:08,674
so these p-orbitals here can never overlap head-on

122
00:06:08,674 --> 00:06:09,498
but if they were big enough,

123
00:06:09,498 --> 00:06:11,167
and they got close enough together in space,

124
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:15,487
you can see there be side-by-side overlap of those p-orbitals.

125
00:06:15,487 --> 00:06:17,672
So, we call that pi-bonds, right?

126
00:06:17,672 --> 00:06:19,025
So, there is one pi-bond

127
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:20,966
resulting from the side-by-side overlap

128
00:06:20,966 --> 00:06:22,882
of those two p-orbitals.

129
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,575
and if you look over here there is also an opportunity

130
00:06:25,575 --> 00:06:28,872
for these p-orbitals to overlap side-by-side.

131
00:06:28,872 --> 00:06:32,023
So, there is another pi-bond in the molecule.

132
00:06:32,023 --> 00:06:34,179
So, there is a total of two pi-bonds.

133
00:06:34,179 --> 00:06:35,715
There are three sigma-bonds,

134
00:06:35,715 --> 00:06:39,185
and two pi-bonds in the molecule.

135
00:06:39,185 --> 00:06:41,904
Let's go back to the sigma-bond really quickly.

136
00:06:41,904 --> 00:06:43,100
So, look at this sigma-bond

137
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,698
one that is between my two carbon atoms, right?

138
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:49,837
This sigma-bond are formed from two sp-hybrid orbitals,

139
00:06:49,837 --> 00:06:53,311
which we know are smaller than sp3 or sp2.

140
00:06:53,311 --> 00:06:54,998
And, that's the reason why

141
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,694
you are going to see a triple bond

142
00:06:56,694 --> 00:07:01,641
being shorter than a double bond or a single bond

143
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:03,477
that has to do with the sp-hybrid orbitals.

144
00:07:03,477 --> 00:07:06,386
Go ahead and sketch out the dot structure really fast, right?

145
00:07:06,386 --> 00:07:09,044
We can see the triple bond there between the carbon atoms.

146
00:07:09,044 --> 00:07:13,594
And, if we analyze these bonds here,

147
00:07:13,594 --> 00:07:14,513
Let's do that really quickly.

148
00:07:14,513 --> 00:07:17,232
So, if I look at the dot structure,

149
00:07:17,232 --> 00:07:20,819
and I'm trying to figure out how many sigma or pi-bonds I have,

150
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:23,631
all I have to do is to count of the single bonds,

151
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:26,782
and now that will tell me how many sigma-bonds I have.

152
00:07:26,782 --> 00:07:29,114
So, here is the single bond, that is the sigma-bond.

153
00:07:29,114 --> 00:07:32,147
Here is the single bond, that is a sigma bond.

154
00:07:32,147 --> 00:07:35,075
and here is the triple bond between my carbons.

155
00:07:35,075 --> 00:07:37,996
I know that one of those bonds is a sigma-bond.

156
00:07:37,996 --> 00:07:40,323
This doesn't really matter which one you say it is

157
00:07:40,323 --> 00:07:41,474
for the dot structure.

158
00:07:41,474 --> 00:07:43,044
So, I'm just going to say this one, right?

159
00:07:43,044 --> 00:07:46,066
So, that gives me my three sigma-bonds.

160
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,963
What I'm trying to figure out is pi-bonds,

161
00:07:47,963 --> 00:07:52,198
I know that the triple bond, there is one sigma-bond and two pi-bonds,

162
00:07:52,198 --> 00:07:55,011
so these must represent my pi-bonds.

163
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:58,200
So, those are my two pi-bonds, like that.

164
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,242
and so once again, for a triple bond, right?

165
00:08:01,242 --> 00:08:03,239
this is going to be the shortest bond like

166
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:07,494
due to the fact that the sigma-bond comes from the overlap,

167
00:08:07,494 --> 00:08:11,794
the head-on overlap of two sp hybrid orbitals.

168
00:08:11,794 --> 00:08:15,575
When I think about the bond angles,

169
00:08:15,575 --> 00:08:17,237
When I think about the bond angle

170
00:08:17,237 --> 00:08:20,041
between this hydrogen and this carbon, and this carbon here.

171
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,112
I can see that it's going to be, right?

172
00:08:23,112 --> 00:08:25,823
this is a straight line over here in my diagram

173
00:08:25,823 --> 00:08:27,975
so, let me see if i can draw this really fast, right?

174
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:31,907
so this is a straight line, running through

175
00:08:31,907 --> 00:08:34,291
all of these atoms, right here.

176
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:38,849
So, therefore, the bond I go must be 180 degrees.

177
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:41,403
So, I have 180 degrees here.

178
00:08:41,403 --> 00:08:47,214
and you can see that that straight line runs through all my sp-hybrid orbitals.

179
00:08:47,214 --> 00:08:49,031
So, it's those hybrid orbitals

180
00:08:49,031 --> 00:08:51,185
that are going to determine the geometry.

181
00:08:51,185 --> 00:08:53,790
The pi-bonds will help to stabilize that

182
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,242
and prevent any free rotation, right?

183
00:08:56,242 --> 00:08:59,257
So, the pi-bonds are going to make sure

184
00:08:59,257 --> 00:09:05,078
that the triple bond cannot undergo any kind of free rotation.

185
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:07,281
Let's do one example

186
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:09,204
to sum up everything we have learned about

187
00:09:09,204 --> 00:09:13,254
sp3-hybridization, sp2 and sp.

188
00:09:13,254 --> 00:09:16,328
So, if I start with just drawing

189
00:09:16,328 --> 00:09:18,060
of a molecule here.

190
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,028
Let's go ahead and put in some carbons

191
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:25,240
right? and some hydrogens like that.

192
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,846
So, here we have a molecule.

193
00:09:28,846 --> 00:09:32,824
and let's try to answer a few questions about this molecule.

194
00:09:32,824 --> 00:09:36,490
The first question would be to identify the hybridization state

195
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,996
of each carbon, right?

196
00:09:37,996 --> 00:09:42,725
So, if I look at this carbon, right?

197
00:09:42,725 --> 00:09:44,958
I can see that there is a double-bond present,

198
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:48,060
so I can immediately see it's sp2-hybridized.

199
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,723
The same thing for this carbon, right?

200
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:53,559
It also has a double-bond, so it's sp2-hybridized.

201
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,588
This carbon over here

202
00:09:56,588 --> 00:09:59,095
This one only has a single bond around it.

203
00:09:59,095 --> 00:10:02,011
So, we saw in a video of sp3-hybridization that

204
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:04,343
this carbon must be sp3-hybridized.

205
00:10:04,343 --> 00:10:06,138
and we've just seen in this video

206
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:11,559
how if you have a triple bond present, those carbons must be sp-hybridized.

207
00:10:12,204 --> 00:10:13,200
All right, next.

208
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,149
Let's think about the shape and also the bond angle.

209
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:20,294
So, we think about

210
00:10:20,294 --> 00:10:24,229
Let's start with sp3-hybridized carbon

211
00:10:24,229 --> 00:10:28,849
we saw in sp3 in the video of sp3-hybridization

212
00:10:28,849 --> 00:10:34,511
that the atoms around it want to try to adopt the tetrahedral bond angle,

213
00:10:34,511 --> 00:10:38,297
and try to get as close as possible to 109.5 degrees.

214
00:10:38,297 --> 00:10:40,522
So, that takes care of sp3-hybridization.

215
00:10:40,522 --> 00:10:42,812
sp2-hybridization, right?

216
00:10:42,812 --> 00:10:46,300
We saw that that's going to give us a trigonal planar geometry

217
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,361
for the atoms around those carbons

218
00:10:48,361 --> 00:10:52,751
with the bond angle approximately 120 degrees.

219
00:10:52,751 --> 00:10:55,782
For sp-hybridization, we saw in this video,

220
00:10:55,782 --> 00:11:00,011
that's going to be linear, which is why I've drawn the dot structure in linear

221
00:11:00,011 --> 00:11:03,175
and giving us the bond angle of 180 degrees.

222
00:11:03,175 --> 00:11:08,861
Finally, let's count up the number of sigma- and pi-bonds in this molecule.

223
00:11:08,861 --> 00:11:12,043
So, I'm going to start with the number of sigma-bonds.

224
00:11:12,043 --> 00:11:15,027
So, all I have to do is to count up my single bonds.

225
00:11:15,027 --> 00:11:19,578
so this is a, this is one, two, three,

226
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:25,196
for a double-bond, I know one of those is a sigma-bond from my video on sp2-hybridization.

227
00:11:25,196 --> 00:11:30,646
so four, five, six, seven, eight

228
00:11:30,646 --> 00:11:31,899
nine, and then,

229
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:37,651
in this video, we saw that for triple bond, one of those is sigma-bond, right?

230
00:11:37,651 --> 00:11:39,584
so one of those is a sigma-bond there,

231
00:11:39,584 --> 00:11:42,232
so there is a total of ten, sigma-bonds.

232
00:11:42,232 --> 00:11:43,977
so we just count 10 sigma-bonds.

233
00:11:43,977 --> 00:11:45,700
What about pi-bonds?

234
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,418
Well, those will be the ones that are left, right?

235
00:11:47,418 --> 00:11:50,535
So, for the double-bond, you have one sigma-bond and one pi-bond.

236
00:11:50,535 --> 00:11:52,381
So, this should be a pi-bond.

237
00:11:52,381 --> 00:11:55,978
For triple bond, we have one sigma-bond and two pi-bonds.

238
00:11:55,978 --> 00:12:00,553
So, there are total of three pi-bonds for this molecule.

239
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:04,344
So, this is the type of question that you are usually asked

240
00:12:04,344 --> 00:12:07,711
in a test for organic chemistry.

241
00:12:07,711 --> 00:12:10,148
You should be able to analyze an organic molecule in this way

242
00:12:10,148 --> 00:12:14,067
it's an important skill for later in the course.
