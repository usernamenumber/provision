1
00:00:00,644 --> 00:00:07,028
Express d times 4d to the fourth to the one half power as a radical expression.

2
00:00:07,028 --> 00:00:10,480
So the key thing to realise here is that if I take anything

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,744
to the one half power by definition, this is the

4
00:00:14,744 --> 00:00:17,177
same thing as taking the principle root

5
00:00:17,177 --> 00:00:19,133
of that anything.

6
00:00:19,133 --> 00:00:20,762
So let's just apply that here we have

7
00:00:20,762 --> 00:00:23,361
4d to the fourth raised to the one half power.

8
00:00:23,361 --> 00:00:25,780
So this part, right over here, let me do it in two different colours,

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,343
so I have d right over there,

10
00:00:28,343 --> 00:00:31,448
and the I have 4d to the fourth raised to the one half power

11
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:35,061
which by definition is the principle root,

12
00:00:35,061 --> 00:00:39,310
of 4d to the fourth and we explore other videos

13
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,446
while this all works out well with exponent properties.

14
00:00:42,446 --> 00:00:45,028
Now we know how to simplify this right here.

15
00:00:45,028 --> 00:00:46,765
We are looking for the principle root of

16
00:00:46,765 --> 00:00:51,910
this is the same thing, this is the same thing as d

17
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:56,311
times the principle root of 4 times the principle root

18
00:00:56,311 --> 00:01:01,397
of d to the fourth, times the principle root of d to the fourth

19
00:01:01,397 --> 00:01:05,177
The principle root of four, principle root of four is

20
00:01:05,177 --> 00:01:07,828
2, and we have that d out front.

21
00:01:07,828 --> 00:01:11,261
And the principle root of d to the 4th power is the

22
00:01:11,261 --> 00:01:14,496
I should do it as a positive square root of d to the four

23
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:18,107
That is d squared, and we don't have to put an absolute value here,

24
00:01:18,107 --> 00:01:21,417
because even if d is a negative value,

25
00:01:21,417 --> 00:01:25,194
d squared will still be a positive value.

26
00:01:25,194 --> 00:01:27,378
And if this was a d squared here,

27
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:29,612
then we would have to think about the absolute value over here.

28
00:01:29,612 --> 00:01:32,861
And then, just to simplify this we have a d times

29
00:01:32,861 --> 00:01:36,812
a 2 times a d squared that's multiply the d's times each other

30
00:01:36,812 --> 00:01:39,194
same base, that become d to the third.

31
00:01:39,194 --> 00:01:43,894
So this becomes 2 times d to the third power.

32
00:01:43,894 --> 00:01:46,444
Now another way you could have done this is

33
00:01:46,444 --> 00:01:48,444
to just straight use the exponent properties.

34
00:01:48,444 --> 00:01:50,610
You could have said that that is the same thing as

35
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,529
d times and inside the parenthesis

36
00:01:53,529 --> 00:01:56,911
If you take the product of things and then raise them

37
00:01:56,911 --> 00:01:59,509
to an exponent, that's the same thing as raising

38
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:01,379
each of them individually to the exponent

39
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:03,229
and then taking the product.

40
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:04,595
So that's the same thing

41
00:02:04,595 --> 00:02:06,245
so I'm gonna rewrite this part right over here

42
00:02:06,245 --> 00:02:07,946
as 4 to the one half power

43
00:02:07,946 --> 00:02:13,130
times d to the fourth to the one half power

44
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,494
and 4 to the one half power, this is literally just

45
00:02:16,494 --> 00:02:20,860
the principle square root of 4 which is 2 and d to the fourth

46
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,011
to the one half power, this is, again

47
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:25,812
you can use exponent property, if I have something

48
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,578
raised to some power and then I have it raised to

49
00:02:28,578 --> 00:02:30,861
another power, this is the same thing as

50
00:02:30,861 --> 00:02:35,011
that same base raised to the product of these powers

51
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:37,056
Let me prove it in other videos.

52
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:39,737
So this right over here, this expression right over here

53
00:02:39,737 --> 00:02:45,011
is going to be equal to d to the 4 times one half power.

54
00:02:45,011 --> 00:02:47,111
What's 4 times one half?

55
00:02:47,111 --> 00:02:50,261
Well that's just 2! So this simplifies once again

56
00:02:50,261 --> 00:02:54,812
d times 2 times d squared, which is 2 d to the 3rd power.
