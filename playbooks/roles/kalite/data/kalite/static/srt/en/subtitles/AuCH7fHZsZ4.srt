00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
The word arbitrage sounds very fancy, but it's actually a very simple idea.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:13,892
It's really just taking advantage of differences in price on essentially the same thing to make risk-free profits.

3
00:00:13,892 --> 00:00:14,954
Let's think about it a little bit.

4
00:00:14,954 --> 00:00:19,800
Let's say in one part of town, there's some type of a market.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,933
Let's say it's a market for apples.

6
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:36,215
And let's say that in that market apples sell for $1 per apple.

7
00:00:36,215 --> 00:00:42,467
And let's say in another part of town you have another market.

8
00:00:42,467 --> 00:00:52,333
And in that other part of town, the apples sell for $1.50 per apple.

9
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,867
So how could you take advantage...?

10
00:00:53,867 --> 00:00:58,533
And we're going to assume that these apples are completely identical apples.

11
00:00:58,533 --> 00:01:05,548
How could you take advantage in this price difference on these identical things to make a risk-free profit?

12
00:01:05,548 --> 00:01:11,379
Well ideally, you want to sell the apples in the more expensive market where you can get $1.50/apple.

13
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:16,379
And you want to buy apple in the less expensive market where you can get them for $1/apple.

14
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:18,933
And that's exactly what you would do.

15
00:01:18,933 --> 00:01:20,902
You would go to this market over here....

16
00:01:20,902 --> 00:01:28,948
You would buy apples; let's say you buy 10 apples for $10.

17
00:01:28,948 --> 00:01:34,564
And then you would go maybe ride your bicycles to the other market over there

18
00:01:34,564 --> 00:01:36,348
and you would sell your 10 apples.

19
00:01:36,348 --> 00:01:49,221
So this is buy 10 apples for $10, and then you would sell those 10 apples for $15.

20
00:01:49,221 --> 00:01:54,267
And so you would make an immediate risk-free profit of $5.

21
00:01:54,267 --> 00:01:56,271
You are buying for $10 and selling for 15.

22
00:01:56,271 --> 00:01:58,795
And you can just keep doing that over and over again

23
00:01:58,795 --> 00:02:02,933
and on every trip as many apples as your bicycle can carry

24
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:04,682
You will continue to make money.

25
00:02:04,682 --> 00:02:07,348
So this is what arbitrage is.

26
00:02:07,348 --> 00:02:09,133
And just imagine the side effect

27
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:10,733
If someone did this enough,

28
00:02:10,733 --> 00:02:14,477
then this would increase the supply of apples here

29
00:02:14,477 --> 00:02:18,133
so supply would increase in this market

30
00:02:18,133 --> 00:02:20,585
and in this market the demand will increase

31
00:02:20,585 --> 00:02:25,733
because there's someone who keeps buying in this market and selling into that market

32
00:02:25,733 --> 00:02:27,267
So what's eventually going to happen

33
00:02:27,267 --> 00:02:33,005
with the demand increases the price will go up in this market

34
00:02:33,005 --> 00:02:37,800
and when the supply increases in this market, the price will go down.

35
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,200
So in theory the more that you do this the more that you are going to make these prices come closer to each other.

36
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,533
And eventually you won't be able to make any profit at all.

37
00:02:45,533 --> 99:59:59,999
But while there's discrepancy you have an opportunity for arbitrage.
