1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,320
We are on problem 12.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,750
I had to take a pause because I had a hunger pang,

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:05,520
but I had to resist.

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,150
Because I do this thing called the Warrior Diet,

5
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,700
which is more of a way of life-- but anyway,back to the SAT.

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,070
But you shouldn't starve yourself

7
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,930
because you have to feed your brain for the SAT.

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,390
OK, let me draw the x- and y-axis.

9
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,970
Whenever I'm hungry, I just go outside and do some sprints

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,080
because that's the warrior way.

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,420
That's the y-axis.

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,250
But you shouldn't do that

13
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,360
because you're probably still growing.

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,580
I, unfortunately, have stabilized at 5'9".

15
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,600
All right, so let's see,

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,990
they drew something that looks like a parabola,

17
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,460
so I'm going to assume it is without better information.

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,150
So let me draw it.

19
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,150
My thing does not look like a parabola,

20
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,450
but I think you get the point.

21
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,420
And then they draw this rectangle-looking thing.

22
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,520
I'll draw it in another color.

23
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:14,040
Something like that. Let's see, let me label these points.

24
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:30,340
Points q, r, s, this is t.

25
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,840
And they say that this is-- oh, p, p not t.

26
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,120
And this is point negative 1, 0.

27
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,640
Obviously the y is 0 because we're on the x-axis

28
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,990
and that's negative 1 and that's 1.

29
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,000
OK,they tell us in the figure above

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,320
p, q, r, s is a rectangle

31
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,100
and points q and r lie on the graph of y equals ax squared.

32
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,790
And that's this thing, this yellow thing.

33
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,770
Where a is a constant.

34
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,710
If the perimeter of pqrs is 10,what is the value of a?

35
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,010
If we can figure out one ordered pair,

36
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:11,530
if we can figure out one x-y pair that lie on this curve,

37
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,830
we can figure out what the curve is

38
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,650
because we can substitute that y and x

39
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,550
into this equation and solve for a.

40
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,660
Well, do we know any points that are on that?

41
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,330
Well, both r and q are on it,

42
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,890
so if we can figure out the coordinates of r and q,

43
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,430
then we will be set. So what can we do?

44
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,360
Well, they told us a perimeter.

45
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,850
They told us the perimeter of this rectangle.

46
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,270
So what do we know about the rectangle already?

47
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,180
How long is this side right here?

48
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,200
Well, it goes 1 unit to the left on the x-axis

49
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,230
and it goes 1 to the right and it's flat.

50
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:45,370
So that has a width of 2, right?

51
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,670
It's a rectangle, so if that has a width of 2,

52
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,790
this also has a width of 2, right?

53
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,520
Let's call this height.

54
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,080
That's the height of the rectangle.

55
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,230
If that's the height, that's also the height.

56
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,000
So what's the perimeter?

57
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:05,780
The perimeter is 2 plus 2, which is 4, plus h plus h.

58
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,240
And that equals what? They told us that equals 10.

59
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,300
So we can add those h's together.

60
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,170
We get 4 plus 2h is equal to 10.

61
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,080
Or subtract 4 from both sides.

62
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:24,850
2h is equal to 6. Divide both sides by 2. h is equal to 3.

63
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,030
So we know that h equals 3.

64
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,550
So if h equals 3, what is the point r?

65
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,410
Well we know that its x-coordinate is 1 out,

66
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,170
so it's 1, and then what's the y-coordinate?

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,520
Well, this height right here is 3, right?

68
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,300
And we're starting at 0,so we go 3 up from 0.

69
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,920
So this is going to be 3 right here.

70
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,210
So the r's coordinate is 1, 3.

71
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,670
And r is on the yellow parabola,so now we are set.

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,560
We can take this and substitute x and y here.

73
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:03,190
We know y is equal to 3 when x is equal to 1.

74
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:07,080
So 1 squared, right? x squared.

75
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,510
So 3 is equal to a times 1 squared is 1.

76
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,380
So a is equal to 3 because that one doesn't matter, right?

77
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,490
a is equal to 3 so we just write down 3 inside there.

78
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:24,800
Next problem. Problem 13.

79
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:39,210
If a times b plus b is equal to a plus 2c,

80
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,800
what is the value of b

81
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:49,860
when a is equal to 2 and c is equal to 3?

82
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,800
So a real quick thing that we can do just to

83
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:57,650
maybe simplify things for us is we can factor out the b

84
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,480
out of this side.

85
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,070
What do I mean by factoring out a b?

86
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,380
Well, divide both of these terms by b

87
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:08,660
and you get b times a plus 1 is equal to a plus 2c.

88
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,750
All right, let me box this out so you don't get confused.

89
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,640
All I did is I undistribute the b,

90
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,570
right? You can multiply this back out

91
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,700
and you'd get ab is equal to b.

92
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,240
And then if you want to solve for b,

93
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,990
divide both sides by a plus 1

94
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:27,560
and you get b is equal to a plus 2c over a plus 1.

95
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,600
And then you substitute.

96
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,340
So a is 2, so it's 2 plus 2 times c,

97
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:40,110
c is 3, 2 times 3 over 2 plus 1,

98
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:46,530
which is equal to 2 plus 6 over 3, which is equal to what?

99
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,320
8/3.

100
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,520
Another way you could have done it--

101
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,880
and it might have been even faster,

102
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,800
actually--is just to substitute from the beginning.

103
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:59,790
So you say a is 2, so that would give us 2b plus b right?

104
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:06,220
I just, a is 2 is equal to 2 plus 2 times c, 2 plus 6.

105
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,340
So you get 2b plus b,so what's 2b plus b?

106
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:14,350
That's 3b. 3b is equal to 2 plus 6, 8.

107
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,700
Actually this would have been faster.

108
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,220
8 divided by 3.

109
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,930
So those are two ways you could have done it,

110
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,860
and hopefully you'll do them one of the two ways.

111
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,580
Hopefully you'll do it the faster way.

112
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:28,620
Next problem. 14.

113
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,490
Bunch of lines for me to draw.

114
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,510
I do so much for you guys.

115
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:41,360
The only thing I get in return is the satisfaction

116
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,530
of you guys getting a perfect score on the SAT.

117
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,220
I'm going to take these videos down before I have kids,

118
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,780
though, so they don't have competition.

119
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,850
Let's see, OK. I'm kidding.

120
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,570
The competition will only make them stronger.

121
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,980
I don't have kids yet, by the way, but one day I will.

122
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,720
And they'll have to compete against you guys,

123
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,940
who I've given this edge to.

124
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,330
That's how selfless I am.

125
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,430
And anyway, back to the problem.

126
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,500
So we have this-- I'm only partially serious.

127
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:29,780
OK, this is l, this is a, b, c.

128
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,960
This is angle y, y degrees.

129
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,160
This out here is angle x, x degrees.

130
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:41,250
In the figure above, m is parallel to n, so this is m,

131
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,200
this is n, they are parallel. Fair enough?

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,220
And l bisects angle abc.

133
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,850
So what does bisect mean?

134
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:58,540
That means that it splits the angle perfectly,

135
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:02,160
so that tells us that angle is equivalent to this angle.

136
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,380
OK?

137
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:16,130
If y is between 45 and 55, what is one possible value for x?

138
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:21,440
So let's just say that y is 50 and see what we can do here.

139
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,900
So if y is 50, right?

140
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,620
That satisfies, this is between 45 and 55.

141
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,130
What is this larger angle here

142
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,280
that I'm going to do in magenta

143
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,680
Well, it's a corresponding angle, right?

144
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,010
Because it's a parallel line,k is a transversal,

145
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,080
so this magenta angle corresponds to y.

146
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,060
So it will also be equal to 50.

147
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,940
And we know l bisects this angle,

148
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,260
so both of these smaller angles are going to be 25 and 25.

149
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,670
And now l is a transversal as well.

150
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:02,380
So if l is 25, this angle right here is 25.

151
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,860
Let me do that in another color.

152
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,840
No, that color was too similar.

153
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,950
I'll do it in red.

154
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:12,210
If this right here is 25, what angle is this going to be?

155
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:16,060
Well once again, corresponding angles of a transversal,

156
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,700
so this is also going to be 25.

157
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,770
And now what could x be?

158
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,380
Well, x is opposite to this angle,

159
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,730
so it's also going to be 25 degrees.

160
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,110
So this is just the angle game on steroids.

161
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,650
And you really didn't have to do the range,

162
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,170
you just pick a number. y is 50,

163
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,000
corresponding angle is also 50.

164
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,490
That corresponding angle is bisected,

165
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,050
so each of these smaller angles is 25.

166
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:42,280
And then l is a transversal again, so if this is 25,

167
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,390
this is 25, and x is opposite.

168
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,550
So it's also 25.

169
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,040
I'll see you in the next video.
