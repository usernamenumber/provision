1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,790
   

2
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:04,540
Let's explore the repercussions
of this

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,590
equation some more.

4
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:06,810
So what was the equation?

5
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,300
It was that the force of a
magnetic field on a moving

6
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,220
charged particle is equal to the
charge-- that's not what I

7
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,860
wanted to do-- is equal to the
charge of the particle-- and

8
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,200
that's just a scalar quantity--
times the

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,520
velocity-- the cross product
of the velocity of the

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,620
particle-- with the
magnetic field.

11
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:35,550
Now, isn't the velocity vector
just the same thing as the

12
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,000
distance vector divided
by time?

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,370
So the velocity vector is equal
to-- let's call the

14
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,280
distance that the electron
travels, l.

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,620
Distance divided by time.

16
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,180
So we could rewrite that, that
the force vector is equal to

17
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,780
the charge times-- and I'm doing
this on purpose-- 1 over

18
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,600
time, right?

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,720
Times the distance vector
taken-- you take the cross

20
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,530
product with the
magnetic field.

21
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:10,730
All I did is I rewrote velocity
as per time times

22
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,140
distance, or distance
per time.

23
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,950
And this is a scalar quantity,
at least for our purposes,

24
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,890
time only has a magnitude.

25
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,660
Maybe we could call
it change in time.

26
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,850
But it doesn't have
a direction.

27
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,470
We're not going at
an angle in time.

28
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,120
So we could take the scalar
quantity out.

29
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,110
It doesn't affect this
vector cross product.

30
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:32,440
So what we get left with is,
force is equal to charge per

31
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,250
time times-- and this is just a
regular times, because this

32
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,010
is just a number, it's not a
vector-- times the cross

33
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:46,420
product of the distance vector
and the magnetic field.

34
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,840
And what is charge per time?

35
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,350
Coulombs per second?

36
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,770
Well, that's just current.

37
00:01:52,770 --> 00:02:00,790
So we get that force is equal to
current times the distance

38
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:08,199
that the current is flowing
along, taken-- and you take

39
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:11,930
the cross product of that
with the magnetic field.

40
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,160
And sometimes this is written as
a capital L because it's a

41
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,940
vector and all that, but we
started with a lower case l,

42
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,660
so we'll stay with
the lower case l.

43
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,750
So let's see if we can apply
this formula, which is really

44
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,580
the same thing as this.

45
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,800
We just took the division by
time and took it out of

46
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,380
velocity so we get distance.

47
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,660
And we took it and we divided
the coulombs, or we took the

48
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,070
charge divided by that.

49
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:36,470
So we took charge divided by
time, or charge per unit of

50
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,770
time, you get current.

51
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,000
So this is really just another
way of writing this.

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,710
It's not even a new formula.

53
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,100
You could almost prove
it to yourself if

54
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,510
you ever forget it.

55
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:52,420
But let's see if we can use this
to figure out the effect

56
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,330
that a magnetic field has on
a current carrying wire.

57
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,520
So let me-- actually, I probably
want to put this up

58
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,550
at the top, just so that I have
space to draw a current

59
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,355
carrying wire.

60
00:03:03,355 --> 00:03:05,640
So let me rewrite it in green.

61
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,220
So you're familiar with the
formula in all colors.

62
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,680
So now our new derivation is
that the force of a magnetic

63
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,280
field on a current carrying wire
is equal to the current

64
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,770
in the wire-- and that's just a
scalar quantity, although it

65
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,760
could be positive or negative
depending on the direction.

66
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,400
Well, current is always a
positive number, but if this

67
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,650
current is going in the opposite
direction as our

68
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,040
distance vector, then it
might be negative.

69
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,810
But I wouldn't worry
about that for now.

70
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,530
Let's just assume this is a
current in the direction of

71
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,080
the distance vector.

72
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,210
So it's a scalar quantity
current times our distance

73
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:47,200
vector l, or maybe the length
of the conductor.

74
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,650
You take the cross product
of l with the

75
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,980
magnetic field vector.

76
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,360
So let's see if we
can apply that.

77
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,430
Let's say that we have a wire.

78
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:02,070
Actually, let's do the magnetic
field first. I've

79
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,130
been doing a lot of magnetic
fields that

80
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,490
pop out of the screen.

81
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,810
Let's do a magnetic field that
goes into the screen.

82
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,310
And those are even
easier to draw.

83
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,080
They're just x's.

84
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,550
Now, why is it an x?

85
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:16,750
Because you're looking at the
rear end of an arrow.

86
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,720
That's why it's an x.

87
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,740
And that's why a circle with a
dot means a field or a vector

88
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,420
coming out of the window.

89
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,750
Because if an arrow was shot at
you, all you would see is

90
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,350
the tip of the arrow
with maybe a little

91
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,140
circle around it.

92
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,160
But anyway, this shows us a
vector going into the screen.

93
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,430
So this is our magnetic field.

94
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,970
That is B.

95
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,620
I don't know, let's
assign some value.

96
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:49,200
Let's say that the magnitude
of B is equal to 1 tesla.

97
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,140
And let's say I have a
wire going through

98
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,300
that magnetic field.

99
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:04,400
Let's say the wire is going
along or it's in the plane of

100
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,800
your computer monitor.

101
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:15,280
Let me just draw a wire going
through the magnetic field.

102
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,210
And my question to you-- let
me tell you a little bit of

103
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,620
information about this wire.

104
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,050
Let's say the wire is
carrying a current.

105
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,670
So I is going in
that direction.

106
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:32,410
And it is carrying a current
of-- I'm just making up

107
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:38,330
numbers-- 5 amperes, or
5 coulombs per second.

108
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:44,060
My question to you is, what is
the net force of this magnetic

109
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,550
field on a section
of this wire?

110
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:50,370
And let's make this section of
the wire, I don't know, let's

111
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,190
say it's a 2 meter
section of wire.

112
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:56,890
   

113
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,720
So obviously the more wire you
have, the more charged moving

114
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,390
particles you'll have. So the
larger a section you have, the

115
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:06,960
more of a force you'll have on
that longer piece of wire.

116
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,540
So we have to pick our length.

117
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,610
So we want to know, what is
the force of the magnetic

118
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,970
field on this section of wire?

119
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:16,590
From here to here.

120
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,910
So let's just go to
this formula.

121
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,200
The force is equal
to the current.

122
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,760
So that's 5 amperes.

123
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,320
And remember, just from what we
learned about electricity,

124
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,390
the current is the direction
that notional positive charges

125
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,090
would travel in, and
suits us fine.

126
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,830
Because when we did the first
equation, we cared about the

127
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,360
direction a positive
charge would go in.

128
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,770
And if it was an electron or a
negative charge, we would put

129
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:38,630
a negative sign there.

130
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,570
So that works fine.

131
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,850
But if you ever have to
visualize things as they maybe

132
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,260
are in reality, but when you
talk about electrons it's hard

133
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,130
to say that they really are
reality, because they're

134
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,310
almost more an idea
than an object.

135
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,760
But it's always good to remember
that when the current

136
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,170
is flowing in this direction,
that would be true.

137
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,820
Because if they were positive
charges moving, but we know

138
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,150
it's a negative charge moving
in the opposite direction.

139
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,960
Or you can think of it
as, maybe, holes.

140
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,490
Well, I don't want
to get into that.

141
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:07,130
But anyway, the current-- you
could visualize it if you like

142
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,770
as positive charges going
in this direction.

143
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,650
So the current is going
this direction.

144
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,170
So you could view this
distance vector

145
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,490
that we care about.

146
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,670
Its magnitude is 2 meters.

147
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,990
Because that's the length
of wire in question.

148
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,700
And its direction is the
direction of the current.

149
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,110
So let me-- this is l.

150
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,990
Sometimes I get a little carried
away on tangents.

151
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,280
So that is l.

152
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,530
   

153
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,100
It's 2 meters in
that direction.

154
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,660
I is 5 amperes.

155
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,050
And we already figured
out that the

156
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,910
magnetic field is 1 tesla.

157
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,950
So what's this going
to be equal to?

158
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:52,180
So the force is going to be
equal to-- we're using all SI

159
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:57,110
units, so we don't have to
convert anything-- 5 amperes

160
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:02,840
times 2 meters in
that direction.

161
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,030
I won't specify right now,
let's just say that's a

162
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,540
magnitude of l.

163
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,530
Actually, let me write it.

164
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:18,220
Well, 2 meters times the
magnetic field, 1 tesla.

165
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,350
And so when you take a cross
product of something, this is

166
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,290
just a reminder.

167
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,050
l cross B.

168
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:29,130
That's equal to the magnitude of
l times the magnitude of B

169
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:35,700
times the sine of the angle
between them times some unit

170
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,299
directional vector that
we figure out with

171
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:38,480
the right hand rule.

172
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,870
So we already did
the magnitude of

173
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,580
the distance vector.

174
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,460
That was 2 meters.

175
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,590
We did the magnitude of
the magnetic field.

176
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,910
And what's the sine of the
angle between them?

177
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,970
Well, if the magnetic field is
going into the screen, if it's

178
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,690
going straight into the screen,
you could imagine a

179
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,550
bunch of arrows shooting
into the screen.

180
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,930
Those are the vectors.

181
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:02,990
While our distance vector, or
this l is in the screen, they

182
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,980
actually are perpendicular,
in 3 dimensions.

183
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,580
So this angle is 90 degrees.

184
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,400
So this actually
just becomes 1.

185
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,280
So in terms of the magnitude,
we're done.

186
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,250
The l cross B magnitude
is 2 times 1 tesla.

187
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,030
And then we multiply that
times the current.

188
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,360
And then we actually have the
magnitude of the force.

189
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,900
The magnitude of this force is
going to be equal to 5 amperes

190
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,570
times 2 meters times 1 tesla.

191
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:30,090
Which is equal to 10 newtons.

192
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,980
And then the only question left
is, what is the direction

193
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,400
of the force that the magnetic
field is exerting?

194
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,360
And this is where we break
out the right hand rule.

195
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,220
And it's no different.

196
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:44,980
You could just imagine one of
the positive particles moving

197
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,950
in that direction, and just
use the right hand rule.

198
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:50,450
So let's take our hand out.

199
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,670
And if we-- let me
draw a hand.

200
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,840
A right hand.

201
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,400
So this is my right hand.

202
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,500
If I have my thumb sticking
out like that.

203
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,550
So the l is going to
be my index finger.

204
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,910
The first thing in the
cross product.

205
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,610
And then the B is the
magnetic field.

206
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,980
That's going into the screen.

207
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,210
So you can't see it.

208
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,710
All you can take my word for it
is that my middle finger is

209
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,390
pointed downwards into the
screen and then my other

210
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,700
fingers are just doing
something else.

211
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,100
And there you have it.

212
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,760
Your thumb is actually the
direction of the force.

213
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,450
   

214
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:31,150
Your index finger is the
direction of-- we'll say l for

215
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,180
these purposes.

216
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,430
And then the magnetic field is
going into it, so you can't

217
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,250
see my middle finger but it's
pointing downwards.

218
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,780
I could draw a little x there,
to show it's going downwards.

219
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,100
And then the force is what
my thumb is doing.

220
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,400
So the force on this wire, or
at least on that section of

221
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,630
wire, is going to be
perpendicular to the direction

222
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,830
of the current.

223
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:52,290
And that direction is going
to be a 10 newton force.

224
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,790
Anyway, I've run out of time.
