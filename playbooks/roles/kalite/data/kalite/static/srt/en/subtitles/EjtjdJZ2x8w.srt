1
00:00:01,867 --> 00:00:07,267
The number of values of theta in the interval from negative pi over two to pi over two,

2
00:00:07,267 --> 00:00:10,133
not including those two since it's got curly parenthesis around it,

3
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:15,667
such that theta does not equal n * pi over five, so it's not a multiple of pi over five,

4
00:00:15,667 --> 00:00:21,867
for n equals zero, plus or minus one, plus or minus two, and tangent of theta is equal to

5
00:00:21,867 --> 00:00:29,133
cotangent of five theta, as well as sin of two theta is equal to cosin of four theta is ?

6
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:33,800
We have to find the number of values of theta that satisfy all of these things.

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,667
So just from the get go it seems we are going to have to solve for thetas and convert between sin and cosin,

8
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:41,600
which is essentially what we are doing between tangent and cotangent.

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,933
Those of you who know me, if you are actually taking an exam under time pressure, I don't recommend you

10
00:00:45,933 --> 00:00:51,933
reproving trig identities from first principles, but for education purposes,

11
00:00:51,933 --> 00:00:57,467
I always like to do it, so let's just draw a right triangle over here.

12
00:00:57,467 --> 00:01:02,333
If you are actually going to take the IIT JEE exam, I recommend having most of the trig identities

13
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:08,733
at your fingertips. But let's say that's a right triangle, and let's call that theta.

14
00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:15,800
And this angle over here is going to be pi over two minus theta. If we are in radians,

15
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,867
ninety degrees right here is pi over two. The whole triangle is one hundred eighty degrees which is pi,

16
00:01:20,867 --> 00:01:27,400
so this is pi over two, so these two guys are going to have to add up to the other pi over two.

17
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,467
So this is pi over two minus theta. So let's think about what cosin of theta is.

18
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:44,667
Cosin of theta. soh - cah - toa. Let's call this a, b, and c. Cosign of theta,

19
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:50,333
it's going to be the adjacent side, let me write down. soh - cah - toa.

20
00:01:51,283 --> 00:01:57,710
Cosin is adjacent over hypotenuse. So cosin of theta is b over c, adjacent over hypotenuse.

21
00:01:57,787 --> 00:02:05,533
What is also equal to b over c? If you look from this angle over here's point of view, b is the opposite

22
00:02:05,533 --> 00:02:10,133
side. So it's opposite over hypotenuse from this angle's point of view.

23
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:18,333
So it's also equal to the sin of pi over two, minus theta. So we've got our first

24
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:26,933
main identity here, that the cosin of theta is equal to the sin of pi over two minus theta.

25
00:02:26,933 --> 00:02:33,133
We can go the other way around, and use the exact same logic to get that the sin of theta is equal

26
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:40,533
to the cosin of pi over two minus theta. So that will be pretty useful when we try to solve this equation.

27
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:46,133
We can even use it when we solve this one, because if I was to write down the cotangent of five theta.

28
00:02:46,133 --> 00:03:03,933
So the cotangent of five theta, is the exact same thing as the cosin of five theta over the

29
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:12,067
sin of five theta. Which is one over the tangent. I can convert the cosin to sin using

30
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:25,067
this identity over here. This is the sin of pi over two minus five theta, over the cosin of pi over

31
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:30,933
two minus five theta. I'm just using this identity over here. This is the exact same thing

32
00:03:30,933 --> 00:03:41,800
as the tangent of pi over two minus five theta. And since we're going to have to solve this equation eventually,

33
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,067
and we want to make sure we get all of the solutions to this equation,

34
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:49,667
one thing you might want to remember is, when we take the tangent of an angle,

35
00:03:49,667 --> 00:03:57,200
and I'll just draw the unit circle here, if I have some angle, let me draw my axes.

36
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,200
And let's say that this right here is theta. You probably remember that theta is essentially the

37
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:12,067
slope of the line formed, it's opposite over adjacent, the slope of the line formed by the radius of

38
00:04:12,067 --> 00:04:17,067
the unit circle. So this theta is going to have the exact same tangent as if we add a hundred eighty

39
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:23,733
degrees. Or if we add pi to this. So if you add pi, you get theta plus pi,

40
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:31,067
So this whole angle over here is theta plus pi. And it's tangent is going to be the same thing.

41
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:36,467
The slope of the radius is going to be the same. So you can add multiples of pi

42
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:39,133
to a tangent value and you are going to get the exact same value.

43
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:47,133
So let me put some multiples of pi over here so we can make sure that we get all of the solutions.

44
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:51,333
So with that said, with this written, we can now solve this first equation over here.

45
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,400
We can worry about some of these other constraints later. Tangent of theta is equal to

46
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:02,533
cotangent of five theta. Well so we can write tangent of theta is equal to, and instead of writing

47
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:10,067
cotangent of five theta we can write, is equal to the tangent of pi over two minus five theta plus

48
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:17,867
integer multiples of pi. And so the tangent of this is equal to the tangent of that, so these things

49
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:28,400
are equal to each other. So we get theta is equal to pi over two minus five theta plus n times pi.

50
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:35,800
Or at minimum when you take the tangent of this it is equal to either the tangent of the same thing

51
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,533
or we could add multiples of pi to it. But now we just have to solve this.

52
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:48,533
We can add five theta to both sides of this equation. So you get six theta is equal

53
00:05:48,533 --> 00:06:00,933
to pi over two plus n pi. Plus multiples of pi. Divide both sides by six.

54
00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:10,000
I get theta is equal to pi over twelve plus n times pi over six. Or just to make the fraction easier,

55
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:19,200
this is the same thing as pi over twelve plus two n pi over twelve.

56
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,000
This is the same thing as n pi over six, I just multiplied the numerator and denominator by two.

57
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:37,533
And this is the exact same thing as 2n plus 1 times pi over 12. So that's all of the solutions

58
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:47,133
for this first equation over there. And let's do the same thing for this second equation

59
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:51,800
and then we'll see where they overlap in this range, and we'll take out anything that satisfies this

60
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:59,333
criteria right over here. So the second equation, let me write it over here, we have sin of two theta.

61
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:07,133
Cosin of four theta, what does that equal to? Cosin of four theta using the same exact logic,

62
00:07:07,133 --> 00:07:15,667
is equal to sin of pi over two minus theta. And of course when we take a sin or cosin, or really we

63
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:20,467
take any trig identity or any trig function of any angle, you're going to get the same

64
00:07:20,467 --> 00:07:25,800
value if you add multiples of two pi. So let me add multiples of two pi here, just so we make sure

65
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:32,467
that we can get all the possible solutions. So this is what cosin of four theta is equal to.

66
00:07:32,467 --> 00:07:51,200
Let me be careful. Cosin of four theta is equal to sin of pi over two minus FOUR theta plus two pi n.

67
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:57,667
You add multiples of two pi you're going to go back to the same angle. So you go back up to this equation

68
00:07:57,667 --> 00:08:06,133
up here, you get sin of two theta, is equal to cosin of four theta, which is equal to this over here,

69
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:18,333
sin of pi over two minus four theta plus two pi n. And so these evaluate to the same thing,

70
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:31,067
let's set them equal to each other. Two theta is equal to pi over two minus four theta plus two pi n.

71
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:43,800
Let's add four theta to both sides of this equation, we get six theta is equal to pi over two, this is cancelled out,

72
00:08:43,800 --> 00:09:03,800
plus two pi n. Let's divide both sides by six, we get theta is equal to pi over twelve plus pi n over

73
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:12,933
three. Now we can put it over a common denominator just to simplify things.

74
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:23,067
We have over twelve, we have this pi. Pi n over three is the same thing as plus 4 n pi over twelve.

75
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:33,733
Or we can write this as being, this is equal to four n plus one times pi over twelve.

76
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:40,000
So now we just need to see where there's overlap between this solution and that solution.

77
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,533
Remember we just have to count the number of solutions, we don't have to find solutions.

78
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:52,333
And you can think about how many of these you're going to have between negative pi over two

79
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:56,133
and pi over two, remember that was the range that we're working with, between negative pi over two

80
00:09:56,133 --> 00:10:01,800
and pi over two, not including those two. And you can figure out every one of these is also

81
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:07,467
going to be one of these. Because no matter what you set n equal to, if you set n equal to

82
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:15,933
twice that you're going to have equivalent things. So anything that satisfies this equation will also

83
00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:21,133
satisfy this equation right here. So really we can just count how many are in this one.

84
00:10:21,133 --> 00:10:25,400
But just to make it clear, I'm going to find all of them that satisfy this equation,

85
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,667
And we're going to see how many of those satisfy this equation as well.

86
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:34,733
But the fast way to do it is to just find or count all the ones that satisfy this one, and you've solved the problem.

87
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:48,133
So let's just count starting at n equals zero. At n equals zero, and I'm using this n up here.

88
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:56,933
If n equals zero we just have pi over twelve, at n equals one we have three pi over twelve.

89
00:10:56,933 --> 00:11:03,600
If n is two you get five pi over twelve. And we can't make n equal three, because

90
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,067
if n was equal to three this would be seven pi over twelve which is greater than pi over two.

91
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:12,933
That's greater than six pi over twelve so we can't have that. We can also go to negative n.

92
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:25,200
If n is negative one, then this becomes negative pi over twelve. If n is negative two,

93
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:33,667
this becomes negative three pi over twelve, and if n is negative three then

94
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:40,133
this becomes negative five pi over twelve. And once again we can't go to n is equal to negative

95
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:44,600
four because then we get negative seven pi over twelve which is out of our range.

96
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:50,467
So this satisfies this equation up here, now which of these overlap with this over here.

97
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:59,933
So let's set n equal to zero, we get pi over twelve. If n is equal to one we get

98
00:11:59,933 --> 00:12:06,000
five pi over twelve. We can't set n equal to two because then we get out of our range.

99
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,200
We'll go above pi over two. If n is equal to negative one, we get negative three pi over twelve.

100
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,267
Is n is equal to negative two then we get negative seven pi over twelve,

101
00:12:17,267 --> 00:12:23,467
which is smaller than negative pi over two so that doesn't count. So if we look over here,

102
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:33,200
we have three solutions, and none of them satisfy this, none of them are multiples of n pi over five.

103
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:41,067
So the answer to our problem is three. And you really could have done this second equation over here,

104
00:12:41,067 --> 00:12:45,667
and realized that anything that is a solution to this top equation is a solution to this bottom equation.

105
00:12:45,667 --> 99:59:59,999
And you would have just counted these solutions and you would have been done.
