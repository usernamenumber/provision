1
00:00:01,678 --> 00:00:03,264
So when you were swimming or showering,

2
00:00:03,264 --> 00:00:04,242
have you ever wondered

3
00:00:04,242 --> 00:00:08,159
why your cells don't fill up with water?

4
00:00:08,159 --> 00:00:10,306
Or why the substances in your cells

5
00:00:10,306 --> 00:00:12,440
don't leak into the pool?

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,485
We actually have a very important structure

7
00:00:15,485 --> 00:00:17,076
that prevents this from happening.

8
00:00:17,076 --> 00:00:20,577
This is what we call the cell membrane.

9
00:00:20,577 --> 00:00:23,344
The cell membrane is what's on the outside of a cell.

10
00:00:23,344 --> 00:00:25,990
If we have a very basic picture of a cell here

11
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,439
with a little nucleus on the inside,

12
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,491
this pink outside layer is what we call the cell membrane.

13
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,709
The cell membrane can protect the cell

14
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:36,196
from the outside environment

15
00:00:36,457 --> 00:00:37,600
and it can determine

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,034
what can enter and leave the cell.

17
00:00:40,034 --> 00:00:44,458
This is a property that we call 'semi-permeability'.

18
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:46,199
It is somewhat permeable.

19
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:49,135
Some things can enter while other things cannot.

20
00:00:49,135 --> 00:00:52,209
This is such an important part of the cell

21
00:00:52,209 --> 00:00:53,273
because it is one of the reasons why

22
00:00:53,273 --> 00:00:55,772
we can actually survive in the world.

23
00:00:55,772 --> 00:00:59,032
So, what actually makes up this structure?

24
00:00:59,032 --> 00:01:02,155
Well, the main building blocks of the cell membrane

25
00:01:02,155 --> 00:01:04,690
are what we call "phospholipids".

26
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:05,938
There are other substances

27
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:07,905
that make up the cell membrane,

28
00:01:07,905 --> 00:01:11,908
but the most important building blocks are phospholipids.

29
00:01:11,908 --> 00:01:14,822
Phospholipids have three major components.

30
00:01:14,822 --> 00:01:17,569
The first is a phosphate head group.

31
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:20,987
The second is a glycerol backbone.

32
00:01:20,987 --> 00:01:25,073
The third are two fatty acid tails.

33
00:01:25,073 --> 00:01:26,204
The way we draw this is

34
00:01:27,111 --> 00:01:30,655
to draw the phosphate head like a head

35
00:01:30,655 --> 00:01:35,273
and the two fatty acid tails like strings from a balloon.

36
00:01:35,273 --> 00:01:36,864
The way I remember this is that

37
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:38,490
the phospholipid looks like a balloon,

38
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,547
but with two strings instead of one.

39
00:01:40,547 --> 00:01:42,365
Now, where's our glycerol backbone?

40
00:01:42,365 --> 00:01:44,487
Well, our glycerol backbone is actually

41
00:01:44,487 --> 00:01:45,827
what it sounds like.

42
00:01:45,827 --> 00:01:49,641
It holds the fatty acid tails to the phosphate head.

43
00:01:49,641 --> 00:01:51,405
It's the backbone of this molecule.

44
00:01:51,405 --> 00:01:54,656
So it's usually not drawn in the picture,

45
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,381
but just remember that it's there,

46
00:01:56,381 --> 00:01:58,114
and that it holds the two fatty acids tails

47
00:01:58,114 --> 00:02:00,895
to the phosphate head.

48
00:02:00,895 --> 00:02:05,901
So this structure actually has an interesting property.

49
00:02:05,901 --> 00:02:10,155
The head group is actually 'hydrophilic', or polar.

50
00:02:10,155 --> 00:02:13,423
'Hydrophilic' means that it's water-loving.

51
00:02:13,423 --> 00:02:15,719
The phosphate head group will do whatever it can

52
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,845
to get to water. It loves water.

53
00:02:17,845 --> 00:02:20,092
But these fatty acid tails,

54
00:02:20,092 --> 00:02:23,299
because they're long carbon chains,

55
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:25,744
are 'hydrophobic'.

56
00:02:25,744 --> 00:02:30,471
I remember hydrophobic because phobia means fearing.

57
00:02:30,471 --> 00:02:33,444
Hydro means water, so hydrophobic means water-fearing.

58
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:36,110
These two fatty acids will do whatever

59
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,553
they can to get away from water.

60
00:02:38,553 --> 00:02:41,181
A molecule that has both of these things together

61
00:02:41,181 --> 00:02:44,453
it what we call an 'amphipathic' molecule.

62
00:02:44,453 --> 00:02:49,465
It means that the molecule has hydrophilic and hydrophobic sections.

63
00:02:49,465 --> 00:02:51,388
So, in water, what would this do?

64
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:55,065
Let's say we put a ton of these molecules in water.

65
00:02:55,065 --> 00:02:57,242
Once in water, the hydrophobic heads

66
00:02:57,242 --> 00:02:59,657
want to be as close to water as possible,

67
00:02:59,657 --> 00:03:01,633
but the tails don't.

68
00:03:01,633 --> 00:03:03,959
So what will happen is these phosphate groups

69
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:05,748
will cluster together,

70
00:03:05,748 --> 00:03:08,829
while the tails will try to shield themselves from water.

71
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:11,986
Since this is a substance that's in water,

72
00:03:11,986 --> 00:03:14,101
water is going to be down below too,

73
00:03:14,101 --> 00:03:16,886
so this will actually form a really unique structure,

74
00:03:16,886 --> 00:03:19,989
because the fatty tails will start grouping like this.

75
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:22,920
The phospholipids will be upside down

76
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,787
so that the phosphate head groups can be close to water

77
00:03:25,787 --> 00:03:29,795
while this inside section can be away from water.

78
00:03:29,795 --> 00:03:35,090
This is what we call a phospholipid bilayer.

79
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,770
This is the basic structure of a cell membrane.

80
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:43,447
Like we mentioned, this inside part is hydrophobic.

81
00:03:43,447 --> 00:03:46,506
Now we have this structure that looks like this,

82
00:03:46,506 --> 00:03:48,304
which we call a phospholipid bilayer,

83
00:03:48,304 --> 00:03:50,431
or lipid bilayer for short.

84
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:53,932
But doesn't this side section also interact with water?

85
00:03:53,932 --> 00:03:57,039
How can this structure be like this if this section

86
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,376
still touches water?

87
00:03:58,376 --> 00:04:02,155
The fatty acids don't want to touch water.

88
00:04:03,462 --> 00:04:08,440
What actually happens is that the structure of a circle forms.

89
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,827
Like this.

90
00:04:09,827 --> 00:04:12,616
Now, this is a fairly crudely drawn picture,

91
00:04:12,616 --> 00:04:15,535
but in a cell the lipid bilayer is pretty thin

92
00:04:15,535 --> 00:04:17,366
compared to the entire cell,

93
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:19,139
so you'll notice that this water here

94
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:20,916
isn't a problem anymore.

95
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:25,555
In our cells, water can be on the inside and outside.

96
00:04:25,555 --> 00:04:28,853
No matter where this cell membrane touches water,

97
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:34,144
only the phosphate head groups will touch.

98
00:04:40,173 --> 00:04:41,577
Moving on to a new picture,

99
00:04:41,577 --> 00:04:46,262
we mentioned before that the cell membrane is semi-permeable.

100
00:04:46,262 --> 00:04:48,492
We're going to explore that a little bit more.

101
00:04:48,492 --> 00:04:53,496
So I've pre-drawn a cell membrane.

102
00:04:53,496 --> 00:04:54,600
As we mentioned, the cell membrane

103
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,321
is actually a sphere that surrounds our cell.

104
00:04:57,321 --> 00:04:58,323
For the sake of this lesson,

105
00:04:58,323 --> 00:05:00,641
we're going to draw it out in a straight line.

106
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:04,105
We're going to say that the top side is the outside,

107
00:05:04,105 --> 00:05:05,917
or the extracellular space,

108
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:08,365
and the bottom can be the inside,

109
00:05:08,365 --> 00:05:10,311
or the intracellular space.

110
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:11,996
So, you'll notice that the cell membrane

111
00:05:11,996 --> 00:05:15,200
has these phospholipids packed closely together.

112
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,163
Usually only small molecules can pass through.

113
00:05:19,163 --> 00:05:20,452
Another property of the cell membrane

114
00:05:20,452 --> 00:05:24,043
that we've discussed is that this inside section [with the tails]

115
00:05:24,043 --> 00:05:25,763
is really hydrophobic.

116
00:05:25,763 --> 00:05:28,662
Generally only small non-polar molecules

117
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:32,028
can pass through the cell membrane.

118
00:05:32,028 --> 00:05:36,655
This is what we call "passive diffusion".

119
00:05:36,655 --> 00:05:40,156
So what is a good example of a small non-polar molecule?

120
00:05:40,156 --> 00:05:47,075
Well, the most common type is gases.

121
00:05:47,075 --> 00:05:50,796
Things like O2 or CO2 for example.

122
00:05:50,796 --> 00:05:53,543
These are things that surround us every day,

123
00:05:53,543 --> 00:05:54,795
and our cell, in a sense,

124
00:05:54,795 --> 00:05:58,664
breathes these molecules in and out.

125
00:05:58,664 --> 00:06:02,420
So gases can easily pass through the cell membrane

126
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,194
and they pass through very quickly.

127
00:06:05,194 --> 00:06:08,466
They are small and non-polar.

128
00:06:08,466 --> 00:06:10,607
So, what else does the cell interact with?

129
00:06:10,607 --> 00:06:13,155
The most common thing is water.

130
00:06:13,155 --> 00:06:17,286
Water is actually a pretty small molecule and it's polar.

131
00:06:17,286 --> 00:06:18,164
   

132
00:06:18,164 --> 00:06:22,078
Something else that's similar to water is ethanol.

133
00:06:22,078 --> 00:06:24,810
This is the type of alcohol that we drink.

134
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:28,131
So how does this molecule interact with the cell membrane?

135
00:06:28,131 --> 00:06:31,829
Well, we've said that the cell membrane likes small molecules.

136
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:34,501
So these can pass through the cell membrane.

137
00:06:34,501 --> 00:06:38,531
But the cell membrane prefers non-polar molecules.

138
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:41,437
So these will pass through really slowly.

139
00:06:41,437 --> 00:06:42,606
They can pass through

140
00:06:42,606 --> 00:06:44,998
because they're so tiny that they sneak by.

141
00:06:44,998 --> 00:06:46,917
But this happens pretty slowly

142
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:49,323
because the hydrophobic region still

143
00:06:49,323 --> 00:06:50,865
doesn't like having water in there.

144
00:06:50,865 --> 00:06:53,995
So, if we have small, polar molecules,

145
00:06:53,995 --> 00:06:55,081
what about something that is large

146
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:59,139
but nonpolar, like benzene?

147
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:02,076
Benzene can actually pass through the cell membrane.

148
00:07:02,076 --> 00:07:04,262
Even though it's large, it's non-polar,

149
00:07:04,262 --> 00:07:07,662
so it's going to get along well with the hydrophobic region,

150
00:07:07,662 --> 00:07:12,279
but it's going to pass through very slowly.

151
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:14,506
As a fun fact, benzene used to be used

152
00:07:14,506 --> 00:07:18,405
in labs for researchers to wash their hands.

153
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:19,573
Scientists found out that

154
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:24,741
benzene can pass through our skin and harm us.

155
00:07:24,741 --> 00:07:28,224
What about something that is large and polar?

156
00:07:28,224 --> 00:07:32,909
Well, a molecule like this might be sugar, or glucose.

157
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:36,700
Glucose cannot pass through the cell membrane.

158
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,071
It's large and it's polar;

159
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:40,106
it's the complete opposite to what

160
00:07:40,106 --> 00:07:42,772
the cell membrane wants to let through.

161
00:07:42,772 --> 00:07:44,503
So glucose will have to be absorbed

162
00:07:44,503 --> 00:07:47,251
by our cells through other means,

163
00:07:47,251 --> 00:07:50,097
but it cannot pass through the cell membrane.

164
00:07:50,097 --> 00:07:52,953
What about charged molecules?

165
00:07:52,953 --> 00:07:55,223
These are also all over the place.

What's an example of a charged molecule?

167
00:07:57,533 --> 00:08:01,155
Something like a chloride ion, a sodium ion,

168
00:08:01,155 --> 00:08:02,606
or any sort of ion.

169
00:08:02,606 --> 00:08:07,261
A common example of charged molecules are amino acids.

170
00:08:07,261 --> 00:08:11,229
Since these are charged, they are also polar

171
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:14,139
and cannot pass through.

172
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:15,732
In summary, our cell membrane

173
00:08:15,732 --> 00:08:17,387
protects our cell

174
00:08:17,387 --> 00:08:19,489
and determines what enters and leaves,

175
00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:21,936
a property that we call semi-permeability.

176
00:08:21,936 --> 00:08:24,275
This cell membrane is made up of

177
00:08:24,275 --> 00:08:27,174
a bunch of phospholipids put together.

178
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:31,322
Since our cell membrane has a large hydrophobic region,

179
00:08:31,322 --> 00:08:33,988
it prefers non-polar molecules,

180
00:08:33,988 --> 00:08:37,491
and since these phospholipids are packed so closely,

181
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:41,743
the cell membrane also prefers small molecules to pass through.

182
00:08:41,743 --> 00:08:43,975
The cell membrane is semi-permeable,

183
00:08:43,975 --> 00:08:46,821
allowing generally small and non-polar

184
00:08:46,821 --> 00:08:49,866
molecules to pass through.
