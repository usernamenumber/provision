00:00:01,133 --> 00:00:08,467
We're asked to add and simplify and we have the principle root of two x squared plus four times the principle

2
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:14,933
root of eight plus three times the principle root two x squared plus the principle root of eight

3
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:17,733
so we can do a little bit of adding, we can actually simplify

4
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:19,800
first and then add or we can add first and then simplify

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,400
but it looks like we can already add so lets try and do that

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:30,133
so here, right over here, I have a principle root of two x squared and over here I have three principle

7
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:35,867
roots of two x squared, well if I have one of something here and I have three of something here and i need

8
00:00:35,867 --> 00:00:41,800
to add them together I can put a one co-efficient out here to make it clear this is one of this thing

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,733
and I have three of these things but if I have one of this thing and three more of these things and I add them together I am

10
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:56,400
going to have four of those things, so this is four times the principle root of two x squared

11
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,867
and that confuses a little bit, imagine that the whole principle root of two x squared was some variable

12
00:01:01,867 --> 00:01:08,867
lets say this whole thing was "a" and lets say that this whole thing was "a" as well, because its the same thing, you'd have one "a"

13
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:14,067
plus three "a"'s which will give you four "a"'s, in this case "a" is all of this business right over here

14
00:01:14,067 --> 00:01:19,333
so we added those terms, and then we wanted to think about we have four principle roots of "a" and we

15
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:24,800
have one more principle roots of "a", so same idea you have four of these things I am circling in magenta

16
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,533
and you have one more of these things that I am circling in magenta, that one co-efficient is implicit

17
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:36,400
so if I have four of something plus one more of something it becomes five of that something

18
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:45,533
so plus plus five times the square root, plus five times the square root of eight

19
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:49,867
and now we'll see if we can simplify this anymore, we have four of something and we have five of something

20
00:01:49,867 --> 00:01:54,933
else, so you can't just add these two things together, but maybe we can simplify this a little bit

21
00:01:54,933 --> 00:02:00,800
so we know that the principle root of two x squared, this is the same thing as, so let me write the four

22
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,400
out front, so we have the four, and the principle root of two x squared is the same thing as the principle

23
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:11,333
root of two times the principle root of x squared so I just rewrote this part over here

24
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:18,867
and then we have plus five times, now eight can be written as a product of a perfect square and a

25
00:02:18,867 --> 00:02:26,000
not so perfect square, eight can be written as four times two, so lets write it that way

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,800
so if we view this whole, this is the principle root, the square root of four times two, we can re-write this as the

27
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:39,733
five times the square root of four, or the principle root of four times the principle root of two and

28
00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:44,533
what can we simplify here? well we know what the principle root of x squared is, it is the positive square

29
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:52,400
root of x squared, so it is not just x, you might be tempted to say it is x but since we know it is

30
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,467
the positive square root we have to say it is the absolute value of x, because what if x was negative?

31
00:02:57,467 --> 00:03:01,867
if was x was negative, you'd have , lets say it was negative three, you'd have negative three squared,

32
00:03:01,867 --> 00:03:08,467
you'd have a positive nine, and so the principle root of a positive nine is going to be a positive three

33
00:03:08,467 --> 00:03:12,733
and so it wouldn't just be x, it wouldnt be negative three, it would be positive three, so you have to

34
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:17,600
take the absolute value, and the other thing that is a perfect square is the four right here, its principle

35
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:24,400
root is two, its principle square root i should say is two, so now you have, if we just change the order we

36
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,533
are multiplying right here, you have four, four times the absolute value

37
00:03:29,533 --> 00:03:36,467
of x, four times the absolute value of x, times the square root of two, times the square root of two,

38
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:45,133
I want to do that in that same yellow color, times the square root of two, plus plus we have five times

39
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:50,600
two, which is ten, right, this whole thing is simplified to two, so we have plus ten

40
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:57,400
square roots of two, now we could call it a day, and say we are all done adding and simplifying

41
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,000
or you could add a little bit more depending on how you wanna view it, because over here you have

42
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,267
four times the absolute value of x square roots of two, and here you have ten square roots of two

43
00:04:09,267 --> 00:04:15,067
so you have four absolute value of x of something, and you have ten of that same something, you could

44
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:19,067
add them up, or another way to think about it is, you could factor out a square root of two

45
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:30,200
either one of those works, so you get four times the absolute value of x, plus ten plus ten times times

46
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:37,400
the principle square root of two, so depending on whether you view this of this more simplified, one

47
00:04:37,400 --> 99:59:59,999
of those two will will satisfy you
