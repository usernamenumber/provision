1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
We're on problem number five.

3
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,985
Let's see, we have a pie graph
here of survey results.

4
00:00:04,985 --> 00:00:10,206
   

5
00:00:10,206 --> 00:00:15,030
And let's see, that looks like
almost a straight line.

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,030
Dividing it in half there.

7
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:21,690
And then this gets divided
in half again.

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,635
It looks like that, roughly.

9
00:00:25,635 --> 00:00:28,010
It looks like that.

10
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:32,479
And then this is slightly
bigger like that.

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,960
All right, and this tells
us x is less than 20

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,090
for 30% of the time.

13
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,740
I don't even know what
these represent.

14
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:48,430
x is greater than or equal
to 60 25% of the time.

15
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:55,670
x is between 40 and less than
60, this is 25% of the time.

16
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,500
So it can equal 40, but
it's less than 60.

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:05,019
And then it's greater than or
equal to 20 and less than 40

18
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:06,475
20% of the time.

19
00:01:06,475 --> 00:01:07,835
That's the survey results.

20
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:11,120
The chart above shows the
results when 1,000 people were

21
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,610
asked how old are you?

22
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,210
The age they gave is
represented by x.

23
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,960
How many people said their
age was less than 40?

24
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,240
So x is less than 40.

25
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,780
Well, this category right here
is x is between 20 and 40, so

26
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:37,070
it's this one plus all the
people who said that they were

27
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,940
younger than 20 because if
you're less than 20, you're

28
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,130
definitely less than
40 as well, so it's

29
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,970
both of these combined.

30
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,490
And this is 30%, this is 20%.

31
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:51,620
So if you combine it, it's 30%
plus 20% equals 50% of the

32
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,105
entire population asked.

33
00:01:53,105 --> 00:01:58,760
And 1,000 people were asked,
so 50% times 1,000, well,

34
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,690
that's straightforward.

35
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,960
That equals 500 people.

36
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,490
And that's choice D.

37
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:09,840
Next problem, problem 6.

38
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,630
Which of the following could
be the remainders when four

39
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:20,320
consecutive positive integers
are each divided by 3?

40
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,550
Interesting.

41
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:28,650
So let's say we have x plus 1,
x plus 2, x plus 3, right?

42
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,216
These are four consecutive
positive integers.

43
00:02:31,216 --> 00:02:35,980
   

44
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,940
Well, let's assume that
this first one is

45
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,830
divisible by 3, right?

46
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,850
Let's say that x divided by 3,
there's no remainder, so the

47
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,260
remainder is 0.

48
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:50,780
So when this number's divisible
by this number, x is

49
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,450
divisible by 3, so now when
you divide x plus 1 by 3,

50
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,200
you're going to have
1 left over.

51
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,660
Similarly, you're going
to have 2 left over.

52
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,810
Here, you're not going to
3 left over, right?

53
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:06,440
Because if x is divisible by
3, then x plus 3 is also

54
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,670
divisible by 3, right?

55
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,150
You're going to have a cycle.

56
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,700
It's going to go back to
a remainder of zero.

57
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,250
So this is a possible
situation.

58
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,360
And similarly, if x had a
remainder of 1, then x plus 1

59
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,880
would have a remainder of 2.

60
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,790
Then x plus 2 would have a
remainder of 0, and then this

61
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,360
would have a remainder
of 1 again.

62
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,800
So I don't know, let's
look at the choices.

63
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,810
Are any of these out there?

64
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,310
Well, sure.

65
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,510
This is choice D, actually.

66
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:37,440
The first thing we did, choice
D was 0, 1, 2, 0, which is D.

67
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,770
And the key here is realizing
that you can't have a

68
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:48,210
remainder of 3 or 4 when you're
dividing by 3, right?

69
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,170
Your remainder can only
be 0, 1 or 2.

70
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:54,780
So with that realization alone,
you can cancel out all

71
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,460
the choices that have
a 3 or a 4 in it.

72
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,150
You can't have a remainder
of 3 or 4 if

73
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,510
you're dividing by 3.

74
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,250
And you can try that
out, right?

75
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,810
Because if you have a remainder
by 3, that means you

76
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,310
could divide one more 3 into
the number and have a

77
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,500
remainder of 0.

78
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,670
So you could cancel
out A, B, C and E.

79
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:12,900
You can actually cancel
out everything.

80
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,430
So you would have just had to
have that one realization, and

81
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,079
you would have said the choice
is D because you can't have a

82
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,970
remainder of 3 or 4 if
you're dividing by 3.

83
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:28,430
Next problem, problem 7.

84
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,090
   

85
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:36,710
If y is inversely proportional
to x, so that means that y is

86
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,620
proportional to the inverse of
x, so it's equal to some

87
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,910
constant times 1/x.

88
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,390
Because that's what inversely
proportional means.

89
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:47,030
If we said proportional, it'd
be y equals k times x, but

90
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,050
it's inversely proportional.

91
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:56,120
And they tell us that
y is 15 when x is 5.

92
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,320
So y is 15 is equal to
k times 1/5, right?

93
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,300
y is 15 when x is equal to 5.

94
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,810
Let's see, let's multiply
both sides of this by 5.

95
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:14,290
So you get 5 times 15 is 75
is equal to k, right?

96
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,890
So y is equal to 75/x.

97
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,900
I just rewrote this.

98
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,910
What is the value of
y when x is 25?

99
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,210
So y is equal to 75.

100
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,430
x is now 25.

101
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,780
What's 75 divided by 25?

102
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,150
Well, it's 3.

103
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,680
And that's choice C.

104
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,930
Problem 8.

105
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:40,620
   

106
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:50,950
If 2x plus z is equal to 2y,
and 2x-- and then they also

107
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:57,880
tell us that 2x plus 2y
plus z is equal to 20.

108
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,005
What is the value of y?

109
00:06:00,005 --> 00:06:02,620
   

110
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,170
y is equal to what?

111
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,820
So there's something
interesting here.

112
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:14,330
we can rewrite this second
equation as subtract 2y from

113
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,430
both sides of this equation
right here, and you get 2x

114
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:24,560
plus z is equal to 20
minus y, right?

115
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,880
So essentially, you have a 2x
plus z here, and you have a 2x

116
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,540
plus z here.

117
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,920
Let's make a new variable.

118
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,120
You don't have to do this step,
but I think this'll

119
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,550
simplify things.

120
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:39,880
Let's call the variable Q.

121
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,280
Let's say Q is equal
to 2x plus z.

122
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,360
That's where they're trying
to confuse you.

123
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,230
They're giving you two equations
with three unknowns.

124
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,520
And you're like, how can I
solve for one of them?

125
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,610
Well, what's interesting is they
have-- you're solving for

126
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,240
one of them, and then the
relationship has a 2x plus z

127
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,480
in both equations.

128
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,830
So if you say Q is equal to 2x
plus z, everything starts to

129
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:03,990
make sense because then this top
equation will become Q is

130
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,360
equal to 2y.

131
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,780
And what will this bottom
equation be?

132
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:12,560
That would be Q is equal
to 20 minus y, right?

133
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,040
And now you could set these
equal to each other.

134
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,670
2y is equal to 20 minus y.

135
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:25,960
Add y to both sides, you
get 3y is equal to 20.

136
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,210
Am I doing that right?

137
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:30,740
3y is equal to 20?

138
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,005
You add y to both sides.
y is equal to 20/3.

139
00:07:34,005 --> 00:07:35,690
And they don't have
that choice, so I

140
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,810
must have made a mistake.

141
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:39,915
Let me redo the problem.

142
00:07:39,915 --> 00:07:41,260
I must've made a mistake.

143
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,680
Problem 8.

144
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,600
So they're telling us 2x plus
z is equal to 2y, and then

145
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:56,140
they tell us 2x plus 2y
plus z is equal to 20.

146
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,290
What is the value of y?

147
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:02,510
OK, the second equation can be
written as 2x plus z is equal

148
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:06,010
to 20 minus 2y.

149
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:10,470
And this top equation is still
2x plus z is equal to 2y.

150
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,510
Oh, I see.

151
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,870
I had dropped a y someplace.

152
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,450
So this must equal this,
because they both

153
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,530
equal 2x plus z.

154
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,630
I don't even have to do all
that substitution Q.

00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:22,830
I think that you can see that 2x
plus z equals this, 2x plus

156
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:26,130
z equals this, so this
must equal this.

157
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:30,030
So 2y is equal to 20 minus 2y.

158
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:35,000
Add 2y to both sides, you
get 4y is equal to 20,

159
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,820
y is equal to 5.

160
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,100
And that is choice A.

161
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,500
I'll see you in the
next video.

162
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:55,690
   

163
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:56,090
Oh, whoops!

164
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,350
I didn't delete.

165
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,600
Sorry.

166
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,333
