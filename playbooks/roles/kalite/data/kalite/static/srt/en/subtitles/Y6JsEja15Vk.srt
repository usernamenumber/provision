1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
   

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,390
We have this system
of equations here.

3
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:04,660
3t plus 4g is equal to 6.

4
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,860
And we have negative 6t plus
g is also equal to 6.

5
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,120
And there's a bunch
of ways you can

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,570
solve systems of equations.

7
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,510
You can graph them.

8
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,510
You can solve by substitution.

9
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:17,350
Whenever you see the
coefficients on one of the

10
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,330
terms, in this case the
t term, they're almost

11
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:20,890
cancelable.

12
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,780
And when I say cancelable, if
I add 3t to negative 6t, you

13
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,200
won't be able to cancel
them out.

14
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,560
The t won't disappear.

15
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,950
But if I were to scale the 3 up,
if I were to multiply it

16
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:34,070
by 2 and it becomes 6t, and then
I were to add these two

17
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,310
things, then they would
cancel out.

18
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,420
And I would be left
just with g's.

19
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,690
So let's try to do that.

20
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,460
And now remember, I can't just
multiply this 3t by 2.

21
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,240
In order for this equation to
hold true, anything I do to

22
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,870
the left-hand side, I have to
do to the right-hand side as

23
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,550
well, and I have to do it to
the entire left-hand side.

24
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,570
So let me multiply this
equation by 2.

25
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:56,940
So I'm multiplying it by 2.

26
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:57,780
So let me just write it here.

27
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,980
So I'm going to multiply
2 times 3t plus 4g is

28
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,870
equal to 2 times 6.

29
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,830
Anything I do to one side, I
have to do to the other side.

30
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:08,610
The equality still holds true.

31
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:15,840
So 2 times 3t is 6t plus 2 times
4g is 8g, is equal to 2

32
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,680
times 6, which is 12.

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,340
So I really just rewrote the
same information, the same

34
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,740
constraint in this
first equation.

35
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,450
I just multiplied
both sides by 2.

36
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,640
Now, let me write the second
equation right below it.

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,990
I'll write it in orange.

38
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:33,450
So the second equation right
here is negative 6t plus g is

39
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,450
equal to 6.

40
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,510
Now, think about what
happens if I were to

41
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,740
add these two equations.

42
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,840
Remember, I can do that because
I'm essentially adding

43
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,120
the same thing to both sides
of this top equation.

44
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,720
Or you could say I'm adding the
same thing to both sides

45
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,120
of this bottom equation because
the other equation is

46
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,010
an equality.

47
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,860
This negative 6t plus
g, it is 6.

48
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,070
So if I'm adding 6 to 12, I'm
really adding the same

49
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,800
quantity to the left-hand
side.

50
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,180
That's why I can do it.

51
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,640
So let's add the left-hand
sides together.

52
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,870
When we do that, the
6t's cancel out.

53
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,390
That was the whole point behind
multiplying this first

54
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,480
character by 2, so that the 3t
becomes a 6t, and we're left

55
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:14,440
with 8g plus g is 9g, is equal
to 12 plus 6, which is 18.

56
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,040
Divide both sides by 9, and you
are left with g is equal

57
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,780
to 18/9, or 2.

58
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,590
So we've solved for g.

59
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,310
Now we can substitute back and
solve for t, and we can use

60
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,440
either of these equations.

61
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,610
Let's use the second equation
right here.

62
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,920
So we have negative 6t plus g--
we just solved for g; g is

63
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,610
2-- is equal to 6.

64
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,360
And we can subtract 2 from both
sides of this equation.

65
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,190
Subtracting 2, the left-hand
side of the equation, that

66
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,180
cancels out.

67
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:54,460
You have negative 6t is equal
to 6 minus 2 is 4.

68
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:59,920
Now I can divide both sides of
this equation by negative 6.

69
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,300
And we're left with t is equal
to-- what is this?

70
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,550
t is equal to negative 2/3.

71
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,240
And we're done.

72
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,280
We've solved for a t and a g
that satisfy both equations.

73
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,340
We just saw that it satisfies
the bottom one.

74
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,460
If you want to feel good that
it satisfies the top,

75
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,390
substitute them back
into the top.

76
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:18,970
Let's do that.

77
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:25,310
3 times the t we got, negative
2/3, plus 4 times the g we

78
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,890
got, so plus 4 times 2.

79
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,050
Let's see what that is.

80
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,650
3 times negative 2/3,
that's negative 2.

81
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,040
The 3's cancel out.

82
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,150
Plus 4 times 2 is 8.

83
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,310
Negative 2 plus 8
is equal to 6.

84
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,390
And that's exactly what that
first equation got us.

85
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:44,010
So these two values definitely
satisfy both equations.

86
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:44,466
