1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,810
Let me draw a function
that would be interesting

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:04,490
to take a limit of.

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,880
And I'll just draw it visually
for now, and we'll do some

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,390
specific examples
a little later.

5
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,870
So that's my y-axis,
and that's my x-axis.

6
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,180
And let;s say the function
looks something like--

7
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,950
I'll make it a fairly
straightforward function

8
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:19,760
--let's say it's a line,
for the most part.

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,100
Let's say it looks just
like, accept it has a

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,080
hole at some point.

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,690
x is equal to a, so
it's undefined there.

12
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,030
Let me black that point
out so you can see that

13
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,110
it's not defined there.

14
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:38,780
And that point there
is x is equal to a.

15
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:45,180
This is the x-axis, this is
the y is equal f of x-axis.

16
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,120
Let's just say
that's the y-axis.

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,030
And let's say that this
is f of x, or this is

18
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,880
y is equal to f of x.

19
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,740
Now we've done a bunch
of videos on limits.

20
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,160
I think you have an
intuition on this.

21
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,850
If I were to say what is the
limit as x approaches a,

22
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,020
and let's say that this
point right here is l.

23
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,480
We know from our previous
videos that-- well first of all

24
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,940
I could write it down --the
limit as x approaches

25
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,690
a of f of x.

26
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:17,560
What this means intuitively is
as we approach a from either

27
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,980
side, as we approach it from
that side, what does

28
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,290
f of x approach?

29
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,030
So when x is here,
f of x is here.

30
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,490
When x is here, f
of x is there.

31
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,080
And we see that it's
approaching this l right there.

32
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:40,320
And when we approach a from
that side-- and we've done

33
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,200
limits where you approach from
only the left or right side,

34
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,750
but to actually have a limit it
has to approach the same thing

35
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,670
from the positive direction and
the negative direction --but as

36
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,380
you go from there, if you pick
this x, then this is f of x.

37
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,440
f of x is right there.

38
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,460
If x gets here then it goes
here, and as we get closer and

39
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:03,860
closer to a, f of x approaches
this point l, or this value l.

40
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,600
So we say that the limit
of f of x ax x approaches

41
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,960
a is equal to l.

42
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,640
I think we have that intuition.

43
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,360
But this was not very, it's
actually not rigorous at all

44
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,480
in terms of being specific
in terms of what we

45
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,290
mean is a limit.

46
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,340
All I said so far is as
we get closer, what does

47
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,440
f of x get closer to?

48
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,360
So in this video I'll attempt
to explain to you a definition

49
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,360
of a limit that has a little
bit more, or actually a lot

50
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,180
more, mathematical rigor than
just saying you know, as x gets

51
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,990
closer to this value, what
does f of x get closer to?

52
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,290
And the way I think about it's:
kind of like a little game.

53
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:48,640
The definition is, this
statement right here means that

54
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:55,150
I can always give you a range
about this point-- and when I

55
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,190
talk about range I'm not
talking about it in the whole

56
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,960
domain range aspect, I'm just
talking about a range like you

57
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,980
know, I can give you a distance
from a as long as I'm no

58
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:12,360
further than that, I can
guarantee you that f of x is go

59
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,160
it not going to be any further
than a given distance from l

60
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,030
--and the way I think about it
is, it could be viewed

61
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:18,490
as a little game.

62
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,840
Let's say you say, OK Sal,
I don't believe you.

63
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:29,900
I want to see you know, whether
f of x can get within 0.5 of l.

64
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:37,460
So let's say you give me 0.5
and you say Sal, by this

65
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,760
definition you should always
be able to give me a range

66
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,330
around a that will get f of
x within 0.5 of l, right?

67
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,980
So the values of f of x are
always going to be right in

68
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,160
this range, right there.

69
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,300
And as long as I'm in that
range around a, as long as I'm

70
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,890
the range around you give me, f
of x will always be at least

71
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,030
that close to our limit point.

72
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:07,830
Let me draw it a little bit
bigger, just because I think

73
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,870
I'm just overwriting the same
diagram over and over again.

74
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:16,770
So let's say that this is f of
x, this is the hole point.

75
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,340
There doesn't have to be a hole
there; the limit could equal

76
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,020
actually a value of the
function, but the limit is more

77
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,560
interesting when the function
isn't defined there

78
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,910
but the limit is.

79
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:28,770
So this point right here-- that
is, let me draw the axes again.

80
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:44,010
So that's x-axis, y-axis x,
y, this is the limit point

81
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,310
l, this is the point a.

82
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,630
So the definition of the limit,
and I'll go back to this in

83
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,690
second because now that it's
bigger I want explain it again.

84
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:58,090
It says this means-- and this
is the epsilon delta definition

85
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,260
of limits, and we'll touch on
epsilon and delta in a second,

86
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,790
is I can guarantee you that
f of x, you give me any

87
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,860
distance from l you want.

88
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,450
And actually let's
call that epsilon.

89
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,590
And let's just hit on
the definition right

90
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,050
from the get go.

91
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:17,090
So you say I want to be no more
than epsilon away from l.

92
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,510
And epsilon can just be any
number greater, any real

93
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,960
number, greater than 0.

94
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,320
So that would be, this distance
right here is epsilon.

95
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,810
This distance there is epsilon.

96
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,480
And for any epsilon you give
me, any real number-- so this

97
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:36,810
is, this would be l plus
epsilon right here, this would

98
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:43,030
be l minus epsilon right here
--the epsilon delta definition

99
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:48,030
of this says that no matter
what epsilon one you give me, I

100
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,650
can always specify a
distance around a.

101
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,000
And I'll call that delta.

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,710
I can always specify
a distance around a.

103
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:02,320
So let's say this is delta
less than a, and this

104
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,440
is delta more than a.

105
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,365
This is the letter delta.

106
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:15,680
Where as long as you pick an x
that's within a plus delta and

107
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,440
a minus delta, as long as the x
is within here, I can guarantee

108
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,160
you that the f of x, the
corresponding f of x is going

109
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,350
to be within your range.

110
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,060
And if you think about it
this makes sense right?

111
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,630
It's essentially saying, I can
get you as close as you want to

112
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,980
this limit point just by-- and
when I say as close as you

113
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:36,430
want, you define what you want
by giving me an epsilon; on

114
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,940
it's a little bit of a game
--and I can get you as close as

115
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,000
you want to that limit point by
giving you a range around the

116
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,680
point that x is approaching.

117
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,420
And as long as you pick an x
value that's within this range

118
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,570
around a, long as you pick an x
value around there, I can

119
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:55,440
guarantee you that f of x will
be within the range

120
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,290
you specify.

121
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:01,270
Just make this a little bit
more concrete, let's say you

122
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,490
say, I want f of x to be within
0.5-- let's just you know, make

123
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,380
everything concrete numbers.

124
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:11,750
Let's say this is the number 2
and let's say this is number 1.

125
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,575
So we're saying that the limit
as x approaches 1 of f of x-- I

126
00:07:16,575 --> 00:07:18,880
haven't defined f of x, but it
looks like a line with the hole

127
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,480
right there, is equal to 2.

128
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,820
This means that you can
give me any number.

129
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,380
Let's say you want to try it
out for a couple of examples.

130
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,220
Let's say you say I want f of x
to be within point-- let me do

131
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:35,680
a different color --I want f
of x to be within 0.5 of 2.

132
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,970
I want f of x to be
between 2.5 and 1.5.

133
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:45,650
Then I could say, OK, as long
as you pick an x within-- I

134
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,190
don't know, it could be
arbitrarily close but as long

135
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,920
as you pick an x that's --let's
say it works for this function

136
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:57,790
that's between, I don't
know, 0.9 and 1.1.

137
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:02,980
So in this case the delta from
our limit point is only 0.1.

138
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:09,320
As long as you pick an x that's
within 0.1 of this point, or 1,

139
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,640
I can guarantee you that your
f of x is going to

140
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,740
lie in that range.

141
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,220
So hopefully you get a little
bit of a sense of that.

142
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,750
Let me define that with the
actual epsilon delta, and this

143
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,580
is what you'll actually see in
your mat textbook, and then

144
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,110
we'll do a couple of examples.

145
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,730
And just to be clear, that
was just a specific example.

146
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,870
You gave me one epsilon and I
gave you a delta that worked.

147
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:36,270
But by definition if this is
true, or if someone writes

148
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:40,290
this, they're saying it doesn't
just work for one specific

149
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,900
instance, it works for
any number you give me.

150
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:48,800
You can say I want to be within
one millionth of, you know, or

151
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,180
ten to the negative hundredth
power of 2, you know, super

152
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,590
close to 2, and I can always
give you a range around this

153
00:08:55,590 --> 00:09:00,270
point where as long as you pick
an x in that range, f of x will

154
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:03,540
always be within this range
that you specify, within that

155
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:08,240
were you know, one trillionth
of a unit away from

156
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,470
the limit point.

157
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,270
And of course, the one thing
I can't guarantee is what

158
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,760
happens when x is equal to a.

159
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,580
I'm just saying as long as you
pick an x that's within my

160
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,950
range but not on a, it'll work.

161
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,720
Your f of x will show up to be
within the range you specify.

162
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,680
And just to make the math
clear-- because I've been

163
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,250
speaking only in words so far
--and this is what we see the

164
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:33,460
textbook: it says look, you
give me any epsilon

165
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,810
greater than 0.

166
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,390
Anyway, this is a
definition, right?

167
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:41,730
If someone writes this they
mean that you can give them any

168
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:52,800
epsilon greater than 0, and
then they'll give you a delta--

169
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,590
remember your epsilon is how
close you want f of x to be

170
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,760
to your limit point, right?

171
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,530
It's a range around f of x
--they'll give you a delta

172
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:04,860
which is a range
around a, right?

173
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,520
Let me write this.

174
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:11,830
So limit as approaches a
of f of x is equal to l.

175
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:15,210
So they'll give you a delta
where as long as x is no more

176
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:23,025
than delta-- So the distance
between x and a, so if we pick

177
00:10:23,025 --> 00:10:27,950
an x here-- let me do another
color --if we pick an x here,

178
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:31,340
the distance between that value
and a, as long as one, that's

179
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,840
greater than 0 so that x
doesn't show up on top of a,

180
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,980
because its function might be
undefined at that point.

181
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,750
But as long as the distance
between x and a is greater

182
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:45,400
than 0 and less than this x
range that they gave you,

183
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,450
it's less than delta.

184
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,930
So as long as you take an x,
you know if I were to zoom the

185
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:55,680
x-axis right here-- this is a
and so this distance right here

186
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,240
would be delta, and this
distance right here would be

187
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,920
delta --as long as you pick an
x value that falls here-- so as

188
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,520
long as you pick that x value
or this x value or this x value

189
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,560
--as long as you pick one of
those x values, I can guarantee

190
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:17,010
you that the distance between
your function and the limit

191
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,670
point, so the distance between
you know, when you take one of

192
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,460
these x values and you evaluate
f of x at that point, that the

193
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,170
distance between that f of x
and the limit point is

194
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:31,560
going to be less than the
number you gave them.

195
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,470
And if you think of, it seems
very complicated, and I have

196
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,690
mixed feelings about where
this is included in most

197
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,640
calculus curriculums.

198
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,345
It's included in like the, you
know, the third week before you

199
00:11:42,345 --> 00:11:44,670
even learn derivatives, and
it's kind of this very mathy

200
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,560
and rigorous thing to think
about, and you know, it tends

201
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,720
to derail a lot of students and
a lot of people I don't think

202
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,010
get a lot of the intuition
behind it, but it is

203
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,050
mathematically rigorous.

204
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,910
And I think it is very valuable
once you study you know, more

205
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,910
advanced calculus or
become a math major.

206
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,330
But with that said, this
does make a lot of sense

207
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,160
intuitively, right?

208
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,550
Because before we were talking
about, look you know, I can get

209
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:12,945
you as close as x approaches
this value f of x is going

210
00:12:12,945 --> 00:12:13,960
to approach this value.

211
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,620
And the way we mathematically
define it is, you say Sal,

212
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,970
I want to be super close.

213
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,180
I want the distance to be
f of x [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

214
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,640
And I want it to be
0.000000001, then I can always

215
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,540
give you a distance around x
where this will be true.

216
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,320
And I'm all out of
time in this video.

217
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,260
In the next video I'll do some
examples where I prove the

218
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:38,120
limits, where I prove some
limit statements using

219
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,330
this definition.

220
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:43,370
And hopefully you know, when we
use some tangible numbers, this

221
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,440
definition will make a
little bit more sense.

222
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,270
See you in the next video.
