1
00:00:01,133 --> 00:00:06,400
Every video until now, we've been working from the assumption that the observable universe

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,667
is smaller than the entire universe.

3
00:00:09,667 --> 00:00:13,667
And if you go by the Cosmic Inflation Theory

4
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:16,533
Cosmic Inflation Theory

5
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:20,933
It was founded by Alan Guth

6
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:24,333
I have an almost personal connection to Alan Guth

7
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:29,800
When I was at MIT I always used to go to this Chinese food truck

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,533
and I always used to show up at the food truck like 2 seconds before Alan Guth

9
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,867
He was always one or two behind me in line, but anyway

10
00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:40,800
He was the founder of the Cosmic Inflation Theory which is basically this idea that

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,267
the very early moments, or the very early period after the big bang,

12
00:00:45,267 --> 00:00:50,067
it went through this major inflation in the expansion of space

13
00:00:50,067 --> 00:01:00,867
If based on the Theory of Cosmic Inflation then the observable universe is on the order of

14
00:01:00,867 --> 00:01:04,000
or maybe another way to say it, the entire universe is on the order of

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:13,067
10 to the 23 times the size of the observable universe.

16
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:15,667
So that would mean this is just a tiny tiny fraction,

17
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:19,267
I mean this is an unimaginably large number

18
00:01:19,267 --> 00:01:23,200
In fact it is unimaginable, so already everything we've talked about

19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:30,933
this itself is an incomprehensible amount of space, but this is an incomprehensible multiple

20
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:34,200
of this incomprehensible amount of space.

21
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:41,733
That's just based on that theory but, it is possible, we cannot rule out even the idea that

22
00:01:41,733 --> 00:01:46,533
the actual universe is smaller, smaller, than the observable universe

23
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:52,200
that one is in some ways even more mind blowing than the idea that the universe is this big

24
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,733
the fact that what we're observing is actually larger than the actual universe

25
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:59,267
And you'll say "Sal, that's impossible", but just think about it a little bit

26
00:01:59,267 --> 00:02:03,267
This is the observable universe, the way we've depicted it is based on how long the light

27
00:02:03,267 --> 00:02:07,933
has taken to reach us, we've already covered before that this point in space is now

28
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:12,733
46 billion light years away, not 13.7, the way it looks right over here.

29
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:15,533
It just took 13.7 billion years to reach us.

30
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:20,133
If there is any photon that would take longer than 13.7 billion years to reach us,

31
00:02:20,133 --> 00:02:24,800
it hasn't reached us yet because it could have only started 13.7 billion years ago.

32
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,400
So they're on their way and they start at some point outside of our observable universe

33
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,400
So our observable universe will grow over time

34
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,200
but with that said let's imagine that the actual universe is a sub-set of this observable universe

35
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,733
let's say it's roughly, half the diameter, so let's say it looks like this.

36
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:46,195
Maybe I'll make it a little bit of an oval.

37
00:02:46,195 --> 00:02:52,400
Maybe the actual universe, and this is just to be a little bit provocative, and it's not impossible

38
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,600
Let's say that this is the actual universe.

39
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,267
Actual Universe

40
00:02:58,267 --> 00:03:01,200
And the way I drew it, it makes it look like Earth is the center.

41
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,133
That we're the center of it but remember, this is very likely to be the surface,

42
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:09,400
or it is the, it is curved, it has a slight curvature,

43
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,200
it could very well be the surface of a 4-dimensional object

44
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,733
maybe the simplest one to visualize is the 4-dimensional sphere

45
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:20,733
so if you really want to visualize this right, this whole volume

46
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:24,200
and remember this whole picture keeps looking 2-dimensional, but it has depth.

47
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,400
It is a volume of space, an incredibly vast volume of space

48
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,600
so what I've done here is this is a ellipsoid right here, it's an elliptical volume of space

49
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,267
that I've bubbled up right over here but if this was really the entire universe

50
00:03:39,267 --> 00:03:43,733
and the entire universe really were the surface of a 4-dimensional sphere

51
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:48,267
then the reality is that this entire space can be represented like this.

52
00:03:48,267 --> 00:03:53,533
It can be represented as the surface, if this was a 4-dimensional sphere

53
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:56,267
obviously this way I can only draw a 3 dimensional spheres,

54
00:03:56,267 --> 00:04:01,400
let me show that it has some, that it's not just a circle, that it has some depth to it.

55
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,533
and I can even shade it right over here

56
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:10,959
so you can imagine that this point, that this point over here,

57
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,462
is actually the same thing as that point over there, that they have wrapped around

58
00:04:16,462 --> 00:04:20,267
and that they're connected right at the back over here and let show that, draw and go behind

59
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:25,129
that they're connected right over there and that this point and this point

60
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:28,467
are actually the same point that they've wrapped around

61
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:34,533
they've wrapped around, actually the way I've drawn it right here they would actually all wrap around

62
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:38,733
right back there at that point if I'm visualizing properly

63
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:43,200
if you go in any one direction, you would come back on the other side of the surface

64
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,554
if you go, let's say that Earth is right here.

65
00:04:45,554 --> 00:04:48,133
The way we've depicted it, Earth is the center but we see that when

66
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:51,267
when you look at it like this, there is no center to the surface of a sphere

67
00:04:51,267 --> 00:04:53,133
even a 4-dimensional sphere

68
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:57,867
So in this sense, if you go in any one direction you'll come back out the other side

69
00:04:57,867 --> 00:05:01,267
so if you start from Earth, you go in that direction, once you get there you're really

70
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,800
here again and then you would come back to Earth.

71
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,133
And so, if this were the case, if the actual volume of the true universe

72
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:11,600
was smaller than what it looks like, the observable universe,

73
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,400
then what's all this stuff on the outside?

74
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:19,400
And to think about it, think about what would happen if 13.7 billion years ago

75
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:27,200
When we were in that primitive state, that the background radiation, that those photons are being

76
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,733
that the electromagnetic waves are being released.

77
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:34,600
let's say that they get released, and those photons on their first pass,

78
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,933
and I think you know where this is going, on their first pass they would get to us

79
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:43,600
they would get to us in about, this looks like a distance of about, I don't know,

80
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,800
this looks like about 6 billion years.

81
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:51,200
then they would pass us up and then they would get back to this point again in another 6 billion years

82
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:57,200
and then they would come back here, so that very first pass of photons are going to be right over here

83
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,600
and from our point of view, we're not going to see them for a couple of billion years

84
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,800
so when we do see them we're going to perceive them

85
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:09,067
we're going to say "Wow, it took 15, 16 billion years for that photon to get to me

86
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:11,533
that must be from something out here" but the reality is

87
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:17,733
it's a photon from something within a smaller physical universe, within a smaller actual universe

88
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:26,533
that has just taken several passes by us and we're just seeing a pass after 14 billion years

89
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:28,267
we just think it's from something further out.

90
00:06:28,267 --> 00:06:31,200
Now the other thing is, well you say, if this was the case,

91
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,867
if we could just go in one direction in the universe and come out the other side

92
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:40,267
and if all of that was within the observable universe, wouldn't we be able to tell?

93
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:45,600
Wouldn't we be able to look in two directions and see the same thing from a different perspective?

94
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,467
and the answer there is to think about what happens, or actually

95
00:06:49,467 --> 00:06:52,000
Wouldn't we even be able to see ourselves?

96
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,036
because if we emit some light, and it would take maybe, I don't know how for that is

97
00:06:57,036 --> 00:07:02,400
let's say it's 6 or 7 billion light years to get right over here which would be right over there and

98
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,800
then it would take another 6 or 7 billion light years to get over there

99
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,800
So maybe that background radiation we're seeing is actually background radiation emitted

100
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:16,600
from that exact point in space that we are right now, or from a very similar point in space

101
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,133
to where we are right now

102
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:23,400
Part of the background radiation is from a similar point in space that we are right now.

103
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,200
So how come we can't just see ourselves?

104
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,067
Well, I kind-of just answered the question.

105
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:34,667
That second pass, if you're observing that same point in space, if you're observing light

106
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:40,600
from the same point in space on a previous pass that light was emitted a long long time ago

107
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,200
Maybe, well, 13 billion years ago.

108
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,467
and so it would be unrecognizable, the region, this region of space,

109
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,467
the region of the space that we are in right now,

110
00:07:49,467 --> 00:07:54,400
if we saw this same region of space 13 billion years ago, we just wouldn't recognize it

111
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,533
Now there are people attempting to see if there is some patterns,

112
00:07:57,533 --> 00:07:59,400
see if you can model how the universe would change

113
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,867
and if you see patterns and maybe the actual universe is a sub-set of the observable

114
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:09,067
we just haven't seen it yet, but it's completely a possibility

115
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:12,800
hopefully I didn't confuse you, I actually find this kind-of an interesting idea

116
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:20,933
that these things that we think are, let's say the light that has taken 8 billion years to reach us

117
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:25,133
we think it's from something, based on this scale, 8 billion light years out,

118
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:27,800
it's actually further because the universe is expanding so

119
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,267
it will have actually traversed more space than that

120
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:34,400
but we think it's from something like that but it could have been something further in

121
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,600
if the actual universe is smaller and it's just on it's second pass

122
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,600
it's actually coming back again and that's why it took 8 billion years to reach us

123
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:46,800
we don't even recognize it because it looks very different than that region of space right now

124
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,533
or that region of space after 4 billion years looks completely different than when it first released

125
00:08:51,533 --> 99:59:59,000
anyway, hopefully I didn't confuse you too much, I think this is a fascinating, fascinating topic
