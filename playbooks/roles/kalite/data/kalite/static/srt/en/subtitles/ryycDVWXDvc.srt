1
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:09,948
[Male Narrator] So around 1350 BC, everything changed in Egyptian art

2
00:00:09,948 --> 00:00:12,227
[Female Narrator] When we think about Egyptian art, we don't think of change

3
00:00:12,227 --> 00:00:15,005
[Male] That's true the old kingdom, the middle kingdom, the

4
00:00:15,005 --> 00:00:17,932
new Kingdom and the transitional periods between art

5
00:00:17,932 --> 00:00:21,450
is consistent for almost 3000 years but there is

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,807
this radical break right around 1350 and it's because

7
00:00:25,807 --> 00:00:29,480
the ruler Akhenaten, changes the state religion.

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,253
[Female] He changes it from the worship from the god

9
00:00:32,253 --> 00:00:36,587
Amun to a new god, a sun god called Aten so he

10
00:00:36,587 --> 00:00:39,627
actually changes his own name to Akhenaten

11
00:00:39,627 --> 00:00:43,614
which means "Aten is pleased". [Male laughs]

12
00:00:43,614 --> 00:00:45,888
[Female] The key is he makes him and his wife the

13
00:00:45,888 --> 00:00:51,017
only representatives of Aten on earth so he upsets

14
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:54,057
the entire priesthood of Egypt by making him and his

15
00:00:54,057 --> 00:00:57,968
wife the only ones with access to this new god Aten.

16
00:00:57,968 --> 00:01:01,725
[Male] And in fact, after Akhenaten dies, Egypt will return

17
00:01:01,725 --> 00:01:05,121
to its traditional religion. So this period is a very brief

18
00:01:05,121 --> 00:01:08,300
episode in Egyptian history, but it also marks a real

19
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,529
shift in style and this small stone plaque that we're

20
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:14,629
looking at, this sunken relief carving which would've

21
00:01:14,629 --> 00:01:17,213
been placed in a private, domestic environment

22
00:01:17,213 --> 00:01:20,448
is a perfect example of those stylistic changes

23
00:01:20,448 --> 00:01:22,341
[Female] Right, it would've been an altar in someone's

24
00:01:22,341 --> 00:01:25,253
home where they would've seen Akhenaten and his

25
00:01:25,253 --> 00:01:28,031
wife Nefertiti and their relationship to the god

26
00:01:28,031 --> 00:01:31,785
Aten. This has always been one of my favorite sculptures.

27
00:01:31,785 --> 00:01:35,426
It's so informal compared to most Egyptian art, we

28
00:01:35,426 --> 00:01:39,817
really have a sense of a couple and their relationship

29
00:01:39,817 --> 00:01:41,687
with one another and their relationship with their

30
00:01:41,687 --> 00:01:44,276
children, and love and domesticity.

31
00:01:44,276 --> 00:01:47,550
[Male] So let's take a close look. On the left you have

32
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,824
Akhenaten himself, this is the Pharoh of Egypt,

33
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,574
supreme ruler. You can see that he's holding his

34
00:01:52,574 --> 00:01:55,715
eldest daughter and he's actually getting ready to kiss

35
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:58,326
her, he seems to be holding her very tenderly.

36
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:01,356
Supporting her head, holding her under the thighs.

37
00:02:01,356 --> 00:02:04,690
She seems to be perhaps pointing back to her mother

38
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,798
at the same moment. [Female] We see Nefertiti

39
00:02:06,798 --> 00:02:09,082
holding another daughter on her lap pointing

40
00:02:09,082 --> 00:02:12,470
back to Akhenaten, and yet a third daughter

41
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,215
the youngest one on her shoulder playing with her

42
00:02:15,215 --> 00:02:18,652
earring. I think it's immediately apparent that there's

43
00:02:18,652 --> 00:02:21,951
something wrong with their anatomy. If you look at the

44
00:02:21,951 --> 00:02:24,197
children or we look at Nefertiti or Akhenaten

45
00:02:24,197 --> 00:02:29,365
we see swollen bellies, very thin arms and elongated

46
00:02:29,365 --> 00:02:32,473
skulls, forms that have made art historians wonder

47
00:02:32,473 --> 00:02:34,625
whether there was something medically wrong with

48
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:37,436
Akhenaten. [Male] In fact, we don't think that there was

49
00:02:37,436 --> 00:02:40,858
we think that this is a purely stylistic break that

50
00:02:40,858 --> 00:02:44,337
was meant to distinguish this new age, this new

51
00:02:44,337 --> 00:02:47,056
religion from Egypt's past. [Female] Egyptian art had

52
00:02:47,056 --> 00:02:50,702
been dominated by rectilinear forms, here Akhenaten

53
00:02:50,702 --> 00:02:53,970
seems to be demanding this new style, dominated

54
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,320
by curvilinear forms. [Male] Look at the careful

55
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,878
attention to the drapery, there is a softness

56
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:02,558
throughout that is in absolute contrast to the traditions

57
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:05,372
of Egyptian art. But in some ways, there are elements

58
00:03:05,372 --> 00:03:07,717
of traditional Egyptian sculpture. [Female]

59
00:03:07,717 --> 00:03:12,053
Right, we still see a composite view of the body and

60
00:03:12,053 --> 00:03:15,185
a profile view of the face, but a frontal view of the eye.

61
00:03:15,185 --> 00:03:18,719
[Male] Right or one hand is facing us but the shoulders

62
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:21,121
are squared with us so as much of the body is

63
00:03:21,121 --> 00:03:24,434
exposed to us as possible while the figures are still in

64
00:03:24,434 --> 00:03:27,729
profile. So let's take a look at some of the iconography

65
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:31,594
here, this little panel really tells us a lot. God is

66
00:03:31,594 --> 00:03:35,599
present, Aten is present, here rendered as the sun

67
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,567
disk. And from that sun, which has a small cobra in it

68
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:43,270
which signifies that this is the supreme deity. The only

69
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:47,076
deity. Akhenaten was a monotheist and this was in

70
00:03:47,076 --> 00:03:51,945
such contrast to the pantheon of gods that traditional

71
00:03:51,945 --> 00:03:55,154
Egyptian religion counted on. Here Akhenaten says

72
00:03:55,154 --> 00:03:58,927
"No, there is only one true God" so we can see the

73
00:03:58,927 --> 00:04:01,752
cobra, we can see the sun disk and then we can see

74
00:04:01,752 --> 00:04:05,559
rays of light that pour down and if you look closely you

75
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:09,320
can see hands at the ends of those rays except for

76
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,987
the rays that terminate right at the faces of the King

77
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:16,919
and Queen, and there you see not only hands but also

78
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:21,481
Ankhs, the Egyptian sign of life and so it's as if Aten

79
00:04:21,481 --> 00:04:26,659
is giving life to these two people and these two people alone.

80
00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:28,766
[Female] Those rays of light are holding those Ankhs

81
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:33,543
right at the noses, the breath of life for Akhenaten and

82
00:04:33,543 --> 00:04:37,622
Nefertiti. We can see in the throne of Nefertiti symbols

83
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:40,937
of both Upper and Lower Egypt, indicating that Nefertiti

84
00:04:40,937 --> 00:04:44,481
is Queen of both. [Male] Akhenaten himself is sitting on

85
00:04:44,481 --> 00:04:47,257
a simpler throne, it does give a sense of her

86
00:04:47,257 --> 00:04:51,257
importance and the fact that they would rule Egypt together.
