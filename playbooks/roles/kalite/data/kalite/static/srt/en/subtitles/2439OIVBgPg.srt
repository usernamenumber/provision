00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,300
Hello. In this series of presentations, I'm gonna try

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:11,200
to teach you everything you need to know about triangles and angles and parallel lines

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:18,800
and this is probably the highest-yield information that you could ever learn, especially in terms of the standardized tests.

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,300
And then when we've learned all the rules we'll play something I call the Angle Game,

5
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,600
which is essentially what the SAT makes you do over and over again.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,100
So let's start with some basics.You know what an angles is.

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:35,300
Well actually maybe you don't know what an angle is.

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:46,000
If I have two lines...

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,800
and they intersect at some point,

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,900
the angle is a measure of exactly how wide the intersection is between those two lines.

11
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:05,500
So this is the angle. An angle is how wide those two lines open up.

12
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:12,600
And they're measured either in degrees or radiants. And for the sake of most geometry classes we'll use degrees.

13
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,300
When we start doing Trigonometry we'll use radiants.

14
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:21,700
And you're probably familiar with this. Zero degrees would be two lines on top of each other...

15
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:27,700
this if I were to just eyeball it looks like 45 degrees.

16
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:38,800
If I had the lines even wider apart, like that, that's 90 degrees.

17
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,400
And 90 degree lines are also called perpendicular, because

18
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,200
they are, I feel like saying because they are perpendicular,

19
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,900
but because one is going completely vertical while the other is going horizontal.

20
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:56,400
Wow, it's actually amazingly difficult to find the exact right wording.

21
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:03,500
But I think you get the idea. By definition, perpendicular lines are 90 degrees apart from each other.

22
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,700
And you've seen this all the time in things like squares or rectangles.

23
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:18,800
A rectangle is made up of a bunch of perpendicular lines, or lines at 90 degree angles.

24
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,700
The way you draw a 90 degree angle is you draw a little box like that.

25
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,300
That's the same thing as doing this.

26
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:49,700
And you could even get wider angles. If you go above 90 degrees... this could be, I don't know, 135 degrees

27
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:59,100
If you ever want to really measure the angles you could use a protractor.

28
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:10,400
Then if you had it so wide that the two lines are actually almost forming a line...

29
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:21,600
that's 180 degrees. And then you could keep going.

30
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:36,900
If this angle is 135 degrees...

31
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:55,800
There are 360 degrees in a circle. So this magenta angle would be 360 - 135 degrees

32
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:05,400
that's 225 degrees.

33
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:12,100
So you know degrees in a circle are 360 degrees, this is important to know.

34
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:17,400
It's also important to know that if you go halfway around a circle,

35
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,400
that's 180 degrees.

36
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,400
Like if you viewed the
pivot point as like,

37
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,100
let's say, right here.

38
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,200
I mean it looks like just
one line and it really is.

39
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,400
But that's 180 degrees.

40
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,600
And then if you go quarter
way around the circle,

41
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,800
that's 90 degrees.

42
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,900
All right?

43
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,100
Hopefully you're getting
a bit of an intuition

44
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,600
for what an angle is.

45
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,400
So now I will teach you
a bunch of very useful

46
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,500
rules for angles.

47
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:50,300
Clear this.

48
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:50,800
So let me redraw.

49
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,300
So if I had a line like this.

50
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,900
I like using the colors, just
so I think it keeps you from

51
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:04,100
getting completely bored.

52
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,477
And it might not be completely
intuitive what I'm doing, but

53
00:05:06,477 --> 00:05:11,400
let's add an angle like that.

54
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,800
And so, let's just say-- you
know, I'm not measuring these

55
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,400
exactly-- let's say that
this is 30 degrees.

56
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:27,300
We know that if we go all the
way around the circle, we know

57
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,800
that that's 360 degrees.

58
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,600
Right?

59
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,300
And that's a very ugly
looking around the circle

60
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,100
angle that I drew.

61
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,100
So then we also know
that this angle right

62
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,600
here is 330 degrees.

63
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,300
Right?

64
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,800
Because this angle plus this
magenta angle is going to

65
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,300
equal the whole circle.

66
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,300
So this is equal
to 330 degrees.

67
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,400
So remember that.

68
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,500
The angles in a circle--
or there are 360

69
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,300
degrees in a circle.

70
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,500
I don't know if you remember.

71
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,200
You probably don't.

72
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,400
This was probably
before you were born.

73
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,900
But there used to be a game
called 720, and it was a

74
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,900
skateboarding game--
it was a video game.

75
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,100
And the 720 was essentially
you were trying to jump

76
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,500
your skateboard and
spin around twice.

77
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,500
And that's 720 degrees.

78
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,600
If you go around a circle
twice that's 720 degrees.

79
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,300
If you just jump and
spin around once, you

80
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,700
went 360 degrees.

81
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,700
So you've probably heard this
in just popular culture.

82
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,200
But anyway.

83
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,900
So 360 degrees in a circle.

84
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,800
And you could imagine half
a circle is 180 degrees.

85
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,200
So the other important thing to
realize is, like we said, if

86
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,700
we go halfway around the
circle it's 180 degrees.

87
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:50,900
But if we have two angles that
add up to that-- so let's say.

88
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,700
I don't know if these lines are
thick enough for you to see.

89
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:58,100
Let me draw something thicker.

90
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,700
It doesn't look ideal,
but you get the idea.

91
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:11,600
So if we have this
angle, let's call it x.

92
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:19,500
And then this angle is y.

93
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,000
What do we know about the
relationship between x and y?

94
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,300
Well, we know that the entire
angle is half of a circle.

95
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:28,800
Right?

96
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,700
So that's 180 degrees.

97
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,500
That's 180 degrees,
this entire angle.

98
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:42,600
So what are angles x and
y going to add up to?

99
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,900
I'm trying to stay
color consistent.

100
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:51,100
x plus y are going to
equal-- I'm color blind,

101
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,800
I think-- 180 degrees.

102
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,400
Or you could write y is
equal to 180 minus x.

103
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,000
Or x is equal to 180 minus y.

104
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,100
But if x plus y are equal to
180 degrees-- and you can see

105
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,900
that it makes sense that they
do-- if you add the two angles

106
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,900
you go halfway around a circle.

107
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:20,400
Then that tells us that x and y
are-- and this is a fancy word,

108
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,900
and it's just good to commit
this to memory-- they are

109
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:36,300
supplementary angles.

110
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,800
That's when you add
to 180 degrees.

111
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:45,700
Now what if we had
this situation.

112
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,600
Oh my God, that was horrible.

113
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,100
Undo.

114
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,000
Let's say I had this situation.

115
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,800
Let's see.

116
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,300
I draw two perpendicular lines.

117
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:00,900
Right?

118
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,200
So this is going a quarter
way around the circle.

119
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,700
All right.

120
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:09,400
Let's say this entire angle
here-- I'm drawing it really

121
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,600
big-- that's 90 degrees.

122
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,100
Right?

123
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,300
They're perpendicular.

124
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:19,700
And now if I had two
angles within that.

125
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,600
So now if I have two angles
here-- so let's say that this

126
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,200
is x and this is y-- what
do x and y add up to?

127
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,200
Well, x plus y is 90.

128
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:38,900
And we can say that x and
y are complementary.

129
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:43,000
And it's important to not get
confused between the two.

130
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,200
Just remember complementary
means two angles add up to 90

131
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,500
degrees, supplementary means
that two angles add

132
00:09:50,500 --> 99:59:59,999
up to 180 degrees.
