1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,050
We're on problem 84.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,660
On a company-sponsored cruise,

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,390
2/3 of the passengers were company employees,

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,010
and the remaining passengers were their guests.

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:20,380
So we could say, employees is equal to 2/3 of passengers.

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,990
And I guess we could also say that guests are equal to 1/3

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,000
of passengers. The remainder are guests.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,740
If 3/4 of the company employee passengers were managers,

9
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:36,620
what was the number of company employee passengers who were

10
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,910
not managers? OK.

11
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,010
So the second statement, in at least the problem statement,

12
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:54,260
it says if 3/4 of the company employee passengers were

13
00:00:54,260 --> 00:01:04,900
managers-- so 3/4 of E were managers,if I read that statement

14
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,940
what was the number of company employee passengers

15
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,540
who were not managers?

16
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:22,010
So essentially, they want to know what 1/4 of E is, right?

17
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,470
This is what they're asking.

18
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:27,300
Because they want to know, what were the number of

19
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,990
company employee passengers that were not managers?

20
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,020
And 3/4 were managers, 1/4 were not managers.

21
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,290
So if we could figure out P,we would be able to figure out E,

22
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,060
and we'd be able to figure out 1/4 E.

23
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,970
If we were able to figure out guests, we could then use that

24
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,760
to figure out P, which we could use to figure out E,

25
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,180
which we could then figure out 1/4 E.

26
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,590
So that's how we should be thinking about it,

27
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,010
not that we should be spending that much time on it.

28
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:53,470
Problem number one. There were 690 passengers.

29
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,750
690 is equal to P. Well, we'd be done, right?

30
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,660
Because E is equal to 2/3 P,

31
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,730
and then we want to know what 1/4 E is.

32
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:09,880
So the non-manager employees would be 1/4 times E,

33
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,650
which is just 2/3 times P. Times 690.

34
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,500
And that would be our answer. So one alone is sufficient.

35
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,340
And then statement number two. There were 230 passengers

36
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,110
who were guests of the company employees.

37
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:31,000
So they're essentially saying that guests are equal to 230.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,450
And then we could use this information,

39
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,650
that guests are just 1/3 of P.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,720
And then, of course, from there you could solve.

41
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,140
You could multiply 3 times both sides of the equation to

42
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,430
figure out that P is equal to 690.

43
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,050
Which is the same information that they gave in one,

44
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,010
which was enough to solve the problem.

45
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,330
So two alone is also sufficient. So

46
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:59,030
they are each independently sufficient to solve the problem.

47
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,030
That problem is confusing, just with the language.

48
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,620
Company, employee, manager,passenger, guest.

49
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,390
It was very confusing. 85.

50
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:15,040
In the x-y plane, does the point 4 comma 12 lie on line k?

51
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,510
OK, this is interesting. So let me draw a line k,

52
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:22,390
and I'll worry about the point 4 comma 12 later.So let's see.

53
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,060
Let me look at the points that they do say lie on k.

54
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,560
So if this is the x-axis,that's the y-axis.

55
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,300
Statement one tells us that the point 1, 7 lies on k.

56
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:40,240
So the point 1 comma 7 lies on k.

57
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:47,200
And then they also tell us that the point--- that alone

58
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,230
isn't going let me know if the point 4 comma 12 lies on it.

59
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:56,040
So 1, 2, 3, 4. 4 comma 12. It might be up here.

60
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,020
This is the point that we care about. If you can see that.

61
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,010
Let me scroll down. 4 comma 12.

62
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,880
So if the line looks like that, maybe it goes through,

63
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,850
but the line could be like that.

64
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,530
So statement number one alone isn't enough.

65
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,490
Statement number two says the point minus 2 comma 2.

66
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,240
x is minus 2, y is positive 2.

67
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,590
So they're saying that lies on it. Eyeballing this line,

68
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,000
k, it seems like 4 comma 12 could very well lie on it.

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,390
But we have to do a little bit of math to figure it out.

70
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,370
So first of all, just statement two by itself

71
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,440
doesn't help us, because this line could go anywhere.

72
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:43,000
You need two points to just know what the line is.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,360
And so how do we figure out if the point 4 comma

74
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,060
12 is on this line?

75
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,030
Well, the easiest way to do it is to figure out the slope--

76
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,740
well, I don't know if it's the easiest way, but it's the way

77
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,020
I would think about doing it--is to figure out the slope of

78
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,270
the line, and then extend that slope here and see if the

79
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,040
point 4 comma 12 lies on it.

80
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,020
So let's see, what's the slope of this line?

81
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:11,020
So when we went up 7 minus 2. So the rise is 5.

82
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:17,540
When you go up 5, we went over how much? 1 minus minus 2.

83
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,370
We went over 3, right?

84
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,570
So for every 3 that you move over, you go up 5.

85
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,540
That's the easiest way to think about it.

86
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:29,190
So we're going from x is equal to 1 to x is equal to 4,

87
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,800
so we're going to the right by 3.

88
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,410
And so we should be going up 5.

89
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,940
So 5 plus 7, sure enough,is equal to 12.

90
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,940
So if you just extend the slope,

91
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:46,060
it does hit the point 4 comma 12.Well,actually you know what?

92
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:50,480
I just wasted a lot of your time, because we just have to

93
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,330
know whether the data is sufficient to answer the question.

94
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,580
We don't have to prove that the question is true.

95
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,570
I've just proven to you that 4 common 12 does lie on the line

96
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,510
But you could have just said,oh, well, you know what?

97
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:05,060
Statement number one gives me a point on the line.

98
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,100
That alone isn't enough to solve the problem.

99
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,080
Statement number two gives me another point.

100
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,790
And then at this point, if you're really taking the GMAT

101
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,100
and time matters, you just say, hey, I got two

102
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:18,980
points for this line.

103
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,370
Two points is everything I need to know about a line.

104
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,880
Once I know two points on a line, I can figure out if any

105
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,740
other point is on that line. I'm done.

106
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,420
Both statements combined are sufficient.

107
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,070
You wouldn't have to do all of this stuff that I did,

108
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,020
which would waste your time.

109
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,410
But just to prove to you that you could figure it,I did that.

110
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,830
But anyway.I have to admit I did waste your time a little bit

111
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,760
You should just immediately say,oh,I got two points on a line

112
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:43,040
Once I have two points, I can completely figure out if any

113
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,220
other point lies on that line. 86.

114
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:01,740
So we have circular garden K,and then we have circular garden

115
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,060
let's see,what does it say?

116
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,590
It is 1/2 the length of the edge that surrounds circular

117
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:13,510
garden G. So this is circular garden G. This is K. This is G.

118
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:16,090
So they're saying the length of the edging that surrounds

119
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:20,840
circular garden K is 1/2 the length of the edging that

120
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,230
surrounds circular garden G.

121
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:26,120
So we could say circumference of K-- right, that's the edging

122
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:32,020
that surrounds it--is equal to 1/2 the circumference of G.

123
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:37,160
Fair enough. What is the area of garden K?

124
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,040
Assume that the edging has negligible width.

125
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,590
Well, a couple of things.

126
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,000
If we know the circumference,we know the area, right?

127
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,070
Because the circumference is 2 pi r, and once we know r,

128
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,910
area is pi r squared.

129
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:54,060
So if we can figure out the circumference of K,

130
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,470
then we know its area.

131
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,200
And likewise, if we know anything about the radius,

132
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,590
or the diameter, or the area of G, we can figure out its

133
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,780
circumference. We know its area. We can use the formula,

134
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:11,110
area equals pi r squared to figure out what r is.

135
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:13,080
And then once you figure out what r is, you could just

136
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,020
figure out that circumference is equal to 2 pi r.

137
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,300
So if you have any of this information, you're able to

138
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,800
figure out any of the rest of it.

139
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:25,280
So statement number one says,the area of G is equal to 25

140
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,190
pi square meters. So let me write it.

141
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,300
So immediately you should say,hey, if I know the area of G,

142
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,000
I can figure out the radius of G.

143
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And if I know the radius of G,

144
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,710
I can figure out the circumference of G.

145
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,150
If I know the circumference of G, I can figure out the

146
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,010
circumference of K.

147
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,920
If I know the circumference of K I can figure out the radius

148
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,780
of K, and if I know the radius of K, I know the area of K.

149
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,450
You shouldn't have to calculate any of that.

150
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,310
So this is enough. This is sufficient. Statement two.

151
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,590
And maybe I'll do that for you, just to show you that it

152
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,730
can be done. But hopefully it's making some sense.

153
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:04,760
The edging around G is 10 pi meters long.

154
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,300
So they're actually telling us that the circumference of G is

155
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,050
equal to 10 pi.

156
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,580
So this is even easier. They're giving us this.

157
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,430
That means the circumference of K is 5 pi, which means that

158
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,130
we can figure out the radius of K and we could

159
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:19,970
figure out the area.

160
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,070
So this is also sufficient to solve the problem.

161
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,460
And just so you don't take my word for it,

162
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,060
let me just show you how quickly you could figure it out.

163
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:33,390
If the area of G is 25 pi, that means that pi times the

164
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,450
radius squared of G is equal to 25 pi.

165
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,780
That means that the radius is equal to 5, right?

166
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,400
Cancel out the pi on both sides. r is equal to 5.

167
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,790
That means the radius is 5.

168
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:47,020
That means the circumference is 2 pi times this.

169
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:51,470
So that means that the circumference of G is equal to

170
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:55,220
2 pi times 5, which is 10 pi, which is exactly what

171
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,530
statement two told us.

172
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,330
And then from there, we could figure out the circumference

173
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,580
of K, which is 1/2 of that.

174
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,070
So circumference of K is equal to 5 pi.

175
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,470
And then we know that 2 pi times the radius of K

176
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,870
is equal to 5 pi. Divide both sides by pi.

177
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,020
We know that the radius is equal to 5/2.

178
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,960
And then the area of K would be pi times this squared.

179
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,980
So it would be pi times 25/4, and we'd be done.

180
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,570
But all of this was a waste of time.

181
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:25,300
I just wanted to show you that once you have the radius or

182
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,680
the circumference, or the area of either of these,

183
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,080
you're able to figure out everything else.

184
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,000
And I'm out of time. See you in the next video.
