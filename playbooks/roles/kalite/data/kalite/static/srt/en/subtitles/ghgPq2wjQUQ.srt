1
00:00:00,338 --> 00:00:03,318
What I thought I would attempt to do in this and the next few

2
00:00:03,318 --> 00:00:06,533
videos is just to give a scaffold of American history, I'm clearly

3
00:00:06,533 --> 00:00:10,133
going to glaze over a lot of the details, but hopefully it will

4
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:13,000
give you a sense of how at least everything fits in together

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,333
and at least the major events in American history,

6
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:18,800
now when I talk about American history I mean United States

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,733
history, and so the first real successful settlement in what's

8
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:25,400
now the United States was at Jamestown, and that's Jamestown

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,708
Virginia, right over here in 1607, and it was set up as a kind of

10
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:33,000
a commercial settlement, and then shortly after that, and we always

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,067
learn this in school with you know the pilgrims on the Mayflower

12
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:40,667
sailing the oceans blue and all the rest, they were kinda the next

13
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:45,200
major settlement in the new world, I guess we should say the

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,667
next major English settlement, there were obviously the Spanish

15
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:51,748
and the Portuguese were already settling the New World with

16
00:00:51,748 --> 00:00:54,236
a good bit of success at this point, but we're talking about the

17
00:00:54,236 --> 00:00:58,667
English settlements, and so the pilgrims settled Plymouth in what's

18
00:00:58,667 --> 00:01:05,867
now Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1620 and at, obviously from 1620 until the mid 1700s

19
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:10,129
you just had a huge influx of people, migrating and cities

20
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:14,262
developing, but I'm going to fast forward all the way to the mid -

21
00:01:14,262 --> 00:01:17,098
1700's, so this is actually a huge amount of time that I'm

22
00:01:17,098 --> 00:01:19,492
just not providing any details over because I'm just going

23
00:01:19,492 --> 00:01:25,333
focus on the major events in American history, so this is 130

24
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:29,533
year period where things were just getting built out more, they were getting more developed

25
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:33,667
and I'm going to fast forward to 1754 because at this period,

26
00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:37,267
you had essentially the entire east coast of what's now the US

27
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:40,867
these were the thirteen colonies of the United States, well they're not the United States, yet.

28
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:44,467
They are the 13 British colonies, but these are English settlements

29
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:47,034
and then if you go a little bit to the

30
00:01:47,034 --> 00:01:49,600
north-west, from there you have all the French settlements

31
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,733
and obviously still in these parts, you know, in Quebec and Canada people speak French

32
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:59,754
but you had the french settlements up in this area, up in this area

33
00:01:59,754 --> 00:02:02,708
over here, I'm not going to go into the details, each of these can

34
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:05,733
be a whole series of videos, and hopefully in the future I will make

35
00:02:05,733 --> 00:02:10,733
them a whole series of videos, but you fast forward to 1754

36
00:02:10,733 --> 00:02:14,902
and you start having the French and the British start getting into

37
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:20,467
squabbles over territory where Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is right now.

38
00:02:20,467 --> 00:02:24,267
In 1754, and that starts the French and Indian war,

39
00:02:24,267 --> 00:02:28,225
and I want to be very clear here, because this is one of the biggest

40
00:02:28,225 --> 00:02:31,333
points of confusion when people learn American history,

41
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,426
Since it's called the French and Indian war they think its between the French

42
00:02:33,426 --> 00:02:38,216
and the Indians, but its not its. It was the French and the Indians against, against

43
00:02:38,216 --> 00:02:44,424
the British and the colonists so in this war the British and the

44
00:02:44,424 --> 00:02:49,200
colonists were on the same side against the French and the Indians, and then obviously

45
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,554
there were some Indians who were also on the side of the British,

46
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:57,179
but its called the French and Indian war because these were the people

47
00:02:57,179 --> 00:03:01,933
that the British were fighting against, now if anyone outside of the

48
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:08,256
United States talks about the French and Indian war they'll not call it the French and Indian war, they'll really just call that

49
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:12,421
the American theater of the Seven Years War, because it eventually evolves

50
00:03:12,421 --> 00:03:15,471
into a much bigger conflict, between Great Britain and France

51
00:03:15,471 --> 00:03:18,333
that is going on in Europe, and the French and Indian war was really

52
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:23,867
just the American theater of it. So between, between 7 -- the French and Indian war starts in

53
00:03:23,867 --> 00:03:27,759
1754 based on these disputes over Pittsburgh, but that wasn't the only

54
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,323
thing there were all of these other things, and other tensions

55
00:03:31,323 --> 00:03:34,692
that were developing and the thing that starts the war is never the only

56
00:03:34,692 --> 00:03:38,262
factor it is always just the tipping point, but that leads to a

57
00:03:38,262 --> 00:03:43,867
bigger war in Europe, and that's the Seven Years War, that starts in 1756 and ends

58
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:49,667
they both end because they are really the same war

59
00:03:49,667 --> 00:03:56,961
in 1763 with the Treaty of Paris, Treaty of Paris in 1763 and the big take-away of that

60
00:03:56,961 --> 00:04:02,992
is that really most of what France had in the new world now becomes

61
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:08,662
essentially a part of the British Empire now becomes British colonies

62
00:04:08,662 --> 00:04:13,533
or British territories, and even Louisiana goes over to Spain, at this point

63
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:17,067
and you'll see it goes back to France for a little bit in 1800

64
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:19,622
and then it goes back to the United States, in 1803 but we'll see

65
00:04:19,622 --> 00:04:25,400
that in a second, so 1763 the British with this huge costly war

66
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,990
that they were able to win, and at least from the point of view of the

67
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:34,478
British they felt that the main beneficiaries of this war were the Americans

68
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:37,225
because they were able to get all this new territory all of this new area

69
00:04:37,225 --> 00:04:41,452
that they can now trade with, so that they can now potentially settle,

70
00:04:41,452 --> 00:04:47,626
and so the British decide to start taxing the Americans for at least some portion

71
00:04:47,626 --> 00:04:53,533
to recoup some portion of the cost of the war so they pass in 1765 they

72
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:59,667
pass the Stamp Act and this wasn't a tax on stamps what this was is

73
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:03,034
that they essentially declared that a whole set of paper that had to be

74
00:05:03,034 --> 00:05:08,258
used in the new world so the stuff for legal documents, stuff that maybe even

75
00:05:08,258 --> 00:05:13,672
newspaper that that paper had to be produced in Great Britian and it had

76
00:05:13,672 --> 00:05:17,669
to have a special stamp on it in order for the contracts or whatever was on top it

77
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:21,386
in order to be legitimate, so essentially it was a huge tax on paper,

78
00:05:21,386 --> 00:05:25,497
and on documents and essentially this is what societies ran on so it was

79
00:05:25,497 --> 00:05:32,189
just a way to extract money from the colonists in order to I guess help pay back

80
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:37,148
some of the cost that the empire felt that they had incurred on behalf of

81
00:05:37,148 --> 00:05:41,867
of the colonists you can debate whether who was the main beneficiary

82
00:05:41,867 --> 00:05:45,675
but regardless you can imagine that this this whole period

83
00:05:45,675 --> 00:05:49,112
over here the colonists weren't happy, especially because they didn't have representation

84
00:05:49,112 --> 00:05:52,892
in Parliament, this was done without anybody from the colonies saying

85
00:05:52,892 --> 00:05:59,302
"Hey wait, I don't think that's fair or this is fair" or whatever so you fast forward, 1773

86
00:05:59,302 --> 00:06:04,309
you have the Boston Tea party where, you have a bunch of people who

87
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:08,590
for what ever reason and there's multiple interests here, but there was three ships

88
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:14,470
in Boston harbour full of tea, and the tea was owned by the East India Tea

89
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:19,520
Company, and they decide in protest, and there was a whole series of

90
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,621
acts and other taxes that went back and forth but once again we're not

91
00:06:22,621 --> 00:06:26,533
going to go into the details here, but in revolt they dumped the tea

92
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:30,536
and they dressed up as Indians, American Indians, and they dumped the tea

93
00:06:30,536 --> 00:06:35,800
into Boston Harbor, and you can imagine that that was a very exciting

94
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,867
act for the colonists, but it didn't make the British very happy, and then after that they passed the

95
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:44,468
Coercive Act, they essentially did a blockade of Boston, so things started

96
00:06:44,468 --> 00:06:48,933
to get really really really tense in the early 1770s,

97
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:53,199
than if you fast forward to 1775 you have essentially the first

98
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,789
conflicts of the American Revolutionary War and we're going to do

99
00:06:56,789 --> 00:06:59,656
a whole series of videos on really the whole Revolutionary War,

100
00:06:59,656 --> 00:07:05,041
1776 you have the Declaration of Independence, this is them right

101
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:08,756
here drafting the Declaration of Independence and thats really just saying

102
00:07:08,756 --> 00:07:14,600
"Hey you know we've had enough of you Great Britain. We are now

103
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,636
declaring ourselves as an independent country. No more of this colonies

104
00:07:19,636 --> 00:07:24,779
business", and so all the way untill 1783 you have the American

105
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:28,400
Revolutionary War, and once again you can do a lot of videos on this but I'm

106
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,230
just going to go over just so that you have a sense of when everything

107
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,861
happened and when everything ended, and we can later dig deeper

108
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:38,059
into the scaffold and it ends with the Treaty of Paris, and the US

109
00:07:38,059 --> 00:07:43,586
becomes a free, independant state and then you fast forward --

110
00:07:43,586 --> 00:07:47,580
until this point the US is being governed by Congress and the Articles

111
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,779
of Confederation, but the constitution that we have now, it was drafted

112
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:54,667
in 1787, it was ratified it had to get at least 9 of the states to ratify

113
00:07:54,667 --> 00:08:00,328
it that happend in 1788 and then it went into effect in 1789.

114
00:08:00,328 --> 00:08:04,043
so it depends on what you consider the birth of the country well it would

115
00:08:04,043 --> 00:08:07,433
definitely the Declaration of Independence, but the country in its

116
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:12,635
current form with its current institutions, with its current constitution started in 1789 and that

117
00:08:12,635 --> 00:08:18,347
was also the beginning of Washington's first of two terms as President

118
00:08:18,347 --> 00:08:24,152
and those ended in 1797. And then John Addams comes into the picture

119
00:08:24,152 --> 00:08:30,467
and the reason why I put this is that it was actually, this is the only president that I show, very important that

120
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:34,564
he decided to step down after two terms, he was hugely popular and if he

121
00:08:34,564 --> 00:08:37,900
wanted to he probably could have become one of these characters that

122
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,733
stick around maybe a little bit longer than some people would want

123
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:44,194
so it was really good that he set this example of stepping down after

124
00:08:44,194 --> 00:08:48,267
two terms and that he wasn't this kinda power hungry dude.

125
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:53,133
You fast forward a little bit more, 1803, and I mentioned after the

126
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:57,000
French and Indian war what's Louisiana, and I want to be clear

127
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,341
Louisiana isn't just what's the current state of Louisiana it's this whole

128
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:05,067
region that includes the state of Louisiana, but all the way up to roughly

129
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:09,384
what the United States's current border with Canada

130
00:09:09,384 --> 00:09:13,323
And after the French and Indian war all of this business over here went to Spain.

131
00:09:13,323 --> 00:09:16,308
Then in 1800 it went back to France.

132
00:09:16,308 --> 00:09:22,154
But then in 1803 Napoleon had a bunch of stuff that he had to worry about; his naval fleet was destroyed,

133
00:09:22,154 --> 00:09:29,208
he had suffered some defeats in the West Indies, I guess we could call it.

134
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:38,585
In particular, in Haiti, and he said "I probably won't be able to control this territory anyways."

135
00:09:38,585 --> 00:09:44,577
So he sold it to the United States for what turned out to be a very, very, very cheap price.

136
00:09:44,577 --> 00:09:47,400
But it's kind of like, you know, It's not like he could of protected it anyways.

137
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,177
The United States might have been able to take it from him, without him being able to do anything.

138
00:09:51,177 --> 00:09:56,723
So he might as well get some money for it so he can fund his battles in Europe.

139
00:09:56,723 --> 00:10:00,269
So in 1803, the United States almost doubled in size.

140
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:09,200
It went from these territories that had after the American Revolution for independance

141
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,362
Now it got all this region over here in 1803.

142
00:10:13,423 --> 00:10:20,231
Then you fast forward a bit, you fast forward a bit. The war of 1812 it was an interesting one

143
00:10:20,231 --> 00:10:24,054
because there weren't any really serious outcomes from it.

144
00:10:24,054 --> 00:10:28,769
What was interesting about this whole time period even after independance,

145
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:31,038
the British continued to harass America,

146
00:10:31,038 --> 00:10:40,538
they continued to arm Native Americans who would maybe revolt, or cause trouble for settlers

147
00:10:40,538 --> 00:10:46,269
They would impress American seamen, when I say impress, I don't mean they were doing something special.

148
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:51,262
It meant that they were impressment of seamen meant they were

149
00:10:51,262 --> 00:10:57,129
kind of taking over these boats, taking the sailors and forcing them to become part of the British military.

150
00:10:57,129 --> 00:11:01,537
So they are doing a whole series of things that was really kind of antagonizing the United States.

151
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:05,483
In 1812, the United States declares war on Great Britain.

152
00:11:05,483 --> 00:11:11,845
You have the war of 1812. It ends in 1815 with the battle of New Orleans.

153
00:11:11,845 --> 00:11:17,629
But there wasn't any real transfer of territory or anything like that over here.

154
00:11:17,721 --> 00:11:21,283
What was good, some people call it the second war for American independence.

155
00:11:21,283 --> 00:11:26,775
It really asserted America's, that America was here to stay, I should say,

156
00:11:26,775 --> 00:11:28,614
that the United States was here to stay.

157
00:11:28,614 --> 00:11:33,721
That the revolution wasn't just some fluke, that it isn't just some just flybynight country.

158
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:37,275
It was able to defeat one of the greatest empires in the world again.

159
00:11:37,314 --> 00:11:39,792
So it was kinda here to stay.

160
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:42,107
Now, you fast forward a little bit more,

161
00:11:42,107 --> 00:11:46,761
this part of what we call Texas, this area right over here.

162
00:11:46,761 --> 00:11:51,561
It was before 1836, it was part of Mexico,

163
00:11:51,561 --> 00:11:58,222
but the Mexicans actually encouraged, actually encouraged English speaking settlers.

164
00:11:58,222 --> 00:12:02,369
These would be the American English speaking settlers into the area just because it was sparsely settled.

165
00:12:02,384 --> 00:12:06,622
But these English speaking settlers a lot of them were slave owners

166
00:12:06,622 --> 00:12:11,899
And then as we kinda go up to 1836 the state of Mexico,

167
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:15,643
that all this was kind of governed by - they were thinking about abolishing slavery.

168
00:12:15,643 --> 00:12:20,505
So you can imagine that the settlers there didn't like this idea.

169
00:12:20,505 --> 00:12:24,359
So in 1836, you have the war for Texas independence.

170
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:27,697
And that's where you "Remember the Alamo" and all of that.

171
00:12:27,697 --> 00:12:33,005
The first President of Texas is Sam Houston, that is why Houston is named Houston.

172
00:12:33,005 --> 00:12:36,751
Then you fast forward all the way to 1845;

173
00:12:36,751 --> 00:12:40,605
In this time period you have this whole talk in the United States

174
00:12:40,605 --> 00:12:45,797
of manifest destiny, that, you know, it is a part of our God given destiny as Americans

175
00:12:45,797 --> 00:12:51,482
to one day extend our territory all the way to the Pacific ocean.

176
00:12:51,482 --> 00:12:53,115
So people were already eyeing a lot of the territory,

177
00:12:53,115 --> 00:12:56,340
remember all this territory, this was Texas

178
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,979
and Mexico still viewed it as their territory, even though,

179
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:04,114
it was being governed independently by the people that called themselves Republic of Texas.

180
00:13:04,114 --> 00:13:08,297
And all this territory, that was Mexican territory,

181
00:13:08,297 --> 00:13:12,262
so that people were trying to eye and saying wouldn't it be nice to get a little bit of that.

182
00:13:12,262 --> 00:13:21,597
So in 1845, and this was in agreement with the settlers in Texas, with the Republic of Texas, the United States annexed Texas.

183
00:13:21,597 --> 00:13:25,614
So the settlers there wanted this to happen. So this wasn't a forced annexation of Texas.

184
00:13:25,614 --> 00:13:33,596
But Mexico was not so happy about this, because Mexico still viewed, still viewed Texas as a part of their territory.

185
00:13:33,596 --> 00:13:40,615
And America, to some degree depends on how you view it, seams like they kind of wanted to goad Mexico into war.

186
00:13:40,615 --> 00:13:44,497
So they sent military really close to the border of Mexico,

187
00:13:44,497 --> 00:13:50,430
even into some territory where that Mexico had better claims to it, but I'm not going to take sides on this.

188
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,771
But it seemed like there was some instigation going on,

189
00:13:53,771 --> 00:13:55,847
some debate on the actually course of events.

190
00:13:55,847 --> 00:14:01,780
In 1846, you have war actually breaking out between Mexico and the United States.

191
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:05,684
And by 1848, the United States essentially trounces Mexico.

192
00:14:05,684 --> 00:14:10,730
Most of the war actually does go on on Mexican land.

193
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:16,510
Because of that, because of that, Mexico cedes over all this area,

194
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:20,544
so California, and all of the rest of, you know, Nevada, Arizona,

195
00:14:20,544 --> 00:14:24,877
and with the part of New Mexico that didn't come along with the United States, didn't already have.

196
00:14:24,877 --> 00:14:33,009
Along the same amount of time you both have the British and the Americans that were eyeing this territory,

197
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:36,610
Oregon terriory, the territory up here. It even included part of Canada.

198
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,626
Eventually, they were able to resolve it relatively peacefully.

199
00:14:39,626 --> 00:14:43,014
And what they agreed is, is that the Americans would get all of this territory.

200
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:47,030
And the British would get everything north of this line, right over here.

201
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:51,180
That's why Vancouver and British Columbia and all of that is, is Canada now.

202
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:57,078
It stayed part of the British empire a little bit longer.

203
00:14:57,078 --> 00:15:00,461
So by 1848 the manifest destiny essentially had happened.

204
00:15:00,461 --> 00:15:02,862
We, the United States had gotten everything from

205
00:15:02,862 --> 00:15:06,480
California all the way from the Pacific coast to the Atlantic coast.

206
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,711
And then, you know, and clearly, I'm really just covering the high levels

207
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:16,162
just 30,000 level, of foot view of American history here.

208
00:15:16,162 --> 00:15:18,545
This whole time you have this tension developing,

209
00:15:18,545 --> 00:15:23,378
from the birth of the country through, through the election of Abraham Lincoln.

210
00:15:23,378 --> 00:15:25,812
You have this tension over slavery.

211
00:15:25,812 --> 00:15:28,628
A lot of people in the North didn't like it on moral grounds.

212
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:33,695
A lot of people in the South didn't like it, well they wanted slavery regardless of their,

213
00:15:33,695 --> 00:15:36,078
of their, of what they thought of it morally.

214
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:40,695
The South's economy to a large degree was based on slavery

215
00:15:40,695 --> 00:15:44,395
and so all of this, you know, the tipping point kind of happened in 1860.

216
00:15:44,395 --> 00:15:51,366
where Abraham Lincoln who was pretty vocal about his, about the fact that he did not like slavery.

217
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:55,097
He wanted to curb the spread of slave states.

218
00:15:55,097 --> 00:15:57,832
You know, up to this point you had all these compromises,

219
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:01,540
every time a state came into the Union, the slave states wanted it to be another slave state,

220
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,419
the free states wanted it to be another free state.

221
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:10,351
So you always had this, people kinda jockeying for whoever could have the most states on their side of the camp.

222
00:16:10,351 --> 00:16:16,625
But all this kind of, pro slavery and anti slavery, hit a tipping point in 1860,

223
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:21,842
when Abraham Lincoln, who was fairly vocal about not extending slavery, he was elected.

224
00:16:21,842 --> 00:16:28,843
Then, a bunch of what are now,what we consider southern states seceded from the Union.

225
00:16:28,843 --> 00:16:35,275
And then 1861, in South Carolina, South Carolina said, "Hey, we are not part of the United States anymore."

226
00:16:35,275 --> 00:16:40,926
but there was still a United States military garrison there, so they attacked it, that started the Civil War.

227
00:16:40,926 --> 00:16:44,359
So during the Civil War, it lasted until 1865.

228
00:16:44,359 --> 00:16:48,976
Abraham Lincoln makes the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863,

229
00:16:48,976 --> 00:16:52,926
which essentially proclaims, all the slaves should be free.

230
00:16:52,926 --> 00:16:57,993
This lays the groundwork for the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constituition.

231
00:16:57,993 --> 00:17:02,675
And then unfortunately, he dies, two months before the end of the Civil War.

232
00:17:02,675 --> 00:17:06,931
But in 1865, the South surrenders, so they are not able to secede.

233
00:17:06,931 --> 00:17:11,587
Essentially, we no longer have slavery in the United States.

234
00:17:11,587 --> 00:17:17,504
So I'm going to leave, and it's fascinating. Just to give you a sense of things, here's the map.

235
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:21,140
The navy blue are the Union states, the Northern States,

236
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:25,732
the light blue are the territory controlled by the Northern States.

237
00:17:25,732 --> 00:17:30,857
This orange color are the states that seceded from the Union, the Confederacy.

238
00:17:30,857 --> 00:17:36,389
This light orange, these are kinda territories that they controlled, but they were disputed.

239
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:41,455
And these yellow states, right here were members of the Union,

240
00:17:41,455 --> 00:17:46,684
they did not secede from the Union, they didn't join the Confederacy, but they were slave states.

241
00:17:46,684 --> 00:17:49,571
Probably the most fascinating thing about the American war, the Civil War,

242
00:17:49,571 --> 00:17:54,852
other then the fact that it ended slavery in the United States, that was probably the biggest thing,

243
00:17:54,852 --> 00:17:59,738
It was also the bloodiest war that ever happened in the United States history.

244
00:17:59,738 --> 00:18:03,132
During the Civil War, during the Civil War, and these are unbelievable numbers.

245
00:18:03,132 --> 00:18:11,786
18% of white males in the South, white males in the South, in South died.

246
00:18:11,786 --> 00:18:17,587
18%, almost one out of five white males in the South died during the Civil War.

247
00:18:17,587 --> 00:18:20,632
And for the North, it was slightly better. It was 6%.

248
00:18:20,632 --> 99:59:59,999
But still it was a huge percentage of the men in the United States died fighting the Civil War.
