1
00:00:00,839 --> 00:00:04,979
Ever since the franco-prusian 
war in 1870 to 1871

2
00:00:04,979 --> 00:00:08,303
the Germans recognized that they were
likely to face another war with france.

3
00:00:08,303 --> 00:00:12,860
That was a war that allowed Germany
to unify the humiliated France,

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,959
they were able to capture some very
valuable territory from France,

5
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:19,170
in particular Alsace-Lorraine, 
which is very mineral rich,

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,188
and so the Germans were plotting to
uh... what are we going to do if

7
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,512
we're going to get into
another war with them.

8
00:00:23,512 --> 00:00:26,161
At the same time, once France
and Russia had this alliance,

9
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:29,593
Germany fully recognized that 
if there is a war with France,

10
00:00:29,593 --> 00:00:33,210
it's likely to not be just with France,
it's likely to be a two-front war

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,720
on the western front... they will
be in conflict with France,

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,552
and on the eastern front they will
be they'll be in conflict with Russia.

13
00:00:40,552 --> 00:00:42,875
And so to deal with this eventuality,
this is all the scheming that

14
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:47,063
Germany did in the decades
going up to Wold War One.

15
00:00:47,063 --> 00:00:51,040
They came up with the Schlieffen plan, 
and I'm sure I'm mispronouncing it...

16
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,732
Schleiff.. Schliff...

17
00:00:53,732 --> 00:00:57,009
..Schlieffen plan,

18
00:00:57,009 --> 00:01:00,879
named for Alfred von Schlieffen,
he was chief of the German Empire's

19
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,860
general staff from 1891 to 1905.

20
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,250
And it was based on how do you 
deal with the two-front war,

21
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,100
and the general ideas here
were that Russia...

22
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,330
Russia had a large and almost
inexhaustible army but because it was

23
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,713
so large it would take a long
time for to mobilize...

24
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:23,550
long time... 
...to mobilize.

25
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,610
and the Germans were actually able to
approximate it correctly 'cause this is

26
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,437
how long it did take the Russians
to mobilize at the beginning

27
00:01:29,437 --> 00:01:30,859
of the World War One,

28
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:33,960
they estimated that it would take
them about six weeks.

29
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,150
So the Schlieffen plan called for

30
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,049
enough german troops on the 
eastern front initially

31
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:45,751
in order to keep the Russians at bay, but
then the main fighting force of the germans,

32
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:49,831
while the Russians are mobilizing, 
is to go after France

33
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:52,250
and try to essentially
knock France out of commission

34
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,030
so that they're not facing a 
two-front war anymore

35
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:58,569
and that have those troops go back
to fight against the Russians.

36
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:00,509
And the way that they wanted to do it

37
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:05,240
is by rolling through Belgium in a kind
of a wheel-like pattern like this,

38
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,259
and the reason why they want to do this
wheel-like pattern is that they correctly

39
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:13,079
predicted that the French were very eager
to get this territory right over here

40
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:15,614
and the French actually had a plan - 
they called it "Plan 17" -

41
00:02:15,614 --> 00:02:18,945
for going after Alsace-Lorraine,
it was an offensive plan

42
00:02:18,945 --> 00:02:22,792
and the view is that the French 
army is going in that direction,

43
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:25,909
if the german army rolls through Belgium 
and is able to get them from the rear

44
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:28,696
they could put the french army 
out of commission.

45
00:02:28,696 --> 00:02:33,620
So in early august 1914, the 
Germans was to declare war

46
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,625
on France and on Russia. 
The germans tried to put

47
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:41,885
the Schlieffen plan into action
and they frankly almost succeeded.

48
00:02:41,885 --> 00:02:47,011
So through april... sorry, through
august and early september

49
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:50,730
the Germans were able to,
essentially rolled through Belgium,

50
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,830
were able to roll through Belgium,

51
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:57,668
and keep the combined mainly 
french forces but there is also

52
00:02:57,668 --> 00:03:01,309
some assistance from
British, to keep them on their heels.

53
00:03:01,309 --> 00:03:04,609
And this happened all the way 
until early september

54
00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:09,849
when they get near the Marne or a little
bit past the Marne river in France

55
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:13,845
and it was here that the... 
the sixth french army

56
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:17,312
so, and when we talk about armies
we're talking about huge numbers

57
00:03:17,312 --> 00:03:20,019
of troops, the...
the sixth french army had

58
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:22,720
over two hundred thousand troops
in it. When we're talking about

59
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,553
the battle of the Marne, which I'm about
to talk to, we're talking about a...

60
00:03:26,553 --> 00:03:29,386
the first battle of the Marne,
we're talking about a battle

61
00:03:29,386 --> 00:03:33,020
that involves two million troops,
so these are... these are battles

62
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:37,030
that are occurring on an epic
scale, just each of these armies,

63
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:40,989
this army or... this one right...,
or even the german armies,

64
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:44,449
we're talking about hundreds,
tens to hundreds of thousands

65
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:47,773
of troops, in general an army
characterize, you're talking

66
00:03:47,773 --> 00:03:51,139
about over fifty thousand, 
sixty thousand troops.

67
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:54,333
So what happens as you go to
early september, specially

68
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:59,402
september fifth 1914,
the sixth french army

69
00:03:59,402 --> 00:04:02,983
recognize... recognizes a
mistake that the first

70
00:04:02,983 --> 00:04:07,064
german army made. By
trying to roll around like this

71
00:04:07,064 --> 00:04:10,834
they exposed their right
flank, so right over here

72
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,908
would be the right
flank of the german army.

73
00:04:13,908 --> 00:04:19,549
And just as... most mammals...
our flanks are kind of our weak spot

74
00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:24,473
that area between your ribs and your
hips, the same thing is true for armies.

75
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:29,034
The front of the army tends to be
where you have the strongest forces

76
00:04:29,034 --> 00:04:31,346
and then you have your
supply routes going back,

77
00:04:31,346 --> 00:04:34,628
so if you can outflank an army,
that's what a lot of military strategy

78
00:04:34,628 --> 00:04:38,979
is designed around, you can 
hit an army in it's weaker point.

79
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:44,169
so by september fifth, the first german
army recognizes, but it was too late,

80
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:48,087
by september sixth they were 
at in battle they were uh...

81
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:51,851
they were essentially being 
confronted by the sixth french army

82
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:57,456
and by essentially turning to meet
them, by turning to meet them,

83
00:04:57,456 --> 00:05:01,035
they created an opening between
them and the second german army,

84
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:04,639
and that opening was able to... the 
French and the British were able to

85
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,481
take advantage of that to essentially
put the Germans on their heels

86
00:05:08,481 --> 00:05:12,175
after a month of advancing,
and so right over here you have

87
00:05:12,175 --> 00:05:13,069
the various... you have the various

88
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:16,582
you have the various french armies

89
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:19,739
and they were assisted by the 
british expeditionary..

90
00:05:19,739 --> 00:05:21,930
the british expeditionary force.

91
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:26,096
and so from the battle of the Marne,
which was essentially most...

92
00:05:26,096 --> 00:05:29,445
most historians would say between
september sixth or september fifth

93
00:05:29,445 --> 00:05:31,880
september sixth and
september twelve

94
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,505
they were able to put the...
the Germans on the retreat,

95
00:05:35,505 --> 00:05:38,060
the Germans retreated
pass the Aisne river,

96
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,590
and then once you get into november
and the end of year of 1914,

97
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,463
at essentially... the Germans essentially 
entrenched themselves and

98
00:05:44,463 --> 00:05:48,050
literally they were building
deep trenches in...

99
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:52,131
...in northern France, and a little
bit of western Belgium,

100
00:05:52,131 --> 00:05:55,081
and what i have right over here
- let me see if I can draw -

101
00:05:55,081 --> 00:05:56,620
what i have right over here
what the boundaries were

102
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,648
eventually happened after
the german suffered essentially

103
00:06:00,648 --> 00:06:04,625
their first big defeat, they had
to ... they had to retreat,

104
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:08,749
and they had to literally retrench, 
and this is what the borders

105
00:06:08,749 --> 00:06:11,234
would then be like,
and they were and...

106
00:06:11,234 --> 00:06:13,350
and these were literally
trenches getting dug here,

107
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,379
and these borders are... you know
this first stage of the war was

108
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:19,554
hugely dynamic, you had 
armies moving fairly rapidly

109
00:06:19,554 --> 00:06:23,968
over a period of weeks and months,
but then once the Germans retrenched,

110
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:27,840
you have a roughly this position being
static for the next three years

111
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,014
in the famous trench warfare of the western
front that you might have seen movies on.

112
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,169
And I want to emphasize this was a
big deal, the first battle of the Marne

113
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:39,653
sometimes is called the 
"miracle of the Marne".

114
00:06:39,653 --> 00:06:43,529
If that... if the Allies at the french,
with the british help,

115
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:46,672
were not able to push the Germans
back, they might have accomplished

116
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:50,962
the Schlieffen plan and actually
maybe they would have won WWI,

117
00:06:50,962 --> 00:06:54,587
or at least been able to win the western
front fairly quickly and then been able

118
00:06:54,587 --> 00:06:58,850
to deal with the Russians a little bit better.
But because of the "miracle at the Marne"

119
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:03,471
which was hugely bloody, were talking
about 500.000 casualties on both sides,

120
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:07,216
we're talking a hundred to two hundred
thousand dead on both sides,

121
00:07:07,216 --> 00:07:10,300
but because of that, that was able to
hold off the Germans,

122
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:16,894
but it got the western front in this kind 
of ugly three year long trench warfare.
