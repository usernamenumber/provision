1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,900
   

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,280
We're on problem 48.

3
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,800
It says if x squared is added
to x, the sum is 42.

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,220
So let's just write that out.

5
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:13,390
If x squared is added to x,
the sum is equal to 42.

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,079
Which of the following could
be the value of x?

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,660
So essentially they just want
us to solve this equation.

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,930
So the easiest way to do it is
to write it as a quadratic

9
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,500
equaling 0 and then
factoring it.

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,130
So we could write this as x
squared plus x minus 42 is

11
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,560
equal to 0.

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,020
And let's think.

13
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:36,040
What two numbers when I add
them equal 1, and when I

14
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,710
multiply them equal minus 42?

15
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,110
And the fact that when I
multiply them equals minus 42

16
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,530
tells me that one of them has to
be positive and one of them

17
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,290
has to be negative.

18
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,280
That's the only way that when
you multiply two numbers

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,700
you're going to have
a negative number.

20
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,500
So one of them has to be
positive, one of them has to

21
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,370
be negative.

22
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,640
And so when we're adding a
positive and a negative,

23
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,430
you're really finding the
difference between the two.

24
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,080
So the difference between the
two numbers has to be 1 and

25
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,000
their product has to be 42.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,610
And I noticed when I see
42 I immediately

27
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,770
think, oh, 6 and 7.

28
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,930
6 times 7 is 42.

29
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,850
And since when you add them
you get a positive 1, 7's

30
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,780
probably the positive one and
minus 6 or 6 is probably the

31
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,730
negative one.

32
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,210
So let's try it out.

33
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:21,190
x plus 7 times x minus
6 equal to 0.

34
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:26,460
And right, 7 times minus
6 is minus 42.

35
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,460
It's really 7x plus minus 6x
is equal to positive x.

36
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,740
Or you could think 7 plus
minus 6 is equal to the

37
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,466
coefficient on the
x, which is 1.

38
00:01:36,466 --> 00:01:37,890
But anyway, that works.

39
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,050
And you could multiply this
out and try it out.

40
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,860
And everything I'm saying,
it's not some voodoo.

41
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,200
The reason why I say that they
have to add up to the 1 is

42
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,620
because when you multiply
this out, that's what

43
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,870
builds up this term.

44
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:54,370
This 7 times x plus the minus
6 times the other x.

45
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,880
That's what builds this term
when you multiply it out.

46
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,010
This term comes from
the x times the x.

47
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,620
The minus 42 comes from the
7 times the minus 6.

48
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,640
Anyway, now we're
at this point.

49
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,210
We say OK, well how do we get--
we have two things when

50
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,840
you multiply them equal to 0.

51
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,120
Well that means that one of them
or both of them have to

52
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,110
be equal to 0.

53
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:16,520
So that means that x plus 7 is
equal to 0, which would mean

54
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,890
subtract 7 from both sides.

55
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,290
Which means x is equal
to minus 7.

56
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,580
Or x minus 6 is equal to 0.

57
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,090
Add 6 to both sides. x is
equal to 6. x would

58
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,110
be 6 or minus 7.

59
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,830
And they have one of
the choices there,

60
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,710
which was choice A.

61
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,340
Next problem.

62
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,820
49.

63
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,740
What quantity should be added to
both sides of this equation

64
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,320
to complete the square?

65
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,930
So when you complete the square
you want the thing to

66
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,740
just look like a-- you want
whatever's on the left-hand

67
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,190
side to look like a
perfect square.

68
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,350
And what do I mean by
perfect square?

69
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:54,580
So if I had x plus a squared,
that's equal to x plus a

70
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,030
times x plus a.

71
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,370
And that's equal to x
times x, x squared.

72
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,890
x times that a, so
that's plus ax.

73
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,680
And now this a times this x.

74
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,250
So that's another ax.

75
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,730
Plus this a times that a.

76
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,410
So plus a squared.

77
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,100
And that's equal to x squared.

78
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:17,720
Plus-- we have two of these
now-- plus 2ax plus a squared.

79
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,520
So essentially we want this, we
want the left-hand side to

80
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,930
have this form.

81
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,330
So we say, this is
a perfect square.

82
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,742
We can say that's the same thing
as x plus a squared.

83
00:03:26,742 --> 00:03:29,820
So let's think about
how we can do it.

84
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:37,040
If we have x squared minus 8x
is equal to 5 and I put a

85
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,640
space here for a reason because
we want to add or

86
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,490
subtract something here so it
looks like a perfect square.

87
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,530
So think about it.

88
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,600
When we have this format, in
order for this thing to be a

89
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,820
perfect square, whatever this
coefficient is right here,

90
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,430
this term right here has to
be half of this, squared.

91
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,310
a squared is half
of 2a squared.

92
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,990
So if we took half of minus
8, that's minus 4.

93
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,890
In this case, if we said
2a is equal to 8, a

94
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,720
would be minus 4.

95
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,910
And so minus 4 squared
is what?

96
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,830
It's plus 16.

97
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,990
And this is an equation.

98
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,005
So one you do to one side of an
equation you have to do to

99
00:04:18,005 --> 00:04:18,955
the other side of
the equation.

100
00:04:18,955 --> 00:04:21,570
So you have to say that
that is also equal to.

101
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,820
So you have to add
16 to both sides.

102
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,600
Otherwise you're changing
the equation.

103
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,610
Now this, hopefully you
recognize this as already a

104
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:29,300
perfect square.

105
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,270
I mean you could look at this
pattern up here or you could

106
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:35,090
say, OK, if I add minus 4 to
itself twice I get minus 8.

107
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,680
If I multiply it by
itself I get 16.

108
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,790
So this is x minus 4 squared.

109
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,490
That's equal to 25.

110
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,370
And actually, just if you're
curious-- and we did this in

111
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,170
the Khan Academy, we did a
couple of videos on this--

112
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,400
this is how you prove the
quadratic equation.

113
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,050
You essentially complete the
square with arbitrary numbers

114
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,320
a, b, and c, and you get
the quadratic equation.

115
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,540
You know, we show it in 10
minutes, so it's not this

116
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,270
impossibly hard thing
to understand.

117
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,860
They just want to know, what
do you add to both sides of

118
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,220
this equation?

119
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,500
What quantity should be added to
both sides of this equation

120
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,370
to complete the square?

121
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,100
So the answer to this
one was 16.

122
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,670
But they just as equally could
have said, solve it by

123
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,860
completing the square.

124
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,730
And you'd say oh, x minus 4
squared is equal to 25.

125
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,160
So x minus 4 is equal
to plus or minus 5.

126
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,310
And then you could say,
x is equal to plus or

127
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,690
minus 5 plus 4.

128
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,930
And then you could say,
OK, which is 4 plus

129
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,190
positive 5 is 9.

130
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:35,780
4 plus minus 5 is--
or, minus 1.

131
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,160
Anyway, they didn't ask us
that, so we don't have to

132
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,350
spend too much time
thinking about it.

133
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:42,430
   

134
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:49,310
Let's see, we're
on problem 50.

135
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:53,070
Let me see, problem 50.

136
00:05:53,070 --> 00:06:01,970
I'll copy and paste 50 and 51.

137
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,190
All right, what are the
solutions for the quadratic

138
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:12,190
equation x squared plus
6x is equal to 16?

139
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:15,350
And the temptation here is
really to kind of try to solve

140
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,870
it the way you do a
linear equation.

141
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,110
I don't know, factor out an
x and-- I don't know, do

142
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,580
whatever else.

143
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,010
But the important thing to
recognize is this is a

144
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,220
quadratic equation.

145
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,910
And the easiest way to solve it
is to put all the terms on

146
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,660
one side and then get a
0 on the other side.

147
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,640
And then either factor
it or use the

148
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,090
actual quadratic equation.

149
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,300
Or complete the square, whatever
you need to do.

150
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,970
So let's subtract 16
from both sides.

151
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:40,230
And you get x squared plus 6x
minus 16 is equal to 0.

152
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:43,270
I just subtracted 16 from
both sides to get here.

153
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,600
And before just jumping into the
quadratic equation, let's

154
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,270
see if we can factor
it by inspection.

155
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:54,165
So what two numbers, when I
add them, equal 6-- and we

156
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:58,602
want positive 6-- and when I
multiply them equal minus 16?

157
00:06:58,602 --> 00:07:01,360
And once again, since it's a
minus 16, if you multiply two

158
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,310
numbers you get a
negative number.

159
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,530
They have to be different
signs.

160
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,560
One has to be positive and
one has to be negative.

161
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,780
And their difference will be 6
because one's positive and

162
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,435
one's negative.

163
00:07:11,435 --> 00:07:12,990
So let me think about it.

164
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:16,470
So if I had minus-- well,
8 and 2 is equal to 16.

165
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,390
And they're 6 apart.

166
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,800
So if I did plus 8 and
minus 2-- right.

167
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,370
Plus 8 and minus 2
is positive 6.

168
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:27,360
So it's x plus 8 times
x minus 2.

169
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,620
And that really just takes
a lot of practice.

170
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,870
You say, OK, what two numbers?

171
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:30,880
16.

172
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,340
OK.

173
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,010
8 and 2.

174
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,290
Well they're going to have
to be different signs.

175
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,480
But I have a positive one here,
so whichever number's

176
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,430
larger is probably going
to be the positive one.

177
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,120
So positive 8 and minus 2.

178
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,790
Yeah, when you add them up,
they equal minus 6.

179
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,660
Yeah, it works.

180
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,120
So you set that equal to 0.

181
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,910
And you say OK, this has to be
equal to 0, or that has to be

182
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,320
equal to 0.

183
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,220
So x is either equal
to minus 8.

184
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,830
If you say x plus 8 is equal to
0 then subtract 8 from both

185
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,590
sides, you get x is
equal to minus 8.

186
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,075
I shouldn't have skipped
that step, but

187
00:08:01,075 --> 00:08:02,030
I'll do the step here.

188
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,530
Or you could say x minus
2 is equal to 0.

189
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,220
Add 2 to both sides, you
get x is equal to 2.

190
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,070
What x makes this
term equal to 0?

191
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,330
And you could look at
it from inspection.

192
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:19,190
So x could either be minus 8
or 2, and that is choice C.

193
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,290
Problem 51.

194
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:24,970
Leanne correctly solved the
equation x squared plus 4x

195
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,020
equals 6 by completing
the square.

196
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,530
Which equation is part
of her solution?

197
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,385
OK, so the same thing.

198
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:34,010
x squared plus 4x.

199
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,260
And when you complete the square
you're going to add

200
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:35,809
something here.

201
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:36,954
So I'm going to leave
a little blank.

202
00:08:36,954 --> 00:08:38,850
Is equal to 6.

203
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,880
So what could I add here that
makes this expression look

204
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,950
like a perfect square?

205
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,320
Well, got to the pattern
that we did a

206
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,850
couple of problems ago.

207
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,840
Whatever's here should be the
square of half of this.

208
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,510
So 4-- well, half
of that is 2.

209
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,570
2 squared is 4.

210
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,400
So I should add 4
to that side.

211
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,630
If I add 4 to that side,
I have to add 4 to

212
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,490
this side as well.

213
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,080
And now this 2 plus
2 is equal to 4.

214
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,800
2 times 2 is equal to 4.

215
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,340
So this is x plus 2 squared.

216
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,660
And I really want you to
get the intuition.

217
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,750
Don't memorize the steps for
completing the square.

218
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,380
I want you to really
understand why.

219
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,120
This is the square
of half of that.

220
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,230
And we showed it in
the beginning.

221
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,650
Square a lot of binomials and
see for yourself that that's

222
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,270
always going to be the case.

223
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,200
Anyway, so this is
x plus 2 squared.

224
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,360
That's going to be equal to--
6 plus 4 is equal to 10.

225
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,170
And that is choice B.

226
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,842
   

227
00:09:30,842 --> 00:09:34,760
I think we have time
for one more.

228
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:40,980
One more problem, problem 52.

229
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,330
Copied it and now I
have pasted it.

230
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,410
Carter is solving this equation
by factoring.

231
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:51,610
Which expression could be one
of his correct factors?

232
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:58,470
Once again, I like to personally
separate out the

233
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,030
number that goes into
all of them.

234
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,320
And all of these are
divisible by 5.

235
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,260
And that just simplifies
it in my head.

236
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,760
So if I divide all of these by
5-- actually, I could just

237
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,600
divide both sides of
this equation by 5.

238
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,410
0 divided by 5 is 0.

239
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:14,910
And then that left side divided
by 5 becomes 2x

240
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:27,960
squared minus 5x plus
3 is equal to 0.

241
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,400
So if this is 2x squared here,
so it's going to be two

242
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,880
numbers when you multiply them
equal 3 and when you-- so

243
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,210
let's think about this
a little bit.

244
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,830
Actually, let me write it down
here because I think I'll need

245
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,930
more space.

246
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:44,240
2x squared minus 5x plus
3 is equal to 0.

247
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,040
And I just divided both
sides of the equation

248
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,755
by 5 to get to this.

249
00:10:47,755 --> 00:10:50,430
So let's see what
we can do here.

250
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,870
So we have a 2x squared here
and they already kind of

251
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,860
hinted to us that we're going
to have an integer solution,

252
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,230
so we can factor this.

253
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:00,460
So the intuition is that this is
going to be 2x times-- you

254
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,250
know, plus something.

255
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,460
Plus a.

256
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,650
Times-- well what times?

257
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:06,810
Times probably x, right?

258
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,340
2x times x is 2x squared.

259
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,050
Now that wouldn't be completely
obvious if they

260
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,970
didn't already tell us that
we could factor this.

261
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:13,550
You might have to use a

262
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,840
quadratic equation or something.

263
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,660
Actually, the quadratic equation
wouldn't be something

264
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,800
crazy to use here because
you can just

265
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,890
kind of plug and chug.

266
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,210
But let's see if we can
get the intuition.

267
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:25,470
So it's going to be 2x plus
something times x plus

268
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,830
something else.

269
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:30,310
If we were to multiply this out,
you get 2x times x is 2x

270
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,380
squared as it should.

271
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,250
2x times b is plus 2bx.

272
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,180
a times x is plus ax.

273
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:42,320
a times b is plus ab.

274
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,570
And so let's see what we get.

275
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,770
   

276
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:55,400
So plus 2b plus ax plus ab.

277
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,420
2x squared.

278
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,180
OK, now can do pattern
matching.

279
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,440
This was our original thing.

280
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,890
So 2 times b plus a has to be
equal to-- this term is the

281
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,150
same thing as this
term right here.

282
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,080
And that term has to be
the same thing as

283
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,440
that term right there.

284
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,230
So first of all, I have
a positive 3 here.

285
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,290
So I'm multiplying two numbers
to get a positive 3.

286
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:23,940
So they either have to be both
positive or both negative.

287
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,460
And then the other interesting
thing is we have-- when I take

288
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,070
2 times one of them plus
the other one, I

289
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,920
get a negative number.

290
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,520
So the only way when you're
dealing with negative numbers,

291
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,750
and when you just multiply it
times a positive and add them

292
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,050
to each other you get another
negative number, is if they're

293
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,340
both negative.

294
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,860
This told us they both
have to be negative

295
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,050
because this is positive.

296
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:44,460
And then since when you add
them without any negative

297
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,510
signs you get a negative number,
it tells you that that

298
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,920
has to be negative as well.

299
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,190
So let's see.

300
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:54,390
Let's just try 3-- negative
3 and negative 1.

301
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,300
If negative 3 and negative 1.

302
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:56,800
So you're right.

303
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,330
Yeah.

304
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:05,450
If b is equal to minus 1 and a
is equal to minus 3, then 2

305
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,050
times minus 1 is minus 2.

306
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,080
Minus 3.

307
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,460
Right, so b is equal to minus
1 and a is equal to minus 3.

308
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,740
This is a bit of an
art form here.

309
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,950
I mean there isn't like a plug
and chug, very mechanical way

310
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:17,680
of doing this.

311
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,610
The quadratic equation is one,
but this is the best way that,

312
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,220
at least, I know how to
do these without.

313
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,980
So, we know what a and b is.

314
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:28,460
So it's 2x-- a is minus 3.

315
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:34,910
2x minus 3 times x plus
b. b is minus 1.

316
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,290
So that's the factorization.

317
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:41,590
So 2x minus 3 times x
minus 1, which one?

318
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,180
They have this one right here.

319
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,090
2x minus 3.

320
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,070
And I'm all out of time.

321
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,790
See you in the next video.
