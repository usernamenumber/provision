1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
   

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,200
So we have a company here.

3
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,900
Let's just say it's
a widget factory

4
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,530
again or a widget company.

5
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,440
And what I'm going to do is I'm
going to actually write

6
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,170
out its income statement over
a given number of years.

7
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:15,400
What we did in the first video
on this series is we just did

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,140
one snapshot of the
income statement.

9
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,350
I think it was 2008.

10
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,600
But here we're looking at the
income statement over a bunch

11
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,910
of years, and in this case, I'm
just assuming that they

12
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,730
have a very stable revenue base,
that they bring in a

13
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,350
very stable amount of
revenue every year.

14
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,360
Now, their cost of goods, I'm
going to split up this time,

15
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,760
because there's two components
of cost of goods, so I'll just

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,020
make a cost of goods category
right here.

17
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,550
COGS, but that just stands for
Cost of Goods Sold, but

18
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,250
sometimes you'll hear someone
say our COGS were this or our

19
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,170
COGS were that.

20
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,180
Cost of Goods Sold.

21
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,150
So they're the variable costs.

22
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,850
And this video isn't a video
on variable versus fixed

23
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,460
costs, but you might learn
a little bit about it.

24
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,150
So they're the variable costs,
and that's literally the

25
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,830
actual costs of making
those widgets.

26
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:04,370
So if the widgets are made out
stainless steel, it's the cost

27
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:08,860
of buying the stainless steel
and maybe the electricity bill

28
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,140
of melting it and reforming it
or however you have to work

29
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:12,910
with stainless steel.

30
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,870
So let's say the variable costs
each of these years--

31
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,690
and I'm assuming stainless
steel prices

32
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:21,810
don't change-- is $100,000.

33
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:29,280
Minus $100,000 every year.

34
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,760
And actually, let's
just say that also

35
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,850
includes employee costs.

36
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,330
They have people on hourly wages
that are forming these

37
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,840
stainless steel widgets, so that
incorporates everything.

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,490
And then the fixed costs
will essentially be

39
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,360
the cost of the factory.

40
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,570
And let's say that they
essentially have to build a

41
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,920
new factory every two years, or
let's say they have to do

42
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,500
major repairs to the factory
every two years.

43
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,910
So let's say repairs
on factory.

44
00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:00,030
Because that's part of the cost
of building the widgets,

45
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,230
because if you continue to make
widgets at this kind of

46
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:07,060
$1 million a year pace, your
factory has to be retooled or

47
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,910
revamped every two years.

48
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,090
So let's put this fixed cost.
So the factory retooling.

49
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,730
   

50
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,410
And most times, and we'll see
this when you look at an

51
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,230
actual company's income
statement, they're not going

52
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,930
to break up the variable and
fixed costs within their cost

53
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,300
of goods sold like this, because
really, they actually

54
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,740
want to hide it from a lot
of their competitors.

55
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,730
They don't want their
competitors to have too much

56
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,170
intelligence on what their
cost structure is like.

57
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,875
It could be used against them
potentially, or maybe they

58
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,170
don't want their customers
to know.

59
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,370
Anyway, factory tooling.

60
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,330
So the way I just described it,
one way to account for it

61
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,750
is when you do the factory
retooling, you essentially

62
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,390
just mark it as an expense.

63
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:51,910
So let's say a factory retooling
costs $500,000.

64
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:56,430
So let's say it's
minus $500,000.

65
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,960
But they do it every
two years.

66
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,000
So you did it in 2005.

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,200
They didn't have to do
it in 2006, then they

68
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,360
can do it in 2007.

69
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,180
They don't have to
do it in 2008.

70
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,250
Fair enough.

71
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,815
And then we have their
gross profit.

72
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:18,500
   

73
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,110
Here it's $1 million
minus $600,000.

74
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:30,030
It's $400,000, then it's
$900,000, then it is $400,000,

75
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,250
then it's $900,000.

76
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:39,580
And let's say that their
SG&A-- SG&A is Selling,

77
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,390
General and Administrative
expenses.

78
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,120
I'll leave out marketing
for now.

79
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,370
They're SG&A, let's say it's
another $500,000 every year.

80
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,540
So minus $500,000.

81
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,322
And that never changes.

82
00:03:53,322 --> 00:03:57,260
$500,000 every year.

83
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,060
Minus $500,000.

84
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:05,980
And so their operating profit,
the amount of pre-tax income,

85
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,880
but you know, we're not
considering financing either,

86
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,470
so this is their operating
profit or their EBIT.

87
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,830
So operating profit.

88
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:20,519
And this year, it's
minus $100,000.

89
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,210
Here it's also minus $100,000.

90
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,970
But then in these years,
they make money.

91
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:29,120
It's $400,000 and $400,000.

92
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,170
And then we could
take this down.

93
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:33,605
Let's say they have no
interest expense.

94
00:04:33,605 --> 00:04:36,350
They have no interest expense,
because that's not the point

95
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,460
of this video.

96
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:44,870
And then their pre-tax profit is
going to be the same thing

97
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,910
as the operating profit, so
minus $100,000, minus

98
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:52,640
$100,000, $400,000--
I'll make the good

99
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,770
years in green-- $400,000.

100
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,810
And then, let's just say they're
in the Caribbean and

101
00:04:58,810 --> 00:04:59,770
they don't have to pay taxes.

102
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,100
Because that's not the point
of this, but you can apply

103
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,710
some tax rate to this
and figure out what

104
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:04,840
their net income is.

105
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,910
But the point of this is, even
though their business is ultra

106
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:13,720
stable, they do the exact same
thing every year, when we look

107
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,660
at the pre-tax or the operating
income, or if we tax

108
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,950
it, or even at the net income,
we see a super lumpy business,

109
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,625
because in one year they
lost $100,000.

110
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,280
If you're looking at the
business, you're like, oh,

111
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,160
what a horrible business.

112
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,050
But then the next year they make
$400,000, and then they

113
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,190
lose $100,000.

114
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,190
And you're like, gee, how
is that possible?

115
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,680
That you have such a sleepy,
stable business that's just

116
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,790
making COGS year in year out,
and they have the exact same

117
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,810
amount of revenue?

118
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,860
How is it possible that their
actual income is so lumpy?

119
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,510
And I think you know, because
you have this every other year

120
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:49,610
factory retooling, where they
have to spend $500,000 to

121
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,430
essentially rebuild their
factory because of all of the

122
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:57,560
wear and tear that happened
over the last two years.

123
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,350
So the question is, is this a
good way to account for it,

124
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,720
where when you have to--
I guess you could

125
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,880
say-- buy new equipment.

126
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,790
Let's say this $500,000 is to
buy actual new stainless steel

127
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:12,720
shaping tools, so is it a good
idea to account for it only in

128
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,660
the period that you spend it?

129
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,405
Because it's not like you're
only using these tools in this

130
00:06:18,405 --> 00:06:19,280
period and that period?

131
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,060
You're using these tools
throughout the period.

132
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,080
So the answer is, well, no,
it's not a good idea.

133
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,150
Because the whole purpose of
accounting is to give the

134
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,760
person reading the income
statement in this case as

135
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,340
accurate a picture of the actual
state of the business

136
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:35,940
as possible.

137
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,660
And this, in my opinion, isn't
an accurate picture, where it

138
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,410
creates this huge lumpiness and
it creates the impression

139
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,110
of a volatile business even
though it's a super, super

140
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,510
stable business.

141
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:48,190
So what you do, instead of just
saying, oh, I had to buy

142
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:52,670
$500,000 worth of equipment in
2005, so I literally put a

143
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:56,190
$500,000 expense there, and I
didn't have to do that in

144
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,040
2006, so I have no expense.

145
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,710
I had to do it in 2007,
so I put the expense.

146
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,990
Instead of doing that, what
you do is-- I'll put the

147
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:06,290
balance sheet down here-- so
whatever the balance sheet was

148
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:14,616
in-- so I'll draw both hand
sides of the balance sheet.

149
00:07:14,616 --> 00:07:22,290
   

150
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:27,050
So this is the asset side
of the balance sheet.

151
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,730
And just so you don't get
confused, there's always a

152
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:33,570
liability side of the balance
sheet as well.

153
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:40,200
So in 2007, maybe before I spent
the $500,000, right when

154
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,760
I do it, I probably had $500,000
of cash sitting here.

155
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,750
Let me write that down.

156
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,370
So I have cash.

157
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,950
I'll just put a C there.

158
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,750
Cash, $500,000.

159
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,455
And instead of just using this
an expense, and we'll go in

160
00:07:53,455 --> 00:07:55,570
the future on kind of how you
account for things in a little

161
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,370
bit more detail and how you
actually do the debits and

162
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,880
credits, but a simple way to
think about it, instead of

163
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,950
using this $500,000 as an
expense, we just transferred

164
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,850
this $500,000 to buy an asset.

165
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:10,970
So when you use cash to buy an
asset, and that asset has a

166
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,330
useful life that's more than
just that period, you're

167
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,650
essentially capitalizing the
expense or you're essentially

168
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,210
creating that asset on
the balance sheet.

169
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:21,190
So instead of this $500,000 just
disappearing expense, you

170
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,690
say, no, now I have-- let's call
it F for factory tools.

171
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:29,120
I have factory tools worth
$500,000, and then that cash

172
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,080
will go away.

173
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,039
So your assets will not have
really changed, the absolute

174
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,059
value of the assets.

175
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:36,730
You'll have just had $500,000
going from cash

176
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,760
to new factory tools.

177
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,280
And so this might be at the
beginning of when you do it.

178
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:48,190
Let's say this is 1/1/2007.

179
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,410
And what you say is, I'm going
to use these factory tools.

180
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,640
They're usable over two years.

181
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,760
So what you do is you depreciate
the tools.

182
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,790
So the way you'd think about
this is instead of having

183
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:02,530
factory retooling, you could
say factory tool.

184
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,376
Instead of retooling I'll
call that depreciation.

185
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:10,210
   

186
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,460
I don't know if you
can read that.

187
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,670
   

188
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,180
So it essentially spreads
out the cost of

189
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,850
that $500,000 a year.

190
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,940
So you say, I had a $500,000
piece of capital equipment,

191
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,570
and its useful life
is two years.

192
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,100
So I used half of
it in year one.

193
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,200
So instead of putting $500,000
there, the depreciation is

194
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,010
minus $250,000.

195
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:39,910
Likewise, in this year, no cash
went out the door, but my

196
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:43,070
equipment got a little
bit older, so I used

197
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,120
half more of it.

198
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,000
So it's $250,000.

199
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,240
And then my equipment
is worthless.

200
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,680
So this is in 1/1/2005.

201
00:09:50,680 --> 00:10:03,540
I have this tool that's
worth $500,000.

202
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:08,780
Then on 1/1/2006, I will have
used half of the tool.

203
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:18,650
So now this balance sheet-- I
copied the numbers, too, but

204
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:19,530
that's 2006.

205
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,020
I'm going from 2005 to 2006.

206
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,790
So now I will have used
up half of it.

207
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:30,410
So according to the accounting,
this equipment is

208
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,230
no longer worth $500,000.

209
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:35,520
It's now worth $250,000.

210
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,870
You know, that actually
might make sense.

211
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,200
Maybe if I were to sell it in
the open market, someone might

212
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,220
say, you know what?

213
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,500
I'm only willing to pay
$250,000, because you've

214
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,890
already used it for a year and
it only has one year of useful

215
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,650
life left, so it's of $250,000
of value to me.

216
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:52,240
And then the other $250,000
essentially went to an expense

217
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,740
called depreciation, which
is right there.

218
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:59,270
So every year, you're going to
have this asset go down on the

219
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,730
balance sheets by $250,000.

220
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:06,290
So here at the beginning
of this year, the

221
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,250
asset is worth $500,000.

222
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,570
So I'll write that up here.

223
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,020
So this is what the
asset's valued.

224
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,890
I'll do it in this
orange color.

225
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,860
So over here, let's say you did
it right at the beginning

226
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,130
of the year, the asset's
worth $500,000.

227
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,240
Now, it's worth $250,000.

228
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,530
Now, the asset's worth zero, but
at the beginning of this

229
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:25,280
year, you buy a new asset
worth $500,000.

230
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,270
Then it's worth $250,000
again.

231
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:32,080
And this is just an arguably
long-winded way of saying that

232
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,370
the way you account for this
is you spread out the cost

233
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:38,810
over time, over its useful life,
and this spreading out

234
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:41,390
is called the depreciation
of an asset.

235
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,060
And I'm running out of time in
this video, and I'll cover it

236
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,340
in the next, but you might have
also heard of the word

237
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,500
"amortization." Amortization
is to spread out a

238
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,450
non-tangible cost over
a period of time.

239
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:56,110
So for example, depreciation,
this was factory equipment,

240
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:59,000
and it gets old as I use it,
so I spread out its cost.

241
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,550
That's what depreciation does.

242
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,910
And it accurately reflects
what's actually happening in

243
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,110
the business.

244
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,960
It's not like I didn't
have any cost here.

245
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,050
I did have cost. I'm
using an asset up.

246
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,690
So therefore, I put
it down there.

247
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,870
Amortization is the exact same
thing as depreciation, but it

248
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,860
applies to things that
aren't equipment.

249
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,430
It applies to-- and I'll do it
in the next video-- but let's

250
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,600
say I had one big expense in
terms of I had to pay a bunch

251
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,160
of fees to the bank, but the
benefit of those fees are

252
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,980
going to be over time.

253
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,580
Then I would amortize
those fees.

254
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,930
I'll do that in the
next video.

255
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:32,760
Anyway, hopefully, you found
this vaguely useful.

256
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:32,855
