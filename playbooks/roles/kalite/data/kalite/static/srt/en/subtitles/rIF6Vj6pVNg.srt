1
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,440
In this video we're going to talk about Eratosthenes

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,169
who was a Greek scholar that lived about
two thousand years ago.

3
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:16,730
Eratosthenes found a way, using none of the modern tools that we have,

4
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,820
to measure the circumference of the Earth

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,869
and in this video we're going to see how he
did this.

6
00:00:22,869 --> 00:00:25,109
So the heart of Eratosthenes' measurement

7
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,229
is a simple geometry problem.

8
00:00:27,229 --> 00:00:29,539
So, consider circle shown here,

9
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:34,040
which has points A and B,

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,060
and let's say that we know the
distance that A and B

11
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,200
make on the circumference of the circle.

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,320
So we know the measure of arc AB.

13
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,810
Now, the question is,

14
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:51,050
with this knowledge can we determine the circumference of our circle?

15
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,440
and i'm sure you all

16
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,720
are thinking that the answer is obviously no, because A and B are just two random

17
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,610
points on the circle, so

18
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:00,610
just knowing they're distance doesn't help us very much.

19
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:05,030
What we need is some information that makes A and B not just random points on a

20
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,150
circle anymore.

21
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,860
We need to know the angle

22
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,460
that A and B make with the center of the
circle.

23
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,799
Once we know this, we know

24
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,770
how far around A and B go around the circle

25
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,300
because we know that every circle has

26
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,140
in it 360 degrees

27
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,800
in one full revolution.

28
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,280
So, by knowing theta we know the fraction of the circle

29
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,220
that the arc AB takes up and we can simply extrapolate to find the

30
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,330
circumference.

31
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:37,740
So let's make this point a little clearer with some concrete examples.

32
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,960
Let's look at the circle

33
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,159
on the right now

34
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,869
and again we have points A

35
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,229
and B.

36
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,630
And here you can clearly see

37
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,020
that the angle that A and B

38
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,810
make with the center of the circle is 90 degrees.

39
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,750
And since we know that 90 goes into 360 four times

40
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,780
arc AB is 1/4 around the circle,

41
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,880
meaning that the piece shown here,
the shaded piece,

42
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,720
will fit in the circle four times.

43
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,310
So in this case the circumference of the circle is four times the length of

44
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,779
arc AB.

45
00:02:12,779 --> 00:02:16,579
now let's just try that one home further
with this other circle again we have

46
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:17,909
point sandy

47
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:21,879
uh... and hear the angolan between
points in the let's say we measured

48
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,790
turns out to be

49
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,329
thirty six degrees

50
00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:28,089
so since thirty-six goes into three
hundred sixty ten times

51
00:02:28,089 --> 00:02:30,989
we know that ten of these pieces will
fit in the circle

52
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:33,120
and in this case the circumference is

53
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,949
and number of pieces

54
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:38,279
times the length of one piece

55
00:02:38,279 --> 00:02:39,969
now in general

56
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:45,179
these are coming to the circle is given
by the number of pieces we have

57
00:02:45,179 --> 00:02:47,709
times the length of one piece

58
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:52,129
and just friends explicitly the number
of pieces is three hundred and sixty

59
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:53,069
degrees

60
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:54,599
divided by data

61
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:57,409
the angle of the day and be in a percent
of the circle

62
00:02:57,409 --> 00:03:00,269
and length of one piece is simply abt

63
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:03,879
so now if we just know that these two
things dark a b

64
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:06,569
and the angle in the middle of the
senate the circle

65
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:09,819
we can determine the circumference and
this is really the heart to be a tough

66
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:11,889
news as method

67
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:14,150
so now it's a place

68
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,650
now we have another circle but this time
with explicitly identify the circle as

69
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,629
the earth

70
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:22,179
uh... and pointed becomes a city
alexandria

71
00:03:22,179 --> 00:03:24,609
mississippian uh... you get

72
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:28,329
and um... this is where you're totally
slipped

73
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:31,579
point b now becomes the city of saying

74
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:36,569
so in your classes a day it was known
did the distance between alexandria and

75
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:37,449
saying

76
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:39,789
was about five hundred mice

77
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:43,409
because back then utorrent miles but we
know the conversion factor so we don't

78
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:45,999
have to worry about the old system of
units

79
00:03:45,999 --> 00:03:49,319
the distance between alexander and
saying this time in months

80
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,549
and now

81
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:54,439
looking back at our previous problem we
see that all we have to do to figure out

82
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:57,119
the circumference of the earth given
this information

83
00:03:57,119 --> 00:04:00,279
is to figure out the angles that
alexandria and saying make with the

84
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:01,889
center of the earth

85
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:03,719
and the relieved

86
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:07,399
uh... they really brilliant thing about
their cousins as method is that he found

87
00:04:07,399 --> 00:04:09,949
a nice way to measure this angle

88
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,859
so how did he do this

89
00:04:11,859 --> 00:04:17,539
it was known that insane there was a
well along the well such that at noon on

90
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:18,910
the summer solstice

91
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,449
you could see the sun's rays light up
from the bottom of the world

92
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:26,009
and if you can buy this what this means
is that since as well as such uh... deep

93
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:27,129
thing

94
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:30,250
disney into the sunset is a must have
been coming into the earth

95
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,080
parallel to the world

96
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,050
to redraw these arrays uh...

97
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,460
miss his son is very far away from the
earth

98
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,879
and because the sun is so far away

99
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:44,050
we can't read there is coming in from
the sun at different points

100
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,909
so here we ground the ray that comes in
at alexandria and there are a at saint

101
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:52,280
now it's an interesting property of
reliance

102
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,749
if we have these dibrle and shown here
that you raised

103
00:04:56,749 --> 00:04:57,689
and we have

104
00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:00,069
the radio station

105
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:02,520
the single to be called beta two

106
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,639
is equal to the end of the we're trying
to find beta one

107
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,409
this is something is the fact that you
might've been exposed to a new job that

108
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:13,129
requires as it's called uh... property
of corresponding angles

109
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:15,489
because it's pretty easy to prove
yourself

110
00:05:15,489 --> 00:05:17,250
so since we know this

111
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,909
now we can transform the heart problem
of measuring data one

112
00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:24,009
to the relatively easier problem of
measuring putative

113
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:25,770
so i realize that they did too

114
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,220
three straight forward towards him and
on this region

115
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,210
we have hit the surface of the earth

116
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,779
as one of the important months and then
the radius

117
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:36,400
get translated into

118
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,270
vertical stick

119
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:42,379
and we also have the sun with one of
interest so this great cast a shadow on

120
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:43,460
the ground

121
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,749
and by knowing the length of the shadow

122
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:46,860
and the height of artistic

123
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,710
we can construct this triangle and
simply measure the angle

124
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:55,349
there to all we had to do is look at the
shadow created optimistically

125
00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:58,229
and this is exactly what it does in his
dad

126
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:01,360
and he measured that the angle data to
was equal to

127
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,509
seven point two degrees

128
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:08,279
so now we have this information the
angle

129
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,699
which is called better now

130
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:12,099
is equal to seven twenty degrees

131
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:15,449
and the measure of the art gave the or
alexander saying

132
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:18,009
is the five hundred must

133
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:21,949
still with us information now all we
have to do speed this into the formula

134
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:25,729
that we got earlier pushes recall it c
equals

135
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:28,360
three hundred fifty degrees divided
right there

136
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,199
times abt

137
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,729
so this is very simple to do

138
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:34,930
with morgan seven point two degrees but
they don't put in five hundred miles

139
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,460
arabian

140
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,220
and in the end we find it's easy for the
fifty eight times five hundred miles

141
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,690
or twenty five thousand miles

142
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:48,539
so this is our estimate or beer dozens
estimate for the circumference of the

143
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:50,240
earth call that c

144
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,660
nearsightedness

145
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,520
and so good to see how simple it was for
us to get this

146
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,259
noticed that

147
00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:00,490
according to our modern measurements the
average circumference of the earth

148
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:05,449
because not a perfect sphere is around
twenty four thousand nine hundred miles

149
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:09,759
so we're only about two hundred miles
off with this seemingly primitive method

150
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,849
which is about to have a percent

151
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:15,830
so this is a very impressive thing for
someone who lived so long ago without

152
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:21,899
the access to these tools that we now
use
