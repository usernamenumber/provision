1
00:00:00,718 --> 00:00:04,319
Let's talk a little bit more about reserve ratio requirements

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,369
And then if I have time, I want to introduce another,

3
00:00:07,369 --> 00:00:09,721
almost related and often confused topic

4
00:00:09,721 --> 00:00:11,319
and that is "leverage."

5
00:00:11,319 --> 00:00:21,354
So let's do reserve ratio requirement.

6
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:25,153
And let's say in whatever jurisdiction or world that I live in,

7
00:00:25,153 --> 00:00:28,919
that requirement is 10%. So that means that

8
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:35,636
for every dollar of checking account liabilities

9
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:38,003
or notes liabilities that I have outstanding,

10
00:00:38,003 --> 00:00:42,169
that I have to keep at least 10% of that in actual

11
00:00:42,169 --> 00:00:44,969
whatever the reserve currency is.

12
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:47,136
In our world we've been dealing so far it's been gold.

13
00:00:47,136 --> 00:00:49,335
In the current world, it's not gold.

14
00:00:49,335 --> 00:00:50,703
It's actually dollar bills.

15
00:00:50,703 --> 00:00:52,402
But anyway, we'll stay in the gold world

16
00:00:52,402 --> 00:00:54,954
and later on we'll get ourselves off the gold standard

17
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:56,219
and see how that works.

18
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,886
But let's just do the example from scratch again

19
00:00:59,886 --> 00:01:01,937
and just see how big I can get my balance sheet

20
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:05,336
and see exactly how this stops me from getting too big.

21
00:01:05,336 --> 00:01:08,469
So I have my bank like I always did.

22
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:11,086
Let's say my building is worth 100 gold pieces

23
00:01:11,086 --> 00:01:16,852
and then I capitalize it with another 200 gold pieces.

24
00:01:16,852 --> 00:01:19,227
This is the building.

25
00:01:19,227 --> 00:01:23,194
And this is my equity that I start off with.

26
00:01:23,194 --> 00:01:29,660
So I start off with 300 equity - 300 gold pieces of equity.

27
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,361
I should always do the equity in a different color

28
00:01:31,361 --> 00:01:33,993
because sometimes it gets confused with the liabilities -

29
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:36,044
- because they're both on the right-hand side.

30
00:01:36,044 --> 00:01:39,794
So this is my equity.

31
00:01:39,794 --> 00:01:42,145
And then I might take some deposits.

32
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:45,642
Let's just - I don't want to make this too large of a diagram.

33
00:01:45,642 --> 00:01:48,904
So let's just say I take another 100 gold pieces in deposits,

34
00:01:50,965 --> 00:01:54,920
100 gold pieces of actual deposits.

35
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,368
And then I have checking accounts

36
00:01:56,368 --> 00:01:58,463
for these people who deposited them.

37
00:01:58,463 --> 00:02:03,198
Let me do that - I'll do that in purple.

38
00:02:03,198 --> 00:02:06,114
These are checking accounts

39
00:02:06,114 --> 00:02:08,848
or notes deposit accounts for people.

40
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:09,747
These are my liabilities.

41
00:02:09,747 --> 00:02:12,280
So my question is, if these are all the deposits I have,

42
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,848
or these are all of the reserves I have,

43
00:02:14,848 --> 00:02:17,399
how much can I lend out.

44
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:19,598
Or, how much can I expand my balance sheet?

45
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,580
Well, the reserve ratio requirement says that

46
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,514
my reserves over my total checking accounts

47
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:32,015
that I have on my liabilities and the notes that I issue,

48
00:02:32,015 --> 00:02:34,529
that my reserves can be no more -

49
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,830
- or have to be at least 10% of that.

50
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,648
So right now I only have 100.

51
00:02:40,648 --> 00:02:43,214
Oops... I pressed the wrong button.

52
00:02:43,214 --> 00:02:46,130
Right now I only have 100 gold pieces

53
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,815
of on-demand checking accounts.

54
00:02:47,815 --> 00:02:49,497
And I'm not going to worry too much

55
00:02:49,497 --> 00:02:50,797
about the notes outstanding right now.

56
00:02:50,797 --> 00:02:51,880
They're really the same thing -

57
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,315
- at least from a balance sheet point of view.

58
00:02:54,315 --> 00:02:56,315
And I have 300 gold pieces.

59
00:02:56,315 --> 00:02:58,247
So I actually have more reserves

60
00:02:58,247 --> 00:02:59,399
than I have on demand account

61
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:00,981
because I've actually pre-capitalized it

62
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:02,747
with some of my initial equity.

63
00:03:02,747 --> 00:03:05,165
So how much lending can I do?

64
00:03:05,165 --> 00:03:06,947
Well, this requirement says that

65
00:03:06,947 --> 00:03:11,114
I can only expand these on demand accounts

66
00:03:11,114 --> 00:03:15,364
so that this is at least 10% of it,

67
00:03:15,364 --> 00:03:20,680
this 300 gold pieces is at least 10% of it, right?

68
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,797
These are my actual reserves.

69
00:03:22,797 --> 00:03:25,597
So let's think of it this way.

70
00:03:25,597 --> 00:03:30,247
10% has to equal my reserves -

71
00:03:30,247 --> 00:03:34,797
- I have 300 gold pieces of reserves:

72
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,197
100 from actual deposits,

73
00:03:36,197 --> 00:03:38,464
200 that I actually put in ahead of time

74
00:03:38,464 --> 00:03:40,614
to start up my bank, that was my own gold -

75
00:03:40,614 --> 00:03:44,497
- over the total amount of -

76
00:03:44,497 --> 00:03:46,648
- I'll just say demand deposits, I won't worry

77
00:03:46,648 --> 00:03:48,114
it's demand deposits plus bank notes,

78
00:03:48,114 --> 00:03:51,847
but we'll keep it simple right now, I think you get the idea -

79
00:03:51,847 --> 00:03:53,797
Deposits.

80
00:03:53,797 --> 00:03:55,415
So we can do a little bit of math.

81
00:03:55,415 --> 00:03:56,631
Let's see. Multiply -

82
00:03:56,631 --> 00:04:01,262
so we get 10% of the demand deposits have to equal 300 -

83
00:04:01,262 --> 00:04:05,229
or divide both sides by 0.1 and then you say, well,

84
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:10,594
I could have up to 3,000 gold pieces of demand deposits.

85
00:04:10,594 --> 00:04:14,179
So how much could I expand my balance sheet?

86
00:04:14,179 --> 00:04:15,811
Well, I could keep making loans

87
00:04:15,811 --> 00:04:18,378
until I have 3,000 gold pieces of demand deposits.

88
00:04:18,378 --> 00:04:22,029
Let me start making loans out.

89
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,947
So someone has a project where, say, 900 gold pieces

90
00:04:25,947 --> 00:04:27,697
they need to build a factory of some kind.

91
00:04:27,697 --> 00:04:31,428
I say, sure, here you go. 900 gold pieces -

92
00:04:31,428 --> 00:04:34,579
- I'll draw it a little bit less high than it should be,

93
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:36,545
then it would be proportional to that.

94
00:04:36,545 --> 00:04:38,862
So 900 loan.

95
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:41,378
And I don't hand that person gold.

96
00:04:41,378 --> 00:04:44,983
I just give them a checking account.

97
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:47,374
So it's a 900 checking account.

98
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:49,326
Of course they're going to use this, maybe to write checks

99
00:04:49,326 --> 00:04:52,441
to their laborers or their contractors,

100
00:04:52,441 --> 00:04:54,509
- whoever needs to build a factory.

101
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:56,463
And so let's see

102
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,941
how much do I have outstanding right now

103
00:04:57,941 --> 00:04:59,459
in terms of demand deposits?

104
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:01,791
I have 900 plus 100.

105
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:02,859
I have 1,000.

106
00:05:02,859 --> 00:05:03,926
So I have 2,000 left.

107
00:05:03,926 --> 00:05:05,775
So let's say someone has a really big project.

108
00:05:05,775 --> 00:05:08,242
They want to build a bridge over the local river or whatever

109
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:09,275
and they'll charge a toll

110
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:10,791
and I think that's a pretty good idea

111
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,875
because people are very likely to use that bridge.

112
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:16,191
So I'll give out a loan to that person.

113
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:21,192
So I'll give out a 2,000-gold-piece loan to that person.

114
00:05:21,192 --> 00:05:24,108
2,000 loan.

115
00:05:24,108 --> 00:05:26,459
And then instead of giving them actual gold,

116
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,843
I'll just create a checking account for them.

117
00:05:27,843 --> 00:05:31,358
I could've actually issued bank notes, same idea.

118
00:05:31,358 --> 00:05:34,691
So 2,000 checking account.

119
00:05:34,691 --> 00:05:37,142
And then I'm done, right?

120
00:05:37,142 --> 00:05:39,593
Because what are my total demand deposits?

121
00:05:39,593 --> 00:05:41,342
2,000 plus 900 plus 100.

122
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:44,041
I have 300 in total demand deposits. And actually

123
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,708
all of my liabilities at this point are demand deposits.

124
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,859
I could have borrowed money in some other way,

125
00:05:48,859 --> 00:05:50,526
but I won't worry about that right now.

126
00:05:50,526 --> 00:05:56,042
So the ratio of my reserves, 300,

127
00:05:57,365 --> 00:06:01,249
to my demand deposits, which is this part right here,

128
00:06:01,249 --> 00:06:03,366
which is essentially all of my liabilities right now,

129
00:06:03,366 --> 00:06:07,132
is 10%. And what this allows -

130
00:06:07,132 --> 00:06:08,516
because of this requirement,

131
00:06:08,516 --> 00:06:10,499
one, it kept me from keep making loans out -

132
00:06:10,499 --> 00:06:12,899
- I've essentially maxed out what I can do

133
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:15,682
under this type of reserve ratio requirement.

134
00:06:15,682 --> 00:06:18,352
And what it says is, it allows 10% -

135
00:06:18,352 --> 00:06:20,836
- essentially it makes sure that I'm liquid enough,

136
00:06:20,836 --> 00:06:22,852
it makes sure that when these people, who I've said,

137
00:06:22,852 --> 00:06:25,669
at any point in time, you can come and ask for your money,

138
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:27,838
and that if people actually do want their money

139
00:06:27,838 --> 00:06:28,744
in terms of gold.

140
00:06:28,744 --> 00:06:30,328
Remember, they can transact with this money.

141
00:06:30,328 --> 00:06:34,112
They can write checks, or if these were bank notes,

142
00:06:34,112 --> 00:06:35,976
they could exchange those bank notes.

143
00:06:35,976 --> 00:06:36,994
But if someone,

144
00:06:36,994 --> 00:06:39,113
whoever has access to this checking account

145
00:06:39,113 --> 00:06:41,246
at some point of time actually wants their gold,

146
00:06:41,246 --> 00:06:43,038
I need to keep at least 10% aside,

147
00:06:43,407 --> 00:06:46,178
assuming that no more than 10% need it at one time.

148
00:06:46,178 --> 00:06:47,674
So that's what these reserve requirements are.

149
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:48,967
It keeps me liquid.

150
00:06:48,967 --> 00:06:51,869
Liquid means when someone actually asks for their gold,

151
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,324
I have the gold to give it to them.

152
00:06:54,324 --> 00:06:57,865
Now a separate question is, am I solvent?

153
00:06:57,865 --> 00:07:00,768
Solvent means, am I good for the money?

154
00:07:00,768 --> 00:07:02,368
And solvent is just an issue of,

155
00:07:02,368 --> 00:07:04,635
are your assets larger than your liabilities?

156
00:07:04,635 --> 00:07:08,907
So right now in this world, my assets are what?

157
00:07:08,907 --> 00:07:13,901
I have 3,000 plus my initial equity.

158
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:16,101
This was 100 down here.

159
00:07:16,101 --> 00:07:20,406
So my assets are 3,300.

160
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,035
So I'm also solvent.

161
00:07:22,035 --> 00:07:23,738
As long as my assets,

162
00:07:23,738 --> 00:07:27,169
which are this entire left-hand side of the balance sheet,

163
00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:30,103
as long as my assets are bigger than my liabilities,

164
00:07:30,103 --> 00:07:30,837
I'm solvent,

165
00:07:30,837 --> 00:07:33,168
which means that even if in a world -

166
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:35,935
- let's say in a world, where for whatever reason,

167
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:38,036
people wanted gold again, they'd come to me

168
00:07:38,036 --> 00:07:41,135
and let's say they wanted 400 gold pieces.

169
00:07:41,135 --> 00:07:43,336
I would not be liquid in that situation

170
00:07:43,336 --> 00:07:46,769
because I do not have 400 gold pieces

171
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:48,102
to immediately give them.

172
00:07:48,102 --> 00:07:49,572
So I would have a liquidity problem.

173
00:07:49,572 --> 00:07:52,270
Maybe I would have to borrow gold from someone else.

174
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,102
But I would be solvent, assuming that

175
00:07:54,102 --> 00:07:57,156
these two loans are still good.

176
00:07:57,156 --> 00:07:59,239
And if someone gave me enough time,

177
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:01,071
either these loans would be paid back,

178
00:08:01,071 --> 00:08:04,068
or maybe I could sell these assets, which these loans are,

179
00:08:04,068 --> 00:08:06,836
to somebody else and get 900 gold pieces for them,

180
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:09,168
in which case I could pay these people

181
00:08:09,168 --> 00:08:10,704
with the gold that they need.

182
00:08:10,704 --> 00:08:12,268
So anyway, I just wanted to show you that difference

183
00:08:12,268 --> 00:08:14,072
between liquidity and solvency.

184
00:08:14,072 --> 00:08:17,534
And actually, I realize that I almost used up all my time.

185
00:08:17,534 --> 00:08:20,368
So in the next video,

186
00:08:20,368 --> 00:08:22,501
I'm going to show you about leverage.

187
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:26,270
And leverage and leverage requirements have a lot more

188
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,536
to do with solvency than liquidity.

189
00:08:29,536 --> 00:08:31,170
And just to give you a little bit of a preview,

190
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,436
it essentially says, how much of a cushion

191
00:08:33,436 --> 00:08:37,136
do you need to have, before you're insolvent -

192
00:08:37,136 --> 00:08:40,937
- before your liabilities are greater than your assets?

193
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,201
So how much loss can you take here

194
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:44,323
before you're out of business?

195
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:46,503
Anyway, I'll see you in the next video.

196
00:08:46,503 --> 00:08:49,835
It ended up being just on reserve ratios, this one.

197
00:08:49,835 --> 00:08:52,000
The next one, I'll do leverage.
