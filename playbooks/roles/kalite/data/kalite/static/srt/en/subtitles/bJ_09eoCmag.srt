1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,460
   

2
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,830
In the last video, we started
to talk about how to

3
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,840
parameterize a torus,
or a doughnut shape.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,670
And the two parameters we were
using, and I spent a lot of

5
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,750
time trying to visualize
it, because this is all

6
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:12,660
about visualization.

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,950
I think this is really the
hard thing to do here.

8
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:19,490
But the way we can parameterize
a torus, which is the surface

9
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,860
of this doughnut, is to say say
hey, let's take a point let's

10
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,790
rotate it around a circle.

11
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:26,580
It could be any circle.

12
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,000
I picked a circle
in the z-y plane.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,670
And how far it's gone around
that circle, we'll parameterize

14
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:37,320
that by s, and s can go between
0 all the way to 2 pi, and then

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,990
we're going to rotate this
circle around itself.

16
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,480
Or I guess a better way to say
it, we're going to rotate the

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,860
circle around the z-axis, and
it's all at the center of the

18
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,290
circle, so we're always going
to keep a distance b away.

19
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,800
And so these were top
views right there.

20
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,590
And then we defined our second
parameter t, which tells us how

21
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,180
far the entire circle has
rotated around the

22
00:00:59,180 --> 00:00:59,920
z-axis access.

23
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,150
And those were our two
parameter definitions.

24
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,780
And then here we tried to
visualize what happens.

25
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,350
This is kind of the domain
that our parameterization

26
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,820
is going to be defined on.

27
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:14,140
s goes between 0 and 2 pi,
so when t is 0, we haven't

28
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,870
rotated out of the z-y plane.

29
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,910
s is at 0, goes all the
way to 2 pi over there.

30
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:26,510
Then when t goes to 2 pi, we've
kind of moved our circle.

31
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,460
We've moved it along,
we've rotated around

32
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,970
the z-axis a bit.

33
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:34,950
And then this line in our s-t
domain corresponds to that

34
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:40,490
circle in 3 dimensions,
or in our x-y-z space.

35
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,650
Now given that, hopefully we
visualize it pretty well.

36
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,540
Let's think about actually how
to define a position

37
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:51,520
vector-valued function that is
essentially this

38
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,140
parameterization.

39
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,360
So let's first to do
the z, because that's

40
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,660
pretty straightforward.

41
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,860
So let's look at this
view right here.

42
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,580
What's our z going to
be as a function?

43
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,240
So our x's, our y's, and
our z's should all be

44
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,690
a function of s and t.

45
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,780
That's what it's all about.

46
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,340
Any position in space should
be a function of picking a

47
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,300
particular t and
a particular s.

48
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,800
And we saw that over here.

49
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,380
This point right here, let
me actually do that with

50
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,820
a couple of points.

51
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,690
This point right there,
that corresponds to that

52
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,790
point, right there.

53
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:26,970
Then we pick another one.

54
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,660
This point right here,
corresponds to this

55
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,100
point, right over there.

56
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,770
I can do a few more.

57
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,180
Let me pick.

58
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,490
This point right here,
so s is still 0.

59
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:44,580
That's going to be this outer
edge, way out over there.

60
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,770
I'll pick one more, just
to define this square.

61
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,350
This point right over here,
where we haven't rotated t at

62
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,800
all, but we've gone a quarter
way around the circle, is

63
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,920
that point right there.

64
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,400
So for any s and t we're
mapping it to a point

65
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,530
in x-y-z space.

66
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,950
So our z's, our x's, and
our y's should all be

67
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,910
a function of s and t.

68
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,690
So the first one to think
about is just the z.

69
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,020
I think this will be
pretty straightforward.

70
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:19,940
So z as a function of s and
t is going to equal what?

71
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:25,080
Well, if you take any circle,
remember s is how the angle

72
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,250
between our radius
and the x-y plane.

73
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,795
So I can even draw
it over here.

74
00:03:29,795 --> 00:03:33,350
Let me do it in another color.

75
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,910
I'm running out of colors.

76
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,550
So let's say that this is
a radius, right there.

77
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,750
That angle, we said, that is s.

78
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:46,110
So if I were to draw that
circle out, just like

79
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,990
that, we can do a little
bit of trigonometry.

80
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,840
   

81
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,970
The angle is s.

82
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,950
We know the radius is
a, the radius of our

83
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,890
circle, we defined that.

84
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:04,760
So z is just going to be the
distance above the x-y plane.

85
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,640
It's going to be this
distance, right there.

86
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,900
And that's straightforward
trigonometry.

87
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,275
That's going to be a, I mean,
we can do SOCATOA and all

88
00:04:12,275 --> 00:04:14,620
of that, you might want
to review the videos.

89
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,320
But the sine, you can
view it this way.

90
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,210
So if this is z right there,
you could say that the sine of

91
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:28,190
s, SOCATOA is the opposite
over the hypotenuse, is

92
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,750
equal to a z over a.

93
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:37,020
Multiply both sides by a, you
have a sine s is equal to z.

94
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,790
That tells us how much above
the x-y plane we are.

95
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,180
Just some simple trigonometry.

96
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,970
So z of s and t, it's only
going to be a function of s.

97
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:52,740
It's going to be a
times the sine of s.

98
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,110
Not too bad.

99
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,420
Now see if we can figure out
what x and y are going to be.

100
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,500
Remember, z doesn't matter.

101
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,250
Doesn't matter how much we've
rotated around the z-axis.

102
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,980
What matters is, how much we've
rotated around the circle.

103
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,820
If s is 0, we're just going
to be in the x-y plane,

104
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,310
z is going to be zero.

105
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,140
If s is pi over 2, up here,
then we're going to be

106
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,190
traveling around the
top of the doughnut.

107
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,805
And we're going to be exactly
a above the x-y plane, or z

108
00:05:19,805 --> 00:05:20,700
is going to be equal to a.

109
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,000
Hopefully that makes
reasonable sense to you.

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,020
Now let's think about what
happens as we rotate around.

111
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,830
Remember, these two
are top views.

112
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:34,210
We are looking down
on this doughnut.

113
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:39,090
So the center of each of these
circles is b away from the

114
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:43,410
origin, or from the z-axis,
what we're rotating around.

115
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,220
It's always b away.

116
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,660
So our x-coordinate, or our x-
and y-coordinate, so if we go

117
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,240
to the center of the circle
here, we're going to be b away,

118
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,050
and this is going to be b
away, right over there.

119
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:00,000
So let's think about where we
are in the x-y plane, or how

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,850
far the part of our, what
we're, I guess you could

121
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:08,280
imagine, if you were to project
our point into the x-y

122
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,150
plane, how far is that going
to be from our origin?

123
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,030
Well, it's always going to
be, remember, let's go

124
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,050
back to this drawing here.

125
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,720
This might be the
most instructive.

126
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,440
This is just one particular
circle on the z-y plane, but

127
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,910
it could be any of them.

128
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:30,390
If this is the z-axis, over
here, this distance right here

129
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,230
is always going to be b.

130
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,780
We know that for sure.

131
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,295
And so what is this
distance going to be?

132
00:06:37,295 --> 00:06:43,200
   

133
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,110
We're at b to the center, and
then we're going to have some

134
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:49,900
angle s, and so depending on
that angle s, this distance

135
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,650
onto, I guess, the x-y plane,
you know, if we're sitting on

136
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:56,310
the x-y plane, how far are
we from the z-axis, or the

137
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,870
projection onto the x-y plane.

138
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:02,300
Or you can, you know, the
x or the y position.

139
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,850
I'm saying it as many
ways as possible.

140
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,490
I think you're visualizing it.

141
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,260
If z is a sine of theta, this
distance right here, this

142
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,770
little shorter distance right
here, that's going to

143
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,300
be a cosine if s.

144
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,240
   

145
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,640
s is that angle right there.

146
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,000
This distance right here is
going to be a cosine of s.

147
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,670
So if we talk about just
straight distance from the

148
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:32,910
origin, along the x-y plane,
our distance is always going

149
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:41,660
to be b plus a cosine of s.

150
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,860
When s is out here, then it's
actually going to become a

151
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,910
negative number, and that makes
sense, because our distance

152
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,020
is going to be less than b.

153
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,730
We're going to be at
that point right there.

154
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:55,180
So if you look at this top
views over here, no matter

155
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,510
where we are, that is b.

156
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,420
And let's say we've
rotated a little bit.

157
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:03,090
That distance right here, if
you're looking along the x-y

158
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:10,570
plane, that is always going
to be b plus a cosine of s.

159
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:14,370
That's what that distance
is to any given point.

160
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,760
We're depending on
our s's and t's.

161
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:21,910
Now, as we rotate around, if
we're at a point here, let's

162
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:25,980
say we're at a point there, and
that point, we already said, is

163
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:32,890
b plus a cosine of s, away from
the origin, on the xy plane.

164
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,670
What are the x and y
coordinates of that?

165
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:36,240
Well, remember.

166
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,430
This is a top-down.

167
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,115
We're sitting on the z-axis
looking straight down

168
00:08:40,115 --> 00:08:41,470
the x-y plane right now.

169
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,460
We're looking down
on the doughnut.

170
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,330
So what are our x's
and y's going to be?

171
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,690
Well, you draw another
right triangle right here.

172
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,880
You have another
right triangle.

173
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,400
This angle right here is t.

174
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,520
This distance right here
is going to be this times

175
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,180
the sine of our angle.

176
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:03,000
So this right here, which is
essentially our x, this is

177
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:11,410
going to be our x-coordinate, x
as a function of s and t, os

178
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:18,480
going to be equal to the sine
of t, t is our angle right

179
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,850
there, times this radius.

180
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,550
Times, we could write
it either way, times

181
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:28,195
b plus a cosine of s.

182
00:09:28,195 --> 00:09:30,910
Because remember, how far we
are depends on how much around

183
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:31,900
the circle we are, right?

184
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,340
When we're over here,
we're much further away.

185
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,980
Here we're exactly b away,
if you're looking only

186
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,580
on the x-y plane.

187
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,670
And then over here, we're
b minus a away, if

188
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,900
we're on the x-y plane.

189
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:48,790
So that's x as a
function of s and t.

190
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:54,790
And actually, the way I defined
it right here, our positive

191
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,750
x-axis would actually
go in this direction.

192
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:02,570
So this is x positive, this is
x in the negative direction.

193
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,710
I could've flipped the signs,
but hopefully, you know, this

194
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,350
actually make sense that that
would be the positive x,

195
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,370
this is the negative x.

196
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,530
Depends on whether using a
right-handed or left-handed

197
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,740
coordinate system, but
hopefully that makes sense.

198
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,770
We're just saying, OK, what is
this distance right here that

199
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:18,930
is b plus a cosine of s?

200
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:23,080
We got that from this right
here, when we're taking a view,

201
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,130
just a cut of the torus.

202
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:30,420
That's how far we are, in kind
of the x-y direction at any

203
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,330
point, or kind of radially
out, without thinking

204
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,420
about the height.

205
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,920
And then if you want the
x-coordinate, you multiply it

206
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:43,170
times the sine of t, the way
I've had it up here, and the

207
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:47,140
y-coordinate is going to be
this, right here, the way

208
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,500
we've set up this triangle.

209
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,780
So y as a function of s and t
is going to be equal to the

210
00:10:53,780 --> 00:11:01,260
cosine of t times this radius.

211
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:06,270
b plus a cosine of s.

212
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,030
And so our parameterization,
and you know, just play with

213
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,170
this triangle, and hopefully
it'll make sense.

214
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,500
I mean, if you say that this is
our y-coordinate right here,

215
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:20,530
you just do SOCATOA, cosine of
t, CA is equal to adjacent,

216
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:23,560
which is y, right, this is
the angle right here,

217
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,000
over the hypotenuse.

218
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,850
Over b plus a cosine of s.

219
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,770
Multiply both sides of the
equation times this, and you

220
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:36,680
get y of s of t is equal to
cosine of t times this

221
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,790
thing, right there.

222
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,010
Let me copy and paste
all of our takeaways.

223
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:46,960
   

224
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,165
And we're done with
our parameterization.

225
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:51,830
   

226
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:56,040
We could leave it just like
this, but if we want to

227
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,550
represent it as a position
vector-valued function, we

228
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,590
can define it like this.

229
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:04,950
Find a nice color, maybe pink.

230
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:10,010
So let's say our position
vector-valued function is r.

231
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:15,580
It's going to be a function of
two parameters, s and t, and

232
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,530
it's going to be equal
to its x-value.

233
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,010
Let me do that in
the same color.

234
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,070
So it's going to be, I'll
do this part first.

235
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:31,970
b plus a cosine of s times sine
of t, and that's going to go in

236
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,510
the x-direction, so we'll
say that's times i.

237
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:38,390
And this case, remember,
the way I defined it,

238
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,450
the positive x-direction
is going to be here.

239
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:43,420
So the i-unit vector
will look like that.

240
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,780
i will go in that direction,
the way I've defined things.

241
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:56,710
And then plus our y-value is
going to be b plus a cosine of

242
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:04,590
s times cosine of t in the
y-unit vector direction.

243
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:08,520
Remember, the j-unit vector
will just go just like that.

244
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,460
That's our j-unit vector.

245
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,670
And then, finally, we'll throw
in the z, which was actually

246
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,330
the most straightforward.

247
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:22,800
plus a sine of s times the
k-unit vector, which is the

248
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,330
unit vector in the z-direction.

249
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,950
So times the k-unit vector.

250
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:34,000
And so you give me, now, any s
and t within this domain right

251
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,530
here, and you put it into this
position vector-valued

252
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,240
function, it'll give you the
exact position vector that

253
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,260
specifies the appropriate
point on the torus.

254
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,520
So if you pick, let's just
make sure we understand

255
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,620
what we're doing.

256
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,860
If you pick that point right
there, where s and t are both

257
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,430
equal to pi over 2, and you
might even want to go

258
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,730
through the exercise.

259
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,870
Take pi over 2 in all of these.

260
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,860
Actually, let's do it.

261
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:10,820
So in that case, so when r of
pi over 2, what do we get?

262
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:15,730
It's going to be b plus a
times cosine of pi over 2.

263
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,060
Cosine of pi over
2 is 0, right?

264
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,900
Cosine of 90 degrees.

265
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,940
So it's going to be b, right,
this whole thing is going to be

266
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,920
0, times sine of pi over 2.

267
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,030
Sine of pi over 2 is just 1.

268
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:34,650
So it's going to be b times i
plus, once again, cosine of pi

269
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:40,730
over 2 is 0, so this term right
here is going to be b, and then

270
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:46,650
cosine of pi over 2 is 0,
so it's going to be 0 j.

271
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:51,110
So it's going to be plus 0 j.

272
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:54,970
And then finally, pi over 2,
well, there's no t here,

273
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,520
sine of pi over 2 is 1.

274
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,120
So plus a times k.

275
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,150
   

276
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,230
So there's actually
no j-direction.

277
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:10,950
So this is going to be equal
to b times i plus a times k.

278
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,550
So the point that it specifies,
according to this

279
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:16,010
parameterization, or the vector
[UNINTELLIGIBLE], is b times

280
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,920
i plus a times k.

281
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:24,840
So b times i will get us right
out there, and then a times k

282
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,530
ill get us right over there.

283
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:29,080
So the position of the
vector being specified

284
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,470
is right over there.

285
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,170
Just as we predicted.

286
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,110
That dot, that point right
there, corresponds to that

287
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,570
point, just like that.

288
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,080
Of course, I picked points it
was easy to calculate, but this

289
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,260
whole, when you take every s
and t in this domain right

290
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:48,180
here, you're going to
transform it to this surface.

291
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,930
And this is the
transformation, right here.

292
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:56,090
And of course, we have to
specify that s is between, we

293
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,210
could write it multiple ways.

294
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:04,290
s is between 2 pi and 0,
and we could also say t

295
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,760
is between 2 pi and 0.

296
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,480
And you could, you know, we're
kind of overlapping one extra

297
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,860
time at 2 pi, so maybe we can
get rid of one of these equal

298
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,380
signs if you like, although
that won't necessarily change

299
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,710
the area any, if you're
taking the surface area.

300
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,370
But hopefully this gives you at
least a gut sense, or more than

301
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,770
a gut sense, of how to
parameterize these things, and

302
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,850
what we're even doing, because
it's going to be really

303
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,690
important when we start talking
about surface integrals.

304
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,740
And the hardest thing about
