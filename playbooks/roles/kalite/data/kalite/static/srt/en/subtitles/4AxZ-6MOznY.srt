1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,089
What I want to do in this video is really make some clarification

2
00:00:03,089 --> 00:00:08,449
that goes a litle bit more in detail about the different layers of the Earth.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,833
So let me draw a cross-section of the Earth over here.

4
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:15,756
I won't be able to do it perfectly to the scale,

5
00:00:15,756 --> 00:00:17,752
but I will try to do a little bit better job

6
00:00:17,752 --> 00:00:21,851
and giving you a little bit of the sense of how thick these layers are.

7
00:00:21,851 --> 00:00:24,009
So let's say that this is the crust appear

8
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:28,019
and I'm going to make the continental crust a little bit thicker,

9
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,529
so let's say that that is continental crust and this is continental crust.

10
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:36,016
And that in between, let me put some oceanic crust which is going to be thinner.

11
00:00:36,016 --> 00:00:42,604
So this right here is ... actually let me do the oceanic crust in blue,

12
00:00:42,604 --> 00:00:44,470
but this is not water, this is rock.

13
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:48,137
I will do that in purple, that is even better. I don't want it to be that thick.

14
00:00:48,137 --> 00:00:52,340
So the oceanic crust is thinner than the continental crust

15
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,500
which I'm trying to depict right over here,

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:59,940
so this right over here is oceanic crust

17
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:10,603
and up here is continental crust.

18
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:15,966
And the thickness or how deep you can go and still be in crust, it depends on where you are,

19
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:20,874
or we know that near hot-spots the oceanic crust can actually thin out a good bit,

20
00:01:20,874 --> 00:01:25,740
but roughly, when we talk abou the crust, we are talking about something that is

21
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,804
30-60 km deep.

22
00:01:31,804 --> 00:01:34,883
So if you are on a continent, which I am assuming you are,

23
00:01:34,883 --> 00:01:37,739
and you dig for 20 km, you will still be in the crust,

24
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:39,639
30 km - probably still in the crust.

25
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:47,299
If you dig for 70 km or 100 km, you will probably reach the mantle.

26
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:50,807
Remember, what we are describing here, we talk abou the crust, the mantle and the core,

27
00:01:50,807 --> 00:01:57,490
we are talking abou the chemical make-up, let me make this clear, the chemical make-up.

28
00:01:57,597 --> 00:02:00,805
The crust is fundametally different than the mantle

29
00:02:00,805 --> 00:02:05,936
based on the molecules that it is made up of. Based on its composition.

30
00:02:05,936 --> 00:02:07,739
So let's talk about the mantle now.

31
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:11,407
So the mantle layer is like this.

32
00:02:11,407 --> 00:02:12,740
And once again, this is not the scale,

33
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,408
because the crust, we are talking about 30-60 km,

34
00:02:15,408 --> 00:02:22,792
the mantle, we are talking about 2900 to 3000 km thick.

35
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:26,545
So this right here is the entire mantle.

36
00:02:26,545 --> 00:02:34,711
And this is 2900 to 3000 km thick.

37
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:37,793
So this isn't even one thirtieth ot that.

38
00:02:37,793 --> 00:02:40,867
So I would have to draw even narrower than the way I have drawn over here.

39
00:02:40,867 --> 00:02:46,137
And the mantle itself can be subdivided into the upper mantle and the lower mantle.

40
00:02:46,137 --> 00:02:50,269
So let me draw this division right over here.

41
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:54,538
The upper mantle - there is different ways to define the boundary.

42
00:02:54,538 --> 00:02:58,647
But the upper mantle is roughly about 700 km down.

43
00:02:58,647 --> 00:03:01,493
So these are huge distances. I mean this it going straight down.

44
00:03:01,493 --> 00:03:05,989
So this is the upper mantle.

45
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:08,846
Let me write on the actual mantle here.

46
00:03:08,846 --> 00:03:14,670
This is the upper mantle and this over here is the lower mantle.

47
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,011
And just to be clear on things:

48
00:03:16,011 --> 00:03:18,979
So the crust is solid.

49
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:23,203
Now when you go into the upper mantle, the upper part of the upper mantle

50
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,407
we will talk abou that a little bit more, is cool enough to be solid.

51
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:32,645
So there is a solid portion of the upper mantle.

52
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:41,142
So all of this appear is solid because it's cool enough, it hasn't reached the melting point of those rocks.

53
00:03:41,142 --> 00:03:49,741
And we have leart in previous videos that the combination of solid part of the upper mantle and the crust combined

54
00:03:49,741 --> 00:03:51,744
the we call that the lithosphere.

55
00:03:51,744 --> 00:03:54,038
And when we talk about the lithosphere we are now talking about the mechanical make-up.

56
00:03:54,038 --> 00:03:56,806
We are now talking about what is solid and what is not solid.

57
00:03:56,806 --> 00:04:00,643
So this is the lithosphere.

58
00:04:00,643 --> 00:04:03,869
You go a little bit deeper, right below the lithosphere,

59
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:07,473
now the temperatures are high enough for ...

60
00:04:07,473 --> 00:04:09,808
and I used the word 'liquid' but that is not exactly right.

61
00:04:09,808 --> 00:04:14,558
You kind of think it is a kind of a deformable solid or plastic solid or magma.

62
00:04:14,558 --> 00:04:19,010
And that is the asthenosphere. So this area right over here,

63
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:25,603
the liquid part; actually I shouldn't use the word 'liquid'.

64
00:04:25,603 --> 00:04:29,069
It is kind of deformable. It deformes over long perionds of time.

65
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:33,608
But it is more fluid than what we normally associate with rock.

66
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:36,003
Magma would be a good way to think about it.

67
00:04:36,003 --> 00:04:38,225
That is what we call the asthenosphere.

68
00:04:38,225 --> 00:04:43,002
It is fluid. Just not as fluid as water, it is more viscous than something like water.

69
00:04:43,002 --> 00:04:47,162
So this is the asthenosphere.

70
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:53,534
Now, the upper mantle is hard enough for the rock to melt and be fluid,

71
00:04:53,534 --> 00:05:03,673
but the pressure is low enough for to still be able to kind of move past each.. to be somewhat fluid.

72
00:05:03,673 --> 00:05:12,481
But once you get even deeper, into the lower mantle, you have higher pressure.

73
00:05:12,481 --> 00:05:19,402
And so it's still fluid but it's less fluid, it's kind of thicker.

74
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:23,801
I guess it's the best way to think about it, the lower mantle. It's thicker.

75
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:28,715
So this whole area over here, you can kind of think of it's molten rock, it's fluid,

76
00:05:28,715 --> 00:05:35,467
but the upper part of the molten rock is more fluid, able to move easier because there is less pressure

77
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:38,070
and the pressure is just from all of the rock that is above it,

78
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,885
remember, gravity is pulling down on everything.

79
00:05:39,885 --> 00:05:44,563
Every molecule here wants to go down because of gravity.

80
00:05:44,563 --> 00:05:49,407
So it is applying pressure donw, so the deeper you go, the more pressure you get.

81
00:05:49,407 --> 00:05:53,404
Now, when we get even deeper than that, we get to the core,

82
00:05:53,404 --> 00:05:58,209
and the core is divided between the outer core and the inner core.

83
00:05:58,209 --> 00:06:03,601
So the outer core,

84
00:06:03,601 --> 00:06:10,014
and then, of course, you have the inner core.

85
00:06:10,014 --> 00:06:12,213
And just so we have a sense for distances,

86
00:06:12,213 --> 00:06:18,806
the width or the thickness of the outer core is approximately 2300 km.

87
00:06:18,806 --> 00:06:20,604
So these are huge distances when you think about thickness.

88
00:06:20,604 --> 00:06:23,692
You can go donw another 2300 km and you are in the...

89
00:06:23,692 --> 00:06:26,870
or once you go to the mantle, you can go 2300 km to the outer core,

90
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,875
and then you are in the inner core, and that essentially takes you the rest.

91
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,134
That is essentially the centre of the Earth. The inner core.

92
00:06:32,134 --> 00:06:37,137
Maybe I should draw the boundaries a little bit more to scale.

93
00:06:37,137 --> 00:06:45,031
It should actually look a little bit more ... like this,

94
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:47,346
because the outer core is thicker than the inner.

95
00:06:47,346 --> 00:06:51,670
So the outer core is, as I said, let me rewrite it.

96
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:56,685
Outer core is on the order, it is about 2300 km thick.

97
00:06:56,685 --> 00:07:01,733
And then you have the inner core.

98
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:04,143
I should do it in a hot colour.

99
00:07:04,143 --> 00:07:07,687
So the inner core right over here, it just kind of takes us in the centre of the Earth,

100
00:07:07,687 --> 00:07:11,607
and that is a little over 1000 km thick.

101
00:07:11,607 --> 00:07:14,537
So this is the inner core.

102
00:07:14,537 --> 00:07:18,401
The number I have is about 1200 km thick.

103
00:07:18,401 --> 00:07:24,272
And the entire core, both the outer core and the inner core, is mainly nickel and iron.

104
00:07:24,272 --> 00:07:26,076
When you think about when the Earth was forming,

105
00:07:26,076 --> 00:07:29,271
what happened is when this whole Earth was super-hot, it was in a kind of a fluid state

106
00:07:29,271 --> 00:07:34,870
the heavier elements were allowed to sink down when everything was fluid,

107
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:39,356
the things that were in between, the things that were lighter would go up,

108
00:07:39,356 --> 00:07:41,609
and then the gases, thing that would naturally be in gaseous state,

109
00:07:41,609 --> 00:07:45,206
would kind of bubble up through that fluid,

110
00:07:45,206 --> 00:07:50,013
kind of the way actually carbon bubbles up in a soda,

111
00:07:50,013 --> 00:07:54,271
they would eventually bubble up the fluid and would actually form the atmosphere.

112
00:07:54,271 --> 00:07:56,684
So that is why when you look at the composition of the Earth,

113
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,871
you have the densiest, the heaviest elements in the centre

114
00:07:58,871 --> 00:08:02,135
and then the lightest elements are forming the atmosphere.

115
00:08:02,135 --> 00:08:10,939
The outer core and the inner core, they are made up fundamentally of nickel and iron.

116
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:12,938
And their make-up is actually very similar.

117
00:08:12,938 --> 00:08:17,650
These divisions, chemically they have very similar composition.

118
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:20,606
What is different about them is at the outer core

119
00:08:20,606 --> 00:08:24,325
you have temperatures high enough that nickel and iron can melt,

120
00:08:24,325 --> 00:08:28,861
but the pressures are low enough that they can still be in a fluid state.

121
00:08:28,861 --> 00:08:33,304
So this our liquid outer core.

122
00:08:34,657 --> 00:08:37,934
And this has a pretty low viscosity, especially in relativ to the mantle,

123
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,943
so that is why people kind of consider this in a more traditionally liquid state.

124
00:08:41,943 --> 00:08:48,135
But as you get deeper and deeper and deeper, the pressure becomes so huge as you get to the inner core,

125
00:08:48,135 --> 00:08:51,671
remember all of the weight of all of the rock above you,

126
00:08:51,671 --> 00:08:56,405
of these thousands of miles of rock above you, is all pushing down on the rock below it.

127
00:08:56,405 --> 00:08:59,799
So the inner core even that the temperature is really really hot,

128
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:04,233
the pressure is so big that them molecules cannot flow past each other,

129
00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:07,401
they cannot be liquid, they are kind of jam-packed.

130
00:09:07,401 --> 00:09:13,963
So the inner core because of the high pressure, despite the high temperature, is solid.

131
00:09:13,963 --> 00:09:18,600
So the difference here is actually a mechanical one - between the outer core and the inner core.

132
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,156
They are made up of the same things, roughly the same chemical make-up,

133
00:09:21,156 --> 00:09:26,734
there is just lower pressure on the outside so you can actually be in a fluid state.

134
00:09:26,734 --> 99:59:59,999
So hopefully that clarifies and gives you a little bit the depth on the make-up of the Earth.
