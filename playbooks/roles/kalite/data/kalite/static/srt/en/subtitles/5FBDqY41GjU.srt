1
00:00:00,888 --> 00:00:02,748
We've got a scale here, and as you see,

2
00:00:02,748 --> 00:00:04,975
the scale is balanced.

3
00:00:04,975 --> 00:00:07,681
And we have a question to answer.

4
00:00:07,681 --> 00:00:10,176
We have this mystery mass over here.

5
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:13,414
It's a big question mark on this blue mass.

6
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:18,954
And we also have a bunch of 1 kilogram masses.

7
00:00:18,954 --> 00:00:21,879
These are all each a 1kg mass.

8
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:23,622
And my question to you is:

9
00:00:23,622 --> 00:00:26,948
What could we do to either side of this scale

10
00:00:26,948 --> 00:00:28,740
in order to figure out

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,027
what the mystery mass is?

12
00:00:30,027 --> 00:00:31,561
Or maybe we can't figure it out at all?

13
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:33,200
Is there something that we can do

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,569
either removing or adding these things,

15
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:36,827
so that we can figure out

16
00:00:36,827 --> 00:00:38,541
what this mystery mass is?

17
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,499
I will give you a couple of seconds to think about it.

18
00:00:45,069 --> 00:00:47,433
To figure out what this mystery mass is,

19
00:00:47,433 --> 00:00:51,550
we essentially just want this on one side of this scale

20
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,033
But that by itself is not enough.

21
00:00:53,033 --> 00:00:54,500
We could just remove these three,

22
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,823
but that won't do the job, because

23
00:00:55,823 --> 00:00:57,633
if we just remove these three,

24
00:00:57,633 --> 00:00:59,433
then the left side of this scale

25
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:01,535
is clearly going to have less mass,

26
00:01:01,535 --> 00:01:04,633
and it will go up, and the right side will go down.

27
00:01:04,633 --> 00:01:06,225
And that will not give us much information.

28
00:01:06,225 --> 00:01:08,433
It would just tell us that this blue thing

29
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:11,967
has a lower mass than what is over here.

30
00:01:11,967 --> 00:01:14,232
So just removing this will not help us much.

31
00:01:14,232 --> 00:01:17,166
I won't let us know that this is equal to that.

32
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:19,699
What we have to do if we want to keep the scale balanced,

33
00:01:19,699 --> 00:01:22,232
is that we have to remove the same amount of mass

34
00:01:22,232 --> 00:01:24,699
from both sides of the scale.

35
00:01:24,699 --> 00:01:27,499
So, if we want to remove 3 things here,

36
00:01:27,499 --> 00:01:33,020
(let me try my best to remove 3 things here)

37
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,085
(I will just erase it)

38
00:01:36,085 --> 00:01:38,632
If we want to remove 3 things there,

39
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:40,499
If we did this by itself,

40
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:42,354
just removed these 3 things,

41
00:01:42,354 --> 00:01:44,565
the two sides would not have an equal mass anymore.

42
00:01:44,565 --> 00:01:46,510
this side would have a lower mass.

43
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,343
So we have to remove 3 from both sides.

44
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:51,665
If we want to make sure our scale is balanced,

45
00:01:51,665 --> 00:01:54,497
we have to remove 3 from both sides.

46
00:01:54,497 --> 00:01:57,431
If we started off with the scales balanced,

47
00:01:57,431 --> 00:01:59,838
and then we removed 3 from both sides,

48
00:01:59,838 --> 00:02:01,742
the scale will still be balanced

49
00:02:01,742 --> 00:02:03,832
and then we would have a clear idea

50
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,154
of what the mass of this object actually is.

51
00:02:06,154 --> 00:02:08,151
Now, with 3 removed from both sides,

52
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:10,612
the scale will still be balanced,

53
00:02:10,612 --> 00:02:12,238
and we know that this mass

54
00:02:12,238 --> 00:02:13,956
is equal to whatever is left over here.

55
00:02:13,956 --> 00:02:18,031
It is equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

56
00:02:18,031 --> 00:02:20,318
- and if we're assuming they are kilograms -

57
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:22,965
we'll know that the question mark mass

58
00:02:22,965 --> 00:02:25,798
question mark is equal to 7 kilograms.

59
00:02:25,798 --> 00:02:30,535
So this is a seven kilogram mass.
