1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So what are looking at here?

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is a Jackson Pollock,

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in The Museum of Modern Art, number 1A, 1948

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and it's one of his signature drip paintings

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's called 1A, is it his first?

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It seems like it is based on how it was named.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Pollock was a little bit tricky with his naming conventions,

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
especially when he moved to numbering

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so he's not all that consistent..

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Yeah..he didn't necessarily start with 1

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then sort of move up to 2,

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in fact, I think he added the A at a later date.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
He didn't want to confuse it with another painting that was called 1.

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Haha, I see, we do that ourselves

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with Khan Academy videos, we change the naming..

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You know, when you look at this

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I've actually seen some of,

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I don't know if I saw this exact piece,

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they sometimes blend together a little bit,

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but I've seen some of his paintings in real life

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and, you know when you look at it, from afar,

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they do look like, kind of just a mess, a craziness,

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but up close, they just seem to be..you know I couldn't just

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
paint this exactly the way he did it, it seems like there is some technicality to it,

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but it does, I guess a more general question of, I mean, it just looks like a random..

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
..mess or he just looks like he's throwing up paint there

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I think for a lot of people, they feel,

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
"So what's the big deal here?", you know I feel like a lot of people could have done something like this.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You know, I think Pollock actually would have liked the idea

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that we looked at it and saw a bit of a mess,

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in fact, one of the issues that he was interested in, I think,

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
certainly the abstract expressionists were interested in, is this idea that

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
somehow the internal self was being brought out and that might be, in fact, a mess.

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You know, in a lot of our conversations, we've been talking about the importance of context,

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
not just looking at that piece by itself.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
To get some context, and this was done in 1948, was there other stuff like this

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that was done before or was he really the first to put up stuff like this?

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
He was really the first, in fact, one of his from patriots of another abstract expresions said: "Jackson really broke the ice."

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This was the first painting. Not that was absolutely abstract

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but there was what we called action painting

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's a kind of almost performative action in arena of the
