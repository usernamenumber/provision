1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,170
In this video we're going to
cover what is arguably, the

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:10,040
single most important concept
in all the statistics.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,570
Well if you go into almost any
scientific field you might even

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,760
argue that it's the single
most important concept.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,000
I've actually told people that
it's kind of sad they don't

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,560
cover this in the
core curriculum.

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,900
Everyone should know about is
because it touches on every

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,590
single aspect of our lives and
that's the normal distribution

9
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,000
or the Gaussian distribution
or the bell curve.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,270
And just to kind of give you a
preview of what it is, my

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,970
preview will actually make it
seem pretty strange but as we

12
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:41,880
go through this video hopefully
you'll get a little bit more

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,040
intuition of what
it's all about.

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,740
The Gaussian distribution or
the normal distribution,

15
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,250
they're two words
for the same thing.

16
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,930
It was actually Gauss
who came up with it.

17
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:56,200
I think he was studying
astronomical phenomenon

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,190
when he did.

19
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,740
But it's a probability density
function just like we studies

20
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,990
the Poisson distribution.

21
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,080
It's just like that.

22
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,370
And just to give you the
preview it looks like this.

23
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,760
The probability of getting
any x, and it's a

24
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,150
class of probability
distribution functions.

25
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,520
Just like the binomial
distribution is and the Poisson

26
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,740
distribution, it's based on
a bunch of parameters.

27
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,930
This is how you would
traditionally see it written in

28
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,340
a lot of textbooks and if we
have time, I'd like to

29
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,580
rearrange the algebra just to
get a little bit more intuition

30
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,540
of how it all works out.

31
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,140
Or maybe we could get
some insights on where

32
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,140
it all came from.

33
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,070
I'm not going to prove it in
this video, that's a little

34
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:32,860
bit beyond our scope.

35
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,130
Although, I do want to do it
and there's actually some

36
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,570
really neat mathematics
that might show up.

37
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,610
If you're a math lead there's
something called Sterling's

38
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,650
formula what you might want
to do a Wikipedia search on,

39
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:43,770
which is really fascinating.

40
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,940
It approximates factorials
with essentially a

41
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,890
continuous function.

42
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,100
But I won't go into
that right now.

43
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,890
The normal distribution is 1
over -- this is how it's

44
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,890
normally written -- the
standard deviation times the

45
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:08,230
square root of 2 pi times
e to the minus 1/2.

46
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:11,860
Well, I like to write it this
way, it easier to remember,

47
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:17,470
times whatever value you're
trying to get minus the mean of

48
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,210
our distribution divided by the
standard deviation of our

49
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,950
distribution squared.

50
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,840
And so if you think about it,
actually this is a good thing

51
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,280
to just notice right now.

52
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,970
This is how far I'm from the
mean and we're dividing that

53
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,220
by the standard deviation of
whatever our distribution is.

54
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,480
This is a preview of actually a
normal distribution that I've

55
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,500
plotted, the purple line here
is a normal distribution.

56
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,830
Initially the whole exercise --
I know I jump around a little

57
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,440
bit -- is to show you that the
normal distribution is a good

58
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,110
approximation for the binomial
distribution and vice versa.

59
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,420
If you take enough trials in
your binomal distribution and

60
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,970
we'll touch on that a second.

61
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,680
The intuition of this term
right here I think is

62
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,530
interesting because we're
saying, how far are we away

63
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,310
from the mean, we're dividing
by the standard deviation.

64
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,700
So this whole term right here
is how many standard deviations

65
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,560
we are away from the mean.

66
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,130
This is actually called
the standard z score.

67
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,570
One thing I found in statistics
is there's a lot of words a lot

68
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,970
of definitions and they all
sound very fancy, the

69
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,780
standard z score.

70
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:25,340
But the underlying concept
is pretty straightforward.

71
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,545
Let's say I had a probability
distribution and I get some x

72
00:03:29,545 --> 00:03:32,380
value that's out here and it's
3 and a half the standard

73
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,200
deviations is away from the
mean, then it's standard

74
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,490
z score is 3 and a half.

75
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:39,220
Anyway let's focus on the
purpose of this video.

76
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,890
So that's what the normal
distribution, I guess

77
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,930
the probability density
function for the normal

78
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,350
distribution looks like.

79
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,370
But how did it get there?

80
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,100
By the end of this video you
should at least feel

81
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,770
comfortable that this is a good
approximation for the binomial

82
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:58,020
distribution if you're
taking enough trials.

83
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,760
And that's what's fascinating
about the normal distribution

84
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,940
is that if you have the sum --
and I'll do a whole other video

85
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,990
on the central limit theorem --
but if you have the sum of many

86
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:12,110
independent trials approaching
infinity, that the distribution

87
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,370
of those, even though the
distribution of each of those

88
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,500
trials might have been
non-normal but the distribution

89
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,860
of the sum of all those trials
approaches the normal

90
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,490
distribution.

91
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,890
I'll talk more
about that later.

92
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:27,260
But that's why it's such a good
distribution to kind of assume

93
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,750
for a lot of underlying
phenomenon.

94
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,490
If you're kind of modeling
weather patterns or drug

95
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,790
interactions and you we'll talk
about where it might work well

96
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,480
and where it might
not work so well.

97
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,270
Like sometimes people might
assume things like a normal

98
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,190
distribution in finance and
we've see the financial crisis

99
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,120
that's led to a lot of
things blowing up but.

100
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,860
Anyway, let's go back to this.

101
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,080
This is a spreadsheet
right here.

102
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,640
I just made a black background
and you can downloaded it at

103
00:04:51,640 --> 00:05:01,810
khanacademy.org/downloads
Actually, if you just do that

104
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,380
you'll see all of
the downloads.

105
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,050
I haven't put it there yet, I'm
going to do it right after I

106
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,230
record the videos
downloads/normal

107
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,470
distribution.xls.

108
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,640
If you just go up to
khanacademy.org/download/

109
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,100
you'll see all the things
there and you'll see

110
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:23,880
this spreadsheet.

111
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,950
I encourage you to play with it
and maybe do other spreadsheets

112
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,660
were you experiment with it.

113
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,610
So this spreadsheet what we do
is we're doing a game or let's

114
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,540
say I'm sitting I'm on a street
and I flip a coin, I flip

115
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,240
a completely fair coin.

116
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:44,560
If I get heads, this is heads,
I take a step backwards or

117
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,970
let's say a step to the left.

118
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:50,990
And if I get a tails I
take a step to the right.

119
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,940
So in general I always have a
-- this is a completely fair

120
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,280
coin -- I have a 50 percent
chance of taking a step to the

121
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,520
left and I have a 50 percent
chance of taking a

122
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,630
step to the right.

123
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:03,000
So your intuition there is if
I told you I took a you a

124
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,630
thousand flips of the coin
you're going to keep

125
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,540
going left and right.

126
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,360
If by chance you get a bunch
of heads, you might end up

127
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,100
really kind of moving
over to the left.

128
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,280
If you get a bunch of tails you
might move over to the right.

129
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,740
And we learned already the odds
of getting a bunch of tales or

130
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,670
many more tails than heads is a
lot lower than things kind of

131
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:28,690
being equal or close to equal.

132
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:36,590
Right here what I've done --
let me scroll down a little

133
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:48,980
bit, I don't want to lose the
whole thing -- is I have this

134
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,950
little assumption here and I
encourage you to fill that out

135
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,320
and change it as you like.

136
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,290
This is the number
of steps I take.

137
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,980
This is the mean number of left
steps and all I did is I got

138
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,260
the probability and we
figured out the mean of the

139
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,510
binomial distribution.

140
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:06,510
The mean of the binomial
distribution is essentially the

141
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,400
probability of taking a left
step times the total

142
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,140
number of trials.

143
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,830
So that's equal to 5, that's
where that number comes from.

144
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:17,150
And then the variance -- and
I'm not sure if I went over

145
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,160
this and I need prove this to
you if I have and I'll make a

146
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,500
whole other video on the
variance of the binomial

147
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,300
distribution -- is essentially
equal to the number of trials,

148
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,630
10 times the probability of
taking the left step or kind of

149
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:36,150
a successful trial -- I'm
defining left as a successful

150
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:40,640
trial, that could be right as
well -- times the probability

151
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,490
of 1 minus the successful trial
or non successful trial.

152
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,370
In this case they're equally
probable and that's where

153
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,550
I got the 2.5 from.

154
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,510
And that's all on
the spreadsheet.

155
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,380
If you actually click on
the cell and look at the

156
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,400
actual formula I did that.

157
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,880
Although sometimes when you
see it in Excel it's a

158
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,640
little bit confusing.

159
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,360
And this is just the square
root of that number.

160
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,120
The standard deviation
is just the square

161
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,540
root of the variance.

162
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,460
That's just the
square root of 2.5.

163
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,630
And so if you look here
this says, OK what is

164
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,510
the probability that
I take 0 steps?

165
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:14,170
So I take a total of 10 steps
-- just to understand this

166
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:17,970
spreadsheet -- what is the
probability that I

167
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,360
take 0 left steps?

168
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,020
And just to make clear, if I
take 0 left steps that means I

169
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,110
must have taken 10 right steps.

170
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,440
And I calculate this
probability -- I should have

171
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,650
drawn maybe a line here -- I
calculate this using the

172
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,920
binomial distribution.

173
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,860
And how do I do that?

174
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:44,810
Let me actually switch
colors just to make

175
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,500
things interesting.

176
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,170
Do they have a purple here?

177
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,230
I'll do a blue.

178
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,700
So blue for binomial.

179
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,600
So what I have here is
how many total steps?

180
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,420
There's a total of 10 steps.

181
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,410
So 10 factorial, that's kind of
the number of trials I have.

182
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,820
Of that I'm choosing
0 to go left.

183
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:14,390
So 0 factorial divided by
10 minus 0 factorial.

184
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,580
This is 10 choose 0.

185
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,790
I'm choosing 0 left steps of
the total 10 steps I'm taking

186
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:23,900
times the probability of 0 left
steps so, it's the probability

187
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:28,110
of a left step, I'm only taking
0 of them times the probability

188
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,550
of a right step, and I'm
taking 10 of those.

189
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:35,050
So that's where this number
came from, this .001.

190
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,700
That's what the binomial
distribution tells us.

191
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:44,530
And then this one similarly, is
10 factorial over 1 factorial

192
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:47,070
over 10 minus 1 factorial.

193
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:47,820
That's how I get that one.

194
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,650
And once again, if you click
on the actual cell you'll

195
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:51,960
see that explained.

196
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,020
We've done this multiple times.

197
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,490
This is just a
bionomial calculation.

198
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:59,080
Then right here, after
this line right here, you

199
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,520
can almost ignore it.

200
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,930
I did that so that I can do a
bunch of different scenarios.

201
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:09,490
For example, if I were to go to
my spreadsheet, and instead of

202
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:17,580
doing 10 I wanted to do 20
steps then everything changes.

203
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:23,410
And that's why down here after
you get to a certain point the

204
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:26,130
whole thing just
kind of repeats.

205
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,000
I'll let you think
about why I do that.

206
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,200
Maybe I should have made
a cleaner spreadsheet.

207
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,490
But it doesn't affect the
scatter plot chart that I did.

208
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:38,170
And so this plot in blue, and
you can't see it because the

209
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,590
purple is almost right over.

210
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:43,560
Actually let me make it
smaller so that you can see.

211
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:48,080
Let's say I only took 6 steps.

212
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,200
Well it's still hard to see the
difference between the two.

213
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,590
Once again the whole point
of this is to see that the

214
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,570
normal distribution is
a good approximation.

215
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,730
But they're so close that
you can't even see the

216
00:10:58,730 --> 00:10:59,430
difference on mine.

217
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,705
If you only took four steps,
OK, I think you can see here.

218
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,460
Let me get my screen draw on.

219
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,830
The blue curve is
right around there.

220
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,910
This is the binomial.

221
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,910
There's only a few points
here, you the points

222
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,560
only go up to here.

223
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,890
This is if I take 0 steps left,
1 step left, 2 steps left,

224
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,330
3 steps left, 4 steps left.

225
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,750
And then I plot it and then I
say what's the probability

226
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,840
using the binomial
distribution?

227
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,710
And this is my final
position right?

228
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,460
If I take 0 steps to the left
then I take 4 steps to the

229
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,090
right so my final position
is at 4, so that's the

230
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,950
scenario right here.

231
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,220
Let me switch my color back to
yellow, it's easier to see.

232
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:49,730
If I take 4 steps to the left,
I take 0 steps to the right and

233
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:52,780
so my final position is
going to be at minus 4.

234
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,030
It's going to be here.

235
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:58,980
If I take an equal amount of
both, that's this scenario,

236
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,500
then I'm neutral.

237
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,840
I'm just stuck in the
middle right here.

238
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,360
I take 2 steps to the right and
then I take 2 steps to the left

239
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,630
or vice versa, I take 2 steps
to the left and then I take

240
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,760
2 steps right and I
end up right there.

241
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,720
Hopefully that makes
a little sense.

242
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,790
My phone is ringing.

243
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:17,060
I'll ignore that because
the normal distribution

244
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:17,990
is so important.

245
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:21,050
Actually, my 9 week old son is
watching so this is the first

246
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,200
time I have a live audience.

247
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,300
He might pick up something
about the normal distribution.

248
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,650
So the blue line right here --
I'll trace it maybe in yellow

249
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:35,470
so you can see it -- is the
plot of the binomial

250
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,500
distribution.

251
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,620
I connected the lines but you
see the binomial distribution

252
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,520
look something more like this.

253
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:47,310
This is the probability
of getting to minus 4.

254
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:51,770
This is the probability
of going to minus 2.

255
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:55,390
This right here is
the probability of

256
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,240
ending up nowhere.

257
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:06,030
Then this is the probability of
ending up 2 to the right and

258
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,510
this is the probability of
ending up 4 to the right.

259
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,670
This is the binomial
distribution, I just plotted

260
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,860
these points right here.

261
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,490
This is 0.375.

262
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,520
This is 0.375.

263
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,000
That's the height of that.

264
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,320
Now what I wanted to show
you is that the normal

265
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,530
distribution approximates
the binomial distribution.

266
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:29,550
So this right here, I wanted
to say what does the normal

267
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:34,880
distribution tell me is the
probability of ending up

268
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,180
with exactly 0 left steps?

269
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,260
This is a little bit tricky.

270
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,970
The binomial distribution
is a discreet probability

271
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:45,500
distribution.

272
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,100
You can just look at this chart
or look here and you say, what

273
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:56,280
is the probability of having
exactly 1 left step and 3 right

274
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,160
steps which puts me right here?

275
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,530
Well you just look at this
chart and you say oh, that

276
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,300
puts me right there.

277
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,100
I just read that probability,
it's actually .25.

278
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,400
And I say oh, I have a 25
percent chance of ending

279
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:12,010
up 2 steps to the right.

280
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:14,090
There's a 25 percent chance.

281
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:17,400
The normal distribution
function is a continuous

282
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,180
probability distribution so
it's a continuous curve.

283
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,130
It looks like that, it's a
bell curve and it goes off

284
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:26,400
to infinity and starts
approaching 0 on both sides.

285
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,090
It looks something like that.

286
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,040
This is a continuous
probability distribution.

287
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,800
You can't just take a point
here and say, what's the

288
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,250
probability that I end
up 2 feet to the right?

289
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,080
Because if you just say that
there's the actual the

290
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,580
probability of being exactly --
and you should watch with my

291
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,170
video on probability density
functions -- but the

292
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,270
probability of being exactly 2
feet to the right, exactly, I

293
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:48,500
mean I'm talking to the
atoms, is close to 0.

294
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,430
You actually have to specify
a range around this.

295
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:56,900
What I assume in this
within a half a foot

296
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,330
in either direction.

297
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:58,690
Right?

298
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,380
If we're talking about feet.

299
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,840
To figure that out what I did
here is I took the value of

300
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,280
the probability density
function there.

301
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,600
And I'll show you how
I evaluated that.

302
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,450
And then I multiply that by 1.

303
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,580
So it gives me this area.

304
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,620
And I use that as an
approximation for this area.

305
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,580
If you really want to be
particular about it what you

306
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,000
would do is you would take the
integral of this curve between

307
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,750
this point and this point
as a better approximation.

308
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,970
We'll do that in the future.

309
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,080
But right now I just want to
give you the intuition that the

310
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,470
binomial distribution really
does converge to the

311
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,380
normal distribution.

312
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,290
So how did I get this
number right here?

313
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:44,880
Well I said, what is the
probability that I think 1 left

314
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:53,260
step -- I kind of used less
steps as success -- of one?

315
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:59,080
And that equaled 1 over
the standard deviation.

316
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,450
When I only took 4 steps the
standard deviation was 1.

317
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,780
So 1 over 1.

318
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,950
Actually let me change this.

319
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,946
Let me change it to
a higher number.

320
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,645
We'll go back to the
example where I'm at 10.

321
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,552
So if this is at 10.

322
00:16:20,552 --> 00:16:22,560
Let me go back to
my drawing tool.

323
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,980
Let me do this calculation.

324
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,660
Actually, even better let
me do this calculation.

325
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,160
So what's the probability
that I have 2 left steps?

326
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,845
If I have 2 left steps I took a
total of 10 steps so I'm going

327
00:16:39,845 --> 00:16:42,800
to have 8 right steps and
that puts me 6 to the right.

328
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,090
So that's this
point right here.

329
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,170
So what's that probability?

330
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,070
How do I figure this out
using the probability

331
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,270
density function?

332
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,150
How do I figure this height?

333
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:56,150
Well I say the probability of
taking 2 left steps -- that's

334
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,130
how I calculate it, if you
actually click on the cell

335
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:04,150
you'll see that -- is equal to
1 over the standard deviation,

336
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:11,360
1.581 -- and I just directly
reference the cell there --

337
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,694
times the square root of 2 pi.

338
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:18,885
I'm always in awe of the whole
notion of e to the i pi is

339
00:17:18,885 --> 00:17:19,940
equal to negative 1
and all of that.

340
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,090
But there's another
amazing thing.

341
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:25,530
That all of a sudden as we take
many trials we have this

342
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,740
formula that has e and pi in it
and square roots but once again

343
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,310
these two numbers just
keep showing up.

344
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,290
It tells you something about
the order of the universe

345
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,120
with a capital o.

346
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:42,610
But let's see, times e to
the minus 1/2 times x.

347
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:46,310
Well x is what we're trying
to calculate, two successes.

348
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:54,780
To to have exactly 2 left,
so it's 2 minus the mean.

349
00:17:54,780 --> 00:18:01,000
So the mean is five, 2 minus
five divided by the standard

350
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:10,160
deviation, divided by 1.581,
all of that squared.

351
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,170
That's where this
calculation came from.

352
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,590
So I told you in the last one
this right here just tells

353
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:22,640
me this value up here.

354
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,310
If I want to know this
exact probability,

355
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,960
it's the area of this.

356
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,010
And if I just take one
line the are is 0.

357
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:36,010
Remember, in this case you can
only be 2 feet away because

358
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,770
we're taking very exact steps.

359
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,890
But what the normal
distribution is it's the

360
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:44,280
continuous probability density
function so it can tell us

361
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,720
what's the probability of
being 2.183 feet away?

362
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,900
Which obviously can only happen
if we're taking infinitely

363
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,330
small steps every time.

364
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,420
But that's what it's use is.

365
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,100
It happens when you start
taking an infinite

366
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:56,940
number of steps.

367
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,310
But it can approximate
the discreet.

368
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,470
And the way I approximate it is
I say oh, what's probability of

369
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,150
being within a foot of that.

370
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,400
And so I multiply
this height, which I

371
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,920
calculate here, times 1.

372
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:13,380
So let's say this has a base of
1, to calculate this area which

373
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,110
I use as an approximation.

374
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:19,220
So you just multiply that times
1 and that's what you get here.

375
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,240
And I just want to show you.

376
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,050
Even with just 10 trials, the
curves, the normal distribution

377
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,550
here is in purple and the
binomial distribution

378
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,140
is in blue.

379
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,070
So they're almost right
on top of each other.

380
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:39,860
As you can take many more steps
they almost converge right on

381
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,320
top of each other and I
encourage you to play

382
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,700
with the spreadsheets.

383
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,170
Actually, let me show
you that they converge.

384
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,540
There's a convergence worksheet
on this spreadsheet as well if

385
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:52,180
you click on the bottom
tab on convergence.

386
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,450
This is the same thing but I
just want to show you what

387
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:58,940
happens at any given point.

388
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,550
Let me explain this
spreadsheet to you.

389
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,040
So this is what's
the probability of

390
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,570
moving left, right?

391
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:09,060
So this is just saying, I'm
just fixing a point what's

392
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,330
the probability -- and you
can change this -- of my

393
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,120
final position being 10.

394
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,720
And this essentially tells you
that if I take 10 moves, for my

395
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,330
final position to be 10 to the
right, I have to take 10 right

396
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,820
moves and 0 left moves.

397
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:26,230
That's a typo right there, it
should be moves not movest.

398
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:31,770
If I take 20 moves to end up 10
moves to the right then I have

399
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,580
to make 15 right moves
and 5 left moves.

400
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,780
Likewise if I take a total of
80 moves, if I think 80 flips

401
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,580
of my coin to make me go left
or right, in order end up 10 to

402
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:46,430
the right, I to take 45 right
moves and 35 left moves in any

403
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,920
order and it will end up
with 10 to the right.

404
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,920
So what I want to figure out
is, as I start taking a bunch

405
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:58,650
of total moves -- here I max it
out at 170 -- if I start

406
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:01,350
flipping this coin an infinite
number of times, I want to

407
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:03,340
figure out what's the
probability that my final

408
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,080
position is 10 to the right.

409
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,880
And I want to show you that as
you take more and more moves

410
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,730
the normal distribution becomes
a better and better

411
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:15,260
approximation for the
binomial distribution.

412
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:18,510
So right here, this calculates
the binomial probability, just

413
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,040
the way we did before and you
can look at the cell

414
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,770
to figure it out.

415
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,170
I used left moves as a success.

416
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,920
So this is 10 choose 0 and
we know what that is.

417
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,840
It's 10 factorial over 0
factorial over 10 minus 0

418
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:43,210
factorial times 0.5 to the
0 times 0.5 to the 10th.

419
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,980
That's where that
number comes from.

420
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:52,540
If I go to this one right
here is calculated.

421
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,720
Actually let me write
it out because I think

422
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,290
it's interesting.

423
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:54,867
I have a total of 60 total
moves, so it's 60 factorial

424
00:21:54,867 --> 00:22:02,990
over, I have to have 25 left
moves so 25 factorial.

425
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:09,510
So that's I'm 60 minus 25
factorial times the probability

426
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:12,510
of a left move and have 25 of them, times the

427
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:17,860
probability of a right move
and I have 35 of those.

428
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:21,490
So that's just what the
binomial probability

429
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,390
distribution will tell us.

430
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,220
And then it figures out the
mean and the variance for each

431
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,340
of those circumstances and you
could look at the formula.

432
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,050
But the mean is just the
probability of having

433
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,880
a left move times the
total number of moves.

434
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,250
The variance is probability of
left times probability of right

435
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,160
times total number of moves.

436
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,670
And then the normal
probability, once again, I just

437
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,810
use the normal probability.

438
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,310
So I approximate
it the same way.

439
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,620
And Excel has a normal
distribution function but I

440
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,750
actually typed in the formula
because I wanted you kind of

441
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:57,890
see what was under the covers
for that function that

442
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:58,910
Excel actually has.

443
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:04,770
So I actually say what's the
probability of 25 left moves?

444
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,830
No, 45 left moves.

445
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:14,690
So I say the probability of
45 left moves is equal to 1

446
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:17,340
over the standard deviation.

447
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:20,430
So in this situation the
standard deviation is

448
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,720
the square root of 25.

449
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:32,910
So it's five times 2 pi times e
to the minus 1/2 times 45 minus

450
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:37,790
the mean, minus 50 over the
standard deviation, which we

451
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:41,010
figured out was 5, squared.

452
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:45,060
So that tells me the value of
what the normal distribution

453
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,100
tells me for this situation
with this standard deviation

454
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,020
and this mean and then I
multiply that by 1 -- you don't

455
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,280
see that in the formula, I
don't actually write times 1 --

456
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,020
to figure out the area
under the curve.

457
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,380
Because remember it's a
continuous distribution

458
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,480
function.

459
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,840
This right here just gives me
the value but to figure out the

460
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,590
probability of being within a
foot of it I have

461
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,210
to multiply by 1.

462
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,340
I'm approximating really.

463
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,320
I really should take the
integral from there to there

464
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,900
but this little rectangle is
a pretty good approximation.

465
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:16,860
In this chart I show you that
as the total number of moves

466
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,560
gets larger and larger the
difference between what the

467
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,330
normal probability distribution
tells us and the binomial

468
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:27,060
probability of distribution
tells us, gets smaller and

469
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:30,930
smaller in terms of the
probability of you ending up

470
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,100
to 10 moves to the right.

471
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,040
And you can change
this number here.

472
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,230
Let me change it
just to show you.

473
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,370
You could say what's the
probability of being

474
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:43,670
15 moves to the right?

475
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,280
I think that something is
happening with the floating

476
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,180
point error because when you
get to large factorials I

477
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,770
think something weird
happens out here.

478
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,600
You may just have to
get even further out.

479
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,820
For 10 you can see clearly that
it converges and I'll trying to

480
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,043
figure out why I was getting
those weird saw tooth patterns.

481
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:35,110
Maybe while I do screen capture
something weird is happening.

482
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:37,570
The whole point of this was to
show you that if you want to

483
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:40,770
figure out the probability of
being 10 moves to the right, as

484
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:44,840
you take more and more flips
of your coin the normal

485
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,840
distribution becomes a much
better approximation for the

486
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,730
actual binomial distribution.

487
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:54,220
And as you approach infinity
they actually converge

488
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,120
to each other.

489
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,560
Anyway, that's all
for this video.

490
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,290
I'll actually do several
more videos on the normal

491
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:02,027
distributions because it is
such an important concept.

492
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:02,380
See you soon.
