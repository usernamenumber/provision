1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,460
Now this looks like an interesting problem.

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:06,040
We have his polygon. It looks like a pentagon right over here,

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,270
has five sides it's an irregular pentagon; not all

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,110
the sides looked to be the same length, and the sides are kind of

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,350
continued on and we have this particular exterior angles of

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,060
this pentagon and what we're asked is what is the sum of all

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,200
these exterior angles, and it's kind of daunting 'cause like

8
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:24,520
they don't give us any other information,

9
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,130
they don't even give us any particular angles,

10
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,800
they don't even give us -- you know they don't start us off anywhere

11
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,160
and so what we can do, let's just think about the step by step

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,220
just based on what we do know.

13
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,300
Well we have these exterior angles and these exterior angles

14
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:42,310
they're all, they're each supplementary to some interior angle,

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,510
so maybe if can express them as the function of the interior angles

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,720
we can maybe write this problem in a way maybe a little bit

17
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:52,150
more doable so let's write the interior angles over here

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,340
so let's say we have this we already got to letter we already got to E

19
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:01,280
so let's call this F this interior angle F, let's call this G,

20
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:07,210
let's call this H, let's call this one I, and F let's call this one J

21
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,860
And so this some of this particular exterior angles

22
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:16,130
A is now the same thing A is now the same thing as 180 minus G

23
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,630
Because A and G are supplementary so A is 180 minus G

24
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,280
And then we have plus B but we can write in terms of

25
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,520
this interior angle It's gonna be 180 minus H because

26
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,650
these two angles once again Are supplementary we do

27
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:38,510
that in a new color So this is going to be 180 minus H

28
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,290
and we can do the same thing for each of them

29
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:46,290
C we can write as 180 minus I so plus 180 minus I

30
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:51,930
And then D we can write D we can write as 180 minus J

31
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,070
So plus 180 minus J

32
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,000
And then finally E I'm running out of colors

33
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:05,830
E we can right as 180 minus F so plus 180 plus 180 minus F

34
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,770
And so what we're left with if we add up all the 180s we have

35
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,640
We have a 180 five times

36
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:16,410
So this is going to be equal to five times 180

37
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,920
which is what like 900

38
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:22,550
and then we have minus G minus H minus I minus J minus F

39
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,160
or we could write that as minus, minus I'll try to do the same colors

40
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:32,340
G plus H I'm kind of factoring out this negative sign

41
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:38,130
G plus H we do the same colors G plus that's not the same color

42
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:51,110
G plus H, plus I, plus I, plus J, plus j, plus F, plus F

43
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,770
And the whole reason why I did this

44
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,760
And why this is interesting now is that we have expressed it

45
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,240
The first thing we need to figure out we have expressed it

46
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,390
In terms of the sum of the interior angles

47
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,320
So this is gonna be 900 minus all of this business

48
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:09,010
So this is this is 900 all of this business

49
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,440
Which is the sum of all interior angles

50
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:15,010
So this is the sum of all interior angles

51
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,250
So it seems like we've made a little progress if we get

52
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,030
at least if we can figure out the sum of the interior angles

53
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,190
and to do that part I'll show you a little trick

54
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,430
what you want to do is divide this polygon the inside of the polygon

55
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,260
into three non over lapping triangles

56
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,740
and so we can do that from any side let me just say

57
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,960
let's say they are all coming out of that side right over there

58
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,990
so there I have divided it let me do this is a in a neutral color

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,850
I'm doing it in white so so that's one triangle right over here

60
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,650
And then let me make another triangle just like that

61
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,000
So there you go I've divided it in three non overlapping triangles

62
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,440
And the reason why I did that, the reason why this is valuable

63
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:57,250
Is that we know what the sum of the angles of the triangles add up to

64
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,110
And so to make that useful we have to express

65
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,570
these angles in terms of the sums or in terms of angles

66
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:08,140
that we can figure out based on the fact that the sums of the angles

67
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,340
or the measures of an angles in a triangle add up to 180

68
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,010
so G is kind of already one of the angles in the triangle

69
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,380
F is made up of two angles in the triangle

70
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,250
So remember F is this entire angle right over here

71
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,900
So let's let's divide F into two other angles

72
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,000
Or two other measures of angles I should say

73
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:29,490
So let's call it let's call F is equal to let's say

74
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,660
that F is equal to so we've already gone as high as let's see

75
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:37,620
ABCDEFGHIJ we haven't used K yet

76
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,900
So let's say that F is equals to K plus L

77
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,000
It's equal to the sum of the measures of

78
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,760
these two adjacent angles right over here

79
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:51,180
So F is equal to K plus L so that that way we've split it up into

80
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,110
Into part into angles of these other triangles

81
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,840
And then we can do that with J as well with J as well

82
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,490
We can say coz J once again is that whole thing

83
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,340
So we could say that K is equal to let's see we already used L

84
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:13,380
So let's say J is equals to M plus N so J is equals to M plus N

85
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,110
And then finally we could split up H

86
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,370
H is up here remember this is whole thing

87
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,760
Let's say that H is the same thing as O plus P plus Q

88
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,010
This is O this is P this is Q

89
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,690
And once again I wanted to split up these interior angles

90
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,060
If they're not already parts of or already an angle of a triangle

91
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:34,710
I wanna split them up into angles that are parts of these triangles

92
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,290
So we have H is equal to O plus P plus Q

93
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,140
And the reason why that's interesting is now we can write

94
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,670
we can write the sum of these interior angles

95
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,140
as the sum of a bunch of angles that are part of these triangles

96
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,860
and then we could use the fact that those

97
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:54,860
that for any one triangle they add up to 180 degrees so let's do that

98
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,690
so this this expression right over here is gonna be G

99
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,140
G is that angle right over here we didn't make any substitutions

100
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,180
So this is going to be G

101
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,400
And you want me to write the whole thing

102
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:09,270
So we have 900, 900 minus and instead of a G

103
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,050
Well actually I'm not making a substitution so I can write G

104
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,400
Plus instead of an H instead of an H I can write

105
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:23,884
that H is O plus P plus Q plus O plus P plus Q and then plus I

106
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:28,915
plus I, I is sitting right over there, plus I

107
00:06:28,915 --> 00:06:30,119
plus J...

108
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:33,784
I kinda messed up the colors, the magenta will go with I

109
00:06:33,784 --> 00:06:36,210
and J is the expression right over here,

110
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,208
so J is equal to M plus N

111
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:41,345
so plus M plus N instead of righting J right there

112
00:06:41,345 --> 00:06:44,067
and then finally we have our F

113
00:06:44,067 --> 00:06:46,738
and F, we've already seen,

114
00:06:46,738 --> 00:06:52,440
is equal to K plus L, plus K plus L

115
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,178
so once again I just rewrote

116
00:06:54,178 --> 00:06:55,143
this part right over here

117
00:06:55,143 --> 00:06:57,200
in terms of these component agles.

118
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,768
And now something very interesting

119
00:06:58,768 --> 00:06:59,946
is going to happen

120
00:06:59,946 --> 00:07:00,999
because we now

121
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:02,149
what these sums are going to be

122
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:04,615
because we know that G plus K plus O

123
00:07:04,615 --> 00:07:05,876
is a 180 degrees.

124
00:07:05,876 --> 00:07:07,281
They are the measures of the angle

125
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:08,934
for this first triangle over here

126
00:07:08,934 --> 00:07:10,740
for this triangle right over here.

127
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,866
So G plus O plus K is a 180 degrees.

128
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:17,266
So G .... let me do this in a new color...

129
00:07:17,266 --> 00:07:19,525
so for this triangle right over here

130
00:07:19,525 --> 00:07:20,739
this triangle right over here

131
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:23,260
we know that G plus O plus K

132
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,814
are going to be equal to 180 degrees.

133
00:07:25,814 --> 00:07:27,922
If we cross those out

134
00:07:27,922 --> 00:07:30,323
we can write 180 instead

135
00:07:30,323 --> 00:07:32,056
and then we also know

136
00:07:32,056 --> 00:07:33,677
let me see, I'm definiftely out of colors here...

137
00:07:33,677 --> 00:07:35,798
we know that P for this middle triangle

138
00:07:35,798 --> 00:07:36,911
right over here

139
00:07:36,911 --> 00:07:40,206
we know that P plus L plus M is 180 degrees.

140
00:07:40,206 --> 00:07:44,996
So P plus L plus m is 180 degrees.

141
00:07:44,996 --> 00:07:46,933
So you take those out and you say,

142
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:47,850
You know that the sum

143
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,412
is going to be equal 180 degrees.

144
00:07:50,412 --> 00:07:51,859
And then finally,

145
00:07:51,859 --> 00:07:53,494
this is the home stretch here,

146
00:07:53,494 --> 00:07:55,266
we know that Q plus N plus I

147
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,765
is 180 degrees

148
00:07:56,765 --> 00:07:58,515
in this last triangle.

149
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:00,522
Q plus N plus I

150
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:04,074
Q plus N plus I is 180 degrees.

151
00:08:04,074 --> 00:08:07,491
THose three are also gonna be 180 degrees

152
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:09,067
and so now we know

153
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:10,607
the sum of the interior angles

154
00:08:10,607 --> 00:08:12,907
for this irregular pentagon,

155
00:08:12,907 --> 00:08:14,627
which is actually true for any pentagon,

156
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,994
is 180 plus 180 plus 180,

157
00:08:16,994 --> 00:08:19,582
which is 540 degrees.

158
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,961
So that whole thing is 540 degrees

159
00:08:21,961 --> 00:08:22,739
and if we want to get the sum

160
00:08:22,739 --> 00:08:24,515
of the extra angles

161
00:08:24,515 --> 00:08:26,593
we just subtract it from 900.

162
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:31,594
So 900 minus 540 is going to be 360 degrees.

163
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,829
And we are done. This is equal to 360 degrees.

164
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
   

165
00:08:33,829 --> 99:59:59,999
