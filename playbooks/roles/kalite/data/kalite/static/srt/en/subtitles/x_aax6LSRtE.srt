00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:01,680
What i want to do in this video

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,349
is to come up with a relationship

3
00:00:03,349 --> 00:00:05,741
between the area of a triangle

4
00:00:05,741 --> 00:00:08,495
and the triangle's circumscribed circle

5
00:00:08,495 --> 00:00:09,918
or circum-circle.

6
00:00:09,918 --> 00:00:11,722
So before we think about the circum-circle

7
00:00:11,722 --> 00:00:14,476
let's just think about the area of the triangle.

8
00:00:14,476 --> 00:00:24,806
So let's say that the triangle looks something like this.

9
00:00:24,806 --> 00:00:27,025
Actually I don't want to make it look isosceles.

10
00:00:27,025 --> 00:00:31,591
So let me make it a little bit

11
00:00:31,591 --> 00:00:36,009
so it doesn't look like any particular type of triangle

12
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:40,038
and let's call this traingle "ABC".

13
00:00:40,038 --> 00:00:41,237
That's the vertices

14
00:00:41,237 --> 00:00:45,268
and then the length of the side opposite "A" is "a"

15
00:00:45,268 --> 00:00:48,775
"b" over here, and then "c"

16
00:00:48,775 --> 00:00:51,249
We know how to calculate the area of this triangle

17
00:00:51,249 --> 00:00:52,587
if we know its height.

18
00:00:52,587 --> 00:00:57,005
If we drop an altitude right here

19
00:00:57,005 --> 00:00:59,571
and if this altitude has length "h"

20
00:00:59,571 --> 00:01:05,280
we know that the area of [ABC]

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,221
- and we write [ABC] with the brackets around it

22
00:01:07,221 --> 00:01:09,858
means the area of the traingle [ABC] -

23
00:01:09,858 --> 00:01:15,310
is equal to 1/2 times the base, which is "b"

24
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,847
times the height.

25
00:01:18,847 --> 00:01:19,544
Fair enough.

26
00:01:19,544 --> 00:01:21,616
We have an expression for the area.

27
00:01:21,616 --> 00:01:22,719
Let's see if we can somehow

28
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:25,501
relate some of these things with the area

29
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:30,332
to the radius of the triangle's circumscribed circle.

30
00:01:30,332 --> 00:01:32,654
So the circumscribed circle is a circle

31
00:01:32,654 --> 00:01:36,424
that passes through all of the vertices of the triangle

32
00:01:36,424 --> 00:01:38,910
and every triangle has a circumscribed circle.

33
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,326
So let me try to draw it.

34
00:01:40,326 --> 00:01:43,667
This is the hard part, right over here

35
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:49,825
so it might look something like this

36
00:01:49,825 --> 00:01:51,812
That's fair enough. That's close enough to a circle

37
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:53,800
I think you get the general idea

38
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,742
That is the circum-circle for this triangle.

39
00:01:56,742 --> 00:02:00,608
or this triangle's circumscribed circle.

40
00:02:00,608 --> 00:02:02,366
Let me label it.

41
00:02:02,366 --> 00:02:13,186
This is the circum-circle for this triangle.

42
00:02:13,186 --> 00:02:16,743
Now let's think about the center of that circum-circle

43
00:02:16,743 --> 00:02:19,607
sometimes refer to as the circumcenter.

44
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:21,722
So looks like it would be sitting

45
00:02:21,722 --> 00:02:23,227
I don't know, just eyeballing it

46
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:24,532
right on this little "b" here.

47
00:02:24,532 --> 00:02:27,355
So that's the circum-circle of the circle

48
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:30,343
Let's draw a diameter through that circumcircle

49
00:02:30,343 --> 00:02:33,129
and draw a diameter from vertex "B"

50
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:35,970
through that circumcenter.

51
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:41,794
So then we go there, and we just keep going over here

52
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:46,850
Let's call this point over here "D".

53
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:50,566
Now let's create a triangle with vertices A, B, and D.

54
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:53,621
So we can just draw another line over here

55
00:02:53,621 --> 00:02:56,253
and we have triangle ABD

56
00:02:56,253 --> 00:02:58,509
Now we proved in the geometry play

57
00:02:58,509 --> 00:03:00,665
- and it's not actually a crazy prove at all -

58
00:03:00,665 --> 00:03:05,312
that any triangle that's inscribed in a circle

59
00:03:05,312 --> 00:03:07,650
where one of the sides of the triangle

60
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,684
is a diameter of the circle

61
00:03:11,684 --> 00:03:14,723
then that is going to be a right triangle

62
00:03:14,723 --> 00:03:16,983
and the angle that is going to be 90 degrees

63
00:03:16,983 --> 00:03:19,253
is the angle opposite the diameter

64
00:03:19,253 --> 00:03:21,545
So this is the right angle right here.

65
00:03:21,545 --> 00:03:24,407
You can derive that, pretty straightforward.

66
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:32,255
You have this arc here that is 180 degrees.

67
00:03:32,255 --> 00:03:33,843
because obviously this is a diameter.

68
00:03:33,843 --> 00:03:36,793
And it subtends this inscribed angle.

69
00:03:36,793 --> 00:03:39,896
We've also proved that an inscribed angle

70
00:03:39,896 --> 00:03:41,287
that is subtended by the arc

71
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:43,034
will be half of the arc length

72
00:03:43,034 --> 00:03:45,485
This is an 180 degree arc

73
00:03:45,485 --> 00:03:47,202
so this is going to be a 90 degree angle.

74
00:03:47,202 --> 00:03:50,434
So either way this's going to be 90 degrees over there

75
00:03:50,434 --> 00:03:52,143
The other thing we see

76
00:03:52,143 --> 00:03:54,516
is that we have this arc right over here

77
00:03:54,516 --> 00:03:55,670
that I'm drawing in magenta

78
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,240
the arc that goes from "A" to "B"

79
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,692
That arc subtends two different angles in our drawing

80
00:04:01,692 --> 00:04:05,239
- it subtends this angle right over here, angle ACB

81
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:07,668
it subtends that right over there -

82
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:11,066
but it also subtends angle ADB

83
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:12,773
that's why we construct it this way

84
00:04:12,773 --> 00:04:14,753
So it also subtends this

85
00:04:14,753 --> 00:04:18,917
So these two angles are going to be congruent.

86
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:21,059
They'll both have half the degree measure

87
00:04:21,059 --> 00:04:22,241
of this arc over here

88
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:24,232
because they're both inscribed angles

89
00:04:24,232 --> 00:04:28,356
subtended by the same exact arc.

90
00:04:28,356 --> 00:04:30,118
Something interesting is popping up.

91
00:04:30,118 --> 00:04:31,888
We have two triangles here

92
00:04:31,888 --> 00:04:40,434
we have triangle ABD and triangle BEC

93
00:04:40,434 --> 00:04:41,883
They have two angles that resemble

94
00:04:41,883 --> 00:04:45,747
They have right angle and this magenta angle

95
00:04:45,747 --> 00:04:47,924
and their third angle must be the same.

96
00:04:47,924 --> 00:04:49,209
We'll do it in yellow

97
00:04:49,209 --> 00:04:53,842
The third angle must be congruent to that angle.

98
00:04:53,842 --> 00:04:55,942
They have three angles that are the same.

99
00:04:55,942 --> 00:04:59,018
They must be similar triangles.

100
00:04:59,018 --> 00:05:01,539
or the ratio between the corresponding sides

101
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:03,725
must be the same.

102
00:05:03,725 --> 00:05:05,630
So we can use that information now

103
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,635
to relate the length of this side

104
00:05:07,635 --> 00:05:09,841
which is really the diameter, is two times the radius

105
00:05:09,841 --> 00:05:12,705
to the height of this smaller triangle.

106
00:05:12,705 --> 00:05:13,645
We know the relationship

107
00:05:13,645 --> 00:05:14,670
between the height of the smaller triangle

108
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,659
and the area

109
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:18,141
and we essentially are in the home stretch.

110
00:05:18,141 --> 00:05:19,355
So let's do that

111
00:05:19,355 --> 00:05:21,341
So these are two similar triangles

112
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:33,448
We know that the ratio of C to this diameter right here

113
00:05:33,448 --> 00:05:34,778
What's the length of the diameter?

114
00:05:34,778 --> 00:05:38,544
The length of the diameter is 2 times the radius

115
00:05:38,544 --> 00:05:40,908
This is the radius.

116
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:45,270
We know that the ratio, C to two times the radius

117
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:52,030
is going to be the same exact thing as the ratio of "h"

118
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,838
- and we want to make sure we're using the same side -

119
00:05:53,838 --> 00:05:55,529
to the hypoteneuse of that triangle

120
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:59,553
to the ratio of "H" to "A".

121
00:05:59,553 --> 00:06:01,742
And the way we figured that out

122
00:06:01,742 --> 00:06:03,263
we look at corresponding sides.

123
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,641
"C" and the hypoteneuse are both the sides

124
00:06:06,641 --> 00:06:08,923
adjacent to this angle right over here

125
00:06:08,923 --> 00:06:11,647
So you have "H" and "A".

126
00:06:11,647 --> 00:06:15,405
So "C" is to "2r "as "H" is to "a".

127
00:06:15,405 --> 00:06:19,668
Or, we could do a lot of things.

128
00:06:19,668 --> 00:06:23,380
1, we could solve for h over here

129
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:28,146
and substitute an expression that has the area

130
00:06:28,146 --> 00:06:30,512
Actually let's just do that

131
00:06:30,543 --> 00:06:33,811
So if we use this first expression for the area.

132
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:39,827
We could multiply both sides by two.

133
00:06:39,827 --> 00:06:44,711
And divide both sides by B.

134
00:06:44,711 --> 00:06:47,202
That cancels with that.

135
00:06:47,202 --> 00:06:50,915
We get that H is equal to 3 times the area over B.

136
00:06:50,915 --> 00:06:56,992
We can rewrite this relationship as c/2r is equals to h

137
00:06:56,992 --> 00:07:05,883
which is 2 times the area of our triangle over B

138
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:12,118
and then all of that is going to be over A.

139
00:07:12,118 --> 00:07:15,074
Or, we could rewrite that second part over here

140
00:07:15,074 --> 00:07:20,270
as two times the area over

141
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,977
- we're dividing by "b" and then divided by "a",

142
00:07:21,977 --> 00:07:25,777
that's the same thing as dividing by ab

143
00:07:25,777 --> 00:07:27,169
So we can ignore this right here.

144
00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:31,354
So we have c/2r is equals to 2 times the area over ab

145
00:07:31,354 --> 00:07:33,966
And now we can cross-multiply

146
00:07:33,966 --> 00:07:49,362
ab times c is going to be equal to 2r times 2abc.

147
00:07:49,362 --> 00:07:56,060
So that's going to be 4r times the area of our triangle.

148
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,787
I just cross multiply this times this

149
00:07:58,787 --> 00:08:01,235
is going to be equal to that times that.

150
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:03,503
We know that cross multiplication is just

151
00:08:03,503 --> 00:08:07,320
multiplying both sides of the equation by 2r

152
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,025
and multiplying both sides of the equation by ab.

153
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:12,141
So we did that on the left hand side

154
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:13,607
we also did that on the right hand side

155
00:08:13,607 --> 00:08:15,955
2r and ab

156
00:08:15,955 --> 00:08:19,097
obviously that cancels with that, that cancels with that

157
00:08:19,097 --> 00:08:22,941
So we get ABC is equal to 2r times 2abc.

158
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:26,815
Or 4r times the area of our triangle.

159
00:08:26,815 --> 00:08:27,991
And now we're in the home stretch.

160
00:08:27,991 --> 00:08:40,717
We divide both sides of this by 4 times the area

161
00:08:40,717 --> 00:08:41,752
and we're done.

162
00:08:41,752 --> 00:08:43,698
This cancels with that, that cancels with that

163
00:08:43,698 --> 00:08:45,676
and we have our relationship

164
00:08:45,676 --> 00:08:50,045
The radius, or we can call it the circumradius.

165
00:08:50,045 --> 00:08:52,805
The radius of this triangle's circumscribed circle

166
00:08:52,805 --> 00:08:55,495
is equal to the product of the side of the triangle

167
00:08:55,495 --> 00:09:03,410
divided by 4 times the area of the triangle.

168
00:09:03,410 --> 99:59:59,999
That's a pretty neat result.
