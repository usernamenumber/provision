1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,550
   

2
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,900
We've seen in the last several
videos you start off with

3
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,410
any crazy distribution.

4
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,940
It doesn't have to be
crazy, it could be a nice

5
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:07,830
normal distribution.

6
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,380
But to really make the point
that you don't have to have

7
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,170
a normal distribution I
like to use crazy ones.

8
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,790
So let's say you have some kind
of crazy distribution that

9
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,790
looks something like that.

10
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,080
It could look like anything.

11
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,360
So we've seen multiple times
you take samples from

12
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,530
this crazy distribution.

13
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:27,890
So let's say you were to take
samples of n is equal to 10.

14
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:32,750
So we take 10 instances of this
random variable, average them

15
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,750
out, and then plot our average.

16
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,160
We plot our average.

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,590
We get 1 instance there.

18
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:38,680
We keep doing that.

19
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,280
We do that again.

20
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,650
We take 10 samples from this
random variable, average

21
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:43,430
them, plot them again.

22
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:47,360
You plot again and eventually
you do this a gazillion times--

23
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,230
in theory an infinite number of
times-- and you're going to

24
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:53,240
approach the sampling
distribution of the sample

25
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,290
mean. n equal 10 is not going
to be a perfect normal

26
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,900
distribution but it's
going to be close.

27
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,610
It'd be perfect only
if n was infinity.

28
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:05,680
But let's say we eventually--
all of our samples we get a lot

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,180
of averages that are there that
stacks up, that stacks up

30
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,290
there, and eventually will
approach something that

31
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,060
looks something like that.

32
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,190
And we've seen from the last
video that one-- if let's say

33
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,130
we were to do it again and this
time let's say that n is equal

34
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:23,200
to 20-- one, the distribution
that we get is going

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,990
to be more normal.

36
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,440
And maybe in future videos
we'll delve even deeper into

37
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,510
things like kurtosis and skew.

38
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,780
But it's going to
be more normal.

39
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,570
But even more important here or
I guess even more obviously

40
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,740
to us, we saw that in the
experiment it's going to have

41
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,420
a lower standard deviation.

42
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,680
So they're all going to
have the same mean.

43
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,800
Let's say the mean here is,
I don't know, let's say

44
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,410
the mean here is 5.

45
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,350
Then the mean here is
also going to be 5.

46
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,600
The mean of our sampling
distribution of the sample

47
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,960
mean is going to be 5.

48
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,260
It doesn't matter
what our n is.

49
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,250
If our n is 20 it's
still going to be 5.

50
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,140
But our standard deviation
is going to be less than

51
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,670
either of these scenarios.

52
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,260
And we saw that just
by experimenting.

53
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,015
It might look like this.

54
00:01:58,015 --> 00:01:59,520
It's going to be more normal
but it's going to have a

55
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,350
tighter standard deviation.

56
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,160
So maybe it'll look like that.

57
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,810
And if we did it with an even
larger sample size-- let me do

58
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,770
that in a different color-- if
we did that with an even larger

59
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,430
sample size, n is equal to 100,
what we're going to get is

60
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,010
something that fits the normal
distribution even better.

61
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,820
We take a hundred instances
of this random variable,

62
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,230
average them, plot it.

63
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,730
A hundred instances of
this random variable,

64
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:23,600
average them, plot it.

65
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,230
And we just keep doing that.

66
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,510
If we keep doing that, what
we're going to have is

67
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,950
something that's even more
normal than either of these.

68
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,130
So it's going to be a much
closer fit to a true

69
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,480
normal distribution.

70
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,890
But even more obvious to
the human, it's going

71
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,650
to be even tighter.

72
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,640
So it's going to be a very
low standard deviation.

73
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,840
It's going to look
something like that.

74
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,760
And I'll show you on the
simulation app in the next or

75
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,710
probably later in this video.

76
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,680
So two things happen.

77
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,830
As you increase your sample
size for every time you

78
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,560
do the average, two
things are happening.

79
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,150
You're becoming more normal
and your standard deviation

80
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:57,970
is getting smaller.

81
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,810
So the question might
arise is there a formula?

82
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,680
So if I know the standard
deviation-- so this is my

83
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,990
standard deviation of just my
original probability density

84
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,910
function, this is the mean of
my original probability

85
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,800
density function.

86
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,320
So if I know the standard
deviation and I know n-- n is

87
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,330
going to change depending on
how many samples I'm taking

88
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:21,450
every time I do a sample mean--
if I know that my standard

89
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,870
deviation, or maybe if I
know my variance, right?

90
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,300
The variance to just the
standard deviation squared.

91
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,950
If you don't remember
that you might want to

92
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,640
review those videos.

93
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,450
But if I know the variance of
my original distribution and if

94
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:38,860
I know what my n is-- how many
samples I'm going to take every

95
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,620
time before I average them in
order to plot one thing in my

96
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,910
sampling distribution of my
sample mean-- is there a way to

97
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:50,700
predict what the mean of
these distributions are?

98
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,870
And so-- I'm sorry, the
standard deviation of

99
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,050
these distributions.

100
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,300
And so you don't get confused
between that and that,

101
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,190
let me say the variance.

102
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,560
If you know the variance
you can figure out the

103
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,570
standard deviation.

104
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,220
One is just the square
root of the other.

105
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:06,170
So this is the variance of
our original distribution.

106
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:09,300
Now to show that this is the
variance of our sampling

107
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,620
distribution of our sample mean
we'll write it right here.

108
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,430
This is the variance of our
mean of our sample mean.

109
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,470
Remember the sample--
our true mean is this.

110
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,100
The Greek letter Mu
is our true mean.

111
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:27,080
This is equal to the mean,
while an x a line over

112
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,350
it means sample mean.

113
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,300
   

114
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,110
So here what we're saying is
this is the variance of our

115
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,880
sample mean, that this is going
to be true distribution.

116
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,320
This isn't an estimate.

117
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,590
There's some-- you know, if we
magically knew distribution--

118
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,920
there's some true
variance here.

119
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,590
And of course the mean-- so
this has a mean-- this right

120
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,420
here, we can just get our
notation right, this is the

121
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,750
mean of the sampling
distribution of the

122
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,710
sampling mean.

123
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,870
So this is the mean
of our means.

124
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,830
It just happens to
be the same thing.

125
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,180
This is the mean of
our sample means.

126
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,410
It's going to be the same thing
as that, especially if we do

127
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,400
the trial over and over again.

128
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,490
But anyway, the point of this
video, is there any way to

129
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,600
figure out this variance given
the variance of the original

130
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,520
distribution and your n?

131
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,720
And it turns out there is.

132
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,230
And I'm not going to
do a proof here.

133
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,910
I really want to give you
the intuition of it.

134
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,830
I think you already do have the
sense that every trial you

135
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:26,010
take-- if you take a hundred,
you're much more likely when

136
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,140
you average those out, to get
close to the true mean than if

137
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,410
you took an n of
2 or an n of 5.

138
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,240
You're just very unlikely to be
far away, right, if you took

139
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,640
100 trials as opposed
to taking 5.

140
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,590
So I think you know that
in some way it should be

141
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,740
inversely proportional to n.

142
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,680
The larger your n the smaller
a standard deviation.

143
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,740
And actually it turns out it's
about as simple as possible.

144
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,740
It's one of those magical
things about mathematics.

145
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,110
And I'll prove it
to you one day.

146
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,690
I want to give you
working knowledge first.

147
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,390
In statistics, I'm always
struggling whether I should be

148
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,410
formal in giving you rigorous
proofs but I've kind of come to

149
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,220
the conclusion that it's more
important to get the working

150
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,010
knowledge first in statistics
and then later, once you've

151
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:05,010
gotten all of that down, we can
get into the real deep math

152
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,270
of it and prove it to you.

153
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,460
But I think experimental proofs
are kind of all you need for

154
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,110
right now, using those
simulations to show that

155
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,050
they're really true.

156
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,860
So it turns out that the
variance of your sampling

157
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,230
distribution of your sample
mean is equal to the

158
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,880
variance of your original
distribution-- that guy

159
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,310
right there-- divided by n.

160
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,300
That's all it is.

161
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,940
So if this up here has a
variance of-- let's say this up

162
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,640
here has a variance of 20-- I'm
just making that number up--

163
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,330
then let's say your n is 20.

164
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,850
Then the variance of your
sampling distribution of your

165
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,360
sample mean for an n of 20,
well you're just going to take

166
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,340
that, the variance up here--
your variance is 20--

167
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,840
divided by your n, 20.

168
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,780
So here your variance is
going to be 20 divided by

169
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,410
20 which is equal to 1.

170
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,230
This is the variance of
your original probability

171
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,860
distribution and
this is your n.

172
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,460
What's your standard
deviation going to be?

173
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,540
What's going to be the
square root of that, right?

174
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,870
Standard deviation is going
to be square root of 1.

175
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,410
Well that's also going to be 1.

176
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,090
So we could also write this.

177
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,040
We could take the square root
of both sides of this and say

178
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,830
the standard deviation of the
sampling distribution

179
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,800
standard-- the standard
deviation of the sampling

180
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,180
distribution of the sample mean
is often called the standard

181
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,550
deviation of the mean.

182
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,470
And it's also called-- I'm
going to write this down-- the

183
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,050
standard error of the mean.

184
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:27,810
   

185
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,230
All of these things that I just
mentioned, they all just mean

186
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,010
the standard deviation of the
sampling distribution

187
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:33,860
of the sample mean.

188
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,770
That's why this is confusing
because you use the word mean

189
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,080
and sample over and over again.

190
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,800
And if it confuses
you let me know.

191
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,030
I'll do another video or pause
and repeat or whatever.

192
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,000
But if we just take the square
root of both sides, the

193
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,770
standard error of the mean or
the standard deviation of the

194
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:50,300
sampling distribution of the
sample mean is equal to the

195
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,310
standard deviation of your
original function-- of your

196
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,580
original probability density
function-- which could be very

197
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,850
non-normal, divided by
the square root of n.

198
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:03,110
I just took the square root of
both sides of this equation.

199
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:07,090
I personally like to remember
this: that the variance is just

200
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,820
inversely proportional to n.

201
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,300
And then I like to
go back to this.

202
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,840
Because this is very
simple in my head.

203
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,790
You just take the
variance, divide it by n.

204
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,790
Oh and if I want the standard
deviation, I just take the

205
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:18,430
square roots of both sides
and I get this formula.

206
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:22,460
So here the standard
deviation-- when n is 20-- the

207
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,890
standard deviation of the
sampling distribution of the

208
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,210
sample mean is going to be 1.

209
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:31,530
Here when n is 100, our
variance here when

210
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,500
n is equal to 100.

211
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,230
So our variance of the sampling
mean of the sample distribution

212
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,580
or our variance of the mean--
of the sample mean, we

213
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,340
could say-- is going to be
equal to 20-- this guy's

214
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,290
variance-- divided by n.

215
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,950
So it equals-- n is
100-- so it equals 1/5.

216
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:50,730
Now this guy's standard
deviation or the standard

217
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,270
deviation of the sampling
distribution of the sample mean

218
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,760
or the standard error of the
mean is going to be the

219
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,480
square root of that.

220
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,780
So 1 over the square root of 5.

221
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:03,390
And so this guy's will be a
little bit under 1/2 the

222
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,060
standard deviation while
this guy had a standard

223
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:05,930
deviation of 1.

224
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,450
So you see, it's
definitely thinner.

225
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,140
Now I know what you're saying.

226
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,590
Well, Sal, you just gave
a formula, I don't

227
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,140
necessarily believe you.

228
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,610
Well let's see if we can
prove it to ourselves

229
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,960
using the simulation.

230
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,240
So just for fun let me make
a-- I'll just mess with this

231
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,670
distribution a little bit.

232
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,440
So that's my new distribution.

233
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,370
And let me take an n of-- let
me take two things that's easy

234
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,550
to take the square root of
because we're looking at

235
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,330
standard deviations.

236
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:33,830
So we take an n of
16 and an n of 25.

237
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,470
Let's do 10,000 trials.

238
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,490
So in this case every one of
the trials we're going to take

239
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,320
16 samples from here, average
them, plot it here, and

240
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,600
then do a frequency plot.

241
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,020
Here we're going to do 25 at a
time and then average them.

242
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,830
I'll do it once animated
just to remember.

243
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,620
So I'm taking 16
samples, plot it there.

244
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,500
I take 16 samples as described
by this probability density

245
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,960
function-- or 25 now,
plot it down here.

246
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:03,420
Now if I do that 10,000
times, what do I get?

247
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,710
All right, so here, just
visually you can tell just when

248
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,810
n was larger, the standard
deviation here is smaller.

249
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,020
This is more squeezed together.

250
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,490
But actually let's
write this stuff down.

251
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,420
Let's see if I can
remember it here.

252
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,370
So in this random distribution
I made my standard

253
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,160
deviation was 9.3.

254
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,460
I'm going to remember these.

255
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,470
Our standard deviation for
the original thing was 9.3.

256
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:27,980
And so standard deviation here
was 2.3 and the standard

257
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,590
deviation here is 1.87.

258
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:33,290
Let's see if it conforms
to our formula.

259
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,240
So I'm going to take this off
screen for a second and I'm

260
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,900
going to go back and
do some mathematics.

261
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,030
So I have this on my
other screen so I can

262
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,750
remember those numbers.

263
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:47,220
So in the trial we just did,
my wacky distribution had a

264
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:52,650
standard deviation of 9.3.

265
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:57,680
When n is equal to-- let me do
this in another color-- when n

266
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,900
was equal to 16, just doing the
experiment, doing a bunch of

267
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,460
trials and averaging and doing
all the things, we got the

268
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,070
standard deviation of the
sampling distribution of the

269
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,380
sample mean or the standard
error of the mean, we

270
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:15,570
experimentally determined
it to be 2.33.

271
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:21,500
And then when n is equal to 25
we got the standard error of

272
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,900
the mean being equal to 1.87.

273
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,330
Let's see if it conforms
to our formulas.

274
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:32,680
So we know that the variance or
we could almost say the

275
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,010
variance of the mean or the
standard error-- the variance

276
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:39,230
of the sampling distribution of
the sample mean is equal to the

277
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:42,050
variance of our original
distribution divided by n, take

278
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,490
the square roots of both sides,
and then you get the standard

279
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,770
error of the mean is equal to
the standard deviation of your

280
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,800
original distribution divided
by the square root of n.

281
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,350
So let's see if this works
out for these two things.

282
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:58,670
So if I were to take 9.3--
so let me do this case.

283
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:03,870
So 9.3 divided by the
square root of 16, right?

284
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,150
N is 16.

285
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,050
So divided by the square
root of 16, which is

286
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,300
4, what do I get?

287
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,566
So 9.3 divided by 4.

288
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:14,840
Let me get a little
calculator out here.

289
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,550
Let's see.

290
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:18,720
We have-- let me clear it
out-- we want to divide

291
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,000
9.3 divided by 4.

292
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,930
9.3 three divided by our
square root of n. n was 16.

293
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:32,060
So divided by 4 is
equal to 2.32.

294
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:41,540
So this is equal to 2.32 which
is pretty darn close to 2.33.

295
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,160
This was after 10,000 trials.

296
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,780
Maybe right after this I'll see
what happens if we did 20,000

297
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,960
or 30,000 trials where we take
samples of 16 and average them.

298
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,340
Now let's look at this.

299
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:55,400
Here we would take 9.3-- so let
me draw a little line here.

300
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,300
Let me scroll over,
that might be better.

301
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,340
So we take our standard
deviation of our

302
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,790
original distribution.

303
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:05,280
So just that formula that we've
derived right here would tell

304
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,180
us that our standard error
should be equal to the standard

305
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:13,350
deviation of our original
distribution, 9.3, divided by

306
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,400
the square root of n, divided
by the square root

307
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,380
of 25, right?

308
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,410
4 was just the
square root of 16.

309
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,860
So this is equal to
9.3 divided by 5.

310
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,820
And let's see if it's 1.87.

311
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,320
So let me get my
calculator back.

312
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:36,410
So if I take 9.3 divided
by 5, what do I get?

313
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:41,720
1.86 which is very
close to 1.87.

314
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:49,480
So we got in this case 1.86.

315
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,150
So as you can see what we got
experimentally was almost

316
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:56,010
exactly-- and this was after
10,000 trials-- of what

317
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:56,600
you would expect.

318
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,690
Let's do another 10,000.

319
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,220
So you've got another
10,000 trials.

320
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,550
Well we're still
in the ballpark.

321
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,920
We're not going to-- maybe I
can't hope to get the exact

322
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,350
number rounded or whatever.

323
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:10,690
But as you can see, hopefully
that'll be pretty satisfying to

324
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:14,410
you, that the variance of the
sampling distribution of the

325
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:21,500
sample mean is just going to be
equal to the variance of your

326
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,790
original distribution, no
matter how wacky that

327
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:27,370
distribution might be, divided
by your sample size-- by the

328
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:33,530
number of samples you take for
every basket that you average I

329
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,220
guess is the best way
to think about it.

330
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,710
You know, sometimes this can
get confusing because you are

331
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,275
taking samples of averages
based on samples.

332
00:14:40,275 --> 00:14:43,300
So when someone says sample
size, you're like, is sample

333
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,510
size the number of times I
took averages or the number

334
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,780
of things I'm taking
averages of each time?

335
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,160
And you know, it doesn't
hurt to clarify that.

336
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,790
Normally when they talk
about sample size

337
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,220
they're talking about n.

338
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,570
And, at least in my head, when
I think of the trials as you

339
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:00,700
take a sample size of 16, you
average it, that's the one

340
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,990
trial, and then you plot it.

341
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,680
Then you do it again and
you do another trial.

342
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,980
And you do it over
and over again.

343
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,930
But anyway, hopefully this
makes everything clear and then

344
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:11,340
you now also understand how to
get to the standard

345
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,750
error of the mean.

346
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,848
