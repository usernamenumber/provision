1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,650
   

2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,590
Let's see if we can get the
molecular structure for

3
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:04,840
butylcyclopentane.

4
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:11,050
   

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,980
So you just break this up the
way we've done it in the last

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,970
several videos, the suffix is
-ane, so it is an alkane, all

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,430
single bonds.

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,010
So single bonds.

9
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:29,930
It's pentane, so we're dealing
with five carbons on the base,

10
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,422
or on the backbone.

11
00:00:31,422 --> 00:00:35,360
So this is five carbons and it's
a cyclopentane, so it's

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,560
five carbons in a ring.

13
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,360
So its five-carbon ring is the
backbone, and then we have a

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,180
butyl group added to that
five-carbon ring.

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,630
Now, you might say, hey, Sal,
how do I know which

16
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,940
carbon to add it to?

17
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,330
When you're dealing with a ring
and you only have one

18
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,590
group on the ring, it
doesn't matter.

19
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:53,640
Let me just show you
what I mean.

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,140
So let's draw the five-carbon
ring.

21
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,280
Let's draw the cyclopentane.

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,630
So it'll just be a pentagon,
so one, two, three, four,

23
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,900
five, and it's a ring, so
you can connect them.

24
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,120
One, two, three, four, five.

25
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,580
Now, it doesn't matter where
I draw the butyl group.

26
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,060
It's all symmetric
around there.

27
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,710
We just have a ring and it's
connected to a butyl group at

28
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:14,200
some point.

29
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,410
It'll start to matter once we
add more than one group.

30
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,660
So we can just pick any of
these carbons to add

31
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,890
the butyl group to.

32
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,450
Now, just as a review, the but-
prefix, that refers to,

33
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,520
remember, methyl, ethyl,
propyl, or meth-,

34
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,970
eth-, prop-, but-.

35
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,800
This is four carbons.

36
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,780
This is a four-carbon
alkyl group.

37
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,110
So let me just add it here.

38
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,760
I could have added it to any of
these carbons around this

39
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,870
cyclopentane ring.

40
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,960
So if I just add it right here,
so I'm going to have

41
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,810
four carbons.

42
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:48,170
So one, two, three, four.

43
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,290
That is the butyl part
of this whole thing.

44
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,120
And then let me just
attach them up.

45
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,170
So you might be tempted to just
draw this right there.

46
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,640
And actually, this
would be right.

47
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,500
This is butylcyclopentane.

48
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,390
But a question might arise.

49
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:07,030
I just happened to connect the
cyclopentane to the butyl at

50
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,150
this first carbon on the
butyl right there.

51
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,080
I could have just as easily
done it like this.

52
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,300
   

53
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:21,570
I could have just as easily had
it like this, where-- let

54
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:27,540
me draw my butyl again, so I
have one, two, three, four.

55
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,370
So, once again, this is a butyl,
but instead of being

56
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,380
bonded to the cyclopentane on
my first carbon, maybe it's

57
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,490
bonded right here.

58
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,570
Let me do it with that
yellow color.

59
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,240
Maybe it's bonded right here.

60
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,150
This seems like maybe
this could also be

61
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,630
butylcyclopentane.

62
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,440
It looks like we have
a butyl group.

63
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,700
This is a butyl right here.

64
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,840
I drew a butyl group right over
here, and I also drew a

65
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,260
butyl group right over here.

66
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,470
But these are fundamentally
two different molecular

67
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,000
structures.

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,430
I'm touching the first
carbon here.

69
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,850
I'm touching the second
carbon over here.

70
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,770
Now, there's two ways to
differentiate this.

71
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,760
One is the common naming and one
is the systematic naming.

72
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,650
So let me differentiate
between the two.

73
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,860
So in the common naming, and
this can get a little bit

74
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,930
involved, and this frankly is
probably the most complicated

75
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,020
part of naming organic
compounds.

76
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,540
Systematic is often more
complicated, but it's easier

77
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,720
to systematically
come up with it.

78
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,075
So there's a common and then
there's a systematic.

79
00:03:30,075 --> 00:03:35,010
   

80
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,440
So the common way of doing
it is, if you just say

81
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,020
butylcyclopentane, that implies
that you are bonding

82
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,230
to the first or, depending on
how you view it, the last

83
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,070
carbon in the chain.

84
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,940
So this right here is
butylcyclopentane.

85
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,170
This right here is not just
butylcyclopentane.

86
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:54,110
What you would do is you
definitely have a cyclopentane

87
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,360
ring, so this would definitely
be a cyclopentane.

88
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,860
   

89
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,620
Let me put some space here.

90
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,320
This is definitely going
to be a cyclopentane.

91
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,970
   

92
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:11,690
And you do have a butyl group
on it, so we do have a butyl

93
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:17,880
group, but because we are
bonded-- we aren't bonded to

94
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,490
the first carbon.

95
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,529
We're bonded to a carbon
that is bonded

96
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:21,829
to two other carbons.

97
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:22,810
We call this

98
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:29,550
sec-butylcyclopentane, so this is sec-.

99
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,960
And everything I'm doing
is obviously free-hand.

100
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,120
If you were to see this in
a book, the sec- would be

101
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,370
italicized, or sometimes
it would be written as

102
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,620
s-butylcyclopentane.

103
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:48,770
   

104
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:51,970
And this sec- means that we have
attached to a carbon that

105
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,440
is touching two other carbons.

106
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,090
So you look at the butyl group,
and say, well, which of

107
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,270
these carbons is attached
to two others?

108
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,740
It's either that one
or that one.

109
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,830
And regardless of whether you're
attached to this or

110
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,680
this, if you think about it,
it's fundamentally the same

111
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,050
molecular structure.

112
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,920
So that's what you do when
you're attached to that guy

113
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,460
right over there.

114
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,400
But what about the situation
where we're dealing with just

115
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,840
the common names right here?

116
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,960
What about the situation where
it looks like this?

117
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,430
So we have our cyclopentane
right there, and we have a-- I

118
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,960
guess we could call
it a butyl group.

119
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,040
It'll have four carbons in it,
but let's say that the four

120
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,780
carbons look something
like this.

121
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:30,190
Let's say there are four
carbons, so we have one, two,

122
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:36,040
three, four carbons and
we're bonded to this

123
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,930
one right over here.

124
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,260
So whenever you're bonded to
one end of the four-carbon

125
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:46,860
group and it branches off at the
other end, and it seems a

126
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,660
little complicated, this only
deals for alkyl groups below

127
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:55,290
five or six carbons, this we
call an isobutyl group.

128
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,370
So let me write this down.

129
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:02,920
So this right here, is
sec-butyl, or s-butyl

130
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,100
sometimes for short.

131
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,750
This right here, this right
there is iso-butyl.

132
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,680
   

133
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,030
It's actually-- iso- that
is an iso-butyl group.

134
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,710
And then the last thing to
worry about when you're

135
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,020
dealing with butyl groups
is something like this.

136
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,960
   

137
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,350
Let me draw it.

138
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,160
So you could also draw four
carbons like this.

139
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,910
You have one carbon,
two, three, four.

140
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,200
One, two, three, four carbons
and you're attached over here.

141
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,160
Now this naming, this group
right here-- and you're going

142
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,800
see the systematic
naming is much

143
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,480
easier for these compounds.

144
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,350
This group right here, over
here the carbon you're

145
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,920
attached to is attached
to two other

146
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,410
carbons, so it is sec-butyl.

147
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,820
When you're attached to three
carbons, it is t-butyl, or

148
00:06:52,820 --> 00:07:00,390
tert-butyl, so this right here
is a tert-butyl group, or

149
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,170
sometimes called a t-butyl.

150
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,630
And I really want you
to understand

151
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,200
the difference here.

152
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,000
The common naming, it's easier
to say and easier to spell,

153
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,560
but it's sometimes a
little confusing.

154
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,390
This is just straight up butyl
so you would call this

155
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,380
butylcyclopentane.

156
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,110
This is sec-butyl, because
you have this guy

157
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,670
connected to two carbons.

158
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:21,210
That's where the sec-
comes from.

159
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,290
Sometimes it'll be s-butyl.

160
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:27,570
So this could be called
sec-butylcyclopentane or

161
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,500
s-butylcyclopentane.

162
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,660
This, because we're attached
to the end away from this

163
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,240
branching off, is still a butyl
group, since we have

164
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,670
four carbons.

165
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,650
But since we're attached here,
this is iso-butyl, so this is

166
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,770
iso-butylcyclopentane,

167
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:44,350
And then finally, since the
carbon we're attaching to is

168
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:48,730
attached to one, two, three
other carbons, it is a

169
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,750
tert-butyl or a t-butyl group.

170
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,070
So this is t-butylcyclopentane.

171
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,630
That's the common naming.

172
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,890
So maybe I should clear out
systematic here just so it's

173
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:01,410
clear to you that everything
we've done

174
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,820
here is common naming.

175
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,675
So let me write it down.

176
00:08:05,675 --> 00:08:08,670
It won't hurt to write them down
again because the more

177
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,490
familiar you are with
these, the better.

178
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,740
So this is just
butylcyclopentane.

179
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:18,970
   

180
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,410
This is s- or sec-
butylcyclopentane.

181
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:26,620
   

182
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,330
And this is
iso-butylcyclopentane.

183
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:37,440
   

184
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,990
I'm going off the screen here.

185
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,230
And then finally, this
is tert-butyl, or

186
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,480
t-butylcyclopentane.

187
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,680
   

188
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,100
Now, I said these are
the common naming.

189
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,900
What are the systematic
naming?

190
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,080
Well, in the systematic, this
is still butylcyclopentane.

191
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,240
So let me write this down.

192
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:01,110
Systematic, this is still

193
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,940
butylcyclopentane, which makes sense.

194
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,850
This is very clearly
a cyclopentane.

195
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,040
This is very clearly
a butyl group.

196
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,120
But in the systematic naming,
what we try to do is we try to

197
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,900
name this group right here
just as we would name a

198
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,600
traditional chain, but we
ended it with an -yl.

199
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,760
So if you look at this right
here, what we do is we just

200
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,180
consider the chain
where we attach.

201
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:30,730
We attached over here, so the
longest chain from that point

202
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,600
is there and there.

203
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,540
So if you look at it like that,
it looks like you have

204
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,550
one, two, three carbons, and you
have one carbon attached

205
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,220
on the beginning.

206
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,870
So this little group right here
in the systematic naming,

207
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,890
this looks like a
one, two, three.

208
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:49,520
Three carbons, that's the prop-
prefix, so we're dealing

209
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,910
with a prop-, and it's all going
to be one group, so it's

210
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,840
a propyl group.

211
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,330
This is a propyl group, but it
has a methyl-- remember, meth-

212
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,500
is one carbon.

213
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,870
It has a methyl group attached
on the first carbon.

214
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,435
So this is 1-methylpropyl.

215
00:10:05,435 --> 00:10:11,500
   

216
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,130
Now, that describes
just the group.

217
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:18,970
1-methylpropyl describes just
this part right here.

218
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,870
That describes just that
right over there.

219
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,120
And then to have the whole
compound, to describe the

220
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,550
whole compound, you put this in
parentheses, so this is the

221
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,180
systematic naming.

222
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,040
So 1-methyl-- I put
an L there.

223
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,490
Let me do it in the
same color.

224
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:38,550
1-methyl, because
you're starting

225
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,850
where you're attaching.

226
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:43,810
So 1-methyl, you have a methyl
group right there on that

227
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:44,420
first carbon.

228
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,600
It's a propyl chain.

229
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,800
One, two, three, propyl,
and then you would say

230
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,050
cyclopentane.

231
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:54,130
   

232
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,540
That's the systematic
name for that.

233
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,200
Now if you look at this one
right here, and the common

234
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,650
name is iso-butyl, what
you do is you

235
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,520
look at where we attach.

236
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,110
Where we attached is one,
two, three carbons.

237
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,940
So once again, I'm doing that
same one, two, three carbons.

238
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,260
So once again, this
is a propyl.

239
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:19,210
Prop- is for three, but with a
methyl group now is attached

240
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:23,370
to the one, two, the
second carbon.

241
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,330
So this is 2-methyl.

242
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,460
Let me make some space here.

243
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,710
This is 2-methyl.

244
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,960
   

245
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,500
So that describes this
group right here.

246
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,640
That describes this entire
group cyclopentane.

247
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,600
   

248
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,490
Remember, this is a
systematic name.

249
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,230
You might sometimes see
this referred to as

250
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:47,430
iso-butylcyclopentane or
2-methylpropylcyclopentane.

251
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,890
And this is actually a -yl.

252
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,530
I spelled it wrong.

253
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:53,690
And then finally, we do the same
exact idea here, but it

254
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,510
becomes a little bit
more interesting.

255
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:59,520
Over here, we are attached to
this carbon and the longest

256
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,190
chain I can do starting with
that carbon is just one chain

257
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,730
right there.

258
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,640
So we just have a two-carbon
chain, right?

259
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,630
One, two.

260
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:11,360
The prefix for a two carbon
is ethyl, or eth-.

261
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,640
Eth-, and since it's
a group, ethyl.

262
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:22,970
And then we have two methyl
groups attached right over

263
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,750
there, and it's attached on
the one carbon, right?

264
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,180
This is one and this is two.

265
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,560
We call the one carbon
where we are attached

266
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,910
to the broader chain.

267
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:34,080
So what this is going to be, you
would actually write one

268
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,960
comma one to show that we have
two groups attached to the

269
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,050
first carbon and both
of them are methyl.

270
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:44,975
So we write 1,1-dimethyl,
di- for two, dimethyl.

271
00:12:44,975 --> 00:12:48,120
   

272
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,680
So this entire group right here,
which we also called

273
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,990
t-butyl, in systematic
naming is 1,1-.

274
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,020
We have two groups attached
to this first carbon.

275
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,270
1,1-dimethylethyl.

276
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,780
   

277
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,720
That's this whole thing.

278
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,580
This is the ethyl, and then we
have two methyls attached

279
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,930
there. that's why
we write 1,1-.

280
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:04,940
They're both attached
to the one.

281
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,320
We have two of them.

282
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,290
That's why we wrote
di- over there.

283
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:12,135
So it's 1,1-dimethylethyl- and
then finally, cyclopentane.

284
00:13:12,135 --> 00:13:15,070
   

285
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,750
So hopefully, that doesn't
confuse you too much.

286
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,640
I think if you watch the video
over and over and try to

287
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,900
practice it with your own
problems, you'll see that the

288
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,530
systematic name way is actually

289
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,770
pretty, pretty logical.

290
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,570
And actually, if you have more
than five or six carbons in

291
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,460
the group, they always or they
tend to always use the

292
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,710
systematic naming.

293
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,933
