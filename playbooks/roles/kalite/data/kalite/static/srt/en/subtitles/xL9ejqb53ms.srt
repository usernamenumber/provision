1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,846
In the last video on the Drake equation

2
00:00:02,846 --> 00:00:04,625
we tried out some numbers

3
00:00:04,625 --> 00:00:05,929
we just made some assumptions

4
00:00:05,929 --> 00:00:07,785
that seemed reasonable at least to me

5
00:00:07,785 --> 00:00:10,805
and we got that there should be 12.5

6
00:00:10,805 --> 00:00:14,569
detectable civilizations in the Milky Way Galaxy

7
00:00:14,569 --> 00:00:16,098
and I've talked about a bunch of reasons

8
00:00:16,098 --> 00:00:18,267
about why we are not detecting them

9
00:00:18,267 --> 00:00:20,846
but I left out one of the most obvious reasons

10
00:00:20,846 --> 00:00:21,836
that we are not detecting them

11
00:00:21,836 --> 00:00:24,123
and it was rightfully pointed out in the comments

12
00:00:24,123 --> 00:00:25,523
bellow that video

13
00:00:25,523 --> 00:00:27,790
and thats just the signal might be too weak

14
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,144
if theres 12.5

15
00:00:29,144 --> 00:00:34,129
if there's on the order of 10, 11, 12 detectable

16
00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:35,713
civilizations in our galaxy

17
00:00:35,713 --> 00:00:37,667
they could be quite far from us

18
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:39,056
this isn't the Milky Way

19
00:00:39,056 --> 00:00:40,964
but this is a galaxy that probably doesn't look

20
00:00:40,964 --> 00:00:42,379
too different from our Milky Way

21
00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:44,652
we could obviously never get this vantage point

22
00:00:44,652 --> 00:00:46,179
of our galaxy

23
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,764
well at least not for a while

24
00:00:47,764 --> 00:00:50,052
not unless we can travel quite far away from it

25
00:00:50,052 --> 00:00:52,313
but lets say we are over here

26
00:00:52,313 --> 00:00:55,277
you could imagine if the ten civilizations

27
00:00:55,277 --> 00:00:57,333
or the twelve civilizations are

28
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:01,087
here, one, two, three, four

29
00:01:01,087 --> 00:01:02,738
there's probably a lot more at the center actually

30
00:01:02,738 --> 00:01:04,975
because that's where our density is higher

31
00:01:04,975 --> 00:01:05,969
so let me put it here

32
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:10,585
so one, two, three, four, five, six, seven

33
00:01:10,585 --> 00:01:14,267
eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve

34
00:01:14,267 --> 00:01:16,795
the closest of them might be

35
00:01:16,795 --> 00:01:19,877
tens of thousands of light years away from us

36
00:01:19,877 --> 00:01:21,779
and there might be a lot of stuff in between

37
00:01:21,779 --> 00:01:23,559
all sorts of crazy things happening

38
00:01:23,559 --> 00:01:25,267
stars exploding

39
00:01:25,267 --> 00:01:27,036
all sorts of signals that we are receiving

40
00:01:27,036 --> 00:01:27,867
and it might just be

41
00:01:27,867 --> 00:01:29,754
that the signals from those civilizations

42
00:01:29,754 --> 00:01:31,775
are too weak to reach us

43
00:01:31,775 --> 00:01:34,862
or that there is too much interference

44
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:36,098
from all of the other craziness

45
00:01:36,098 --> 00:01:37,944
that's happening around the galaxy

46
00:01:37,944 --> 00:01:39,118
there's also these other reasons

47
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:40,585
that I've talked about in the last video

48
00:01:40,585 --> 00:01:42,477
maybe they've gone beyond

49
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:45,979
using radio as a form of communication

50
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:47,462
and thats why..

51
00:01:47,462 --> 00:01:49,148
or they never used it to begin with

52
00:01:49,148 --> 00:01:50,569
and that's why we don't even see them

53
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:51,579
ever using it

54
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:53,354
or they used if for a very short period

55
00:01:53,354 --> 00:01:54,600
a kind of transition period

56
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,646
and maybe in a hundred years we'll discover the next best thing

57
00:01:57,646 --> 00:02:02,748
the other idea behind why we're probably

58
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:06,338
or maybe why we might not be able to detect civilizations

59
00:02:06,338 --> 00:02:07,082
is that

60
00:02:07,082 --> 00:02:09,436
well there might be a lot fewer than ten

61
00:02:09,436 --> 00:02:11,908
when I did the Drake equation right over here

62
00:02:11,908 --> 00:02:13,333
I just made a bunch of assumptions

63
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,354
none of these seemed crazy

64
00:02:14,354 --> 00:02:18,200
but I assumed a reality

65
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,000
where you didn't have these kind of cataclysmic events

66
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,431
in the galaxy at regular intervals

67
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:28,692
but we know there are cataclysmic events

68
00:02:28,692 --> 00:02:30,785
that happen in our galaxy

69
00:02:30,785 --> 00:02:32,015
in other galaxies

70
00:02:32,015 --> 00:02:33,979
the one we know the most about

71
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:35,867
although there are all sorts of things that we

72
00:02:35,867 --> 00:02:36,918
don't know much about

73
00:02:36,918 --> 00:02:38,267
are gamma ray bursts

74
00:02:38,267 --> 00:02:41,179
and these are still kind of trying to be understood

75
00:02:41,179 --> 00:02:46,236
GAMMA RAY BURSTS

76
00:02:46,236 --> 00:02:48,005
and you can watch the video on quasars

77
00:02:48,005 --> 00:02:52,010
those are essentially of highly energetic rays

78
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,098
being released when all this material

79
00:02:54,098 --> 00:02:58,508
is being kind of absorbed into super massive black holes

80
00:02:58,523 --> 00:02:59,985
at the centers of galaxies

81
00:02:59,985 --> 00:03:03,267
that tend to be very very very often

82
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:04,492
billions of light years away

83
00:03:04,492 --> 00:03:07,538
and gamma rays are one of the things that get emitted from those

84
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:10,856
but you can also have gamma ray bursts within galaxies

85
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:14,308
we believe maybe certain types of stars when they collapse

86
00:03:14,308 --> 00:03:15,877
into black holes

87
00:03:15,877 --> 00:03:17,477
you have this burst of gamma rays

88
00:03:17,477 --> 00:03:20,144
there might be certain kinds of neutron stars

89
00:03:20,144 --> 00:03:22,596
with the right properties that might every now and then

90
00:03:22,596 --> 00:03:23,729
release gamma rays

91
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:25,267
and the view is

92
00:03:25,267 --> 00:03:28,246
is that if there is a civilization

93
00:03:28,246 --> 00:03:31,575
that is within a few thousand light years

94
00:03:31,575 --> 00:03:35,733
near one of these gamma ray bursts

95
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:36,713
and its in wrong place

96
00:03:36,713 --> 00:03:38,554
its kind of in the path of the burst

97
00:03:38,554 --> 00:03:42,231
then its a good chance that those civilizations will

98
00:03:42,231 --> 00:03:43,646
be completely wiped out

99
00:03:43,646 --> 00:03:45,471
that those planets will become sterilized

100
00:03:45,471 --> 00:03:47,692
because there is so much radiation

101
00:03:47,692 --> 00:03:49,487
coming out from that gamma ray

102
00:03:49,487 --> 00:03:51,302
there's even some theories

103
00:03:51,302 --> 00:03:55,005
that some of the extinction events that have happened in Earth's history

104
00:03:55,005 --> 00:03:56,769
we are not talking about the dinosaurs

105
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,415
we are talking about billions of years ago

106
00:03:58,415 --> 00:03:59,523
maybe a billion years ago

107
00:03:59,523 --> 00:04:00,662
or two billion years ago

108
00:04:00,662 --> 00:04:02,964
that these might have been caused by

109
00:04:02,964 --> 00:04:05,744
relatively local gamma ray bursts

110
00:04:05,744 --> 00:04:08,169
the theory is that these might hit earth

111
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:10,698
on the order of once every billion years

112
00:04:10,698 --> 00:04:13,800
and if you think about the galaxy as a whole

113
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,333
we're kind of in..

114
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:19,077
our solar system is orbiting the galaxy

115
00:04:19,077 --> 00:04:21,795
its kind of a nice distance from the center of the galaxy

116
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:23,513
the closer you get into the center

117
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,729
the higher densities of stars you have

118
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:28,959
so you can imagine if earth gets hit with

119
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,200
one of these gamma rays bursts

120
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,769
every couple of billion years

121
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:35,569
you can imagine something closer the center of the galaxy

122
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:38,329
gets hit with these gamma ray bursts

123
00:04:38,329 --> 00:04:40,200
much much much more frequently

124
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,867
just because there is more activity there

125
00:04:41,867 --> 00:04:43,621
there are more stars that are closer by

126
00:04:43,621 --> 00:04:44,964
more stars that are aging

127
00:04:44,964 --> 00:04:47,308
more stars that might be collapsing into black holes

128
00:04:47,308 --> 00:04:50,221
so the simple answer is we don't know

129
00:04:50,221 --> 00:04:53,077
there could be a thousand civilizations out there

130
00:04:53,077 --> 00:04:55,810
and we're not sophisticated enough to notice them just yet

131
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,733
or there might be very very few

132
00:04:57,733 --> 00:04:59,871
because all of this craziness that happens

133
00:04:59,871 --> 00:05:01,554
in the galaxy

134
00:05:01,554 --> 00:05:03,359
or who knows there might be none

135
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,795
although I find that kind of...

136
00:05:04,795 --> 00:05:06,502
that's not too exciting

137
00:05:06,502 --> 99:59:59,999
so I try not to think about that one
