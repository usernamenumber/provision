00:00:00,757 --> 00:00:05,803
In the last video, I showed that a bunch of triangles are similar to each other to come up with a relationship

2
00:00:05,803 --> 00:00:11,353
between the focal length, the distance of an object from the convex lens,

3
00:00:11,353 --> 00:00:16,305
and the distance of the image of an object from that convex lens.

4
00:00:16,305 --> 00:00:20,551
And I realize that there is one extra low hanging fruit based on all of the geometry that I had done

5
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:27,143
Another relationship that might come in useful, and that's the relationship between the size of the objects.

6
00:00:27,143 --> 00:00:31,966
maybe we set the arrow here, we call it the height of the object

7
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:36,898
And the height of the image

8
00:00:36,898 --> 00:00:39,233
We did, we really setup everything already.

9
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:44,314
We already figure out, that this triangle over here,

10
00:00:44,314 --> 00:00:47,573
is similar to this triangle down here

11
00:00:47,573 --> 00:00:54,432
And we figured out the in last video, that this triangle over here is similar to this triangle over here

12
00:00:54,432 --> 00:00:59,308
And since these two are similar, we can say that A is to B

13
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:00,914
We did this over here, I will rewrite it

14
00:01:00,914 --> 00:01:03,679
A is to B as

15
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:09,462
Both of those are the sides opposite the right angles of these 2 simlar triangles,

16
00:01:09,462 --> 00:01:12,780
So that's going to be the same thing as the ratio of the sides

17
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,625
opposite this yellow angle right over here.

18
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:21,284
so, this triangle over here, since we started with A first,

19
00:01:21,284 --> 00:01:23,563
is this height, right over here.

20
00:01:23,563 --> 00:01:25,331
Now, what is this height right over here?

21
00:01:25,331 --> 00:01:31,946
This is the height of the object.

22
00:01:31,946 --> 00:01:32,447
Is to

23
00:01:32,447 --> 00:01:35,994
Now, what is this opposite side of this yellow angle right over here

24
00:01:35,994 --> 00:01:40,249
This is the height of the image.

25
00:01:40,249 --> 00:01:43,162
Or, we know from the last video

26
00:01:43,162 --> 00:01:45,018
the distance of the object to the distance of the image

27
00:01:45,018 --> 00:01:46,930
is the same thing as A to B

28
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,946
So this is going to be the same thing as this

29
00:01:49,946 --> 00:01:54,703
So, the ratio of the distances is also the same thing as the ratio of their heights

30
00:01:54,703 --> 00:01:56,267
so let me write it this way

31
00:01:56,267 --> 00:02:01,145
The ratio of the distance from the object to the lens

32
00:02:01,145 --> 00:02:04,828
to the distance from the image to the lens is the same

33
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:09,952
as the ratio of the height of the object to the height of the image

34
00:02:09,952 --> 00:02:12,080
or, to the image of that object

35
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,369
So I just want to do the low hanging fruit here

36
00:02:14,369 --> 00:02:17,479
since we had already done all of the...

37
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,229
We had setup all of the mechanics already.

38
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:22,000
Anyway, hope you found this useful.
