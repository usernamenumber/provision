1
00:00:00,143 --> 00:00:01,454
So in my "Sphereflakes" video,

2
00:00:01,454 --> 00:00:03,176
I joked about folding and cutting space-time.

3
00:00:03,176 --> 00:00:05,214
But then I thought, "Hey, why not?"

4
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:07,188
So, uh, how do you do that?

5
00:00:07,188 --> 00:00:09,491
Well, when we wanted to fold and cut only space,

6
00:00:09,491 --> 00:00:11,575
we chose a medium that takes place in space –

7
00:00:11,575 --> 00:00:14,158
that is static paper cutouts, or a sphere sculpture.

8
00:00:14,158 --> 00:00:15,882
But to fold and cut time,

9
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:18,687
we need a medium that happens over time.

10
00:00:18,687 --> 00:00:20,580
I choose music.

11
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,024
Music has two easily recognizable dimensions.

12
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:24,063
One is 'time,'

13
00:00:24,063 --> 00:00:25,594
and the other is 'pitch-space' –

14
00:00:25,594 --> 00:00:27,228
not quite the same as space-space,

15
00:00:27,228 --> 00:00:28,356
but it's one-dimensional –

16
00:00:28,356 --> 00:00:30,108
which makes things easier.

17
00:00:30,108 --> 00:00:32,064
But let's not get confused with the notation.

18
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:33,037
There are a few things to notice

19
00:00:33,037 --> 00:00:36,151
about written music – firstly, that it's not music.

20
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:37,195
You can't listen to this.

21
00:00:37,195 --> 00:00:39,089
Or, well, you can. But it'll be like –

22
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:42,506
[Sounds of paper being loudly rustled with fingers.]

23
00:00:42,506 --> 00:00:43,401
It's not music. It's music notation.

24
00:00:44,432 --> 00:00:45,679
And you can only interpret it

25
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,777
into the beautiful music it represents.

26
00:00:47,777 --> 00:00:50,478
Kind of like how a book is squiggles on a page

27
00:00:50,478 --> 00:00:52,943
that your brain interprets into a meaningful story.

28
00:00:52,943 --> 00:00:54,648
And maybe don't understand it at all,

29
00:00:54,648 --> 00:00:55,503
or you understand just a literal

30
00:00:55,503 --> 00:00:57,083
surface meaning of the action.

31
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:58,683
Or maybe you can read deep and critically

32
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,364
into a story that simple on the surface,

33
00:01:00,364 --> 00:01:02,903
and get more from it than even the author intended.

34
00:01:02,903 --> 00:01:04,702
Math is like this too.

35
00:01:04,702 --> 00:01:06,154
Secondly, written music represents

36
00:01:06,154 --> 00:01:08,407
a two-dimensional space of pitch and time,

37
00:01:08,407 --> 00:01:10,712
but only represents it.

38
00:01:10,712 --> 00:01:13,768
Like there's the suggestion that this is the time axis.

39
00:01:13,768 --> 00:01:14,715
But it's not.

40
00:01:14,715 --> 00:01:17,291
This is exactly the same as this, even though

41
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:19,317
you're changing the values on the x-axis –

42
00:01:19,317 --> 00:01:21,178
at least in standard music notation.

43
00:01:21,178 --> 00:01:22,986
Some more modern composers do make use

44
00:01:22,986 --> 00:01:25,235
of spatial notation – just like some poets

45
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:26,878
do intentionally stretch out words

46
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,404
or play with formatting.

47
00:01:28,404 --> 00:01:30,377
But in standard notation, a stretched out word

48
00:01:30,377 --> 00:01:31,817
only means your text editor

49
00:01:31,817 --> 00:01:33,786
is terrible at justifying margins –

50
00:01:33,786 --> 00:01:36,147
and has nothing to do with the word itself.

51
00:01:36,147 --> 00:01:38,108
Pitch also doesn't entirely depend

52
00:01:38,108 --> 00:01:40,480
on the notes placed on the y-axis.

53
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,507
So I'm going to use something

54
00:01:41,507 --> 00:01:43,423
a little closer to reality.

55
00:01:43,423 --> 00:01:45,793
I've got this music box that plays a paper tape.

56
00:01:45,793 --> 00:01:46,998
As you put the strip through the box,

57
00:01:46,998 --> 00:01:49,510
it plays the punched holes.

58
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,420
[Ascending notes play one after another.]

59
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,384
Hold on. It's too quiet.

60
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,514
This is why music boxes

61
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:55,316
usually come attached to wooden boxes.

62
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:56,840
I don't have a wooden box.

63
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,930
Maybe this nice wooden bowl.

64
00:01:58,930 --> 00:01:59,875
Umm.

65
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:03,230
[Sound of a small drill going through thin wood.]

66
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,902
Ahh! There we go. Music bowl.

67
00:02:05,902 --> 00:02:08,269
Anyway. Here, distance along the strip does translate

68
00:02:08,269 --> 00:02:12,290
directly to time, assuming constant crank speed.

69
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:20,078
[Ascending tones being played.]

70
00:02:20,078 --> 00:02:23,330
The box also has a set C-major scale on one staff.

71
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,286
So pitch space is represented pretty directly.

72
00:02:26,286 --> 00:02:28,029
You don't have to worry about sharps and flats,

73
00:02:28,029 --> 00:02:29,624
or the space between staves,

74
00:02:29,624 --> 00:02:31,160
or the infinite possibilities

75
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,834
on the continuous logarithmic frequency scale.

76
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:36,856
The box magically ignores all notational elements

77
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:39,374
except for where and when the holes are.

78
00:02:39,374 --> 00:02:40,677
Each hole, each note,

79
00:02:40,677 --> 00:02:43,073
is a point on this strip of space-time.

80
00:02:43,073 --> 00:02:44,825
So now let's fold it and cut it.

81
00:02:44,825 --> 00:02:46,545
It's easy to fold time so that it goes

82
00:02:46,545 --> 00:02:49,051
both forwards and backwards simultaneously.

83
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:51,305
Then we can punch in some notes and unfold it into

84
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:52,591
a symmetric melody that goes

85
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:54,439
first forwards and then backwards –

86
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:55,897
or first backwards and then forwards.

87
00:02:55,897 --> 00:02:57,291
Point is it's reversible.

88
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,660
It sounds the same whether you play it like this –

89
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:07,213
[Ascending tones being played.]

90
00:03:07,213 --> 00:03:14,890
[Descending tones being played.]

91
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,706
Or like this.

92
00:03:16,706 --> 00:03:28,864
[Ascending tones being played.]

93
00:03:28,864 --> 00:03:30,383
But maybe you'll want to fold time

94
00:03:30,383 --> 00:03:32,426
into one finite chunk.

95
00:03:32,426 --> 00:03:33,901
Then you could put two mirror lines

96
00:03:33,901 --> 00:03:35,402
which reflect themselves – which means

97
00:03:35,402 --> 00:03:38,042
folding time back and forth infinitely

98
00:03:38,042 --> 00:03:40,192
to get a little time chunk to cut up.

99
00:03:40,192 --> 00:03:42,569
And sometimes cutting through infinitely folded

100
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:45,163
space-time requires the use of power tools.

101
00:03:45,163 --> 00:03:47,004
But then you can unfold a repeating

102
00:03:47,004 --> 00:03:50,228
back and forth musicky thing.

103
00:03:50,228 --> 00:04:08,878
[Many tones being played.]

104
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:10,568
Or you could leave time alone and fold space,

105
00:04:10,568 --> 00:04:11,940
if that's what you're into.

106
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,361
And that sounds like this.

107
00:04:14,361 --> 00:04:21,059
[Tones being played.]

108
00:04:21,059 --> 00:04:23,665
Or you could do both.

109
00:04:23,665 --> 00:04:33,984
[Tones being played.]

110
00:04:33,984 --> 00:04:36,105
Maybe you could try folding at other angles,

111
00:04:36,105 --> 00:04:38,525
but now you're mixing up the space and time axes.

112
00:04:38,525 --> 00:04:41,138
And mixing space with time is hazardous.

113
00:04:41,138 --> 00:04:44,219
Though you could flip both space and time,

114
00:04:44,219 --> 00:04:46,750
which is like rotating the music 180 degrees.

115
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,667
This one is especially fun,

116
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:49,856
because you can rotate any piece of sheet music

117
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,645
and try playing it upside down.

118
00:04:51,645 --> 00:04:52,749
And it's not just upside down,

119
00:04:52,749 --> 00:04:54,393
but backwards in time too.

120
00:04:54,393 --> 00:05:09,592
[Music tones being played.]

121
00:05:09,592 --> 00:05:10,777
Anyway, maybe you want patterns

122
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,557
that aren't all mirror lines.

123
00:05:12,557 --> 00:05:15,215
Like what about a simple repeating melody?

124
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:16,922
Can we fold and cut that?

125
00:05:16,922 --> 00:05:19,492
Yes. Loop up the paper cut then unfold.

126
00:05:19,492 --> 00:05:21,909
Or if you're feeling snazzy, do the melody once,

127
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:23,482
then loop the paper through the box.

128
00:05:23,482 --> 00:05:26,963
[Tones being played.]

129
00:05:26,963 --> 00:05:29,244
This is probably the part where seasoned viewers

130
00:05:29,244 --> 00:05:31,298
will be yelling something about Mobius strips.

131
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:32,581
In the first snowflakes video,

132
00:05:32,581 --> 00:05:34,619
I did fold up a Mobius strip and cut it.

133
00:05:34,619 --> 00:05:36,194
Okay. Here's what happens.

134
00:05:36,194 --> 00:05:38,738
The strip unravels to give you your shapes

135
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:41,294
and then they repeat – but upside down.

136
00:05:41,294 --> 00:05:42,947
And then they repeat, but flipped again.

137
00:05:42,947 --> 00:05:44,980
It's a glide reflection –

138
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,658
and an example of how glide reflections really are

139
00:05:46,658 --> 00:05:48,536
their own special sort symmetry –

140
00:05:48,536 --> 00:05:51,084
different from just a combination of reflections –

141
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:51,935
which looks like this–

142
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,195
and translation which look like this.

143
00:05:54,195 --> 00:05:56,455
and which, together, give you this.

144
00:05:56,455 --> 00:05:58,316
So if you fold space time into a Mobius strip,

145
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,412
you get your melody, and then the inversion –

146
00:06:00,412 --> 00:06:02,311
the melody played upside down.

147
00:06:02,311 --> 00:06:03,218
And then right side up again.

148
00:06:03,218 --> 00:06:04,048
And so on.

149
00:06:04,048 --> 00:06:06,702
Or rather than folding and cutting all of space-time

150
00:06:06,702 --> 00:06:08,563
just cut and tape a little loop of space-time,

151
00:06:08,563 --> 00:06:12,039
into a Mobius strip to be played over ... and over ...
