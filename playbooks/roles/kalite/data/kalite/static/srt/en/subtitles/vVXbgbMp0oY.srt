1
00:00:04,357 --> 00:00:05,866
Consider the following:

2
00:00:05,866 --> 00:00:08,407
Imagine two rooms,

3
00:00:08,407 --> 00:00:12,977
inside each room is a switch

4
00:00:12,977 --> 00:00:15,743
In one room there is a man who flips his switch

5
00:00:15,743 --> 00:00:17,337
according to a coin flip.

6
00:00:17,337 --> 00:00:19,728
If it's heads, that signals that the switch is on --

7
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,980
And if it's tails, the switch is off.

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,942
In the other room, a woman switches her lights

9
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:26,608
based on a blind guess.

10
00:00:26,608 --> 00:00:30,030
She tries to simulate randomness without a coin.

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,934
Then we start the clock

12
00:00:31,934 --> 00:00:39,704
and they make their switches in unison.

13
00:00:39,704 --> 00:00:41,357
Can you determine which light bulb

14
00:00:45,176 --> 00:00:48,996
is being switched by a coin flip?

15
00:00:48,996 --> 00:00:50,592
The answer is Yes.

16
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:59,746
But how?

17
00:00:59,746 --> 00:01:02,646
And the trick is to think about properties of the sequence

18
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:05,782
rather than looking for any specific pattern.

19
00:01:05,782 --> 00:01:07,840
For example, first we may try

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,112
to count the number of 1's and 0's

21
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:11,321
which occur in each sequence.

22
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,336
This is close, but not enough

23
00:01:13,336 --> 00:01:16,406
since they were both seen fairly even.

24
00:01:16,406 --> 00:01:19,816
The answer is to count sequences of numbers

25
00:01:19,816 --> 00:01:22,974
such as runs of three consecutive switches

26
00:01:22,974 --> 00:01:25,657
A true random sequence would be equally likely

27
00:01:25,657 --> 00:01:28,714
to contain every sequence of any length

28
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:32,050
This is called the frequency stability property

29
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,053
and its demonstrated by this uniform graph.

30
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:38,009
The forgery is now obvious.

31
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:40,446
Humans favour certain sequences when they make guesses

32
00:01:40,446 --> 00:01:43,553
resulting in uneven pattern, such as we see here.

33
00:01:43,553 --> 00:01:45,125
One reason this happens

34
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:47,061
is that we make mistake thinking that

35
00:01:47,061 --> 00:01:49,320
certain outcomes are less random than others.

36
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,725
But realize, there is no such thing as a lucky number.

37
00:01:53,725 --> 00:01:56,742
There is no such thing as a lucky sequence.

38
00:01:56,742 --> 00:02:00,938
If we flip a coin 10 times, it is equaly likely to come up

39
00:02:00,938 --> 00:02:08,098
all heads, all tails, or any other sequence you can think of.
