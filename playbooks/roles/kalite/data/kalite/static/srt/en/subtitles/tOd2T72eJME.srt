00:00:00,892 --> 00:00:03,121
PROBLEM: "The scale on a map is

2
00:00:03,121 --> 00:00:05,939
7 centimeters for every 10 kilometers –

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:09,553
or 7 centimeters for 10 kilometers.

4
00:00:09,553 --> 00:00:13,263
If the distance between two cities is 60 kilometers –

5
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,139
(So that's the actual distance.)

6
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:17,142
– how far apart, in centimeters,

7
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,669
are the two cities on the map?"

8
00:00:19,669 --> 00:00:21,469
Well they give us this scale.

9
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:25,454
For every 10 kilometers in the real world,

10
00:00:25,454 --> 00:00:30,139
the map is going to show 7 centimeters.

11
00:00:30,139 --> 00:00:31,433
Or another way to think about it is if you see

12
00:00:31,433 --> 00:00:32,819
7 centimeters on the map,

13
00:00:32,819 --> 00:00:36,780
that represents 10 kilometers in the real world.

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,745
Now, they're saying that the distance

15
00:00:38,745 --> 00:00:43,714
between the two cities is 60 kilometers.

16
00:00:43,714 --> 00:00:49,687
So, it's essentially 6 × 10 kilometers.

17
00:00:49,687 --> 00:00:51,607
So times 6.

18
00:00:51,607 --> 00:00:54,760
So if you have to 6 × 10 kilometers on the map,

19
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,920
you're going to have 6 × 7 centimeters.

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,266
So times 6.

21
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:05,750
And 6 × 7 centimeters gets you to 42 centimeters.

22
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,311
So how far apart in centimeters

23
00:01:07,311 --> 00:01:08,687
are the two cities on the map?

24
00:01:08,687 --> 00:01:11,173
Well, 42 centimeters.
