1
00:00:02,188 --> 00:00:07,712
We're going to compare Aldosterone and ADH or Antidiuretic Hormone side by side.

2
00:00:07,712 --> 00:00:10,419
To do this I think it would be helpful if we just

3
00:00:10,419 --> 00:00:14,990
do a little recap on how these two work because it's going to help

4
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,618
inform exactly what they do.

5
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:25,393
So if we have a little nephron here, a little tubule, and these are the cells lining the tubule

6
00:00:25,393 --> 00:00:30,918
and it's going to eventually send the urine on its way out. Next to it I have a little

7
00:00:30,918 --> 00:00:37,966
blood vessel, and just to save myself from drawing it twice I'm going to cut and paste

8
00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:43,234
this over to this side right here.

9
00:00:43,234 --> 00:00:51,665
In this tubule we know that on one side, on the aldosterone side, we have water permeability.

10
00:00:51,665 --> 00:00:57,854
This membrane that seperates these two, these layer of cells are water permeable.

11
00:00:57,854 --> 00:01:02,831
Over here on the ADH side, we know that they are NOT water permeable.

12
00:01:02,831 --> 00:01:06,643
The reason I'm saying it's different is because we know that, although they look the same

13
00:01:06,643 --> 00:01:09,238
these are different parts of the nephron.

14
00:01:09,238 --> 00:01:14,457
The way that aldosterone works, the main thing it does,

15
00:01:14,457 --> 00:01:21,627
it's going to pull in sodium and spit out into the urine potassium.

16
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:38,131
That's the main activity of aldosterone in terms of capturing sodium

17
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:38,131
and what happens is that sodium, we know, is not permeable to membranes.

18
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:41,858
Not able to cross membranes very easily.

19
00:01:41,858 --> 00:01:45,343
That's actually really important because if it can't cross membranes,

20
00:01:45,343 --> 00:01:51,066
then that means that it's going to contribute to tonicity because we know that

21
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:54,492
the ions that cannot cross membranes are the ones that

22
00:01:54,492 --> 00:01:59,875
are the biggest contributors to tonicity.

23
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:03,200
In fact, this is actually very important because potassium

24
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:13,817
by comparison can "slightly" cross membranes.

25
00:02:13,817 --> 00:02:17,159
So if you have one ion that cannot cross membranes at all

26
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:22,072
and you give away the ion that can slightly cross membranes,

27
00:02:22,072 --> 00:02:27,118
then your tonicity goes up because overall you're getting

28
00:02:27,118 --> 00:02:31,272
more ions that can stay in the blood vessel

29
00:02:31,272 --> 00:02:35,900
and because they can stay in the blood vessel, it can contribute to tonicity.

30
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,426
Water is going to be driven into the blood vessels.

31
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:43,895
So that's really how aldosterone is dragging water into the blood vessel

32
00:02:43,895 --> 00:02:46,230
through increased tonicity.

33
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:51,981
By comparison, the ADH is just using water channels

34
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:56,979
if water is unable to get across otherwise, if you through in some water channels

35
00:02:56,979 --> 00:03:01,286
then you have no problem gathering water.

36
00:03:01,286 --> 00:03:05,303
So these are the key differences: one of them uses an osmole

37
00:03:05,303 --> 00:03:09,844
to drag water across and that's why we always say "Water follows sodium."

38
00:03:09,844 --> 00:03:11,995
and the other is just using channels.

39
00:03:11,995 --> 00:03:19,887
Let me make a little bit of space here. . . let's see if we can create some space down here

40
00:03:19,887 --> 00:03:24,770
I'm going to create two categories: one category is Volume

41
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:31,876
and the other is Osmolarity.

42
00:03:31,876 --> 00:03:42,772
We know osmolarity actually is simply a fraction. It's just osmoles divided by volume.

43
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:48,853
We have the same thing in the other column and I'm going to do that for this side as well:

44
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:55,373
osmolarity is osmoles divided by volume.

45
00:03:55,373 --> 00:04:04,101
We're going to see how these two work and whether one or both will be effected by the hormones.

46
00:04:04,101 --> 00:04:11,389
We know that the way that aldosterone works is by raising the osmoles.

47
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:15,534
It's going to change this, going to increase the osmoles

48
00:04:15,534 --> 00:04:19,223
and as a result it will increase the volume.

49
00:04:19,223 --> 00:04:25,806
So actually, both osmoles and volume are effected.

50
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:33,600
Let me start out by just circling this box because we know that the volume is effected.

51
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:34,200
because osmoles and volume are both affected and that they're proportional to one another

52
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:43,412
we usually don't think of osmolarity being effected by aldosterone because both

53
00:04:43,412 --> 00:04:48,864
the numerator and denominator are going to go up if there's a lot of aldosterone

54
00:04:48,864 --> 00:04:52,176
or down if there's not any aldosterone around.

55
00:04:52,176 --> 00:04:55,680
So osmolarity doesn't really get effected by aldosterone.

56
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,879
Now, ADH is a little different.

57
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:04,119
In ADH we have volume going up, that's really the primary thing that's happening

58
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:09,006
So we'd say we have a volume change here

59
00:05:09,006 --> 00:05:13,304
but in terms of osmoles, you haven't really

60
00:05:13,304 --> 00:05:16,873
changed the osmoles with ADH, not directly.

61
00:05:16,873 --> 00:05:23,671
If you haven't changed the osmoles and you have changed the volume

62
00:05:23,671 --> 00:05:25,382
then osmolarity is changed.

63
00:05:30,445 --> 00:05:30,445
If you just change the denominator, but not the numerator then the number will change.

64
00:05:30,445 --> 00:05:30,446
So that's why ADH effects osmolarity although it doesn't effect osmoles.

65
00:05:31,846 --> 99:59:59,999
Kind of a tricky thing, but I think you can see it now

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that the numerator doesn't change, but the overall fraction does.

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So you have on this side increased volume and

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you have increased volume on this side

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you have decreased osmolarity.

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So these are the major changes from these hormones.

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me make a little bit more space and we'll continue this line of reasoning.

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if these are the changes, now imagine the scenario

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
where you want to increase volume, but maintain the osmolarity.

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if you want to increase volume, but maintain osmolarity

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which hormone would you use?

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because we can't see the hormone [drawings above], let's just use aldosterone and ADH

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and I'll just put "up" arrows and "down" arrows

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
These are the two hormones, I want to increase volume,

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I would definitely use aldosterone because it

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
doesn't effect osmolartiy, but I would NOT use ADH

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'll put a little circle with a line through it.

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I would NOT use ADH because again, I want to maintain osmolarity

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I would not want to use ADH in that scenario.

84
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now let's say you wanted to increase volume, REGARDLESS of osmolarity

85
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
meaning you don't really care if osmolarity changes

86
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this could be, let's say you have a big car accident

87
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you're bleeding out and the only thing

88
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you really care about right away is increasing

89
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
your blood volume, that's the only thing that

90
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
matters, so you really want to increase volume and you want to do it fast.

91
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, in this scenario, you definitely want to use

92
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
everything that's available to you, aldosterone and ADH.

93
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The fact the osmolarity will go down with ADH really doesn't matter

94
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because we said regardless in this scenario

95
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so because of that, I'm going to imploy ADH this time.

96
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
You can kind of get a sense for how this is going to work, right?

97
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now let's say you wanted to decrease osmlarity

98
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
regardless of volume, so I don't really care if the

99
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
volume changes a little bit here or there,

100
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so in this case, regardless of volume, what would I do?

101
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, if I didn't really care about the volume and I just wanted to decrease osmolarity

102
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that seems like a no brainer, right?

103
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That's exactly what ADH will do, it will decrease osmolarity

104
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and really in this case, I don't need aldosterone.

105
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I said in my phrase here that I don't care about volume changed so, that's fine

106
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'll just use ADH and I'll tolerate the increase in volume.

107
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
In the fourth scenario, let's say you want to decrease osmolarity and maintain

108
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
volume, you don't want it to go up or down.

109
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
This is kind of a tricky one right? because to decrease osmolarity, only one

110
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
hormone will do that so you've got to start with

111
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
some ADH, but if you want to maintain volume

112
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you know that ADH will cause your volume to go up

113
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a little bit and if you don't want it go up, you wanted to maintain volume, you

114
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
may actually have to decrease aldosterone just

115
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a little smidge so that would maintain your volume.

116
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now you can see how the two hormones basically

117
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
have to work together to get the different outcomes.

118
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Depending on what your volume status is and what

119
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
your osmolarity status is.

120
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I can flip around all the arrows or I could say

121
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
well what about decreased volume and maintained osmolarity

122
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or decreased volume regardless of osmolarity?

123
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you would basically just do the opposite of all these things.

124
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Any tweak in volume and osmolarity can help you

125
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
predict what the aldosterone and ADH will be doing.
