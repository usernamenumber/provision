1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,450
   

2
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,350
In this video I want to do a
couple of inequality problems

3
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,060
that are deceptively tricky.

4
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,090
And you might be saying,
hey, aren't all inequality

5
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,480
problems deceptively tricky?

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,580
And on some level
you're probably right.

7
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,630
But let's start with
the first problem.

8
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:20,070
We have x minus 1 over x
plus 2 is greater than 0.

9
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,130
And I'm actually going to show
you two ways to do this.

10
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,370
The first way is, I think, on
some level, the simpler way.

11
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,260
But I'll show you both methods
and whatever works for you,

12
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,810
well, it works for you.

13
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,480
So the first way you can think
about this, if I have just any

14
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,370
number divided by any other
number and I say that they're

15
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,435
going to be greater than 0.

16
00:00:38,435 --> 00:00:41,840
Well, we just have to remember
our properties of multiplying

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,570
and dividing negative numbers.

18
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,940
In what situation is
this fraction going

19
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,560
to be greater than 0?

20
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,300
Well, this is going to be
greater than 0 only if both a

21
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,170
and-- so we could write both a
is greater than 0 and

22
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,670
b is greater than 0.

23
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,670
So this is one circumstance
where this'll

24
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,030
definitely be true.

25
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,480
We have a positive divided
by a positive; it'll

26
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,770
definitely be a positive.

27
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,670
It'll definitely be
greater than 0.

28
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:11,910
Or we could have the situation
where we have a negative

29
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:12,940
divided by a negative.

30
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,600
If we have the same sign
divided by the same sign we're

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,150
also going to be positive.

32
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:23,350
So or-- a is less than 0
and b is less than 0.

33
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,750
So whenever you have any type
of rational expression like

34
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,810
this being greater than 0,
there's two situations in

35
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,100
which it will be true.

36
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,760
The numerator and the
denominator are both

37
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,900
greater than 0, or
they're both less than 0.

38
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,890
So let's remember that and
actually do this problem.

39
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,880
So there's two situations
to solve this problem.

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,770
The first is where both of
them are greater than 0.

41
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,330
If that and that are both
greater than 0, we're cool.

42
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,320
So we could say our first
solution-- maybe I'll draw a

43
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:54,760
little tree like that-- is x
minus 1 greater than 0 and

44
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,410
x plus 2 greater than 0.

45
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,470
That's equivalent to this.

46
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,240
The top and the bottom-- if
they're both greater than 0

47
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,890
then when you divide them
you're going to get

48
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,320
something greater than 0.

49
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,060
The other option-- we just
saw that-- is if both of

50
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,640
them were less than 0.

51
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:16,010
So the other option is x
minus 1 less than 0 and

52
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,760
x plus 2 less than 0.

53
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,280
If both of these are less than
0 then you have a negative

54
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,320
divided by a negative,
which will be positive.

55
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,530
Which will be greater than 0.

56
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,492
So let's actually solve in
both of these circumstances.

57
00:02:28,492 --> 00:02:32,580
So x minus 1 greater than 0.

58
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,730
If we add 1 to both
sides of that we get

59
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,000
x is greater than 1.

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,300
And if we do x plus 2 greater
than 0, if we subtract 2 from

61
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,160
both sides of that equation--
remember I'm doing this

62
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,270
right now-- we get x is
greater than minus 2.

63
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:54,100
So for both of these to hold
true-- so in this little brown

64
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,450
or red color, whatever you want
to think of it-- in order for

65
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:02,100
both of these to go hold true,
x has to be greater than 1 and

66
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,380
x has to be greater
than minus 2.

67
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,770
This statement we figured out
means that x has to be greater

68
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:15,600
than 1 and this statement
tells us that x has to

69
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,560
be greater than minus 2.

70
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,190
Now, if x is greater than 1 and
x has to be greater than minus

71
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:26,010
2, x clearly has to
be greater than 1.

72
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,280
You know, 0 would not satisfy
this because 0 is greater

73
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,450
than minus 2, but it's
not greater than 1.

74
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,490
So for something to be greater
than 1 and minus 2 it has

75
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,080
to be greater than 1.

76
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,000
This whole chain of thought
where I'm saying the numerator

77
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,950
and the denominator are greater
than 0, that's only going to

78
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,285
happen if x is greater than 1.

79
00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:47,870
Because if x is greater than 1,
then x is definitely going to

80
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,430
be greater than negative 2.

81
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,800
Any number greater than
1 is definitely greater

82
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,740
than negative 2.

83
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,590
So that's one situation in
which this equation holds true,

84
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,580
and we can even try it out.

85
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,230
Let's say x was 2.

86
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,700
2 minus 1 is 1 over 2 plus 2.

87
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,360
It's 1/4.

88
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,585
It's a positive number.

89
00:04:01,585 --> 00:04:03,560
Now let's do the situation
where both of these

90
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,900
are negative.

91
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,720
If the x minus 1 is less than
0, if we add 1 to both sides of

92
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,470
that equation that tells us
so x minus 1 is less than 0.

93
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,160
That's the same thing-- if we
add 1 to both sides of that--

94
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,340
as saying that x
is less than 1.

95
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,750
So that constraint boils
down to that constraint.

96
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,225
Now this constraint, x
plus 2 is less than 0.

97
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:30,050
If we subtract 2 from
both sides we get x

98
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,980
is less than minus 2.

99
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,860
So this constraint boils
down to that constraint.

100
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,080
So in order for both of these
guys to be negative, both the

101
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,310
numerator and the denominator
to be negative-- we know that

102
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:50,130
x has to be less than 1 and x
has to be less than minus 2.

103
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:53,140
Now if something has to be less
than 1 and it has to be less

104
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,110
than minus 2, well, it just
has to be less than minus 2.

105
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:00,020
Anything less than minus 2 is
going to satisfy both of these.

106
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,150
So this boils down to
just x could also be

107
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,740
less than minus 2.

108
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,390
And remember, this is an or.

109
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,400
Either both the numerator and
the denominator are positive,

110
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,800
or they're both negative.

111
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,810
So both of them being positive
boil down to x could be greater

112
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:21,350
than 1, or both of them being
negative boils down to x

113
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,940
is less than minus 2.

114
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:30,400
So our solution is x could be
greater than 1 or-- that's

115
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,690
both of these positive--
or x is less than minus 2.

116
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,150
That's both of these negative.

117
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,380
And if we wanted to draw it on
a number line-- let me draw a

118
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,750
number line just like that.

119
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,510
That could be 0 and then
we have 1, so x could

120
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,390
be greater than 1.

121
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,490
Not greater than or equal to.

122
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,840
So we put a little circle
there to show that

123
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,570
we're not including 1.

124
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:58,880
And everything greater than 1
will satisfy this equation.

125
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,860
Or anything less than minus 2.

126
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,930
So we have minus 1, minus 2,
anything less than minus 2 will

127
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:13,410
also satisfy this equation by
both making the numerator

128
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,490
and denominator negative.

129
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,720
And you could try it out.

130
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,940
Minus 3.

131
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,390
Minus 3 minus 1.

132
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:21,830
I'll just do minus 3 minus
1 is equal to minus 4.

133
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,360
And then minus 3 plus 2.

134
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,590
Minus 3 plus 2 is
equal to minus 1.

135
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,830
Minus 4 divided by
minus 1 is positive 4.

136
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,610
So all of these negative
numbers also work.

137
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,120
Now, I told you that I
would show you two ways

138
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,650
of doing this problem.

139
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,030
So let me show you another way
if you found this one maybe

140
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,810
a little bit confusing.

141
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:46,440
So the other way-- let
me rewrite the problem.

142
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:56,810
You get x minus 1 over x
plus 2 is greater than 0.

143
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,590
And actually, let's mix it up
a little bit and you could

144
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,440
apply the same logic.

145
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,950
Let's say it's greater than or
equal-- well, actually no.

146
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,020
I'll just keep it the same way
and maybe in the next video

147
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,020
I'll do the case where it's
greater than or equal just

148
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,610
because I really don't want
to-- maybe I want to

149
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,100
incrementally step up the
level of difficulty.

150
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,800
We're just saying x minus
1 over x plus 2 is just

151
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,100
straight up greater than 0.

152
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,600
Now one thing you might say is
well, if I have a rational

153
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,060
expression like this, maybe I
multiply both sides of this

154
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,790
equation by x plus 2.

155
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,490
So I get rid of it in the
denominator and I can

156
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,920
multiply it times 0 and
get it out of the way.

157
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,700
But the problem is when you
multiply both sides of an

158
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,300
inequality by a number-- if
you're multiplying by a

159
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,610
positive you can keep the
inequality the same.

160
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,820
But if you're multiplying by a
negative you have to switch the

161
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,140
inequality, and we don't
know whether x plus 2 is

162
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,340
positive or negative.

163
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,700
So let's do both situations.

164
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,460
   

165
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,710
Let's do one situation
where x plus 2-- let

166
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:52,840
me write it this way.

167
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,180
x plus 2 is greater than 0.

168
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,080
And then another situation
where-- let me do that

169
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,180
in a different color.

170
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:05,270
Where x plus 2 is less than 0.

171
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,380
These are the two
possibilities for x plus 2.

172
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,700
Actually, in those situations
can x plus 2 equal 0?

173
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,520
If x plus 2 were to be equal to
0 than this whole expression

174
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,380
would be undefined.

175
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,480
And so that definitely won't
be a situation that we

176
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,610
want to deal with it.

177
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,960
It would an undefined
situation.

178
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,000
So these are our two situations
when we're multiplying

179
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,130
both sides.

180
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,530
So if x plus 2 is greater
than 0 that means that x

181
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,690
is greater than minus 2.

182
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,460
We can just subtract 2 from
both sides of this equation.

183
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,920
So if x is greater than
minus 2, then x plus

184
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,330
2 is greater than 0.

185
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,950
And then we can multiply
both sides of this

186
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,520
equation times x plus 2.

187
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,380
So you have x minus 1 over
x plus 2 greater than 0.

188
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:50,200
I'm going to multiply both
sides by x plus 2, which I'm

189
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,400
assuming is positive because
x is greater than minus 2.

190
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,610
Multiply both sides
by x plus 2.

191
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,640
These cancel out.

192
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,390
0 times x plus 2 is it just 0.

193
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,670
You're just left with x minus
1 is greater than-- this

194
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,770
just simplified to 0.

195
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,690
Solve for x, add 1 to
both sides, you get

196
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,670
x is greater than 1.

197
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,830
So we saw that if x plus 2 is
greater than 0, or we could

198
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:18,890
say, if x is greater than
minus 2, then x also has

199
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,390
to be greater than 1.

200
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,860
Or you could say if x is
great-- well, you could

201
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,180
go both ways in that.

202
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,510
But we say, look, both of
these things have to be true.

203
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,380
If for x to satisfy both
of these, it just has

204
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,380
to be greater than 1.

205
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,010
Because if it's greater
than 1 it's definitely

206
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,670
going to satisfy this
constraint over here.

207
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,760
So for this branch we come
up with the solution

208
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,050
x is greater than 1.

209
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:45,300
So this is one situation where
x plus 2 is greater than 0.

210
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:50,240
The other situation is x
plus 2 being less than 0.

211
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,960
If x plus 2 is less than 0
that's equivalent to saying

212
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,070
that x is less than minus 2.

213
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,560
You just subtract 2
from both sides.

214
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,510
Now, if x plus 2 is less than
0, what we'll have to do

215
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,630
when we multiply both
sides-- let's do that.

216
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:06,690
We have x minus 1
over x plus 2.

217
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,190
We have some inequality
and then we have a 0.

218
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:14,420
Now if we multiply both
sides by x plus 2, x plus

219
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,890
2 is a negative number.

220
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,640
When you multiply both
sides of an equation by a

221
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,430
negative number you have
to swap the inequality.

222
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:23,150
So this greater than sign will
become a less than sign because

223
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:26,340
we're assuming that the
x plus 2 is negative.

224
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,680
These cancel out.

225
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,090
0 times anything is 0.

226
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:34,220
We get that x minus
1 is less than 0.

227
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:39,640
Solving for x, adding 1 to
both sides, x is less than 1.

228
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,430
So in the case that x plus 2 is
less than 0 or x is less than

229
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,580
minus 2, x must be less than 1.

230
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,780
Well, I mean we know-- if you
say something has to be less

231
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,030
than minus 2 and less than 1,
just saying that it's less

232
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,720
than minus 2 will do the job.

233
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,220
Anything less than minus 2 is
going to satisfy this one.

234
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,790
But not anything that satisfies
this one is going to

235
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,510
satisfy that one.

236
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:02,520
So this is the only constraint
we have to worry about.

237
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,160
So in the event where x plus 2
is less than 0, we can just

238
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,470
say that x has to be
less than minus 2.

239
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,420
That'll satisfy this equation.

240
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,750
So our final result is x is
either going to be greater

241
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,710
than 1 or x is going to
be less than minus 2.

242
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:20,581
So once again, I can graph
it on the number line.

243
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:25,120
x is greater than
1 right there.

244
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,160
You have 0, minus 1, minus 2.

245
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,840
And then you have x is less
than minus 2, you're not

246
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,290
including the minus 2.

247
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,310
And just like that.

248
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,080
And that is the exact same
result we got up here.

249
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,290
So whichever version
you find to be easier.

250
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,120
But you can see, they're both a
little bit nuanced and you have

251
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,340
to think a little bit about
what happens when you multiply

252
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,790
or divide by positive
or negative numbers.

253
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:48,807
