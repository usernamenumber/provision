1
00:00:00,342 --> 00:00:04,307
We have now seen the Nazis come to power in 1933 -

2
00:00:04,307 --> 00:00:08,532
and by mid 1933 they are the only allowed party in Germany.

3
00:00:08,532 --> 00:00:11,667
And Hitler is fundamentally the dictator of Germany.

4
00:00:11,667 --> 00:00:14,872
But they aren't happy with just that consolidated power,

5
00:00:14,872 --> 00:00:17,149
they want to ensure that they stay in power.

6
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:21,609
And so as we get into 1934 they continue to consolidate their power

7
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:27,000
and now more directly start eliminating their opponents.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,002
And when I say eliminating, they are actually directly killing these individuals.

9
00:00:30,002 --> 00:00:34,333
And there is an entire Nazi power apparatus that is at play,

10
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:38,803
but the three figures here are the ones that are most notable other than Hitler.

11
00:00:38,803 --> 00:00:42,479
This is Joseph Goebbels who is the head of Nazi Propaganda,

12
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:47,803
Hermann Göring who is the head of the Nazi's secret police, the Gestapo,

13
00:00:47,803 --> 00:00:51,341
which later goes under the control of the SS, under Heinrich Himmler.

14
00:00:51,341 --> 00:00:57,480
He is a major player in the rearmament of Germany for ???.

15
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,647
He eventually helds the Luftwaffe which is the German airforce during the World War II.

16
00:01:01,647 --> 00:01:06,476
Heinrich Himmler who is the head of Schutzstaffel

17
00:01:06,476 --> 00:01:13,070
- more famously known as the SS - which is the paramilitary group of the Nazi party -

18
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,474
used to intimidate and eliminate (as we will see) their opponents

19
00:01:16,474 --> 00:01:20,737
and they are also responsible for the execution of the actual

20
00:01:20,737 --> 00:01:24,470
the planning and the execution - of the actual holocaust.

21
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:30,342
And so as we get into 1934 Hitler is eager to eliminate more of his opponents -

22
00:01:30,342 --> 00:01:33,599
and we are not just talking about opponents outside of the Nazi party,

23
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:36,472
we are also talking about rivals within the Nazi party.

24
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:40,146
And the most notable of these was Ernst Röhm

25
00:01:40,146 --> 00:01:44,139
who as you see at this picture was clearly a Nazi.

26
00:01:44,139 --> 00:01:48,603
He was head of the Storm Battalion or the SA, which was the paramilitary group

27
00:01:48,603 --> 00:01:52,474
that the SS splintered out of and it was far more

28
00:01:52,474 --> 00:01:55,008
independent than Hitler would have liked and it was not

29
00:01:55,008 --> 00:01:56,667
popular amongst the German people

30
00:01:56,667 --> 00:02:04,056
because of its violence - and Hitler and his tendence to view Röhm as a potential rival to Hitler's authority

31
00:02:04,056 --> 00:02:10,145
within the Nazi party. And so in 1934, June 30th in particular

32
00:02:10,145 --> 00:02:13,405
- or we can say June 30th till July 2nd -

33
00:02:13,405 --> 00:02:15,804
you have what's called the Night of the Long Knives

34
00:02:15,804 --> 00:02:18,894
and it really should be called the Nights of the Long Knives

35
00:02:18,894 --> 00:02:23,481
but the Night of the Long Knives

36
00:02:23,481 --> 00:02:32,563
where under the pretext of a supposed a coup d'état, under a putsch, under part of Ernst Röhm

37
00:02:32,563 --> 00:02:37,888
They - There you have the SS and the Gestapo start surrunding up Röhm,

38
00:02:37,888 --> 00:02:41,736
his allies and any perceived enimies of Hitler.

39
00:02:41,736 --> 00:02:45,736
Start surronding them of and eliminating them and shooting them...

40
00:02:45,736 --> 00:02:50,224
And Ernst Röhm is arrested and when he refuses to kill himself in his jail cell

41
00:02:50,224 --> 00:02:52,306
he is shot at point-blank range.

42
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:58,309
Gregor Strasser, who is a former rival of Hitler within the Nazi party, he is eliminated.

43
00:02:58,309 --> 00:03:05,004
Kurt von Schleicher who is a previous chancellor
of Germany perceived as a rival to Hitler

44
00:03:05,004 --> 00:03:07,002
- he and his wife are gunned down.

45
00:03:07,002 --> 00:03:14,335
Gustav Ritter von Kahr who is in no way anymore a rival to Hitler

46
00:03:14,335 --> 00:03:18,670
but he was one of the major actors for putting down the Beer Hall Putsch -

47
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,139
the fail the Beer Hall Putch of 1923.

48
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:26,002
He is hacked - he is hacked to get dead.

49
00:03:26,002 --> 00:03:28,337
And these are just four of the more notable folks.

50
00:03:28,337 --> 00:03:34,603
On those few nights over 85 major officials in Germany were eliminated.

51
00:03:34,603 --> 00:03:40,070
And as we will see this is just the beginning of the consolidation of Nazi power

52
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:44,070
and now they are doing it through extra legal means.
