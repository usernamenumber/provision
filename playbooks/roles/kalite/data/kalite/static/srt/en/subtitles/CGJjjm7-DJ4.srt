1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
   

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,600
All of the reactions we've
looked at so far have been of

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:10,890
the form lowercase a moles of
the molecule uppercase A, plus

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,190
lowercase b moles of a
molecule uppercase B.

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,870
They react to form the product
or the products.

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,380
Let's just say they have
a couple of products.

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,140
I could have had as many
molecules here as I wanted.

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:28,070
Let's say c moles of the
molecule C plus d moles of the

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,480
molecule capital D.

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,070
And the idea here is that they
went in one direction.

11
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,090
And if we did a little energy
diagram, just going off of the

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:43,900
kinematics video we just did, if
that's the reaction, or how

13
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,260
the reaction progresses, you
could imagine that here you

14
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,100
have it at a higher
energy state.

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:54,640
You have lowercase a moles of
capital A molecule, plus

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,500
lowercase b moles of capital B
molecule, and you have some

17
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,780
activation energy.

18
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,450
And then you get to a more
stable state or a lower energy

19
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:05,650
level here, where it's lowercase
c moles of C

20
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,300
molecule plus lowercase d moles
of the D moles, and of

21
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,650
course, you had some
activation energy.

22
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,980
It only goes in this
direction.

23
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,550
Once you get here, it's
very hard to go back.

24
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,360
So that if you came back and
looked at this-- if you get

25
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,625
enough of A and B-- you'll just
be sitting with molecules

26
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:19,690
of C and D.

27
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:20,870
It'll only go in
this direction.

28
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,570
But that's not how it
happens in reality.

29
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,180
In reality-- well, it sometimes
happens like this in

30
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,670
reality where the reaction can
only go in one direction.

31
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,180
But in a lot of cases, the
reaction can actually go in

32
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,840
both directions.

33
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,440
So we could write, instead of
this one-way reaction, we

34
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,810
could write a two-way
reaction like this.

35
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:44,930
And not to confuse you too much,
these are the number of

36
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:49,290
moles or the ratios of the
molecules I'm adding up, and

37
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,080
they become relevant
in a second.

38
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,370
So let's say I have lowercase a
moles of this molecule plus

39
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:58,480
lowercase b moles of this
molecule, and then they react

40
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,680
to form lowercase c moles of
this molecule plus lowercase d

41
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,680
moles of that molecule.

42
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,020
Sometimes the reaction can
go in both directions.

43
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,590
And to do that, to just show an
equilibrium reaction, you

44
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,860
do these arrows that go
in both directions.

45
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,610
That means that, hey, some of
this is going to start forming

46
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,520
into some of this.

47
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,240
But at the same time, some of
this might start forming into

48
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,080
some of this.

49
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,680
And at some point, I'm going to
be reaching an equilibrium.

50
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,370
When the rate of reaction of
molecules going in that

51
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,120
direction is equal to the number
of molecules going in

52
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,640
the other direction, then I'm
going to reach some type of

53
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,890
equilibrium.

54
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:41,420
   

55
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,670
Now, why would this happen
as opposed to that?

56
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,610
And I can think of
one situation.

57
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,880
If we draw this energy
diagram again.

58
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,610
Maybe both of these have similar
or not so different

59
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,960
energy states.

60
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,930
There could be other reasons,
but this is the one that comes

61
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,670
to my mind.

62
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,700
Maybe the energy states look
something like this.

63
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,870
On this side, you have the A
plus B, and then you need some

64
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,870
activation energy.

65
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,890
And then maybe the C plus D,
maybe it's a little bit of a

66
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,870
lower potential, but it's
not that much lower.

67
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,770
So maybe they're favored to go
in this direction, because

68
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,880
this is a more stable state.

69
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,650
So this is the A plus B, but
here you have the C plus D.

70
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,010
But it's not ridiculous
to go this way either.

71
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,840
So most of it might go that
way, but some of it

72
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,890
might go this way.

73
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:28,510
If some of these molecules just
have the right amount of

74
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,570
kinetic energy, they can
surmount this activation

75
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:35,400
energy and then go backwards
to that side of it.

76
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,090
And the study of this is called
equilibrium, where

77
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,710
you're looking at the
concentrations of the

78
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,590
different molecules.

79
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,330
And just to compare that to
kinetics, kinetics was how

80
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,790
fast is this is going
to happen?

81
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,260
Or what can I do to change the
activation, this hump here?

82
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:53,860
Equilibrium is studying what
will be the concentrations of

83
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,650
the different molecules that end
up, once the rate going in

84
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,290
this direction is equal to the
rate going in that direction.

85
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,200
And I want to be clear.

86
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,460
Equilibrium is where the rate
going in the forward direction

87
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,470
is equal to the rate going
in the reverse direction.

88
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,530
It doesn't mean that the
concentrations of the two

89
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,170
things are equal.

90
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:15,720
You might end up with 25% of
your eventual solution's

91
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,190
concentration to be A
and B and 75% here.

92
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,450
All we know is that at some
point, you've reached an--

93
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,760
equilibrium just means that
those concentrations won't

94
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,290
change anymore.

95
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,590
And just to give you an example
what I mean here, I

96
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,760
could have written-- let's
see, this is actually the

97
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,720
Haber process.

98
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:37,520
I could write nitrogen gas
plus 3 hydrogen gases.

99
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,730
These are all in gas form, so
I can put a little g in

100
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,980
parentheses.

101
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,030
   

102
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:49,680
Actually, it's an equilibrium
reaction, and it produces 2

103
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,000
moles of ammonia.

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,220
It's called the Haber process.

105
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,000
We could talk about that
in another video.

106
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,990
So in this case, we could say a
is just 1, this lowercase a.

107
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,040
Capital A is the nitrogen
molecule.

108
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,710
Lowercase b is 3.

109
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,720
Uppercase B is the hydrogen
molecule.

110
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,910
And then lowercase c is the
number of moles of ammonia and

111
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,230
uppercase C is the ammonia
molecule itself.

112
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,600
I just want you to realize this
is just an abstract way

113
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,950
of describing a whole
set of equations.

114
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,950
Now, what's interesting in
equilibrium reactions is that

115
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,760
you can define a
constant called

116
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,255
the equilibrium constant.

117
00:05:29,255 --> 00:05:32,260
   

118
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,780
It's defined as the constant
of equilibrium.

119
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,860
Let me switch colors.

120
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,020
I'm using this light
blue too much.

121
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:44,650
The equilibrium constant is
defined as you take the

122
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:49,320
products, or the right-hand
side-- but if it goes in both

123
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,640
directions, you can obviously
go in either direction.

124
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,790
But let's say that this is the
forward direction going from A

125
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,990
plus B to C plus D.

126
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,300
So you take the products, you
take the concentration of each

127
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:04,820
of the products, and you
multiply them by each other,

128
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,700
and you raise them to the mole
ratios that you're taking.

129
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,600
So in this case, it would be
the concentration of big C

130
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,050
raised to the lowercase c power
and the concentration of

131
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,550
big D raised to the
lowercase d power.

132
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:21,820
And when I say concentration,
they usually-- especially what

133
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,980
you see in your intro chemistry
classes, the

134
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:31,790
concentration is going to be
measured in molarity, which,

135
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:36,270
just as a review, is
moles per liter.

136
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,650
A couple of videos ago, when I
taught you what molarity was,

137
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,830
I said, you know, moles per
liter--- I don't like it so

138
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:46,550
much because the volume of your
fluid or your gas you're

139
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,870
dealing with is dependent
on temperature.

140
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,450
So I didn't like
using molarity.

141
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,140
But in this case,
it's kind of OK.

142
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,995
Because this equilibrium
constant is also only true for

143
00:06:55,995 --> 00:06:57,030
a given temperature.

144
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,220
We assume it for a given
temperature, and I'll show you

145
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,200
how we use it in a second.

146
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,900
But it's defined as the
concentrations of the products

147
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,270
to the powers.

148
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,843
And also, if I have time,
maybe I'll do

149
00:07:07,843 --> 00:07:08,850
it in the next video.

150
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,370
The intuition why you're
raising it to the power

151
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:17,820
divided by the concentrations
of the reactants, or the

152
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,580
things on the left-hand side of
the equilibrium reaction.

153
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:27,610
So capital A to the lowercase a
divided by capital B to the

154
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,920
lowercase B.

155
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,220
And what's interesting about
this, and this is a bit of a

156
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,640
simplification, because
this doesn't

157
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,980
apply to all reactions.

158
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,920
But to most things that you're
going to encounter in an intro

159
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,160
chemistry class, this is true,
that once you establish this

160
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,580
equilibrium constant for a
certain temperature-- it's

161
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,090
only true for a certain
temperature-- then you can

162
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,530
change the concentrations and
then be able to predict what

163
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,760
the resulting concentrations
are going to be.

164
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,450
Let me give you an example.

165
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,230
So let's say that after you
did this equilibrium

166
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:59,770
reaction-- and actually, just
to make things hit home a

167
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,110
little bit, let me take this
Haber process reaction and

168
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,090
write it in the same form.

169
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,340
So if I wanted to write the
equilibrium constant for the

170
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,800
Haber reaction, or if I wanted
to calculate it, I would let

171
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,990
this reaction go at
some temperature.

172
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,320
So this is only true at-- let's
say we're doing it at 25

173
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,540
Celsius, which is roughly
room temperature.

174
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,550
So what I would do is I would
take the products.

175
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:23,790
So the only product
is ammonia, NH3.

176
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,280
I raise it to the power of the
number of moles that's

177
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,650
produced for every 1 mole
of nitrogen gas

178
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,030
and 3 moles of hydrogen.

179
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,880
So I raise it to
the power of 2.

180
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,350
So that's what that gets me.

181
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:37,990
And I divide it by
the reactants.

182
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,400
So 1 mole of nitrogen, so
I would just put the

183
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:46,860
concentration of the nitrogen,
plus 3 moles of

184
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,830
hydrogen-- oh, no, no.

185
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:48,760
I shouldn't write
a plus there.

186
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,890
It's multiplied.

187
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:55,200
So times the hydrogen, and I
raise it to the third power,

188
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,090
because for every 1 mole of
nitrogen, I have 3 moles of

189
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,780
hydrogen and then 2
moles of ammonia.

190
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,060
And if I were to calculate this,
remember, when I put

191
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,880
these in brackets, I'm
figuring out the

192
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,730
concentration.

193
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,430
So I would have to figure
out the moles per liter.

194
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:14,170
Or sometimes they say, the
molarity of each of these

195
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,430
things, and it'll get
me some constant.

196
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,630
If I change it, I can go and
calculate the rest, so let me

197
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,910
just do an example right now.

198
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:29,480
So let's say I have 1 mole of
molecule A plus 2 moles of

199
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:40,710
molecule B are in equilibrium
with 3 moles of molecule C.

200
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:44,690
And let's say that once we're
in equilibrium, we go and we

201
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,820
measure the concentrations,
and we figure out that the

202
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:55,100
concentration of A is 1
molar, which is equal

203
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,520
to 1 mole per liter.

204
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,360
That's the concentration of A.

205
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,990
We figure out that once we're
in equilibrium, the

206
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:17,480
concentration of B is equal
to 3 molar, which

207
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,680
means 3 moles per liter.

208
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,750
And let's say that once we're
in that equilibrium, the

209
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:35,100
concentration of C is equal to
point-- well, I don't want to

210
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,780
do something too-- let's say
it's equal to 1 molar as well.

211
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,740
I should get rid of that point
there, because I don't want to

212
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,200
say 0.1 molar, so it's
just 1 molar.

213
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,410
So if we wanted to calculate the
equilibrium constant for

214
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:53,000
this reaction, we just take C,
the concentration of C over

215
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,770
here, so let's see.

216
00:10:53,770 --> 00:11:00,970
The equilibrium constant is
equal to the concentration of

217
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:12,640
C to the third power divided by
the concentration of A to

218
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,740
the first power-- because
there's only 1 mole of A for

219
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,480
every 3 of C and 2 of B-- times
the concentration of--

220
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,640
I'll do it in that color--
B to the third power.

221
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,820
So if we needed to calculate
this, concentration of C is 1

222
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:35,130
molar, and we're raising it to
the third power, divided by

223
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:39,950
concentration of A is 1 molar
times the concentration of B,

224
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:44,280
which is 3 molars, to
the third power.

225
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:51,300
So this is equal to 1/27.

226
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,940
There's a couple of things
we can think about.

227
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,800
The fact that this is less than
1, what does that mean?

228
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:05,320
Well, that means that our
concentration of our reactants

229
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,660
is much larger than the
concentration of the products,

230
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,600
where we view just the products
as whatever's on the

231
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,050
right-hand side of
the equation.

232
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,490
So once this reaction goes to
equilibrium, we're still left

233
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:18,960
with a lot more of
this than this.

234
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,860
And because we're left with
a lot more of that, our

235
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,870
equilibrium constant is less
than 1, which means that the

236
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,920
reaction favors this
direction.

237
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,455
It favors the backward
direction.

238
00:12:29,455 --> 00:12:32,770
   

239
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:35,250
Think about it.

240
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,720
Because there's more of this,
this must be happening more

241
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,700
than the left-to-right
reaction.

242
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,100
The left to right might be a
small direction like this,

243
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,900
while more is happening there,
and that's why we're finding

244
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,650
more reaction here, and that
causes the equilibrium

245
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,150
constant to be less than 1.

246
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:55,270
On the other hand, if the
equilibrium constant was

247
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,470
greater than 1, that means that
this numerator is greater

248
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,800
than this denominator.

249
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,730
Which would imply that you have
more concentration-- once

250
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,560
you're in equilibrium, you end
up with a lot more of the

251
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,530
stuff on the right than you end
up with the stuff on the

252
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:09,030
left, so then that means the
reaction would be going in the

253
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,200
forward direction.

254
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,340
The other interesting thing is
you can then figure out, well,

255
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:19,420
what happens if I add another
mole of A to the reaction?

256
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,370
So let's say I throw some
A into the reaction.

257
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:24,630
   

258
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,300
I add some concentration of A.

259
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:37,110
So now my new A is equal to 2.

260
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,070
Let's say my new A
is equal to 2.

261
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:45,170
Let's say my new B, let's say
that I want to-- well,

262
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:49,820
actually, we can figure out
the relation between the--

263
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,760
actually, instead of going into
this situation where I

264
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,150
change the concentration, let me
do that in the next video,

265
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,550
because I just realized that I'm
running very low on time.

266
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,700
But hopefully, you got a good
sense of what the equilibrium

267
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,280
constant is all about
and how it's

268
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,130
measured or how it's defined.

269
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,890
And in the next video, we're
going to talk a little bit

270
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:07,070
about how else it
could be useful.

271
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,540
In this video, you just said,
oh, if it's less than 1, that

272
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,730
means that the backward
reaction is favored.

273
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,090
If it's greater than 1, the
forward reaction is favored.

274
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,110
In the next video, we'll get a
little intuition, hopefully,

275
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:21,800
on why it is defined this way as
opposed to, say, this way.

276
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,480
My intuition said, hey, why
isn't it three times the

277
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,620
concentration of C divided by
one times the concentration of

278
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,810
A plus three times the
concentration of B?

279
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,510
This might have been more
intuitive to me, but this

280
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,460
isn't the case.

281
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,140
This is what actually is
constant, regardless of how

282
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,820
you change the concentrations
of the various reactants.

283
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:47,880
So maybe we'll talk a little bit
about why this is true and

284
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,570
not necessarily this.
