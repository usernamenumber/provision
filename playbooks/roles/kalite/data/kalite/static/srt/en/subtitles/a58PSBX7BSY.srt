1
00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:09,754
When most people buy a house

2
00:00:09,754 --> 00:00:12,041
they need to borrow money for some part

3
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:13,833
of the purchase price of the house.

4
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:17,390
So let's say that we have a house right over here

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:22,384
and the purchase price is $200,000

6
00:00:22,384 --> 00:00:23,888
And I want to buy this house

7
00:00:23,888 --> 00:00:30,610
and I've saved up $40,000.

8
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,122
So this is my savings, and so I will use this as a downpayment

9
00:00:34,122 --> 00:00:38,437
but I still need to borrow the rest of the money

10
00:00:38,437 --> 00:00:40,035
in order to get to $200,000.

11
00:00:40,035 --> 00:00:44,787
So I'm going to have to get the balance,

12
00:00:44,787 --> 00:00:51,723
the $160,000 as a loan.

13
00:00:51,723 --> 00:00:53,743
And the type of loan people get

14
00:00:53,743 --> 00:00:59,454
or they usually get, is called a mortgage.

15
00:00:59,454 --> 00:01:01,354
And a mortgage is really just a loan

16
00:01:01,354 --> 00:01:04,214
where if you don't pay the loan off,

17
00:01:04,214 --> 00:01:06,725
the person that you borrowed the money from

18
00:01:06,725 --> 00:01:09,780
gets the house. So another way to think about it is

19
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,130
it's a loan that is secured by the house until you

20
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,357
pay off the loan. And when you pay off the loan,

21
00:01:16,357 --> 00:01:17,843
it is your house to keep. But at any point,

22
00:01:17,843 --> 00:01:21,130
if you don't pay it, the bank can come and take the house

23
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,243
and that is called a foreclosure.

24
00:01:23,243 --> 00:01:25,093
Now what I want to focus on in this video

25
00:01:25,093 --> 00:01:28,028
is the types of mortgage loans you will typically see,

26
00:01:28,028 --> 00:01:31,131
and give you at least the beginning of an understanding

27
00:01:31,131 --> 00:01:35,521
of how to understand what these different types of loans mean.

28
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:37,456
So all of these scenarios, let's just assume

29
00:01:37,456 --> 00:01:41,741
that I'm in the market to borrow $160,000

30
00:01:41,741 --> 00:01:44,003
for this house that I'm about to buy.

31
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:47,763
So if you look at any financial website, or any of the major

32
00:01:47,763 --> 00:01:51,744
web portals, they'll give you quotes for mortgage rates

33
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,207
and you'll see something like this.

34
00:01:53,207 --> 00:01:55,930
I made these numbers really simple, normally you'll have some decimals here

35
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,993
5.25%, 4.18%, I made these numbers a little bit simpler

36
00:01:59,993 --> 00:02:02,680
just to make them simpler.

37
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,888
So, these are the typical types of mortgages you will see

38
00:02:05,888 --> 00:02:07,546
but if you contact a mortgage broker, they'll

39
00:02:07,546 --> 00:02:09,528
have many, many more types, more exotic types,

40
00:02:09,528 --> 00:02:11,305
but these are the most common

41
00:02:11,305 --> 00:02:12,419
this is what we will cover in this video,

42
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:14,991
and hopefully this will give you a sense of what the other types

43
00:02:14,991 --> 00:02:16,359
of mortgages are like.

44
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:19,623
A 30-year fixed mortgage means that your

45
00:02:19,623 --> 00:02:23,267
payment and your interest rate are fixed over 30 years,

46
00:02:23,267 --> 00:02:25,613
and over the course of those 30 years,

47
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:28,316
you will pay off your loan.

48
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:35,249
So in this situation, so this is a 30... let me write it over here

49
00:02:35,249 --> 00:02:40,256
So let's think about a 30 year fixed mortgage.

50
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,081
What will happen is you will have a fixed mortgage

51
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:47,741
payment every month. I'll draw a little bar graph

52
00:02:47,741 --> 00:02:50,197
to show the size of your payment.

53
00:02:50,197 --> 00:02:51,680
You'll see why I'm doing that in a second.

54
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,884
So let me just draw a little bit of a graph here.

55
00:02:53,884 --> 00:02:55,781
So each of these blocks represent your

56
00:02:55,781 --> 00:02:56,548
monthly payment for that month

57
00:02:56,548 --> 00:02:59,530
and I'm just going to make up the number

58
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,959
let's say it's $2,000. I actually haven't

59
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,284
figured out the math of what is the exact payment

60
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:05,030
for a 30-year fixed with a 5% interest rate

61
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,494
for $160,000. But let's just say

62
00:03:07,494 --> 00:03:12,024
for the sake of simplicity, let's say it's $2,000 a month.

63
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:14,841
So this height right over here

64
00:03:14,841 --> 00:03:18,780
let me make it like this

65
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,296
So this is $2,000 a month.

66
00:03:22,296 --> 00:03:26,970
$2,000. This is month one, then you will pay

67
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,096
$2,000 in month 2, and so on a so forth,

68
00:03:30,096 --> 00:03:35,039
all the way... if you have 30 years times 12 months

69
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:37,503
you're gonna get all the way to month 360, and

70
00:03:37,503 --> 00:03:41,464
that is going to be your last payment.

71
00:03:41,464 --> 00:03:44,922
Month 360 is the last payment in the year 30,

72
00:03:44,922 --> 00:03:46,718
and you would have paid off your loan.

73
00:03:46,718 --> 00:03:49,657
The interesting thing here is, in the first month

74
00:03:49,657 --> 00:03:51,938
since you have borrowed so much from the bank

75
00:03:51,938 --> 00:03:55,949
you've borrowed $160,000. The interest that you have to pay on it

76
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:57,547
is going to be pretty large.

77
00:03:57,547 --> 00:03:59,062
So most of the initial payments

78
00:03:59,062 --> 00:04:00,844
are going to be interest.

79
00:04:00,844 --> 00:04:03,019
So I'm going to the interest in this magenta color

80
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:07,461
That's not magenta... this is magenta.

81
00:04:07,461 --> 00:04:11,282
In that first payment, it's going to be mostly interest.

82
00:04:11,282 --> 00:04:14,001
And you're going to pay a little bit off of the actual loan,

83
00:04:14,001 --> 00:04:16,364
so that right there is your principle payment.

84
00:04:16,364 --> 00:04:19,483
So let's say after that first month, the principle part

85
00:04:19,483 --> 00:04:23,764
of that $2,000 is (and I'm just making up numbers for the sake of simplicity),

86
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:27,920
Let's say that that is $200, and the interest portion

87
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,967
is $1,800. I'm not actually working it through

88
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:32,844
with the assumptions. You don't even have to assume

89
00:04:32,844 --> 00:04:35,811
that's a $160,000 loan. But the general idea

90
00:04:35,811 --> 00:04:37,808
here is that after this first month, you would have

91
00:04:37,808 --> 00:04:41,308
paid $200 off of your loan. So if it was a $160,000 loan

92
00:04:41,308 --> 00:04:47,047
after that first month, you don't owe $160,000 minus $2,000

93
00:04:47,047 --> 00:04:50,131
because $1,800 of that was interest. You now owe

94
00:04:50,131 --> 00:04:53,674
$160,000 minus $200, so you now owe

95
00:04:53,674 --> 00:05:00,021
$159,800.

96
00:05:00,021 --> 00:05:01,702
And so in the next period,

97
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:04,006
your interest is going to be just a little bit lower.

98
00:05:04,006 --> 00:05:09,931
And your principle, since you're paying the same fixed payment

99
00:05:09,931 --> 00:05:11,694
of $2,000 every month, is going to be a little bit higher.

100
00:05:11,694 --> 00:05:17,013
Maybe it's going to be the next month something slightly higher

101
00:05:17,013 --> 00:05:20,165
I don't know, something like $202, I don't know...

102
00:05:20,165 --> 00:05:21,496
And you keep going like that

103
00:05:21,496 --> 00:05:22,964
and the math works out, they you figure out the payment

104
00:05:22,964 --> 00:05:26,513
so that by that last payment

105
00:05:26,513 --> 00:05:30,669
you're paying very little interest,

106
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:33,572
and most of that last payment is principle.

107
00:05:33,572 --> 00:05:36,363
it's actually being used for the loan.

108
00:05:36,363 --> 00:05:38,000
And then after that last payment

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,638
the loan is paid off. And this will happen

110
00:05:40,638 --> 00:05:44,019
over 30 years. This is a 30 year term.

111
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:46,441
A 15-year fixed is the same exact idea

112
00:05:46,441 --> 00:05:54,167
except, instead of it taking 30 years to pay off the loan

113
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:56,703
you're going to do it over 15 years

114
00:05:56,703 --> 00:06:00,761
so it instead of it being 360 months in the 30 year case

115
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:05,720
it is going to be 180 months

116
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,363
and because of that your payment for the same loan amount

117
00:06:08,363 --> 00:06:10,547
is going to be higher every month

118
00:06:10,547 --> 00:06:12,144
because you're paying it off quicker

119
00:06:12,144 --> 00:06:13,430
you're paying it off in fewer months.

120
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,742
Instead of $2,000 per month, maybe it is something like

121
00:06:16,742 --> 00:06:21,179
$2,800 a month for the 15 year case.

122
00:06:21,179 --> 00:06:23,406
You're paying it off quicker.

123
00:06:23,406 --> 00:06:28,022
The five one ARM case, you'll see there are many types of ARMs,

124
00:06:28,022 --> 00:06:29,458
and I'm gonna explain to you in a second what an ARM is

125
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,058
but the five-one is the most typical

126
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,926
and I will explain that in a second.

127
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:46,216
ARM means Adjustable Rate Mortgage.

128
00:06:46,216 --> 00:06:48,778
And as you see in these situations,

129
00:06:48,778 --> 00:06:51,694
we have the word "fixed," and they're called fixed

130
00:06:51,694 --> 00:06:53,806
because the interest rate was fixed.

131
00:06:53,806 --> 00:06:56,712
Whatever your remaining loan balance was,

132
00:06:56,712 --> 00:07:01,333
you paid the same fixed amount of interest for the next period

133
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,297
so for this 30 year fixed, we are being quoted

134
00:07:04,297 --> 00:07:08,004
a 5% fixed rate over the next years (will not change),

135
00:07:08,004 --> 00:07:11,283
for the 15 year, we're quoted a 4% fixed rate

136
00:07:11,283 --> 00:07:14,606
for the ARM, the rate can change.

137
00:07:14,606 --> 00:07:17,234
When someone tells you about a five-one ARM

138
00:07:17,234 --> 00:07:19,384
They're actually talking about something called

139
00:07:19,384 --> 00:07:22,613
a hybrid ARM, but the general idea behind an adjustable rate mortgage

140
00:07:22,613 --> 00:07:24,845
is the amount of interest you pay on your remaining balance

141
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:28,954
will change according to some index.

142
00:07:28,954 --> 00:07:31,840
The most typical types of adjustable rate mortgages

143
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,374
are things like this hybrid ARM.

144
00:07:36,374 --> 00:07:38,562
This is a hybrid. And a hybrid, it's viewed as a mixture

145
00:07:38,562 --> 00:07:41,241
of two things, or a combination of 2 things

146
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:43,919
and what a hybrid adjustable rate mortgage is

147
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,295
is it has a fixed rate for some period of time

148
00:07:47,295 --> 00:07:51,790
in this case it's a fixed rate for 5 years.

149
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:54,271
and then the interest rate can change

150
00:07:54,271 --> 00:07:58,211
once a year after that, or every 1 years after that

151
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:01,231
And that's what this right over here is telling you

152
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:04,217
So in the case of an adjustable rate mortgage,

153
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:07,196
your payment might look something like this

154
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:09,514
I'll just make up numbers for simplicity

155
00:08:09,514 --> 00:08:12,125
just to give you a flavor of what it might look like.

156
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,831
So in the case of a five-one, your first five years

157
00:08:14,831 --> 00:08:21,753
are fixed. So month 1 can look like that,

158
00:08:21,753 --> 00:08:24,027
month 2 is going to look like that

159
00:08:24,027 --> 00:08:27,671
you go all the way to month 60, which is the last month

160
00:08:27,671 --> 00:08:32,942
of 5 years. So that's month 1, that's month 2, that is month 60

161
00:08:32,942 --> 00:08:36,703
This is over the course of 5 years

162
00:08:36,703 --> 00:08:41,118
And over the course of 5 years, the idea

163
00:08:41,118 --> 00:08:44,744
is fairly similar. Some part of this is going to be

164
00:08:44,744 --> 00:08:49,208
interest, and the remainder is going to actually be used

165
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,996
to pay down the loan. And each month you're going to

166
00:08:51,996 --> 00:08:53,780
pay down a little bit more of the loan

167
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,963
and you're going to have to pay a little less in interest

168
00:08:56,963 --> 00:09:05,047
because you have less remaining on your loan.

169
00:09:05,047 --> 00:09:11,372
But by year 5, or month 60, you still haven't paid your loan off

170
00:09:11,372 --> 00:09:14,104
So maybe the interest is right over here,

171
00:09:14,104 --> 00:09:17,080
Maybe the interest is right over there

172
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,363
and actually it may be higher than that

173
00:09:18,363 --> 00:09:19,572
I don't want to be too exact

174
00:09:19,572 --> 00:09:27,570
and then this is what you're paying down from the loan

175
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,772
A hybrid adjustable rate mortgage, after that 5 year period

176
00:09:29,772 --> 00:09:34,131
The bank can now change the interest rate

177
00:09:34,131 --> 00:09:37,007
And the interest rate is going to be dependent

178
00:09:37,007 --> 00:09:39,245
on some kind of underlying thing that every one is

179
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,250
paying attention to. And so if that underlying thing

180
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:47,995
increases in interest. So in this five-one ARM

181
00:09:47,995 --> 00:09:52,083
it starts off at a 3% interest. If because of this thing

182
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,008
that we're paying attention to

183
00:09:54,008 --> 00:09:55,741
and I'll talk more about that in a second

184
00:09:55,741 --> 00:09:58,482
interest rates all of a sudden go up

185
00:09:58,482 --> 00:10:00,313
and let's say they go up a lot

186
00:10:00,313 --> 00:10:04,575
then all of a sudden your payment could increase.

187
00:10:04,575 --> 00:10:07,929
Because the general idea behind a five-one ARM

188
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:10,380
is that you are still going to pay it off

189
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,847
in 30 years. So they typically, I should say,

190
00:10:12,847 --> 00:10:17,689
have a 30 year term. So if you just stick with this loan

191
00:10:17,689 --> 00:10:20,486
you never try to borrow other money to replace this loan

192
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,230
which is called a refinance

193
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,543
you stick with this loan, it will take you 30 years

194
00:10:24,543 --> 00:10:26,887
to pay it off. But after the first 5 years

195
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:30,674
The amount of interest you pay might actually change

196
00:10:30,674 --> 00:10:32,682
So your payment might actually change.

197
00:10:32,682 --> 00:10:35,374
So if the interest rate goes up

198
00:10:35,374 --> 00:10:38,233
All of a sudden, you might have to pay

199
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:39,517
a lot more interest

200
00:10:39,517 --> 00:10:41,071
all of a sudden in month 61, or in year 6.

201
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:49,850
Let me do that part in that same blue color

202
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,396
And that for year 6, since this is a five-one ARM

203
00:10:53,396 --> 00:10:55,624
They can't change the interest rate again until

204
00:10:55,624 --> 00:10:58,095
year 7, so you'll pay this constant amount

205
00:10:58,095 --> 00:10:59,992
until year 7. But then they will change the rate again.

206
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:04,618
And there usually are some caps on how much they can change the rate

207
00:11:04,618 --> 00:11:07,131
each year or how much they can change the rate in total

208
00:11:07,131 --> 00:11:09,080
but it is a little bit riskier

209
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,971
because you really don't know what your payment might be

210
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:14,289
in year 6 or 7, especially if interest rates go up a lot

211
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:16,158
Now you might be asking,

212
00:11:16,158 --> 00:11:21,433
"What determines what that new interest rate is after the 5 years?"

213
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:23,572
And they usually pick some type of index

214
00:11:23,572 --> 00:11:28,570
the most typical are treasury securities

215
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:32,010
so they'll look at the 10-year treasury interest rate

216
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,816
that essentially the government has to pay when it borrows money

217
00:11:34,816 --> 00:11:37,368
and they'll usually take some premium over this

218
00:11:37,368 --> 00:11:40,365
So if the 10-year treasuries are at 2%

219
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:43,275
The bank might put in your loan documents

220
00:11:43,275 --> 00:11:46,568
that after the initial 5 year fixed period

221
00:11:46,568 --> 00:11:52,097
you will pay 10-year treasury rate, plus 1%.

222
00:11:52,097 --> 00:11:54,470
So you start off paying the 3%, that's fixed

223
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,556
even if the treasury does all sorts of crazy things

224
00:11:56,556 --> 00:11:58,665
even if it goes up to 5%, you're just going to

225
00:11:58,665 --> 00:12:01,441
keep paying the 3% for the first 5 years

226
00:12:01,441 --> 00:12:03,479
but then in that 6th year

227
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:05,437
let's say that (let me just write it over here)

228
00:12:05,437 --> 00:12:10,490
let's say that in year 6 the treasury security rate

229
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:14,292
now has bumped up to 4%

230
00:12:14,292 --> 00:12:17,276
then by contract, by what's in your loan document

231
00:12:17,276 --> 00:12:20,493
you're going to have to pay that, plus 1%

232
00:12:20,493 --> 00:12:23,544
so now your mortgage is going to reset

233
00:12:23,544 --> 00:12:25,662
to have a 5% rate, have a higher rate.

234
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,296
You might get lucky though

235
00:12:28,296 --> 00:12:30,629
maybe the treasury rate goes down

236
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:35,621
maybe it goes to 1%, and then your mortgage rate would actually be 1% plus 1%

237
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:38,626
so it could actually go down to 2%

238
00:12:38,626 --> 00:12:41,535
But the general idea is that that's a little riskier

239
00:12:41,535 --> 00:12:44,231
because you really don't know how predictable that payment

240
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:45,255
is going to be.

241
00:12:45,255 --> 00:12:48,290
And if you look at most times

242
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,447
if you look at quoted interest rates

243
00:12:50,447 --> 00:12:52,603
you'll see that the 30-year fixed rate is higher

244
00:12:52,603 --> 00:12:56,862
than the 15-year fixed rate, which is higher than

245
00:12:56,862 --> 00:13:00,464
the adjustable rate. And that's because the bank,

246
00:13:00,464 --> 00:13:02,396
there's a couple of different forms of risk

247
00:13:02,396 --> 00:13:04,536
but the bank is taking the least amount of risk

248
00:13:04,536 --> 00:13:06,091
on the adjustable rate mortgage

249
00:13:06,091 --> 00:13:08,686
and taking the most amount of risk on the 30 year fixed.

250
00:13:08,686 --> 00:13:11,555
And the biggest risk here, there's the risk that you don't pay it off

251
00:13:11,555 --> 00:13:13,994
But that's why they like to see a downpayment

252
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:15,446
because they can get the house back and hopefully

253
00:13:15,446 --> 00:13:18,613
the house doesn't devalue by more than the amount

254
00:13:18,613 --> 00:13:21,266
of your down payment. But even more than that

255
00:13:21,266 --> 00:13:22,730
there's an interest rate risk.

256
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,685
What happens if the bank lends you money

257
00:13:24,685 --> 00:13:25,795
lends you a big chunk of money at 5%

258
00:13:25,795 --> 00:13:28,506
and then interest rates go up to 6%, 7%

259
00:13:28,506 --> 00:13:32,457
what if they go up to 10%? What if the banks borrowing costs,

260
00:13:32,457 --> 00:13:34,546
the amount of money the bank has to pay people to borrow money,

261
00:13:34,546 --> 00:13:38,104
goes up to 10%, then they will be taking a loss on your loan

262
00:13:38,104 --> 00:13:41,764
They're fixing it for so long, that's why they want to

263
00:13:41,764 --> 00:13:43,595
make up for some of that risk by charging you

264
00:13:43,595 --> 00:13:45,391
higher risk.

265
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,610
A 15 year loan, a little bit less risk

266
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,514
so they'll have a little bit lower interest.

267
00:13:49,514 --> 00:13:51,754
A five-one ARM, even lower risk

268
00:13:51,754 --> 00:13:53,406
they're only fixed for 5 years

269
00:13:53,406 --> 00:13:57,933
and then after that, this will float with the prevailing interest rate

270
00:13:57,933 --> 00:13:59,596
on an annual basis.

271
00:13:59,596 --> 00:14:02,214
So hopefully that give you a little bit of a primer

272
00:14:02,214 --> 00:14:05,510
of mortgage interest rates

273
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,802
but I want to really make sure you don't view this video

274
00:14:06,802 --> 00:14:09,488
as all you need to take out a loan.

275
00:14:09,488 --> 00:14:11,805
It's super important to read the fine print and details

276
00:14:11,805 --> 00:14:13,471
on what's happening with that loan,

277
00:14:13,471 --> 00:14:16,737
especially if you're buying something more, if you're taking out a more exotic

278
00:14:16,737 --> 00:14:17,746
like an adjustable rate mortgage

279
00:14:17,746 --> 00:14:22,980
or an interest only loan, or an option ARM

280
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
or any o
