1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,530
   

2
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,720
Let's say I have
some matrix A.

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,090
If I'm trying to determine
the null space of A, I'm

4
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,200
essentially asking -- I'm
essentially just asking, look

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,740
if we set up the equation Ax is
equal to the 0 vector, the

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:21,090
null space of A is all the x's
that satisfy this equation.

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:29,800
All the x's that satisfy
that equation.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,370
Ax is equal to the
0 vector, or you

9
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,680
could call it the system.

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,930
And the way you would solve it
-- and we've done this many

11
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,900
times, this was many videos
ago -- you would make an

12
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,680
augmented matrix with this.

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,510
So the augmented matrix
would look like that.

14
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,320
And you would have the 0 vector
on the right hand side.

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,530
And then you'd perform a bunch
of row operations to put the

16
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,770
left hand side into reduced
row echelon form.

17
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,070
So, you would do a bunch
of operations.

18
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,040
The left hand side would go into
reduced row echelon form.

19
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,950
Let's call that reduced
row echelon form of A.

20
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:04,239
And then the right hand side
is just going to stay 0,

21
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,100
because you performed the
same row operations.

22
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,040
But when you perform those row
operations on 0, you just get

23
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,850
the 0 vector right here.

24
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,080
And then when you un-augment--
when you create the system

25
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,840
back from this right here,
because these two systems are

26
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,500
equivalent, you are essentially
going to have your

27
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,320
solution set look something
like this.

28
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,960
You're going to have your--
let me write it like this,

29
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,840
your solution set is
going to be equal

30
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,230
to some scalar multiple.

31
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,870
Let's say that, of your free
variables, your free variables

32
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,060
are going to be the
scalar multiples.

33
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,820
And you've seen this
multiple times, so

34
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,860
I'll stay fairly general.

35
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,520
But it's going to be some
multiple times, let's say,

36
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,880
vector 1 plus some other scalar
times vector 2, these

37
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,200
scalars tend to be your free
variables-- times vector 2 all

38
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,930
the way to, I don't
know, whatever, c

39
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,600
times your nth vector.

40
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,830
I'm just trying to
stay general.

41
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,910
We haven't seen any examples
that had more than two or

42
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,800
three vectors here.

43
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,100
But this is what, essentially,
your null space is spanned by

44
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,220
these vectors right there.

45
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,110
You get an equation-- you get
a solution set that looks

46
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,560
something like that, and you
call that your null space.

47
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,220
We've done that multiple
times.

48
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,340
Your null space is that,
so it's all the linear

49
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:20,060
combinations, or it's the span,
of these little vectors

50
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,690
that you get here.

51
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:25,660
And 1 and 2, all the
way to n, n.

52
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,670
This is nothing new.

53
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,010
I'm just restating something
that we've seen multiple,

54
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:29,790
multiple times.

55
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,330
We actually did this in
the previous video.

56
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,850
I just maybe never wrote
it exactly like this.

57
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,110
But what about the case when
you're solving the

58
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,760
inhomogeneous equation.

59
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,090
So the inhomogeneous equation
looks like this.

60
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:47,920
So if I want to solve Ax is
equal to b, I would do

61
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,230
something very similar
to this.

62
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,640
I will create an augmented
matrix.

63
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,200
We'll have A on the left hand
side, and I'd put b on the

64
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,010
right hand side, and I'll
perform a bunch of row

65
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,006
operations to put A into reduced
row echelon form.

66
00:03:01,006 --> 00:03:02,750
So, let me do that.

67
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,250
So this left hand side will
be the reduced row

68
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,300
echelon form of A.

69
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,650
And then the right hand side,
whatever operations I did on

70
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,990
A, I have to do on
the entire row.

71
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,040
So I'll also be doing
them to b.

72
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,010
So I'll have some
new vector here.

73
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:20,060
Maybe I'll call it the vector--
maybe I'll call that

74
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,200
the vector b prime.

75
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,640
It's going to be different
than b, but let's

76
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,430
just call it b prime.

77
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,100
And so when you when you go back
to your-- I guess when

78
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,520
you go out of the augmented
matrix world and rewrite it as

79
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,380
a system, and you solve for
it, and we did this in the

80
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,870
last video-- you'll get
your solution set.

81
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,345
Your solution set that satisfies
this is going to be,

82
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:42,500
x is going to be equal to this
b prime, whatever this new

83
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,890
vector is, this b prime plus
something that looks

84
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,770
exactly like this.

85
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,380
It looks exactly like that, in
fact I'll copy and paste it,

86
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,130
it'll look exactly like this.

87
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:01,640
Let me see if it did copy.

88
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,600
Copy and paste it.

89
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,680
Edit, copy, and let
me paste it.

90
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,090
So it will look something that
looks exactly like that.

91
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:17,700
And we said in the last video
that you can kind of-- given

92
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,959
this you can kind of think of
the solution set to the

93
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,430
inhomogeneous equation is
equivalent to some particular

94
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:31,070
solution, let's call that x
particular, some particular

95
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:35,490
solution, plus some member
of your null space.

96
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,410
So you could say it's plus some
homogeneous solution.

97
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,820
So if you just pick particular
values for a, b and c, all of

98
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,520
the different multiples of the
vector that span your null

99
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,940
space, you'll get some

100
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,910
particular homogeneous solution.

101
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,380
So what I implied in the last
video, and I didn't show it to

102
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,725
you rigorously, is that any
solution to the inhomogeneous

103
00:04:57,725 --> 00:05:01,990
system-- let me write it this
way, any solution-- and do it

104
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:09,740
in white-- that's not white--
any solution to the

105
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:23,370
inhomogeneous system Ax is equal
to b, this is a claim I

106
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:34,010
made, will take the form-- some
particular solution--

107
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,830
that was this right here,
maybe I should do it in

108
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:39,570
green-- this is this right
here-- When you do the reduced

109
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:42,300
row echelon form, it becomes
that b prime vector.

110
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:49,270
Plus some homogeneous solution,
so some member of

111
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,580
the null space.

112
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,860
Now I didn't prove it to
you, but I implied

113
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,665
that this is the case.

114
00:05:54,665 --> 00:05:57,040
And what I want to in this video
is actually do a little

115
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,790
bit of a more rigorous group,
but it's actually fairly

116
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,390
straightforward.

117
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:06,040
So let's first of all verify
that this is a solution.

118
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,050
So let's verify that
this is a solution.

119
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,690
So let's just put this into
out original equation.

120
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:14,000
Let's remember our original
equation was Ax is equal to b.

121
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,250
So let's verify.

122
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,760
   

123
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,950
Let me write it as a question.

124
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:24,460
Is that particular solution,
plus some homogeneous

125
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:32,290
solution, a solution to
Ax is equal to b?

126
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,240
Well to do that you just put
that in the place of x.

127
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,100
So let's try it out.

128
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,230
So A times this guy right here,
times some particular

129
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:46,540
solution, plus some homogeneous
solution is going

130
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,050
to be equal to A times the
particular solution, plus A

131
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,440
times some member of
my null space.

132
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,980
And what is this equal to?

133
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,280
That is going to
be equal to b.

134
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:58,510
Right?

135
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,290
We're saying that this
is a particular

136
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,370
solution to this equation.

137
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,240
That is going to be equal to b
and that this is going to be

138
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,540
equal to the 0 vector because
this is a solution to our

139
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,300
homogeneous equation.

140
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,820
So this is going to be
equal to b plus 0, or

141
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,050
it's equal to b.

142
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:19,130
So A times this vector right
here is indeed equal to b.

143
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,430
So this is a solution.

144
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,750
This is a solution, yes.

145
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,850
Now the next question is, does
every solution to the

146
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,400
inhomogeneous system, or does
any solution to the

147
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,860
inhomogeneous system,
take this form?

148
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:48,810
So does any solution x, to Ax
equal to b, take the form x is

149
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:53,200
equal to some particular
solution, plus a member of our

150
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,940
null space, or plus a
homogeneous solution.

151
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:00,700
So to do that let's take-- let's
test out what happens

152
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:08,270
when we multiply the vector
A times x-- let me

153
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,860
write it this way.

154
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:20,460
let's say that x is any solution
to Ax is equal to b.

155
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,790
Let's start off with that.

156
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:26,800
And let's see what happens when
we take A times x minus

157
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,130
some particular solution
to this.

158
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,820
So when we distribute the matrix
vector product, you get

159
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:39,940
A times our any solution
minus A times

160
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,460
our particular solution.

161
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,700
Now what is this going
to be equal to?

162
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,180
We're saying that this is a
solution to Ax equals b.

163
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,960
So this is going to
be equal to b.

164
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,100
And of course, any particular
solution to this when you

165
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,870
multiply it by A is also
going to be equal to b.

166
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,310
So it's going to be b minus b,
so that's going to be equal to

167
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,780
the 0 vector.

168
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:03,700
Or another way to think about
it is, x, the vector x minus

169
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:12,190
our particular solution is
a solution to A times

170
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,180
x is equal to 0.

171
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,350
Think about this if you take
this, in parentheses right

172
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,890
here, and you put it right
there, and you multiply it

173
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,880
times A you get the 0 vector.

174
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,010
We just did that, you get the
0 vector, because when you

175
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,320
multiply each of these guys
by A you get b and

176
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,810
you get b minus b.

177
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,740
And so that you get 0.

178
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:35,990
So you can say that x minus--
so our any solution x minus

179
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:51,520
the particular solution of x is
a member of our null space.

180
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:51,760
Right?

181
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,420
By definition our null space is
all of the x's that satisfy

182
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,910
this equation.

183
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,450
So, since its a member of our
null space, we can say that it

184
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:03,010
is equal to-- so our any
solution minus our particular

185
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,920
solution is equal to some member
of our null space.

186
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,690
We could say that it is equal
to a homogeneous solution.

187
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,870
There might be more than one.

188
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:17,245
A homogeneous solution.

189
00:10:17,245 --> 00:10:20,730
   

190
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,830
Now, if we just add our
particular solution to both

191
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:28,300
sides of this, we get that any
solution-- remember, we assume

192
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,780
that x is any solution to this--
that any solution is

193
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,420
equal to our homogeneous
solution, is equal to a

194
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:40,120
homogeneous solution, plus a
particular solution-- or plus

195
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,820
our particular solution.

196
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,360
So we've proven it both ways.

197
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,980
That this is a solution to our
inhomogeneous equation, and

198
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,130
that any solution to our
inhomogeneous equation takes

199
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,450
this form right here.

200
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:57,940
Now why am I so concerned with
this, and I've been kind of

201
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,910
fixated on this inhomogeneous
equation for some time.

202
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,060
But we've been talking about the
notion of a transformation

203
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,310
being one-to-one.

204
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:09,370
   

205
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,850
That was one of the two
conditions for a

206
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,200
transformation to
be invertible.

207
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,180
Now to be one-to-one-- so let me
draw a transformation here.

208
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,930
So let's say this is my domain,
X, and this is my

209
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:28,910
co-domain right here, Y, and I
have a transformation that

210
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,360
maps from X to Y.

211
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,630
   

212
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:37,520
In order for T to be
one-to-one-- so I'll write it

213
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,230
like this, one-to-one.

214
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,830
In order for T to be one-to-one
that means for any

215
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:50,600
b that you pick here, for any
b that is a member of our

216
00:11:50,600 --> 00:12:02,450
co-domain, there is at most
one solution to A times x.

217
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:05,380
And I'm assuming that A is our
transformation matrix, so we

218
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,300
can write our transformation T
as being equal to some matrix

219
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,930
times our vector
in our domain.

220
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:16,790
So this would be Ax if this is
x right here, so T would map

221
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,830
from that to that right there.

222
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,040
So in order for our
transformation to be

223
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,450
one-to-one, that means if you
pick any b here, there has to

224
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:28,300
be, at most, one solution
to Ax is equal to b.

225
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,090
Or another way to say that is
that there is at most one guy

226
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,750
that maps into that element
of our co-domain.

227
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,790
There might be none.

228
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,870
So there could be no solution
to this, but there has to be

229
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:39,480
at most one solution.

230
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:46,715
Now, we just said that any
solution to an inhomogeneous--

231
00:12:46,715 --> 00:12:53,610
let me write it in blue-- any
solution takes the form-- if

232
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,310
there is a solution.

233
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,350
So if there isn't a solution,
that's fine.

234
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,270
That will still satisfy
one-to-one.

235
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,050
But if there is a solution, any
solution is going to take

236
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:09,500
the form x particular plus a
member of your null space.

237
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,420
Where this guy right here is
a member of the null space.

238
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,980
This thing right here just
applies to that guy.

239
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,340
Right here.

240
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,100
Any solution if they exist,
if there are no

241
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,890
solutions, that's fine.

242
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,740
You can still be one-to-one.

243
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,850
But if you do have a solution
you can have at most one

244
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,530
person that maps to it,
and any solution

245
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,580
will take this form.

246
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,840
I just showed you that.

247
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,780
Now in order to be one-to-one,
this can only be one solution.

248
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,610
The solution set can only
be one solution.

249
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:41,240
   

250
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,010
We can only have one solution
here, right?

251
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,120
What does that mean?

252
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,580
That means that this guy
right here cannot be

253
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,940
more than one vector.

254
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,590
It just has to be one vector.

255
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:57,000
There's only one particular
solution right there.

256
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,500
But this guy right here has to
be-- for any solution set,

257
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,200
depending on how you define
it, there's only one

258
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,540
particular vector there.

259
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,620
But this guy, the only way that
you're only going to have

260
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:14,510
one solution is if your null
space is trivial, if it only

261
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,240
contains the 0 vector.

262
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,200
Your null space will
always, at minimum,

263
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,120
contain the 0 vector.

264
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,590
In the last video I think I,
just off the cuff, said that

265
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,750
all your null space
has to be empty.

266
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,270
But no, your null space will
always, by definition, by the

267
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,480
fact that it is a subspace,
it will

268
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,920
always contain a 0 vector.

269
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,960
You can always multiply
A times 0 to get 0.

270
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,930
So your null space will
always contain that.

271
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,450
But in order to have only one
solution, your null space can

272
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:43,340
only have the 0 vector so
that this can only be 0.

273
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,040
And so that your only solution
is going to be the particular

274
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,560
solution that you found,
depending on how you got

275
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,220
there, but it's only going to
be your particular solution.

276
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,760
So let me put this this way.

277
00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:04,110
So in order to be one-to-one
your null space of your

278
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,830
transformation matrix
has to be trivial.

279
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:11,280
It has to contain only
the 0 vector.

280
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,590
Now we've covered this many,
many videos ago.

281
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:16,910
What does it mean if your
null space only

282
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,290
contains a trivial vector?

283
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,270
Let me make this clear.

284
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:23,340
So if your transformation vector
looks like this, A1,

285
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:28,800
A2, all the way to An, and
you're multiplying it times

286
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,650
x1, x2, all the way to xn, and
the null space is all of the

287
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:36,385
x's that satisfy this equation,
0, and you are going

288
00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:39,210
to have m 0's right there.

289
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,810
So if your null space is
trivial, and we're saying that

290
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:45,170
that is a condition for you
to be one-to-one, for your

291
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,510
transformation to be one-to-one,
the transformation

292
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,510
that's specified
by this matrix.

293
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:53,140
If your null space is trivial,
what does that mean?

294
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,600
That means that the only
solution to-- another way of

295
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:05,250
writing this is x1 times a1,
plus x2 times a2, all the way

296
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:11,240
to xn times an, is equal
to the 0 vector.

297
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,290
These are equivalent statements
right here.

298
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,250
I just multiplied each of
these terms times these

299
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,360
respective column vectors.

300
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,760
These are the same thing.

301
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,720
Now if you say that your null
space has to be equal to 0,

302
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,270
you're saying that the only
solution to this equation

303
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:28,270
right here, the only scalars
that satisfy this equation--

304
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:32,950
oh sorry, these aren't-- let me
actually-- because I wrote

305
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:37,010
the scalars as vectors-- so
this guy right here, this

306
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:39,030
statement right here, is
equivalent to x1 times a1,

307
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:45,680
plus x2 times a2, plus all the
way to xn times an, is equal

308
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,710
to the 0 vector.

309
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,075
Where the x1's through
xn's are scalars.

310
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:52,680
Now, if we say the null space
is 0, we're saying the only

311
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,890
way that this is satisfied is
if your x1 all the way to xn

312
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,740
is equal to 0.

313
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,700
And this means, this is our
definition actually, of linear

314
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,350
independence.

315
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:09,200
That means that a1-- so the null
space being 0 also means

316
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:15,920
that your column vectors of A--
let me write it this way--

317
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:23,310
it also means that a1, a2, all
the way through an, are

318
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,060
linearly independent.

319
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,670
   

320
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,930
Now what does that mean?

321
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:35,950
If all of these guys are
linearly independent, what is

322
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,230
going to be the basis for
your column space?

323
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,660
Remember, the column
space is the span.

324
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:47,510
The column space of A is equal
to the span of a1, a2,

325
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,920
all the way to an.

326
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,840
What we just said, if we're
dealing with the one-to-one,

327
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,780
or one of the conditions, or the
condition to be one-to-one

328
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,550
is that your null space
has to be 0, or only

329
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,900
contain the 0 vector.

330
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,970
If your null space contains the
0 vector, then all of your

331
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,790
columns are linearly
independent.

332
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:08,925
If all of these columns span
your column space, and they

333
00:18:08,925 --> 00:18:13,810
are linearly independent,
then they form a basis.

334
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:27,430
So that means that a1, a2, all
the way to an, are a basis for

335
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,520
our column space.

336
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,880
And then that means if all of
our column vectors here are

337
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,900
linearly independent, they
obviously span our column

338
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,880
space by definition, and they
all our linearly independent,

339
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,060
they form the basis.

340
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:44,610
So the dimension of our basis,
so the dimension of our column

341
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:48,910
space, that's essentially the
number of vectors you need to

342
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,710
form the basis, is going
to be equal to n.

343
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,032
We have n columns.

344
00:18:52,032 --> 00:18:53,930
So it's going to
be equal to n.

345
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:58,790
Or another way to say it is that
the rank of your matrix

346
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,990
is going to be equal to n.

347
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:04,520
So now we have a condition for
something to be one-to-one.

348
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,630
Something is going to be
one-to-one if and only if, the

349
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,780
rank of your matrix
is equal to n.

350
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,680
And you can go both ways.

351
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,120
If you assume something is
one-to-one, then that means

352
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,100
that its null space here has to
only have the 0 vector, so

353
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,690
it only has one solution.

354
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:24,070
If its null space only has the
0 vector, then that means

355
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,000
its columns are linearly
independent.

356
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,790
Which means that they all
are part of the basis.

357
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,960
Which means that you have
n basis vectors, or you

358
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,060
have a rank of n.

359
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:32,910
Let's go the other way.

360
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,480
If you have a rank of n, that
means that all of these guys

361
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,390
are linearly independent.

362
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,470
If all of these guys are
linearly independent, then the

363
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:43,240
null space is just
the 0 vector.

364
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,920
The null space is just the 0
vector, this part of your

365
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,460
solution disappears.

366
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,410
And then you are only left
with one solution.

367
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,360
So you're one-to-one.

368
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:55,200
So you're one-to-one if and
only if the rank of your

369
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,620
transformation matrix
is equal to n.

370
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:58,933
