2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,984
We're in the Louvre and we are looking at

3
00:00:05,984 --> 00:00:08,115
one of the most important objects in the entire museum.

4
00:00:08,115 --> 00:00:11,061
This is the Law Code Stele of King Hammurabi.

5
00:00:11,061 --> 00:00:16,160
Hammurabi was a Babylonian King that is known for having created

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,695
the most important set of legal codes from the ancient Near East.

7
00:00:20,695 --> 00:00:24,174
Which perhaps predate the legal codes,

8
00:00:24,174 --> 00:00:26,336
the commandments of the Old Testament.

9
00:00:26,336 --> 00:00:27,853
And, in fact, some scholars think that

10
00:00:27,853 --> 00:00:30,659
this may have been a source for the biblical texts.

11
00:00:30,659 --> 00:00:32,263
And we see at the top

12
00:00:32,263 --> 00:00:36,575
Hammurabi himself receiving the laws from the god Shamash.

13
00:00:36,575 --> 00:00:40,196
Shamash was a god associated with both the sun and with law.

14
00:00:40,196 --> 00:00:41,737
We can tell it is Shamash

15
00:00:41,737 --> 00:00:45,943
because of the horns that radiate from his helmet, from his cap

16
00:00:45,943 --> 00:00:49,365
as well as the rays of light that come from his shoulders.

17
00:00:49,365 --> 00:00:53,574
But more important he is seated on a throne showing his authority

18
00:00:53,574 --> 00:00:56,411
and his feet are on the mountains.

19
00:00:56,411 --> 00:01:00,767
That's right. Those scales represent the mountains from which the god emerges.

20
00:01:00,767 --> 00:01:01,671
Now it is extraordinary

21
00:01:01,671 --> 00:01:04,901
because the king of Babylon, Hammurabi, is almost his equal

22
00:01:04,901 --> 00:01:08,249
not quite his height - not quite - but he is addressing him directly.

23
00:01:08,249 --> 00:01:11,441
But he is standing and the god is seated.

24
00:01:11,441 --> 00:01:15,603
And he is receiving from the god both a ring and a sceptre -

25
00:01:15,603 --> 00:01:17,749
-- symbols of power. - right.

26
00:01:17,749 --> 00:01:20,644
Under this wonderful relief and we should say that

27
00:01:20,644 --> 00:01:22,975
this is made out of basalt which is very hard.

28
00:01:22,975 --> 00:01:25,936
A stone that comes from volcanic action - and it's black.

29
00:01:25,936 --> 00:01:30,406
You see inscribed the entire stele covered in very small registers -

30
00:01:30,406 --> 00:01:31,992
-- three pieces of writing.

31
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:34,271
The first describing the kings investiture,

32
00:01:34,271 --> 00:01:36,357
that is his right to be king.

33
00:01:36,357 --> 00:01:40,062
The next a kind of ode to his glory.

34
00:01:40,062 --> 00:01:42,237
And then finally, and mostly,

35
00:01:42,237 --> 00:01:46,901
over 300 specific laws that actually governed Babylonia.

36
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:51,136
The laws are all written using cuneiform in the Akkadian language

37
00:01:51,136 --> 00:01:55,268
and they're written in a language that was very accessible.

38
00:01:55,268 --> 00:01:57,865
Hammurabi really wanted this to be a legacy

39
00:01:57,865 --> 00:02:01,407
so that everyone could read this and understand.

40
00:02:01,407 --> 00:02:02,969
And it was really important that people understood

41
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:04,096
because if they broke these laws

42
00:02:04,096 --> 00:02:06,011
the punishments were really serious.

43
00:02:06,011 --> 00:02:07,277
So all the the laws were written -

44
00:02:07,277 --> 00:02:08,577
you know If you do this -

45
00:02:08,577 --> 00:02:11,415
if you disobey your parents in this way,

46
00:02:11,415 --> 00:02:13,361
if you commit such and such a crime,

47
00:02:13,361 --> 00:02:15,217
this will be your punishment --

48
00:02:15,217 --> 00:02:18,060
so it outlines actions and their punishments.

49
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,426
What's really crucial is this is at the very beginning of a tradition

50
00:02:22,426 --> 00:02:24,032
that we still hold until today.

51
00:02:24,032 --> 00:02:26,054
Which is to say that the laws are uniform

52
00:02:26,054 --> 00:02:28,574
and that there are specific guidelines

53
00:02:28,574 --> 00:02:30,822
and it doesn't matter what your caste is, right?

54
00:02:30,822 --> 00:02:32,568
What your place in society is,

55
00:02:32,568 --> 00:02:33,675
this is the law.

56
00:02:33,675 --> 00:02:38,915
And also an idea that laws are somehow immutable and divine.

57
00:02:38,915 --> 00:02:42,744
Right? This is an important Judeo-Christian idea, too

58
00:02:42,744 --> 00:02:45,972
that the laws are somehow above humanity.

59
00:02:45,972 --> 00:02:48,779
That they are divine and that is clearly represented here.

60
00:02:48,779 --> 00:02:51,993
It is extraordinary that this has come down to us from so long ago.

61
00:02:51,993 --> 00:02:53,896
This is almost 4000 years old.

62
00:02:53,896 --> 00:02:55,230
I presume that is partially

63
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,611
because the stone is so hard.

64
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:59,246
Well I think that's right but I think it's also something

65
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:03,067
that has been seen as enormously important and cherished - yeah.

66
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:09,282
