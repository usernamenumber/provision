1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm here with Dr. Lawrence Baker from Stanford Medical School, and we are going to talk about what?

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
How about Medicare?

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I thikn we knew what was going to happen since we have a picture here already. So what is this a picture

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of?

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
i think this is a picture of LBJ signing the medicare act in 1965. This is the time that we passed medicare.

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Lindon Banes Johnson, LBJ. This looks like Truman over here. I think he was there maybe because he was

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
probably old enough by that time to be a recipient. Yeah, 65 and over.

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I think we all have a general idea of what Medicare is. It is kind of a healthcare program or an insurance

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
program, for people who are retired. But then it starts to get fuzzy after that. There are all these

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
details that confuse most of us.

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Yeah so we talk about Medicare in a bunch of different ways. Medicare is a program, it's a US governmnet

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
program. It is run by the federal government.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Yup

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And sometimes it's thrown in with Medicaid. What is the difference, just at a high level?

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So Medicaid is a different program, run by the federal government in coordination wit te state governments.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Medicaid is a federal and state program.

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Medicare is a federal program. Medicare is for folks who are 65 or older, and people with disabilities.

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Medicaid is the program that is aimed at lower income population.

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this is older people and disabilities and this is lower income and poverty issue.

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
yes

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let me write it down: lower income, primarily retirees. Yeah, the vast majority of people in there are

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
people who are in there because they are over 65.

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And we are just going to focus on Medicare. Medicare is federal government and Medicaid is federal and

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
state governments.

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They obviously sound similar. Yeah they sound very similar.

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They are easily confused, especially at the name level. They are really different programs. They operate

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
completely separately. In a few cases, there are people who get access to both of them. But they pay

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
differently, they run differently.

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So at the federal level, they are still run by the same organization, the centers for Medicaid and Medicare.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Yeah the department of health and human services has a subpart called the centers of medicaid and medicare

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
services (CMS), the executive branch. So the executive branch of government and there is the secretary

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of health and human services, and then within that we have CMS which is Centers for Medicare and Medicai

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
d services. It really should have 2 Ms in it, but it's shorter to just have one.

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
They administer at the federal level, both medicare and medicaid. Just to reiterate, medicare is really

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
mainly a federal thing, while medicaid is both. And they are run separately. So you have medicare is

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you have medicaid here.

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I see.

38
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's dive deep into medicare. So what is it?

39
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So Medicare is an insurance program. It provides insurance for people who are eligible for it. So if

40
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you're age 65 or over, or if you have a disability, a couple of small groups if you have lugarics or

41
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
if you have n stage renal diseases, a kidney failure, then you can get access Medicare too. But those

42
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
are small populations. But if you are in those groups, you are eligible for Medicare. Medicare will provide

43
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you with insurance that will cover hospital bills, doctor bills, and some presciption drugs, it'll cover

44
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a lot of the medical care. So here's the thing, I hear all these things, but this is the part that gets

45
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
confusing for everyone that you have part a, part b, part c and those are all parts

46
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what are they referring to? Are they exactly insurance or they different?

47
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So Medicare has these 4 parts. Part A, B, C and D and it can get a little confusing but we could break

48
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it up into pieces, but the biggest one in terms of the number of people in it, is what sometimes we call t

49
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
traditional medicare, and that's what Part A and B is historically and you can take as a package. Sometimes

50
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
people call it standard medicare or original medicare. But you know when they passed the program, when

51
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they first did it, part a was meant to cover hospital expenditure and part b was aimed at doctor cost,

52
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
cost for seeing physicians. Of course those 2 go so close together that now they are sort of a pair

53
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so you'd only rarely find someone who only wants part A. Sometimes you hear that the doctor cost are

54
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
out patient. Hospital costs are in-patient, because in some sense you're living there while they are

55
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
treating you, while out-patient you go visit them for an hour and leave.

56
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Yeah so that's a way of breaking up services medicine provides. Medicare actually gets a little bit,

57
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's mix-and-match, and so really medicare part A expenditure is when a hospital bills medicare for hospitale,

58
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
, for use of the room, use of the hospital

59
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
anytime a doctor bills medicare, even when they saw the patient in a hospital they are going to be a

60
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
part b expenditure.

61
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I see. So it isn't a strictly an in-patient and out-patient difference. It really is along the lines

62
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of hospital and doctor. It is useful to think about that, the out-patient and in-patient.

63
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So we'll cover everything that happens?

64
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Are we including drugs?

65
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So drugs is one key issue, the first thing is i'd say that traditional medicare is pretty comprehensive,

66
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It covers most of the things people would normally encounter.

67
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So part A and part B do not cover drugs. So when Lindon Johnson was signing this, if Truman had to get

68
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
prescription drugs, and if he was a medicare recipient in 1965, he would have had to pay that out of

69
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
pocket

70
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Yes. So one caveat I'll note is that if you get prescription drugs while you're in the hospital, you're

71
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
staying in the hospital and they are giving you drugs. That's going to be covered. It's when you're outpatient,

72
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you're going home and someone sends you to the pharmacy to pick up the drugs..

73
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I see, so Medicare in its original would not cover that. The out-patient cost. So that became a problem

74
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
for some folks and that has generated changes in the medicare

75
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There is a part now that covers that. So that is the Part D, an extension of the medicare program that

76
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
covers that

77
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I don't know how far we want to get into that

78
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'll write it here, D for Drugs.

79
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The whole story of Drugs in medicare has a lot to it, people would buy additional policies if they had

80
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
A and B and they'd buy a private supplement that might cover the drug itself

81
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
but now with the part D program and maybe people will buy that instead

82
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and then there is other stuff going on there

83
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And there's also a C right here.

84
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So A and B, traditional, A hospitals and B doctors and what percent my health insurance copay. How does

85
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it work with traditional health insurance?

86
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So if yo ujust have Part A and Part B, on Part B side doctors are covered 80% of the medicare allowable

87
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
charges so medicare has a fee schedule that governs what the doctors can be paid for services and medicare

88
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
will cover 80% of the cost and the patient pays remaining 20

89
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
For part A, it gets a little more complicated but there is a copayment that you have to make if you go

90
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to the hospital. Medicare will have a co-payment of a fixed amount - several hundred dollars coming u

91
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
p

92
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's just not as simple as 80-20. You're going to pay a co-payment there too.

93
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So they are not bad coverage, but there are some costs you can run up and if you're pretty sick you might

94
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
have a bill that left over

95
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And there is extreme flexibility here. So you can see any doctor you want, and go to any hospital you

96
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
want

97
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
yeah medicare part a and part b is, in a way of thinking, one of the last bastions as it existed

98
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
in 1965-70-75, when there were really minimal restrictions on what doctors you can see, doctors get a

99
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
lot of discretion in the kind of services they are going to provide

100
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and there's not a lot of oversight that you might see in today's HMOs

101
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But there are still, and maybe I'm wrong here, there still are doctors that wont take medicare patients?

102
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So doctors can elect to be medicare doctors or not and some doctors decide

103
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that they have enough patients from other places then medicare is a plan,

104
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and you have to follow the rules and some people think that medicare doesn't

105
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
pay as well, as other options they have. Most of the doctors, the vast majority of doctors in the country

106
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
will work with medicare.
