1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,160
We're on problem 132.

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,810
If the integer n is greater than 1, is n equal to 2?

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,210
So they tell us that the integer n is greater than 1,

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,890
and they ask us, is n equal to 2?

5
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:24,300
Statement 1, n has exactly two positive factors.

6
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,790
Well that's certainly true of the number 2.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,800
But it's also true of any prime number. I mean n could be 7.

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,380
7 only has two positive factors, 1 and 7.

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,050
So it's true of any prime number. So this, by itself,

10
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,050
isn't enough information to say that it's definitely 2.

11
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:51,590
Statement 2 tells us the difference of any two distinct

12
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:57,140
positive factors of n is odd. This is interesting.

13
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,760
We're just dealing in kind of the positive world.

14
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,360
So let's think about it. Just thinking about statement 1,

15
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,010
we said, OK, what numbers have only two factors?

16
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,180
Well prime numbers only have two factors.

17
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,080
This only tells us that n is prime.

18
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,370
2 is a prime number, but it's not the only prime number.

19
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:36,030
But for most other prime numbers, what do we know about them?

20
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,450
Well they're odd, right? Most prime numbers are odd.

21
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,420
Other than 2, what are the other prime numbers?

22
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,140
You go to 3, you go to 7, you go to 11, 5.

23
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,160
Let me ask you, why are they odd? Because if they were even,

24
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,370
they would be divisible by 2 and they wouldn't be prime.

25
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,030
So by definition really, every prime number

26
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,040
that's not 2 is not divisible by 2 because it's prime.

27
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,590
So they have to be odd numbers.So for any other prime number,

28
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:10,880
the number is going to be 1 and itself. So let's call that p.

29
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,590
So the difference between the two numbers,

30
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,010
and p is going to be an odd number.

31
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,020
Every other prime number other than 2 is odd.

32
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,990
So the difference between the two, p minus 1.

33
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,200
If I take an odd number and I subtract one from it,

34
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:27,670
I get an even number. That's true for any odd number.

35
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:31,860
So every other prime number is odd. And this happens.

36
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,650
But they're saying that when I subtract the difference I get

37
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,190
an odd, I get an odd number.

38
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,440
Well the only number that's true for is 2.

39
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,010
Because factors of 2 are 1 and 2.

40
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:43,460
If I subtract 1 from 2, 2 minus 1 is equal to 1.

41
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,000
That's because 2 is the only even prime number.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,180
So this first statement says we have to be dealing with a

43
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:52,750
prime number.

44
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,120
The second statement says, well, the number really has to

45
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,070
be an even number if it's going to be prime.

46
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,820
Let me think about the other two--

47
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,690
if statement 2 alone is enough.

48
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:11,460
The difference of any two positive factors of n is odd,

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,890
any two positive factors of n.

50
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,520
Now this alone doesn't help us because n could be--

51
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,140
I don't know-- it could be 1 and 6.

52
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,480
The difference between 1 and 6 is 5,so it would satisfy this.

53
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,450
So n could be 6 if we just took statement 2.

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,150
So we really need both. Statement 1 tells us that n is prime.

55
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,460
Statement 2 tells us that n has to be even,

56
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,430
that it has to be an even number.

57
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,460
So frankly, there's only one prime even number,

58
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,850
and that's 2. So both statements together are necessary

59
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,020
to answer this question.

60
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:55,810
133, every member of a certain club volunteers to contribute

61
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:00,050
equally to the purchase price of a $60 gift certificate.

62
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,490
How many members of does a club have?

63
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,290
So we want to know-- let's call m for members--

64
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,020
how many members does a club have?

65
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:12,770
Question 1, each member's contribution is to be $4.

66
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,010
Let's see,it says they contribute equally to a purchase price

67
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,660
OK, so the number of members times--

68
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,490
and they say every member of a certain club.

69
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,900
So now they don't say some members.

70
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,550
So m is the number of members,and they contribute equally $4.

71
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,540
That's going to be equal to $60.

72
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,580
So then you immediately know that you can solve for the

73
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,070
number of members. There are 15 members of this club.

74
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,730
Maybe I'm missing something.

75
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:42,020
Statement 2, if 5 club members fail to contribute,

76
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,710
the share of each contributing member will increase by $2.

77
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:56,360
So that means that if I were to take the amount that 5

78
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,980
members were to contribute-- so let's say that the

79
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,060
contribution amount is c.

80
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,960
So if we take the amount that 5 members would contribute,

81
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:17,040
so 5 times c, and divide it by the remaining members,

82
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:23,750
so divide by m minus 5, that would be that each

83
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,070
contributing member will increase by $2.

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,410
So this is the amount that would have been contributed by

85
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,060
those 5 people.

86
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,840
Let me make sure that I'm not missing anything.

87
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,000
That is going to be equal to $2.

88
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,790
So this is the amount that those 5 members would have

89
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,410
contributed.

90
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,740
If they don't contribute it,

91
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,430
it's going to have to be divided by the other members.

92
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,040
So however many members there are minus 5.

93
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,530
That is going to be-- when you divide the amount divided by

94
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:00,030
who has to pay for it-- is $2 per leftover member.

95
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:04,780
We also know that the members times the contribution for

96
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,010
member if everyone pays, is going to be equal to $60.

97
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,130
That they give us in the problem statement,

98
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,540
that m members are going to contribute equally,

99
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,970
and they're going to end up with $60.

100
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,070
So actually, we have two linear equations and two unknowns.

101
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,530
So statement 2 alone is actually sufficient to

102
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:23,030
solve this problem.

103
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,970
If this doesn't look like a linear question,

104
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:29,170
you can just multiply both sides by m minus 5 and you get 5c

105
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,530
is equal to 2m minus 10.

106
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,010
Now this looks a lot more like a linear equation.

107
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,590
Well, actually, this isn't a complete linear equation.

108
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:42,510
But let me solve it just to make the point clear for you.

109
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:47,780
So if I were to say that c-- this isn't a linear equation,

110
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,030
so I shouldn't have said that-- c is equal to 60/m.

111
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:59,130
If c is equal to 60/m, so then this turns to 5 times 60.

112
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:08,500
So 300/m is equal to 2m minus 10.Then you are left with what?

113
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Multiply both sides by m,

114
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:15,010
you get 300 is equal to 2m squared minus 10m.

115
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:18,510
Divide both sides by 2, you get 150 is equal to

116
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:23,000
m squared minus 10m. Then subtract 150 from both sides.

117
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:33,010
You get m squared minus 10m minus 150 is equal to 0.

118
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:38,030
Then let me see if I can just do this just by factoring it.

119
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:50,000
Minus 150, 30 times 5, no, that's not good. 15 times 10.

120
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:57,080
So if I do m minus 15 times-- no, that doesn't work.

121
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:02,600
15, 25, and 6. I know one of the answers already.

122
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:09,050
I know it's 15. m minus 15 times m plus 10.

123
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,630
Oh, actually, I just realized what my mistake was.

124
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,360
I went from this step to this step.

125
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,500
So I divided both sides by 2. So 300 went into 150.

126
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:23,000
2m squared-- this had to be 5m. That's my mistake. 5m.

127
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,100
M squared minus 5m minus 150.

128
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,990
So that's m minus 15 times m plus 10 is equal to 0.

129
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,340
So that tells us that m is equal to 15 or minus 10.

130
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,810
This is actually a quadratic equation.

131
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,020
We know that the members can't be negative.

132
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,060
There's a positive number of members.

133
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:45,070
So statement 2 alone is enough information to know that there

134
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,850
are exactly 15 members in this club. Next problem.

135
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,400
It had me stumped there because of my careless mistake

136
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,880
there for a second. Next problem.

137
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,050
OK, problem 134.

138
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,340
So that last one, I don't know if I just said it.

139
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,630
Each statement alone is sufficient. So problem 134.

140
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,980
If m and n are positive integers,

141
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:20,090
is the square root of n minus m an integer?

142
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,010
So m and n are positive integers. OK, so they tell us.

143
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:32,660
Statement 1, they say n is greater than m plus 15.

144
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:39,390
Well you know, n is greater than m plus 15.

145
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:45,350
So if n is exactly 16 greater than m, this is another way of

146
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:49,140
saying that n minus m is greater than 15. That tells that

147
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,420
what's under the denominator is greater than 15.

148
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,910
Well, if what's under the denominator is 16,

149
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:54,940
then it is an integer.

150
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,710
But if it's 17, which also meets this requirement,

151
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:58,790
it's not an integer.

152
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,550
So this isn't enough information by itself.

153
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:10,660
Statement 2 says n is equal to m times m plus 1,

154
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,080
which is the same thing as m squared plus m.

155
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,700
So if we substitute that into this equation,

156
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:29,340
we get the square root of m squared plus m minus m.

157
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,710
That's m times m plus 1. It's m squared plus m.

158
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,000
This minus m is right there.

159
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,110
So that cancels out and we're just left with square root of m

160
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:42,360
squared, which is going to be equal to m,which is an integer.

161
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,340
So statement 2 alone is sufficient to say that this would be

162
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:51,060
an integer as long as n is equal to m times m plus 1.

163
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,010
I've run out of time. See you in the next video.
