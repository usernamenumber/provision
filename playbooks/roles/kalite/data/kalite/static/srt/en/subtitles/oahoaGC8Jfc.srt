1
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,929
of my name is james white and today it
will be investigating he transferred

2
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:12,990
heat transfer affects our everyday life

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,030
for example it allows our computers
around without burning up it helps us to

4
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,369
design houses they use less energy

5
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:21,369
it makes cooking food possible

6
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:25,859
and very importantly it helps keep us
warm or cool like this radiator

7
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,420
we'll look at three different types of
he transferred

8
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:33,750
conduction convection and radiation and
fine examples where they occur roundups

9
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,590
to do this will use a thermal camera at
thermal camera can see the radiation

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,560
given off by all objects and use it to
measure their temperatures

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,340
for example called objects normally give
off less radiation

12
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,180
then hot objects which give off more
aviation

13
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,620
the camera records this radiation and
creates a picture

14
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,490
the colors in the picture represent
temperatures

15
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,930
hotter temperatures are lighter colors
and colder temperatures are darker

16
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:58,900
colors

17
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,690
in this picture my hand is warm but the
copper wire below it

18
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,519
is cold

19
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:08,180
however at the camera is and always
correct let's look at a video of the

20
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,610
lighter fluid

21
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:13,780
although the flame appears to be the
same time because my hand

22
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,780
it's actually about two thousand degrees
celsius

23
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,950
this is too hot for the video to show us
the real temperature

24
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,530
using the lighter in copper wire we will
observe the first type of heat renter

25
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,010
conduction

26
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,480
i'll show you our simple experiment

27
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,630
conductive heat transfer occurs when
there's a temperature difference between

28
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,870
two materials in contact with each other

29
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:40,120
in this case the right side of the wires
heated by the lighter

30
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,640
at this point temperature in the
material is very high and one area and

31
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,370
cold in other areas

32
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:49,650
he transfers from the high temperatures
sided to the low temperatures sat

33
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:56,650
wet swatches this happens

34
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:03,050
overtime the temperature of the material
becomes more more uniform

35
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:08,409
as he transfer moves energy from hot to
cold areas of the wire

36
00:02:08,409 --> 00:02:14,339
when including a building we often care
about keeping warm or cold air inside

37
00:02:14,339 --> 00:02:19,569
how long can retain heat of building
depends on two things its thickness and

38
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:21,869
its thermal conductivity

39
00:02:21,869 --> 00:02:23,669
materials that are thicker

40
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:25,739
will at last he through

41
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:28,380
materials with higher thermal
conductivity

42
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,809
will add more heat through

43
00:02:30,809 --> 00:02:35,289
how do you think this metal door
compares to this poem panel which lets

44
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:36,929
the more heat

45
00:02:36,929 --> 00:02:42,199
what about traditional materials like
these adobe blocks

46
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:46,030
when the temperature of a waller door is
different than the surrounding area

47
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,660
a different type of heat transfer begin
to kerr

48
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,859
named convection

49
00:02:50,859 --> 00:02:55,909
a lighter a copper wire in a cardboard
backdrop makeup are simple experiment

50
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:59,499
with emmitt till is hotter a colour than
a fluid surrounding it

51
00:02:59,499 --> 00:03:01,919
it causes the fluid to rise rsync

52
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,480
in the case of aha wire heated air rises
as cold air fills its place

53
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,009
this cools down the wire faster than
conduction

54
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:12,279
if we push the wire towards the
cardboard

55
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:16,930
we see that the hot air rising off the
wire heats the cardboard this hot stream

56
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,999
of air is call the convection correct

57
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:22,329
and is part of natural convection

58
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:26,259
sometimes natural convection is
ambassador so engineers will use force

59
00:03:26,259 --> 00:03:30,209
convection your computer uses force
convection to keep itself from

60
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,319
overheating

61
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,739
that's why you're fans too

62
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:37,799
using the thermal camera of we can see
that this laptop as several hot

63
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:38,739
components

64
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:39,620
here here

65
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,439
here and here

66
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,439
when these components get too hot

67
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:48,339
fans in the laptop will start to pull
cool air across the parts

68
00:03:48,339 --> 00:03:51,430
this results imports connection

69
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:55,989
the hot air is them blown out the side
or back of the computer

70
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:59,549
her dad mentioned that all objects give
off radiation

71
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:01,489
when radiation from a hot object

72
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:04,299
it's another object it warms it up

73
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:07,779
this process is called thermal radiation

74
00:04:07,779 --> 00:04:11,999
too bright lights a piece of aluminum
foil and a cardboard backdrop make our

75
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:13,539
simple experiment

76
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:18,199
when the lights are turned on let's see
what happens

77
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:22,139
we can see the radiation from the lights
is absorbed by the cardboard

78
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:29,039
however the radiation is reflected by
the aluminum foil

79
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:30,759
when the lights are turned off

80
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:34,580
we can see that the cardboard under the
aluminum foil was not heated because

81
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,050
radiation never reach it

82
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:42,659
the sun is an extremely hot object and
it's there more radiation warms our

83
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:44,090
entire planet

84
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,639
this means that when designing a
building

85
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,739
window placement is a very important
part of the thermal engineering

86
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:53,870
when the sun's radiation comes through
windows

87
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:58,759
it will heat up the exposed cooler
indoor materials

88
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:02,719
conducting convection then transfer this
heat around the building

89
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:06,449
by considering thermal radiation
indesign a building will be warmer

90
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:10,240
during the winter and cooler during the
summer

91
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,220
radiators are common way to keep
buildings in cold environments

92
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,340
although named irradiated this device
actually uses radiation and convection

93
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,569
transfer it to you to the room

94
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:24,219
thermal radiation is sent out in all
directions from the radiator and makes

95
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:26,669
you very warm when you stand next to it

96
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:30,620
natural convection then circulates the
hot air from the radiator around the

97
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,919
building

98
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:36,669
there are so many examples of heat
transfer or owners every day

99
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:40,110
and as engineers we have to think about
using them to make the world a better

100
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:46,909
place
