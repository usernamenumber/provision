1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,480
   

2
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,210
In this video, we're going
to see if we can

3
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,245
graph a rational function.

4
00:00:04,245 --> 00:00:08,760
A rational function is just
a function that has an

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,420
expression on the numerator
and the denominator.

6
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,660
It has a polynomial in the
numerator-- Let's see, we have

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,600
x squared over-- and another
polynomial in the denominator

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,460
--x squared minus 16.

9
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,090
We could obviously graph this by
just trying out a bunch of

10
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,560
points and then connecting
the dots.

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,890
That's what a calculator would
do for us, a graphing

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:26,740
calculator.

13
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,580
But what we want to do is,
before we try out some points

14
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,880
to kind of fill in the gaps, I
want to understand the basic

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,820
structure of this graph first.

16
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,370
And to understand that, I want
to see what happens as x gets

17
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,880
really big, so x gets really
big, or x gets really, really

18
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,980
small, as x goes in the
negative direction.

19
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,240
Or another way we could think
about it, I want to understand

20
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:52,210
what happens as the magnitude of
x, or the absolute value of

21
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:58,050
x, becomes really big as it
approaches really, really

22
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,760
bigness, or as it approaches
infinity.

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,900
So when the size of x
approaches infinity.

24
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,500
Which essentially is saying,
as x goes really far in the

25
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,480
positive direction, or x goes
really far in the negative

26
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,430
direction, what is going
to happen to the

27
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,020
value of this function?

28
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,210
So let's get out a calculator.

29
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,470
Won't use the graphing part of
it just yet, but let's just

30
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,720
try out some values.

31
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,810
What happens when x
is equal to 10?

32
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,880
It's going to be the same thing
as when x is equal to

33
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,220
negative 10, because when you
put a negative 10 here, you

34
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,230
square it, you get 100,
just like 10.

35
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,700
Same here, negative 10, you
square it, you get the same

36
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,320
thing as a positive 10.

37
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,710
So whether you go in the super
high positive direction or the

38
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,620
super low negative direction,
as you approach positive or

39
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,430
negative infinity, you're going
to approach the same

40
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,340
thing because you're squaring
the values.

41
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,930
But let's try out some values.

42
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:54,060
If I get 10 squared divided
by 10 squared

43
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,970
minus 16, I get 1.19.

44
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,760
Now what happens if x gets
a little bit bigger?

45
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,800
This is x is equal to 10.

46
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,140
What happens when x
is equal to 100?

47
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:16,110
We have 100 squared divided
by 100 squared minus 16.

48
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,340
I'm getting even closer to 1.

49
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,960
When x was 10, around here,
we're getting y is 1.19.

50
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,140
When x is 100, 100 squared
over 100 squared

51
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,470
minus 16, y is 1.0016.

52
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,570
Just for fun, let's try 1,000.

53
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:42,120
So it's 1,000 squared divided
by 1,000 squared minus 16.

54
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,100
And we're even closer to 1.

55
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,390
So as the size of x gets larger
and larger and larger,

56
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,900
our y gets closer
and closer to 1.

57
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,830
And that would also be true
if this was a negative 10,

58
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,070
because negative 10 squared over
negative 10 squared minus

59
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,040
16 is going to be the
exact same thing.

60
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,490
Because the negative, when
you square it, is

61
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,700
going to be a positive.

62
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,330
It's going to be the same thing
as 10 squared, same

63
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,640
thing over here.

64
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,350
So whether x gets really big or
x gets really small, we're

65
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,190
going to be approaching
y is equal to 1.

66
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,916
You could try it with a million
if you want, and

67
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:14,640
you're going to get a number
even closer to 1.

68
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,870
So as the size of x approaches
infinity, the absolute value

69
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:25,400
of x, or the distance from the
origin, approaches infinity, y

70
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,690
is approaching 1.

71
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,940
Or another way to think about
it is, the graph of this

72
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,700
function is going to approach
the line y is equal to 1.

73
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,880
So let me graph the line
y is equal to 1.

74
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,520
So I'll do it in a dotted line
because this isn't the graph

75
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,230
of our function, but this is
a line that our function is

76
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,960
approaching.

77
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,480
So that is the graph
of y is equal to 1.

78
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,110
Now, this idea of a function,
or the graph of a function,

79
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,810
approaching a line but never
quite touching it.

80
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,000
So this is going to get closer
and closer and closer to this

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,280
line, y equal to one, in that
direction, but never quite

82
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,430
getting close enough to it.

83
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,220
It'll approach 0, its distance
from this y equals 1, but

84
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,900
it'll never quite get there.

85
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,190
This line that the graph
is approaching

86
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,440
is called an asymptote.

87
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,000
   

88
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,800
And it'll be even more
clear once I

89
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,030
actually graph the function.

90
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,950
We're going to work up there.

91
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,060
And since it's a horizontal
line, we call this a

92
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,310
horizontal asymptote.

93
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,580
   

94
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,690
This is what our graph
approaches as we go in the

95
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,660
positive direction, or really
far in the negative direction.

96
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,970
Let's think about some of the
other interesting things about

97
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,920
this, about this function
right here.

98
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,000
Well one thing that might pop
out at you is this is a

99
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,910
difference of squares.

100
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,250
This is x squared
minus 4 squared.

101
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:53,350
So we can rewrite this as
x squared over x plus 4

102
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,600
times x minus 4.

103
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,870
So what's going to happen here,
as x approaches either

104
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,530
positive 4, or x approaches
negative 4?

105
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,580
Well, first of all, try
those values out.

106
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,290
If x is equal to 4, what
is going to happen?

107
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,740
This expression right here, this
term right here, is going

108
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,900
to be equal to 0.

109
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,660
And we're going to
be dividing by 0.

110
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,050
We cannot do that.

111
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,810
Similarly, if x is equal
to negative 4, we'd

112
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,060
be dividing by 0.

113
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,470
This expression, right here,
is going to be equal to 0.

114
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:27,110
We can't do that.

115
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:37,880
We could say that this function
is undefined at x is

116
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,860
equal to plus or minus 4.

117
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,580
It can't equal those values
because we'd be dividing by 0

118
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,290
in either one of those
circumstances.

119
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:51,430
Now, what happens as we
approach those values?

120
00:05:51,430 --> 00:06:00,930
What happens as x approaches
negative 4?

121
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,430
Let's just do that
one for fun.

122
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,150
What happens as x approaches
negative 4?

123
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:11,155
Let's say we're approaching it
from the negative direction.

124
00:06:11,155 --> 00:06:16,490
   

125
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,853
So let's try it out
in our calculator.

126
00:06:17,853 --> 00:06:21,950
   

127
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,020
So let's say we want to go from
the negative direction.

128
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,680
So let's start with
negative 4.1.

129
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:39,700
So if we have negative 4.1
squared divided by negative

130
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:47,770
4.1 squared minus 16,
what do we get?

131
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,540
We get 20.75.

132
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,960
So we get this number,
whatever.

133
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,290
Let's see if we get even
closer to negative 4.

134
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,495
So let me just get
that entry there.

135
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:57,830
So let's get a little bit
closer to negative 4.

136
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:02,950
So instead of negative 4.1,
let's do negative 4.01.

137
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:09,752
So let me insert a
negative 4.01.

138
00:07:09,752 --> 00:07:15,890
And then over here, this
is negative 4.01,

139
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,200
and see what it is.

140
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,320
Now we went to 200, so
we're getting to

141
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,490
larger and larger values.

142
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:23,730
Let's try negative 4.001.

143
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:24,980
Let's try that out.

144
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,990
   

145
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,620
Whoops, that's not what
I wanted to do.

146
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,630
I wanted to do that.

147
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,670
So let's try.

148
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,985
No that's not what
I want to do.

149
00:07:36,985 --> 00:07:37,840
Let's see.

150
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:44,000
So we want to go to, instead of
4.01, I want to do 4.001,

151
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,270
and over there, negative
4.001.

152
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,260
And what do we get?

153
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,800
We get 2,000.

154
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,110
So as we get closer and closer
to negative 4 from the

155
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,470
negative direction, we're
approaching larger and larger,

156
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,440
super larger numbers.

157
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,360
And you can try it, if it's
4.0000001, it's going to get

158
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,130
to smaller and smaller numbers--
or sorry, larger and

159
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,170
larger numbers here.

160
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:11,490
If you do 4.001, it's probably
going to be 20,000.

161
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,540
And then if you add
another 0 here.

162
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,860
So as we get closer and closer,
it's getting to larger

163
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,250
and larger numbers.

164
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,850
So we could say, as x approaches
negative 4, we

165
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,950
could say y is approaching
infinity.

166
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,970
It's getting to a larger and
larger and larger value.

167
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,650
But we can't ever quite get
to x is equal to 4.

168
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,680
It's undefined there.

169
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,440
That will make the denominator
here equal to 0.

170
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,570
So what we want to do here is,
we can never quite equal x

171
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:36,700
equal negative 4.

172
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:41,150
So let me see, x is equal
to 1, 2, 3, 4.

173
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,220
We can never quite get to x
is equal to negative 4.

174
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,520
Let me draw x is equal to
negative 4 as a dotted line,

175
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,710
right there.

176
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,090
That is x is equal
to negative 4.

177
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:55,050
   

178
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,290
We can never quite get there,
but as we approached it from

179
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,430
the negative side, as we had
4.1, then 4.01, we went to

180
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,230
larger and larger values.

181
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,330
And we also know that as we went
on the left-hand side, as

182
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:09,290
we go to larger and larger x
values, that y will get closer

183
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,530
and closer to 1.

184
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:13,120
So you have a general sense of
what this part of the graph

185
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,920
will look like.

186
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,200
This part of the graph
is going to look

187
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,230
something like that.

188
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,700
As x gets to super negative
numbers, it gets closer and

189
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,980
closer to 1, as x gets closer
and closer to negative 4 from

190
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,700
the negative direction, it's
going to go closer and closer

191
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,720
to infinity.

192
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,245
You're going to get closer and
closer to a very-- It's going

193
00:09:32,245 --> 00:09:33,750
to get larger and larger,
I guess, is an

194
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,280
easy way to say it.

195
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,710
Now, just like x equal negative
4, x equals 4 will

196
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,760
also be a point where the
graph is undefined.

197
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,620
So let me graph that here.

198
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,600
1, 2, 3, 4.

199
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,850
Right here.

200
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:49,380
   

201
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,936
Right over here.

202
00:09:50,936 --> 00:09:53,280
x is equal to 4.

203
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,820
And, once again, what happens
as we approach x equals 4,

204
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,890
let's say from the positive
direction?

205
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:05,470
So as x approaches 4 from the
positive direction, what's

206
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,220
going to happen?

207
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,890
So this is like trying out x
is equal to 4.01, or x is

208
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:14,040
equal to 4.001, or x
is equal to 4.0001.

209
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,420
So we're just getting closer and
closer and closer to x is

210
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,570
equal to 4.

211
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:21,260
Well, these values are the exact
same values that we just

212
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,980
tried on our calculator, except
they are the negative

213
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,580
version of them, right?

214
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,440
And we already saw that, just
the way that this function is

215
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,340
set up, the negative numbers,
they get squared, so whether

216
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,410
you take the negative or the
positive x values, it's going

217
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:33,620
to be the same thing.

218
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,930
This graph is symmetric.

219
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,900
When x is equal to negative
5, it's the same thing

220
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,860
as x is equal 5.

221
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,010
When x is equal to negative
10, it's the same

222
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,420
thing as x equals 10.

223
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,720
So the same thing is
going to happen.

224
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,465
You could try it out with your
calculator, if you like.

225
00:10:44,465 --> 00:10:46,900
If you try out these values,
you're going to see, as we get

226
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,330
closer and closer to 4, we're
going to approach larger and

227
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:50,960
larger numbers.

228
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,190
These same numbers over here.

229
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:57,820
So the graph over here, as we
get closer and closer to 4,

230
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,300
we're going to approach larger
and larger numbers.

231
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,990
And then here, as x gets larger
and larger and larger,

232
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,510
we saw over here, we had these
horizontal asymptotes, y gets

233
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,650
closer and closer to 1.

234
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:13,750
So just like we called this a
horizontal asymptote, these

235
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,460
values-- or you can even view
these vertical lines: x is

236
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:21,290
equal to negative 4 and x is
equal to 4 --we call these

237
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,540
vertical asymptotes.

238
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:28,920
   

239
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,730
These are lines, asymptotes,
once again, they are lines

240
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:35,140
that the graph approaches,
but never quite touches.

241
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,280
So that's what's
going on here.

242
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,680
And then we can think about
what's happening to the graph

243
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,600
inside of here.

244
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,450
So you could think of it
in a couple of ways.

245
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:50,750
You could say, well, what
happens as x approaches 4 from

246
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,100
the negative direction?

247
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,430
So let's try that out, from
the negative direction.

248
00:11:55,430 --> 00:12:03,990
So what happens if you do 3.9
squared divided by 3.9

249
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:08,440
squared minus 16?

250
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,010
You get negative 19.25.

251
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:16,070
Now what happens
if we do 3.99?

252
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,440
So let me put another 9 here.

253
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,933
So we're going to get closer
and closer to 4, and we're

254
00:12:20,933 --> 00:12:23,890
going to do it from
the left-hand side

255
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,470
as we approach 4.

256
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:30,100
So insert another 9 here.

257
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,255
So even more negative.

258
00:12:31,255 --> 00:12:34,220
So let's just do one more.

259
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,400
So we're going to be
even more negative.

260
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,610
So let me make it 3.999.

261
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,245
Get even closer to 4.

262
00:12:42,245 --> 00:12:45,980
   

263
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,860
You're getting even
more negative.

264
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,930
And this is also going to be
true if we did negative 3.9,

265
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:56,380
or negative 3.99, or negative
3.999, because when we square

266
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,540
it, the negatives and the
positives are the same thing.

267
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,660
You square negative 1,
you get a positive 1.

268
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:07,835
So as we approach 4 from-- you
go 3.9, 3.99, we get closer

269
00:13:07,835 --> 00:13:09,930
and closer to 4 --we're
getting more and

270
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:10,780
more negative numbers.

271
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,040
We approach negative infinity.

272
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,380
So as we approach-- let
me just graph it here.

273
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,390
As we approach from this
direction, we're going to get

274
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:22,440
smaller-- want to not touch our
asymptote --it's going to

275
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,250
look something like that.

276
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,430
As we approach it from the
left-hand side, we're getting

277
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,040
smaller and smaller numbers.

278
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,840
And that's also going to be true
as we approach negative 4

279
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,220
from the right-hand
side, right?

280
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:37,210
As we get negative 3.9,
3.99, 3.999, we're

281
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:37,970
going to drop down.

282
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:40,800
It's going to look something
like that.

283
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,950
And now that we have a general
sense of what the graph is,

284
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,530
now is a good time where
we could maybe plot

285
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:49,150
a few points here.

286
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:52,190
And the easiest one is, what
happens when x is equal to 0?

287
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:56,570
You have 0 squared over
0 squared minus 16.

288
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,100
So the point when x is equal
to 0, we're going to have 0

289
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,430
over, well, negative 16,
which is just 0.

290
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:07,300
So the point 0, 0 is
on this curve.

291
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,900
And then we could try some other
points if you like, but

292
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,170
the general shape here
is going to look

293
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,805
something like this.

294
00:14:13,805 --> 00:14:18,010
   

295
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:20,360
You could plot more points if
you really want to nail down

296
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,430
exactly what the curve is doing
in between, but here is

297
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,120
the general structure.

298
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,390
And we tried out a lot of values
with the calculator.

299
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:31,280
And I did that because I really
wanted to show you why

300
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,500
it's dropping down like this.

301
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,180
And if you think about it,
it makes complete sense.

302
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,830
As you get closer and closer,
let's say you get closer and

303
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,200
closer to 4.

304
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,790
Either way, as you get closer
and closer to 4, this is going

305
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,340
to become a smaller and smaller
and smaller number,

306
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:47,140
because this is the difference
between x and 4.

307
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,480
So this is becoming
a smaller and

308
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,450
smaller and smaller number.

309
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:56,100
Then, when you take 1
over that, right?

310
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,015
You can essentially view this as
x squared over x plus 4, or

311
00:15:00,015 --> 00:15:02,270
times 1 over x minus 4.

312
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,870
If this is becoming smaller and
smaller, this whole thing,

313
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:08,730
1 over a super small number,
is a super large number.

314
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,540
So as you can imagine, you're
going to get larger and

315
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,010
larger, and depending on whether
you are approaching

316
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:17,090
from the positive or negative,
so whether this is a super

317
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:20,470
small negative number or super
small positive number, that's

318
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,720
going to flip the sign.

319
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,210
But either way, the magnitude--
So we're getting

320
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:27,060
to a very large magnitude in the
negative direction because

321
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,800
the difference between
x and 4 on this side

322
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,560
is negative, right?

323
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,010
3.9 minus 4 is 0.1.

324
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,980
Take the inverse of
that, it's 10.

325
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,640
So we're getting negative
numbers here.

326
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,830
You take the inverse, you're
going to get super large

327
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:41,460
negative numbers.

328
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,590
So I really want to give
you that intuition.

329
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:47,070
But the general way of being
able to graph these type of

330
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,940
things, your first thing you
want to do is identify the

331
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,480
horizontal asymptotes.

332
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,450
What happens as we get very--
the magnitude of our x is very

333
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,960
large, so super positive
values or

334
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,910
super negative values.

335
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,860
You could try it out on a
calculator, if you like.

336
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,820
You literally, if you try out
the value of a million or a

337
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,410
billion, it will kind of
give you the answer.

338
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:11,170
But the way you could also think
about it is, as x gets

339
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:15,680
really large, you could view
that this thing, these terms

340
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,790
right here grow so much faster--
I mean this is just a

341
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,720
constant term.

342
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,190
This term doesn't
matter anymore.

343
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,140
If this is a million
and a million, who

344
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,330
cares about the 16?

345
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:28,970
So as x gets really large,
you could say that y is

346
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,000
approximately x squared
over x squared.

347
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,690
These two terms dominate.

348
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,880
You don't need to worry
about the 16 anymore.

349
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,510
And of course, this is equal to
1, which is exactly what we

350
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,360
got when we plugged in
really large numbers.

351
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,320
So, in a problem like this,
where you have the same

352
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,840
coefficient, or where you have
the same degree on the

353
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,040
numerator and the denominator,
you look at the coefficient of

354
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,470
those terms. So in this case,
the coefficient is 1 and 1.

355
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:59,080
So our horizontal asymptote is
going to be 1 divided by 1, or

356
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,380
y is equal to 1.

357
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,510
If this was 2x squared over
x squared minus 16, our

358
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,859
horizontal asymptote would
be y is equal to 2.

359
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,930
We would approach that
line, up there.

360
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:11,030
If it was a negative 2, our
horizontal asymptote would be

361
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,599
y is equal to negative 2.

362
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,050
So that's how you identify the
horizontal asymptotes where

363
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,190
you have the same degree in
the numerator and the

364
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,115
denominator.

365
00:17:19,115 --> 00:17:22,220
If the denominator has a
larger degree, then the

366
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,769
denominator is going to get
larger much faster than the

367
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:26,329
numerator, and your asymptote
is going to be 0.

368
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:28,359
I'll show an example of
that in the future.

369
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:30,870
And obviously, if your numerator
has a higher degree

370
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:34,400
than your denominator, it's
going to grow way faster than

371
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,230
your denominator, and you won't
have any asymptotes.

372
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,340
You'll just keep growing,
or keep going in

373
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,020
the negative direction.

374
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,970
And that's actually the case
with all of the polynomials

375
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:41,300
we've seen.

376
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,620
You can do them all
as being over 1.

377
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:48,070
In which case, there was no
horizontal asymptote.

378
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,520
Now the vertical asymptotes you
identify by essentially

379
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,110
just factoring the denominator
and figuring out where

380
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,150
does it equal 0.

381
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:57,870
Those are the points where the
function is not defined.

382
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,660
And I'll show you in the future,
there are some special

383
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,030
cases where they won't be
vertical asymptotes, and I

384
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:06,870
guess that special case is,
for example, if you had--

385
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,950
Well, I won't show you the
special case right now.

386
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,430
I'll show you that in
a future video.

387
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:14,460
But in general, if you factor
the bottom terms and they

388
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,430
don't cancel out with anything
on the numerator, then you're

389
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,030
going to be dealing with
a vertical asymptote.

390
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:23,800
If I had another x minus 4 up
here, if my numerator was x

391
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:29,500
squared times x minus 4, and
then these canceled out, and

392
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,500
my expression simplified to
this, the equation would still

393
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,500
be undefined at x is equal to 4,
because you would give the

394
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,700
0 in the denominator.

395
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,825
But since that x minus 4 cancels
out with the x minus 4

396
00:18:40,825 --> 00:18:42,560
in the numerator, it
would not have

397
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,920
been a vertical asymptote.

398
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,890
We'll look at that
in the future.

399
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:49,070
But this equation wasn't that.

400
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,310
So the general rule of thumb for
identifying the vertical

401
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:55,140
asymptotes, factor the
denominator, figure out where

402
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,440
the denominator equals 0, and
if those terms don't cancel

403
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,800
out with any terms of the
numerator, then those are

404
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,020
vertical asymptotes.

405
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:05,050
And then to figure out the
behavior, I guess, within the

406
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:07,370
asymptotes, you can
plot some points.

407
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:08,860
You can try out some points.

408
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,180
You can actually substitute
values for x and

409
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,600
figure out what y is.

410
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,100
Now just to validate that we
hopefully got the right

411
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:21,240
answer, let's actually graph
our rational function.

412
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,830
So let me turn it on.

413
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,525
Let me graph it.

414
00:19:24,525 --> 00:19:32,450
And we say y is equal to
x squared divided by x

415
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,980
squared minus 16.

416
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,890
And let's see what we get.

417
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:42,370
Nope, I just want to graph it.

418
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:45,490
My range is off.

419
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,150
Let me do my range.

420
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:51,120
Let me see, x minimum value I
want for x, let's say it's

421
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,140
negative 10.

422
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,850
My maximum value I
want for x is 10.

423
00:19:55,850 --> 00:20:01,750
x scale is 1. y minimum value,
I want negative 10.

424
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,900
y maximum value, I want 10.

425
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,630
Then y scale, I want 1.

426
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:09,150
Now let me graph it.

427
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:09,990
There we go.

428
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,930
Look at that.

429
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,160
Just like what we drew.

430
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,830
We have an asymptote, as x gets
really large, or x gets

431
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:19,530
really, really small, that
asymptote is y is equal to 1.

432
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,910
We have our vertical
asymptote.

433
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:24,110
It graphed it because it tried
to connect the dots, but it

434
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,170
essentially graphed our
asymptotes for us, but that

435
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:27,860
wouldn't actually be
part of the graph.

436
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:31,910
But as we approach 4 from
0, I guess we can

437
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,560
say, we go super negative.

438
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,230
As we approach negative 4 from
0, we get super negative.

439
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:39,220
Because in either of those
situations, as you approach 4

440
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,910
from this side, this term
is going to be negative.

441
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,150
As you approach negative 4 from
thid side, this term,

442
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:50,330
right here, is going to be--
Well, this term right here is

443
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:53,440
going to be positive, but then
this term right here is going

444
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:53,980
to be negative.

445
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,350
Negative times a positive,
you could play

446
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,090
with it as you like.

447
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,550
But we approach negative
infinity in either case.

448
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:01,270
And then as x approaches
infinity, this thing

449
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,220
asymptotes away.

450
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,960
So hopefully you
found that fun.

451
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,066
