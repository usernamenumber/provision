1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,270
Let's do some example problems

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,100
using our newly acquired knowledge

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,940
of isosceles and equilateral triangles

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,340
So over here I have a kind of a triangle within a triangle

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,650
And we need to figure out this orange angle right over here,

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,100
and this blue angle right over here

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,940
And we know that side AB is equal to！

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:25,000
or segment AB is equal to segment BC, which is equal to segment CD,

9
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,900
or we could also call that DC

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:33,110
So first of all, we see that triangle！ triangle ABC is isosceles

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,860
And because it's isosceles,

12
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,660
the two base angles are going to be congruent

13
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,190
This is one leg, this is the other leg right over there

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,110
So the two base angles are going to be congruent

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,860
So we know that this angle right over here is also 31 degrees

16
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,290
Well, if we know 2 of the angles in a triangle,

17
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,230
we can always figure out the third angle

18
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,060
They have to add up to 180 degrees

19
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,030
So if we！ we could say 31 degrees + 31 degrees

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:06,710
+ the measure of angle ABC is equal to 180 degrees

21
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,650
You could subtract 62

22
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,740
This right here is 62 degrees

23
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,710
You subtract 62 from both sides,

24
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,910
You get the measure of angle ABC is equal to

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,380
Let's see

26
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,560
You subtract another 2, you get 118 degrees

27
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:29,380
So this angle right over here is 118 degrees

28
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,260
Let me just write it like this

29
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,960
This is 118 degrees

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,230
Well, this angle right over here,

31
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,290
this angle right over here is supplementary to that 118 degrees

32
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,970
So that angle + 118 is going to be equal to 180

33
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,770
We already know that that's 62 degrees!

34
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:51,810
62 + 118 is 180, so this right over here is 62 degrees

35
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,940
Now, this angle is one of the base angles for triangle BCD

36
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,740
I didn't draw it that way, but this side and this side are congruent

37
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,470
BC had the same length as CD

38
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,720
Those are the 2 legs of an isosceles triangle

39
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,000
You can kind of imagine it was turned upside down

40
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,270
This is the vertex

41
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,730
This is one base angle

42
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,310
This is the other base angle

43
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,450
Well, the base angles are going to be congruent

44
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,780
So this is going to be 62 degrees, as well

45
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,660
And then finally, if you wanna figure out this blue angle

46
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,410
The blue angle + these two 62 degree angles

47
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,530
are gonna have to add up to 180 degrees

48
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,190
So you get 62 + 62 + the blue angle,

49
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:38,060
which is the measure of angle BCD, measure of angle BCD,

50
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,840
is gonna have to be equal to 180 degrees

51
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,510
These 2 characters, let's see

52
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,140
62 + 62 is 124

53
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,500
You subtract 124 from both sides,

54
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:53,050
you get the measure of angle BCD, is equal to let's see

55
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,010
If you subtract 120 you get 60

56
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,350
and then you have to subtract another 4

57
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,520
So you get 56 degrees

58
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,270
So this is equal to 56 degrees

59
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,560
And we're done!

60
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,850
Now, let's！ we could do either of these

61
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,480
Let's do this one right over here

62
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,580
So what is the measure of angle ABE

63
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,520
So they haven't even drawn segment E here

64
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,140
So let me draw that for us

65
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,370
And so we have to figure out the measure of angle ABE

66
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,040
So we have a bunch of congruent segments here

67
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,070
And, in particular, we see that triangle ABD,

68
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,830
all of its sides are equal

69
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,440
So it's an equilateral triangle,

70
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,730
which means all of the angles are equal

71
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,240
And if all of the angles are equal in a triangle,

72
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,280
they all have to be 60 degrees

73
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,100
They all have to be 60 degrees

74
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,260
So, then, all of these characters are going to be 60 degrees

75
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,390
Well, that's part of angle ABE,

76
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,420
but we have to figure out this other part right over here

77
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,560
And to do that,

78
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,400
we can see that we're actually dealing with an isosceles triangle,

79
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,720
kind of, kind of tipped over to the left

80
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,880
This is the vertex angle

81
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,500
This is one base angle

82
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,410
This is the other base angle

83
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,410
And the vertex angle right here is 90 degrees

84
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,980
And once again, we know that it's isosceles because this side,

85
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:07,080
segment BD is equal to segment DE

86
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,720
And once again, these two angles + this angle right over here

87
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:14,440
is going to have to add up to 180 degrees

88
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,790
We call that an x, you call that an x

89
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,460
You get x + x + 90 is going to be 180 degrees

90
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,470
So, you get 2x +, let me just write it down

91
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,090
Don't wanna skip steps here

92
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:30,870
We have x + x + 90 is going to be equal to 180 degrees

93
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,740
x + x is the same thing as 2x, + 90 is equal to 180

94
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,660
And then we can subtract 90 from both sides

95
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:42,600
You get 2x is equal to 90, or divide both sides by 2,

96
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,920
you get x is equal to 45

97
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,380
X is equal to 45 degrees

98
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,240
And then we're done,

99
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,500
because angle ABE is going to be equal to

100
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,640
60 degrees + the 45 degrees

101
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,750
So it's going be this whole angle, which is what we care about

102
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:04,200
Angle ABE is going to 60 + 45 which is 105 degrees

103
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,900
And now we have this last problem over here

104
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,520
This one looks a little bit simpler

105
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,750
I have an isosceles triangle, this leg is equal to that leg

106
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,460
This is the vertex, and we have to figure out B

107
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,430
And the trick is that, wait,

108
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,310
how do I figure out one side of the triangle

109
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,480
if I only know one other side, or I need to know 2 other sides

110
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,610
And we'll do the exact same way we just did

111
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,310
to the 2nd part of that problem

112
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,410
If this is an isosceles triangle, which we know it is

113
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,460
Then this angle is going to be equal to that angle there

114
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,180
And so if we call this x, then this is x as well

115
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:41,070
We get x + x + 36 degrees is equal to 180

116
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,100
The two x's when you add them up, you get 2x and then

117
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,080
I'll just！ I won't skip steps here

118
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,060
2x + 36 is equal to 180

119
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,010
Subtract 36 from both sides

120
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:57,320
We get 2x！ that 2 looks a little bit funny

121
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:11,390
And then you wanna subtract another 6 from 150 gets us to 144

122
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,540
Did I do that right?

123
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:21,080
Divide both sides by 2, you get x is equal to 72 degrees

124
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,720
So this is equal to 72 degrees

125
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,520
And we are done
