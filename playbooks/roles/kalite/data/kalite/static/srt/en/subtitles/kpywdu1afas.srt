1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,160
We learned in the imaginary numbers video, that hopefully

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,800
you've watched, that every now and then in certain equations

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,840
you end up with a square root of a negative number.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,480
You know, you end up with square root of negative one or

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,640
square root of negative nine.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,720
And since any real number, when you square it, is either zero or

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,620
positive, this was undefined for us.

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,750
And then in order to make it defined in that video, people

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,510
came up with this thing called i.

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,850
And you can call that the imaginary unit,

11
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,010
or just the number i.

12
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:36,520
And you define i as saying, well if i squared-- we'll

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,340
just make a definition.

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,160
This thing called i when you square it,

15
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,610
it equals negative one.

16
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,950
And then that simplifies the idea of taking a

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,200
negative square root.

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,300
Because then you could say, oh well the square root of

19
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:53,420
negative nine is the same thing as i times the square root

20
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,710
of nine, which equals threei.

21
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,870
And how can we say that?

22
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,390
Well, what happens when you square this thing?

23
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,690
So what's threei squared?

24
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:11,120
threei squared is equal to three squared times i squared.

25
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,460
This is just exponent properties.

26
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,880
And that equals nine times negative one, which

27
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,510
equals negative nine.

28
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:22,400
So threei squared is equal to negative nine.

29
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,100
And then if we are kind of extending the definition of

30
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,170
square roots to negative numbers, then we can go the

31
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,600
other way around and we could say threei is equal to the

32
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,780
square root of negative nine.

33
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,480
And threei we can call an imaginary number.

34
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,830
And the word is "imaginary," but it's as real as anything.

35
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,660
I mean to some degree, do negative numbers even exist?

36
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:48,560
They're just kind of a way of us-- when we put this sign in

37
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,180
front of things, it just tells us something about how it

38
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,110
relates to this magnitude.

39
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,380
Anyway, I don't want to confuse you.

40
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,010
But imaginary numbers tend to get a bad rap because they're

41
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:00,360
called imaginary numbers, so some people think that they

42
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,540
exist less than other things.

43
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,910
But with that said, any number times this imaginary unit

44
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,110
i is an imaginary number.

45
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,090
When you do the quadratic equation you realize that

46
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,920
sometimes you end up with a number that has a

47
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:16,770
little bit of both.

48
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,170
It has a real part and an imaginary part.

49
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,620
So let me give you an example of that.

50
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:31,300
Let's say I have the number five plus twoi.

51
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,490
That number you might say, oh, well maybe I can simplify it.

52
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,430
But you really can't.

53
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,450
You can't add a real number plus an imaginary number.

54
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,090
You can almost kind of imagine them-- and I don't want to use

55
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:44,020
the word "imagine" too much-- as in different dimensions.

56
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:48,790
And so a number that has a real part, like the five, and an

57
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,050
imaginary part, like the twoi, this is called a

58
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,060
complex number.

59
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:59,960
And you could, if you want, even graph a complex number.

60
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,050
Let me see.

61
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,370
You could make the vertical axis.

62
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,360
The vertical axis you could call it the imaginary axis.

63
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,710
And you could make the horizontal axis the real axis.

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,590
This is a symbol for the set of real numbers.

65
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,640
And five plus twoi, well it's real part is five.

66
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:32,560
So one, two, three, four, five.

67
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,960
That's five.

68
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,140
And it's imaginary part is twoi, so you go along the imaginary

69
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,860
axis, or the i-axis you could even say, two.

70
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:46,710
And then you would have this number here called five plus twoi.

71
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,980
In future videos I'll actually do examples where we'll make

72
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,870
more use of complex numbers.

73
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,510
But now that we've defined what a complex number is, let's see

74
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,860
how we can operate with it.

75
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,680
So what happens when we add two complex numbers?

76
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,860
Clear image.

77
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,770
So let's say we have two complex numbers.

78
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,150
One is a plus bi.

79
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,720
So the real part is a, the imaginary part is bi.

80
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,100
And let's say that I have another complex

81
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:26,420
number, c plus di.

82
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,230
And in general the symbol that people tend to use-- you know,

83
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:32,320
you always use x for when you're dealing with equations.

84
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:32,630
Right?

85
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,070
Like x could be any general real number when you're

86
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,910
dealing with an equation.

87
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,670
In complex numbers the convention is to use

88
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,560
z, the letter z.

89
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,620
So, for example, we could call this the complex

90
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,980
number z sub one.

91
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:45,800
And it could have been any.

92
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,620
I mean, this choice of z is arbitrary.

93
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,910
This is an i right here.

94
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,300
This could be z sub two.

95
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:57,830
So what is the complex number z sub one plus z sub two?

96
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:04,400
Well that equals this, a plus bi, plus-- this is z sub

97
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:07,200
two right here-- c plus di.

98
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:07,980
Let me switch colors.

99
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,500
This is getting monotonous.

100
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,350
So when you add two complex numbers, all you do is you add

101
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,140
the real parts to each other and you add the complex

102
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,220
parts to each other.

103
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:23,520
So that equals a plus b-- oh sorry.

104
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,180
The real parts.

105
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,300
So it's a and c.

106
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,120
Those are the real parts.

107
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,350
So that equals a plus c plus-- and then you add

108
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,230
the imaginary parts.

109
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,180
b plus d times i.

110
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,110
So you have b i's and d i's.

111
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,430
So when you add them together you have b plus d i's.

112
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,050
b plus d in the imaginary direction, you can

113
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,390
almost imagine.

114
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,090
I'm using the word imagine too much.

115
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,730
So it's pretty easy.

116
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,680
You just add the real and you add the imaginary parts.

117
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,050
So what happens if you multiply two complex numbers?

118
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,810
And actually, let's just go in order.

119
00:05:58,810 --> 00:05:59,920
What happens when you subtract them?

120
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:00,820
Well, it's the same thing.

121
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,870
Nothing fancy here. z sub one minus z sub two.

122
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,790
That's just going to be equal to-- you subtract

123
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,060
the real parts.

124
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,410
a minus c.

125
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,070
And that's the new real part.

126
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,570
And then you subtract the imaginary parts.

127
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,630
b minus d times i.

128
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,500
And this will be the new imaginary part.

129
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,930
So this will be the new complex number.

130
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,750
What happens when I multiply the two numbers?

131
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,690
So what is z sub one times z sub two?

132
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:33,440
Well that equals a plus bi times c plus di.

133
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,900
And we essentially can just FOIL it out.

134
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,300
I don't know if you've learned FOIL in eightth grade algebra,

135
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,100
nineth grade algebra.

136
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,510
I don't like it.

137
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,120
I actually just think of it as the distributive

138
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,250
property twice.

139
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,250
So what we could do is we can take the c plus di

140
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,870
and distribute it on each of these terms.

141
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,220
Right?

142
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:56,190
So this should be equal to a times c plus di.

143
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,000
Right?

144
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:02,530
Plus bi times c plus di.

145
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:02,850
Right?

146
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,850
All I did is I took the c plus di and I multiplied it by this

147
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,110
to get this, and multiplied it by this to get this.

148
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,720
And then we distribute again.

149
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,050
We get ac plus adi-- this is an i.

150
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,920
I know my i's aren't looking good.

151
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:25,290
adi plus-- now what's bi times c?

152
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:25,980
Well that's cbi.

153
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,670
And then we have bi times di.

154
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:38,120
So you get b times d, which is bd.

155
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,780
And then what's i times i?

156
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,740
It's i squared, or negative one.

157
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,140
Right?

158
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,620
Times negative one.

159
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,590
So what does this simplify to?

160
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,220
Well this simplifies to-- I'm going to go back here.

161
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,040
So let's see what the real parts are.

162
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:58,060
We have this term, a times c, that's real.

163
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,250
So ac.

164
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,710
And then this last term, which was bi times di.

165
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,310
Because we're multiplying i times i we get a negative one,

166
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,480
but it becomes real again.

167
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,550
Right?

168
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,920
So we get negative bd minus bd.

169
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,600
So that's our new real part.

170
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,940
So that was this term and that term are real.

171
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,310
And now what's our new imaginary part?

172
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,680
Well it's going to be these two terms added together.

173
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:28,070
So it's-- I'm running out of space again-- ad plus

174
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,840
cb, all of that times i.

175
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,770
It's a little easier with real numbers, and maybe in the next

176
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,150
video I'll use real numbers.

177
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,240
But the important thing to realize is essentially you just

178
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,980
use the distributive property and realize that you can only

179
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,630
add real terms to each other.

180
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,210
You can't add a real to an imaginary.

181
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,250
And you can only add imaginary terms to each other.

182
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,410
And just remember, when you have two imaginary numbers

183
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,000
times each other, the i's, when multiplied times each other,

184
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,060
and you get negative one.

185
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:58,000
Now the last operation, when you divide complex numbers.

186
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,360
This gets a little bit interesting, and maybe

187
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,640
a little unintuitive.

188
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,340
So what happens if I divide z sub one by z sub two?

189
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:17,230
So once again that equals a plus bi, divided by c plus di.

190
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,170
How do I divide this?

191
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,740
Well, we're going to use a property that hopefully

192
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,370
you learned in algebra.

193
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:29,020
That if I multiply-- let me do this in this corner.

194
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:33,760
a plus b times a minus b.

195
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,980
What does that equal?

196
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:39,610
That equals a squared minus b squared.

197
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,230
And so if I multiply a complex number.

198
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,550
Let's say, in theory, I multiply a complex number c

199
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:49,940
plus di times c minus di.

200
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,200
What do I get?

201
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,590
I get c squared minus di squared.

202
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,470
And what's di squared going to be?

203
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,860
It's d squared times negative one, so it becomes c squared--

204
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,720
oh, I'm out of time.

205
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,330
Actually, let me continue the division in the next video,

206
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,170
because it can get involved.

207
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,740
See you soon.
