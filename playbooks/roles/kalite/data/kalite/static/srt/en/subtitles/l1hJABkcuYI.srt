Part c: Find the value of the sixth derivative of f evaluated at zero.

2
00:00:08,364 --> 00:00:13,995
You can imagine if you just tried to find the sixth derivative of f - that would take you forever.

3
00:00:13,995 --> 00:00:17,267
And then to evaluate it at zero because it is x squared here

4
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:20,677
and you'd have keep doing the product rule over and over, the chain rule and all the rest.

5
00:00:20,677 --> 00:00:22,923
It would become very, very, very messy.

6
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:24,333
But we have a big clue here!

7
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:30,190
The fact that they made us find the first four terms of the Taylor series of f about x equals zero

8
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:35,375
tells us that there might be a simpler way to do this as opposed to just taking the sixth derivative

9
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,059
of this and evaluating it at zero.

10
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:42,513
And the simplest way to do this is to just go back - in the last problem we were able to come up with the

11
00:00:42,513 --> 00:00:47,129
first 4 non-zero terms of the Taylor series of f,

12
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:53,333
and if you look at your definition of the Taylor series right here,

13
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:58,385
(and we go in depth of this in another Khan Academy video where we talk about why this makes sense),

14
00:00:58,385 --> 00:01:05,267
you see that each degree term of the Taylor series, its coefficient is that derivative,

15
00:01:05,267 --> 00:01:10,102
(and this Taylor series is centered around zero and that's what we care about in terms of this problem),

16
00:01:10,102 --> 00:01:21,467
we see the coefficient is that derivative evaluated at zero divided by that degree's factorial.

17
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:27,379
So the second degree term is the second derivative of f evaluated at zero divided by 2 factorial.

18
00:01:27,395 --> 00:01:36,421
The fourth degree term is the fourth derivative of f evaluated at zero divided by 4 factorial.

19
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:41,354
So the sixth degree term...

20
00:01:41,354 --> 00:01:44,744
Let's remind ourselves what we're even trying to figure out.

21
00:01:44,744 --> 00:01:49,200
So they want us to figure out the sixth derivative of f evaluated at zero,

22
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,067
that's what they want us to figure out.

23
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:59,867
Well, if you think about the Taylor series centered at zero, or at zero, or approximated around zero,

24
00:01:59,867 --> 00:02:03,292
the sixth degree term in the Taylor series approximation of f

25
00:02:03,292 --> 00:02:15,892
is going to be the sixth derivative of f evaluated at zero times x to the sixth over 6 factorial.

26
00:02:15,892 --> 00:02:26,862
This is going to be the sixth degree term in Taylor approximation...

27
00:02:26,862 --> 00:02:29,333
in Taylor series.

28
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:30,560
And we have that term sitting right over here!

29
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,719
This is the sixth degree term. We figured it out in the last problem!

30
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:37,159
This right here is the sixth degree term.

31
00:02:37,174 --> 00:02:38,685
So we have x to the sixth over here

32
00:02:38,685 --> 00:02:39,939
x to the sixth over here.

33
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:41,425
You have 6 factorial over here

34
00:02:41,425 --> 00:02:43,097
6 factorial over here.

35
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:52,339
So this -121 must be the sixth derivative of f evaluated at zero.

36
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,800
So that's our answer.

37
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,887
This is equal to -121 and we're done.
