1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,280
We're on problem 87.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:11,180
It says an employee is paid 1.5 times the regular hourly

3
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:15,930
rate for each hour worked in excess of 40 hours per week. OK.

4
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:20,010
So after 40, they get overtime. 1.5 times. Excluding sunday.

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,200
And 2 times the regular hourly rate for each hour worked

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,900
on sunday. So each hour worked on Sunday,

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,000
regardless of whether or not they're above 40 hours.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,420
How much was the employee paid last week?

9
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,100
OK. So let's see.

10
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,030
Statement one tells us the employee's regular

11
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:46,030
hourly rate is $10. $10 per hour is normal.

12
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:51,050
Now based on that, we know what their overtime is.

13
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:55,000
Overtime is 1.5 times, so it's $15 an hour.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,020
And it tells us that sunday is double that. $20 an hour.

15
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,120
All of that was said in the problem description,

16
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:02,930
I guess you could call it.

17
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,640
But we still don't know how much they were paid because we

18
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,810
don't know how many hours they worked and when those hours

19
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:08,330
happened to be.

20
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:12,210
So it's still not enough information. Statement number two.

21
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:19,390
It says last week the employee worked a total of 54 hours but

22
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,920
did not work more than 8 hours on any day.

23
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,210
OK. So let's think about that.

24
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,360
If you worked no more than 8 hours in a day,

25
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,060
how many days would you have to work?

26
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:46,080
Well you would have to work-- I guess at minimum,

27
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,090
you'd have to work 6 days for 8 hours.

28
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,730
And 1 day you would work for 6 hours. Right?

29
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,760
Or there's other ways you could say it.

30
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,580
You could have all 7 days you could be working-- for how many

31
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:09,520
times does 7 go into--you could be working 7 6/7 hours a day.

32
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,930
Now neither of these help us because we don't know where

33
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:14,990
the hours were allocated.

34
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,460
We don't know how many of these hours ended up on sunday.

35
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,570
Because that's a critical question.

36
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:23,270
And we know that there was some overtime in some form, right?

37
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,400
But we don't know if that was sunday overtime or if that was

38
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,300
regular overtime.

39
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,590
Imagine working 7 6/7 hours every day.

40
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:36,720
Then you would have 7 6/7 hours for monday through friday,

41
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,760
then you get some overtime for saturday as soon as you got

42
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,010
above 40 hours. And then on sunday you would get paid double.

43
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,860
But then you have this situation.

44
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,810
Maybe sunday is a day you worked 6 hours.

45
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,860
Or maybe sunday is one of the days you worked 8 hours.

46
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,420
So we don't know. So, this problem,

47
00:02:50,420 --> 00:03:00,040
there's not enough information to solve this problem. 88.

48
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,700
What was the revenue that a theater received from the sale

49
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:10,550
of 400 tickets, some of which were sold at the full price,

50
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,260
and the remainder which were sold at reduced price?

51
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,790
OK, fair enough.

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,440
The number of tickets sold at full price-- so this is

53
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,260
statement number one-- so immediately we know that there

54
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,350
were 400 tickets sold.

55
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:27,520
And that is the number of full-priced tickets plus

56
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,810
reduced priced tickets. It's equal to 400, right?

57
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,240
Wait. Some of which were sold at full price and the remainder

58
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,460
of which-- oh, they want to know the revenue. OK.

59
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,000
They want to know the revenue.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,030
So we have to know how much we got for each of these tickets

61
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,580
in order be able to figure it out. So number one.

62
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:56,510
The number of tickets sold at full price were 1/4 of the

63
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,010
total number of tickets sold.

64
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,100
So 1/4 times-- what was the total number of tickets sold?

65
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:07,090
Well they already told us that. 400. So it equals 100.

66
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,000
And then we could just look at that and that tells us that

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,580
the reduced price were equal to--300 tickets were sold at

68
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,240
the reduced price.

69
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,280
But that still doesn't tell us the total revenue because we

70
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,320
don't know how much full price was

71
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,840
or how much reduced price was.

72
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,000
So that's not enough information just yet.

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Problem two says the full price of a ticket was $25.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,450
But we still don't know what the reduced price is.

75
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:37,130
We know the 25 100, or $2,500 were generated from the sale

76
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,170
of the full-price ticket.

77
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,000
But the reduced price, they don't tell us that.

78
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,780
How much did they reduce the price, right?

79
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,910
Some of which were sold at full price and the remainder

80
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,830
of which were sold at a reduced price.

81
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,630
We don't know what that is. It was 25% off? 50% off?

82
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,310
We don't know.

83
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,990
So unless we know the price of the reduced price ticket,

84
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,590
we can't figure this out. So once again,

85
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,810
not enough information to solve the problem.

86
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:06,620
Problem 89. What is that, a circle?

87
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,460
The circle represents one of the operations plus,

88
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,560
minus and times. OK. This is interesting.

89
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,090
So they say a circle represents one of the operations

90
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:32,810
plus minus and timesŁŹis k circle l plus m equal to

91
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:48,000
k circle l plus k circle m for all numbers k, l, and m?

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,590
Well essentially, what are they doing?

93
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,410
They're doing the distributive property, right?

94
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,620
They're saying that k-- whatever this operation times

95
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,370
l plus m-- is the same thing as k times whatever this

96
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,480
operation is with l,plus k whatever this operation is with m.

97
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,300
And the only places where the distributive property works is

98
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,090
either with multiplication or division.

99
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:10,470
And division isn't one of these properties.

100
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,920
So essentially this doesn't work with addition or subtraction

101
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,500
So if essentially we're able to prove or disprove that

102
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,010
multiplication is this operator,

103
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,570
then we have enough information.

104
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,000
This question could be rephrased as:

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,020
is circle equal to multiplication?

106
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,060
So if we can answer this with the statements,

107
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,120
then we can answer this top one.

108
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,610
Because only multiplication works with this.

109
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,630
Or division, but division isn't one of the options.

110
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:56,120
Statement one says k circle 1 is not equal to 1 circle k for

111
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:02,160
some numbers k. Well this immediately tells me

112
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,760
that this is not multiplication, right?

113
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,590
In fact, this tells me that this is subtraction. Right?

114
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,810
Because the only time where k minus 1 is different than 1

115
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,830
minus k, with addition, they'd always be equal to each other.

116
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,700
With multiplication they'd always equal each other.

117
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,000
So this has to be if you believe statement one,

118
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,630
then circle is subtraction.

119
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:23,680
Which tells you that this statement up here is not true.

120
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,970
So statement one alone is sufficient to determine whether

121
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,800
this statement is true. Or another way to phrase problem,

122
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,020
whether circle is equal to multiplication.

123
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,600
So statement one is sufficient. Statement one actually

124
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,530
tells us that the circle is subtraction.

125
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:45,010
Statement number two. Circle represents subtraction.

126
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,000
OK well they just told it outright there.

127
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,400
Well so this and this are equivalent information and so

128
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,200
they're enough to determine that this up here is not true.

129
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,370
Remember, they're not saying, is the statement true?

130
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,740
They're just saying, do you have enough information to

131
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,250
figure it out? And we know that

132
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,700
this isn't true because circle is subtraction.

133
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,000
And this statement only holds true if the circle is equal to

134
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,050
multiplication.

135
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:10,000
So each statement alone is sufficient to solve that problem.

136
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,080
Problem 90.

137
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,790
How many of the 60 cars sold last month by a certain dealer

138
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:25,300
had neither power windows nor a stereo? OK.

139
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,240
So it tells us 60 sold. And we want to know

140
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,010
how many had neither power windows nor a stereo.

141
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:37,220
Statement one tells of the 60 cars sold, 20 had a stereo but

142
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,610
not power windows.

143
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,010
Fair enough.

144
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:50,000
But that still doesn't tell us how many had neither.

145
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,230
So let me draw a little circle Venn Diagram here. OK.

146
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,530
So that's all 60 cars that were sold.

147
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,130
That pool right there, that set.

148
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:03,260
20 had stereos with no power windows.

149
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,780
So let me draw some Venn Diagrams.

150
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,050
Excuse me. All right.

151
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,140
That sneeze that I was talking about a couple of videos ago

152
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,070
finally happened and I feel-- [SNEEZES]

153
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,270
excuse me. All right. Back to the problem.

154
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,590
20 had stereos with no power windows.

155
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:25,050
So let's say that this is the pool that had stereos.

156
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:30,500
This is the pool that had power windows. And what we care,

157
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,460
actually, is what had neither stereo nor power windows.

158
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,890
So we care about this outside. Oh, that looks tacky.

159
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,060
That's a little garish. But anyway.

160
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,800
So if this is stereos, this is power windows,

161
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,620
this would be stereos and power windows.

162
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,220
You're saying 20 had stereos but no power windows.

163
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,930
So that's this right here. So I'll do another fill.

164
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,040
Yeah. That's not pleasant to look at.

165
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:02,080
But this is 20 stereo, no power window.

166
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,010
But that alone doesn't tell us what this green area is.

167
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,590
So what's the second statement? That's too dark.

168
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:13,790
Statement two tells us, of the 60 cars sold,

169
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:17,890
30 had both power windows and a stereo.

170
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,700
So that tells us that this range right here--

171
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:31,500
let me do it in another tacky color. That tells us that

172
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:35,890
that's how many had power windows and stereos.

173
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,720
Let me make sure I have a good color here.

174
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,120
So that's 30. I know that you can't see that.

175
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,410
OK. So we could answer a couple of questions.

176
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,460
We can answer, how many cars sold had stereos in general?

177
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:01,000
Well 50, right? 20 had a stereo, no power windows.

178
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,470
30 had a stereo with power windows.

179
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:07,080
So a total of 50 stereos were sold. We know that.

180
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:13,380
50 had stereos. But that still doesn't answer our question.

181
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:17,440
Of the 10 that remained-- 60 were total,

182
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,400
and there's 10 left within this space and this space.

183
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,670
We don't know how those 10 fall out. Maybe

184
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:27,410
5 had neither and 5 had only power windows with no stereo.

185
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:33,000
Or maybe there were no cars with only power windows and no

186
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,570
stereos, and all 10 had neither.

187
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,230
so you don't know, even using both statements.

188
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,400
So, at least for this one, they haven't given us enough

189
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,360
information to figure out how many had neither.

190
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,100
They did give us enough information figure out how many

191
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,930
stereos got sold, or how many cars with stereos got sold.

192
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,010
Anyway. See you in the next video.
