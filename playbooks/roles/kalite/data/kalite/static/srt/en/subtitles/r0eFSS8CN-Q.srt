Find the natural logarithm of 3 using a calculator.

2
00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:06,432
Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.

3
00:00:06,432 --> 00:00:08,707
And this is a reminder: natural log of 3 --

4
00:00:08,707 --> 00:00:12,934
this is just another way of saying log base e of 3.

5
00:00:12,934 --> 00:00:17,508
Or what power do I have to raise e to get to 3.

6
00:00:17,508 --> 00:00:19,435
And 3 is a little bit larger than e.

7
00:00:19,435 --> 00:00:21,641
e is 2.71 and then it goes on and on.

8
00:00:21,641 --> 00:00:24,660
So 3 is a little bit larger than e. So I'm guessing it gonna be

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,935
1. something something.

10
00:00:26,935 --> 00:00:29,141
Let's get our calculator out and just calculate it.

11
00:00:29,141 --> 00:00:32,508
So natural log, that's this button over here "ln".

12
00:00:32,508 --> 00:00:35,991
I'm assuming it's maybe from french "log naturelle"

13
00:00:35,991 --> 00:00:37,779
or something like that.

14
00:00:37,779 --> 00:00:40,356
So natural log of 3 is

15
00:00:40,356 --> 00:00:45,116
1. (and they want us to round to the nearest hundedth).

16
00:00:45,116 --> 00:00:49,133
So 1.09 and at the thousandths place is an 8,

17
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:53,499
which is greater or equal to 5, so we want to round up.

18
00:00:53,499 --> 00:00:57,562
So we want to round 9 up, that essentialy takes us to 10.

19
00:00:57,562 --> 00:01:00,256
So 1.10.

20
00:01:00,256 --> 00:01:04,296
So this is approximately equal to 1.10,

21
00:01:04,296 --> 00:01:08,034
when we round to the nearest hundredth.
