1
00:00:00,218 --> 00:00:02,957
Hedge funds are talked a lot about in the press

2
00:00:02,957 --> 00:00:06,784
and usually with a slightly suspicious or negative tone

3
00:00:06,784 --> 00:00:08,807
so what I want to do in this video is think about

4
00:00:08,807 --> 00:00:10,354
or give us a way of thinking about

5
00:00:10,354 --> 00:00:13,742
whether a hedge fund, or really any financial type of organization

6
00:00:13,742 --> 00:00:16,607
or institution is good or bad,

7
00:00:16,607 --> 00:00:19,200
and I won't try to take one side or the other

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,941
just give you some type of things to think about.

9
00:00:21,941 --> 00:00:25,075
So the first thing that sometimes is complained about

10
00:00:25,075 --> 00:00:26,542
when people talk about hedge funds,

11
00:00:26,542 --> 00:00:28,075
is that the compensation structure,

12
00:00:28,075 --> 00:00:31,743
because the hedge fund gets 20% of the profits

13
00:00:31,743 --> 00:00:34,991
but if the fund were to kind of blow up and go to zero

14
00:00:34,991 --> 00:00:39,025
the hedge fund manager isn't on the line for 20% of the losses

15
00:00:39,025 --> 00:00:42,474
people would argue that that encourages hedge fund managers

16
00:00:42,474 --> 00:00:48,582
to take disproportionate levels of risk

17
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:51,398
and that is true to some degree

18
00:00:51,398 --> 00:00:54,809
but one thing that is true about hedge funds is that usually

19
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:59,239
it's expected that the manager or the general partner

20
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:02,098
has some of their own skin in the game

21
00:01:02,098 --> 00:01:05,736
so as an example, I drew a Pete Capital Fund 1

22
00:01:05,736 --> 00:01:08,211
the manager committed 10% of the funds

23
00:01:08,211 --> 00:01:10,350
and what's more important, as apposed to just the

24
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,617
percentage of the total fund is

25
00:01:11,617 --> 00:01:15,868
what percentage of Pete's total net worth is in the fund?

26
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:18,036
Some fund managers will put a significant amount

27
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,933
of their own personal net worth in the fund

28
00:01:19,933 --> 00:01:22,818
so even though they get 20% of the upside,

29
00:01:22,818 --> 00:01:25,201
if the fund were to really do horribly,

30
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:26,935
if it were to blow up,

31
00:01:26,935 --> 00:01:29,498
that manager usually will really be on the line

32
00:01:29,498 --> 00:01:31,535
and that's usually the job of the limited partners here

33
00:01:31,535 --> 00:01:35,035
we've mentioned before that versus a mutual fund

34
00:01:35,035 --> 00:01:38,219
the limited partners of a hedge fund need to be sophisticated,

35
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:40,855
they need to be accredited investors, they need to have a certain net worth

36
00:01:40,855 --> 00:01:43,689
they need to show that they understand these type of instruments

37
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:46,305
and so it's really the job of the limited partners

38
00:01:46,305 --> 00:01:48,153
and it's really in their interest

39
00:01:48,153 --> 00:01:50,424
to make sure that they're investing in a fund

40
00:01:50,424 --> 00:01:53,037
where one, Pete looks like a credible guy,

41
00:01:53,037 --> 00:01:56,337
Pete has some skin in the game, and hopefully

42
00:01:56,337 --> 00:01:58,967
a substantial amount of skin in the game relative

43
00:01:58,967 --> 00:02:00,984
to Pete's net worth.

44
00:02:00,984 --> 00:02:03,672
Pete has a reputation, and then they have to decide

45
00:02:03,672 --> 00:02:05,805
their own comfort level with how transparent

46
00:02:05,805 --> 00:02:08,386
Pete is, a lot of hedge funds won't tell their investors a lot of

47
00:02:08,386 --> 00:02:10,608
what they're doing with this $100,000,000

48
00:02:10,608 --> 00:02:12,424
sometimes they'll give a little bit more information

49
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:13,572
or a little bit less,

50
00:02:13,572 --> 00:02:16,316
that could be a negative obviously, because who knows?

51
00:02:16,316 --> 00:02:19,026
Maybe they're going to Las Vegas and they're gambling away this money

52
00:02:19,026 --> 00:02:21,134
but that's where the reputation of the manager matters a lot

53
00:02:21,134 --> 00:02:25,169
but also the secrecy actually could be good for the limited partners

54
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:30,523
because sometimes if everyone knows exactly what's happening inside of the fund

55
00:02:30,523 --> 00:02:32,196
and that information goes out,

56
00:02:32,196 --> 00:02:34,800
there could be other people that could somehow

57
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,403
trade against the fund, or make the same investments of the fund

58
00:02:37,403 --> 00:02:40,119
or if this was a large fund, go ahead of that fund

59
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:43,548
and try to buy whatever this fund was trying to buy ahead of time

60
00:02:43,548 --> 00:02:46,333
so there's kind of pros and cons to the secrecy,

61
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,966
but that risk is definitely there,

62
00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:53,028
and, you know, one thing that I guess is probably interesting to point out

63
00:02:53,028 --> 00:02:57,187
is that this idea of getting a percentage of the upside

64
00:02:57,187 --> 00:03:01,484
but having very limited downside is not unique to hedge funds

65
00:03:01,484 --> 00:03:04,716
in fact, this is probably true of most corporate executives,

66
00:03:04,716 --> 00:03:08,080
in fact, most corporate executives probably don't have as much skin in the game

67
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,003
we've all heard about golden parachutes and all of the rest

68
00:03:11,003 --> 00:03:16,415
if CEOs do really well, they usually get huge, huge, huge bonuses,

69
00:03:16,415 --> 00:03:20,233
if they do horribly and they get fired, they still get golden parachutes

70
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,639
and that actually probably doesn't happen to hedge fund managers,

71
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:25,599
so this idea of a percentage of the upside

72
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,605
without the same percentage of the downside

73
00:03:27,605 --> 00:03:29,291
isn't unique to hedge funds managers,

74
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:32,303
it happens to corporate executives, it happens to

75
00:03:32,303 --> 00:03:35,334
heads of banks, it happens to bankers generally

76
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:37,252
where they get these huge bonuses in a year

77
00:03:37,252 --> 00:03:38,999
but in the next year, if the bank goes out of business

78
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:42,271
no one asks them to kind of give back their bonuses.

79
00:03:42,271 --> 00:03:47,278
So I'm not going to defend it, I'm just going to say that it's not unique to hedge funds.

80
00:03:47,278 --> 00:03:50,561
Now the other kind of notion that sometimes people

81
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:55,677
talk relative to a hedge fund is this idea of secrecy

82
00:03:55,677 --> 00:03:59,427
because it is not regulated, the hedge fund manager

83
00:03:59,427 --> 00:04:02,346
kind of has its choice of what they do over here

84
00:04:02,346 --> 00:04:04,917
and this secrecy, you know, I'll put a little asterix over here,

85
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:08,627
because in order for these people to be willing to commit their fund

86
00:04:08,627 --> 00:04:10,950
the hedge fund manager has to tell them something about

87
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,616
what he's up to, so it's up to the hedge fund manager.

88
00:04:14,616 --> 00:04:17,044
But some people work that the secrecy

89
00:04:17,044 --> 00:04:18,991
the secrecy that the hedge fund has,

90
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:21,609
combined with the fact that they're allowed to invest

91
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:24,226
in more, I guess you could say, exotic things

92
00:04:24,226 --> 00:04:26,192
they don't have to, and I want to be very clear

93
00:04:26,192 --> 00:04:29,053
a lot of hedge funds, even though they have this whole structure

94
00:04:29,053 --> 00:04:33,125
with the 2% management fee, and the 20% carried interest,

95
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,389
a lot of hedge funds, their actual investments

96
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:38,325
might look very similar to a lot of mutual funds

97
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:41,009
in fact, some of them might be more conservative

98
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:43,165
than many mutual funds, so it's not necessarily the case

99
00:04:43,165 --> 00:04:45,984
that hedge funds are doing crazy things over here.

100
00:04:45,984 --> 00:04:48,819
But some of them are, and so that combination

101
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:53,276
of the secrecy, that they might be speculating on this or that

102
00:04:53,276 --> 00:04:55,750
or buying all sorts of crazy derivatives contracts

103
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,056
that makes people feel that hey, there might be something shady

104
00:04:59,056 --> 00:05:00,926
going on over here.

105
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:04,577
And, the way I think about it is, if the hedge fund is relatively small

106
00:05:04,577 --> 00:05:07,436
and $100,000,000 would actually be small in the scale of a hedge fund

107
00:05:07,436 --> 00:05:09,101
or I guess another way to think about it:

108
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:11,835
if the assets that are controlled are relatively small

109
00:05:11,835 --> 00:05:14,846
because with sophisticated derivatives, with $100,000,000

110
00:05:14,846 --> 00:05:17,101
you can actually control much more than

111
00:05:17,101 --> 00:05:20,598
$100,000,000 in notional assets, but if the notional assets

112
00:05:20,598 --> 00:05:24,112
that the hedge fund controls are relatively small

113
00:05:24,112 --> 00:05:29,625
then the secrecy, and kind of the, whatever the hedge fund might do

114
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:32,911
it really just puts the investors of the hedge fund at risk

115
00:05:32,911 --> 00:05:34,580
and so it's really these people's job,

116
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,779
it doesn't put society as a whole at risk

117
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:39,873
the time when hedge funds get dangerous,

118
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:43,961
or potentially get dangerous, or the most cited example of this

119
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:46,729
is long-term capital management in the late 90s

120
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:51,046
Let me write that down, LTCM, I'll do a whole series of videos on this eventually

121
00:05:51,046 --> 00:05:54,664
but long-term capital management controlled so much

122
00:05:54,664 --> 00:05:56,241
in notional funds, now we're talking about in the

123
00:05:56,241 --> 00:05:59,483
hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars

124
00:05:59,483 --> 00:06:07,555
that this fund became too big to fail

125
00:06:07,555 --> 00:06:10,169
and I think you know from the recent financial crisis

126
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,638
that this doesn't happen only to hedge funds

127
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:14,382
and so you have this general notion

128
00:06:14,382 --> 00:06:16,254
that when any financial institution

129
00:06:16,254 --> 00:06:19,853
starts kind of controlling trillions of dollars

130
00:06:19,853 --> 00:06:21,583
or hundreds of billions of dollars,

131
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:24,613
it can start a cascade through the entire financial system

132
00:06:24,613 --> 00:06:28,452
that's not a good thing. This is not a good thing,

133
00:06:28,452 --> 00:06:31,996
this is not good, because when something is too big to fail

134
00:06:31,996 --> 00:06:33,318
people don't let it fail

135
00:06:33,318 --> 00:06:35,624
and that goes against everything that we know about capitalism.

136
00:06:35,624 --> 00:06:38,199
Capitalism, when people do well, let them do well,

137
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,819
but when people fail, let them fail.

138
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,420
The thing I want to point out is that this is not unique to hedge funds

139
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:51,239
AIG which is probably one of the main culprits of the last financial crisis

140
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:54,377
they were an insurer, do you have the rating agencies,

141
00:06:54,377 --> 00:06:55,970
they weren't too big to fail

142
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,898
but they helped kind of validate some of these other

143
00:06:58,898 --> 00:07:01,697
too big to fail actors. You had all of these banks

144
00:07:01,697 --> 00:07:03,256
that were too big to fail.

145
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,184
So I think the general principle here is that

146
00:07:05,184 --> 00:07:07,176
a hedge fund can be good, it can be bad,

147
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:10,168
what's unique about them relative to a mutual fund

148
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:12,452
is that they tend to be a little bit more private

149
00:07:12,452 --> 00:07:16,376
they have more support, they should have more sophisticated investors

150
00:07:16,376 --> 00:07:18,036
but what they do with their money might be

151
00:07:18,036 --> 00:07:22,015
um, exactly the same thing as what a mutual fund

152
00:07:22,015 --> 00:07:24,523
might do, it might even be more conservative than a mutual fund,

153
00:07:24,523 --> 00:07:28,917
it might take on, it might use sophisticated instruments to take on less risk

154
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:30,353
than a mutual fund,

155
00:07:30,353 --> 00:07:32,905
and I think the takeaway, or at least in my mind,

156
00:07:32,905 --> 00:07:35,747
is that any of these things, hedge funds,

157
