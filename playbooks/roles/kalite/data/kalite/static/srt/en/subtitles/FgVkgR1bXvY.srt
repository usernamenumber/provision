1
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:11,695
we go upstairs into the rooms of the noviciet

2
00:00:11,695 --> 00:00:15,655
thtat is for the novices, who are joining jessuit

3
00:00:15,655 --> 00:00:17,937
order. in the 1500s this was a new order

4
00:00:17,937 --> 00:00:21,419
of religion founded by ignatius lowen in 1556

5
00:00:21,419 --> 00:00:25,952
we've swtumbled int a room. it is almost an active

6
00:00:25,952 --> 00:00:27,943
shock certainly surprised to see what appears

7
00:00:27,943 --> 00:00:30,559
to be a young man on his deathbed. somtimes

8
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:32,946
in the gloom entering this room you really think that

9
00:00:32,946 --> 00:00:35,701
somebody is in front of you lying on a couch

10
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:40,370
a sort of day bed. and this is stannish lez cock.

11
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:46,056
he is a young polish novice of the jessuit order

12
00:00:46,056 --> 00:00:49,976
he died only at 18. and he bore his tubuleaous bread and tudious trength

13
00:00:49,976 --> 00:00:53,206
and died with a vision of virgin mary before him

14
00:00:53,206 --> 00:00:56,706
this was made before he was officially declared

15
00:00:56,706 --> 00:00:59,910
a saint. this was made in 1703. whatwe see is a very

16
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,175
richly carved, a very detailed statue of a young man

17
00:01:03,175 --> 00:01:05,658
lying very naturalistically on a bed and

18
00:01:05,658 --> 00:01:07,381
everything is color here. it is awery ti stun that we have

19
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:14,141
sicilian jaspberry, an opal coloured marble

20
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:17,392
we have a deep black stone marble for clothing the

21
00:01:17,392 --> 00:01:20,585
newart, for he as member of the jessuit order ought to be wearing black

22
00:01:20,585 --> 00:01:24,571
and white pillows and of course the flesh is done

23
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:28,773
in white marble. he is holding an image of

24
00:01:28,773 --> 00:01:31,201
the virgin and the crucifix. and he would have

25
00:01:31,201 --> 00:01:34,117
originally had a halo which would have picked up

26
00:01:34,117 --> 00:01:37,700
that sense of yellow and gold and even more.

27
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,210
as i said he is not realistic. he is not lying

28
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:44,889
as if he has died and we are watching him lying in state here.

29
00:01:44,889 --> 00:01:48,257
he is still alive or he is in the moment of passing .

30
00:01:48,257 --> 00:01:51,808
and this was something that fascinated buroka artists.

31
00:01:51,808 --> 00:01:55,726
but nene who had died by the time this was done

32
00:01:55,726 --> 00:01:59,625
was really one of the pioneers in showing the transition

33
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:02,736
the trapazzo from life to death or those moments

34
00:02:02,736 --> 00:02:06,086
in which you go from the earthly to spiritual form

35
00:02:06,086 --> 00:02:10,343
life to death but that was acomfitting return of

36
00:02:10,343 --> 00:02:13,638
singular force it is very intimate . and thats why it has

37
00:02:13,638 --> 00:02:15,735
shocked ina good way many of the cisitors who have

38
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:18,241
come into this room. it is a very intimate place

39
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:21,639
it is a quiet sight of the burrer.burrer does not necessarily

40
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:27,060
mean loud. it is life size.llywe are attending persona lly

41
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,384
to this young mans death. and this was part of the art of

42
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:34,269
jassued persuasive of. the artists persuasion

43
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:36,608
prove example thro art agian thro reading

44
00:02:36,608 --> 00:02:39,975
of course as well. you are brought close to

45
00:02:39,975 --> 00:02:43,294
what matters about , the passing from life to death

46
00:02:43,294 --> 00:02:49,624
and in this case as you see absolutely unshakeable faith.

47
00:02:49,624 --> 00:02:51,605
and the realism of this is such so moving and

48
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:52,610
upsetting in a way that the way that he

49
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,297
lifts his arm up to hold the framed image

50
00:02:57,297 --> 00:03:00,843
of the virgin and clasps with his other hand

51
00:03:00,843 --> 00:03:01,917
the rosary and the cross. its that that

52
00:03:01,917 --> 00:03:02,722
moment of you know someting is happening in front of you

53
00:03:02,722 --> 00:03:05,942
in the 19th century ther was a railing around it

54
00:03:05,942 --> 00:03:10,946
for now there is not that mount of trust. we are

55
00:03:10,946 --> 00:03:14,182
not touching it we could stretch an arm and shke it with his hand

56
00:03:14,182 --> 00:03:16,985
the crucifix is a separate carved object

57
00:03:16,985 --> 00:03:20,046
in the rosaries roll.but if you look closely

58
00:03:20,046 --> 00:03:22,780
the details such as the eyes and the nails

59
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,414
of hi fingers and toenails ae crefully incised

60
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:29,641
this is a very detailed work about. while the

61
00:03:29,641 --> 00:03:33,292
floor the draper and bed itself is so dramatic

62
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:37,917
work. i think itis so for this work is very hard and is

63
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:41,180
meant to be seen very close the fineness of the cloth is

64
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,959
as unso accurate of the undershirt and the collar

65
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,498
jus tthe way it should look it is not different from the collar that

66
00:03:50,498 --> 00:03:53,127
i am wearing see the burro is not censored

67
00:03:53,127 --> 00:04:00,448
we ar eso privilegeed that this is a very privaate moment htat we have been given access to

68
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:03,964
and it is so interesting for we have joined this moment

69
00:04:03,964 --> 00:04:10,119
you have this sweetness and this intimacy

70
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:16,450
enchanting experience. but it is not conflict it is

71
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:20,450
a spectrum of experience. it is a range
