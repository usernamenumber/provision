1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,300
We're now starting test 7. And we're on section two.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,630
Let's see, problem 1 is on page 774.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:17,930
So they say set x-- x is equal to this-- 30, 31, 32, 33.

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,560
I haven't read the problem yet,

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,530
I'm just drawing what they drew.

6
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:31,310
This is 32, 33, 34, 35 and 36.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,580
Sets x and y are shown above.

8
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,930
How many numbers in set x are also in set y?

9
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,150
Well hopefully it's fairly straightforward.

10
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:45,160
Is 30 in set y? No. Then is 31 in set y? No.

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,370
32 is, right? And so is 33. 1, 2, the answer is 2.

12
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,060
That's choice A. Not too tough, huh?

13
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,590
All right, problem number 2.

14
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,140
If Peg traveled 10 miles in 2 hours,

15
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,840
and Linda traveled twice as far in 1/2 the time--

16
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,240
So Linda traveled twice as far.

17
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,820
So twice as far is 10 miles.

18
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,980
So she traveled 20 miles, right? Times 2, that's all I did.

19
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,240
And they say, in 1/2 the time,

20
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,420
so she traveled 20 miles in 1 hour, right?

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,320
I just do the 1/2 here. 20 miles in 1 hour.

22
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,420
What was Linda's average speed in miles per hour?

23
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,270
She did 20 miles in 1 hour. Well that's 20 miles per hour.

24
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,580
And that's choice C.

25
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,530
Also not a difficult problem.

26
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,060
Not that you should feel bad if you had it wrong,

27
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,930
it's just all about practice.

28
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,680
It's all about actually reading the problem.

29
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,590
I know that might seem a bit obvious, but you'd be surprised.

30
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,680
You've even seen me make a couple of mistakes

31
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,230
by not reading the problem properly.

32
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:52,920
OK, problem 3.

33
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,890
They say, my cousin marked this up with a black marker,

34
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,820
so I only hope that what I see is what you see.

35
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,490
So let's see, x is equal to--

36
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,690
she did this when she was in sixth grade.

37
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,570
So I'm very proud of her that

38
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,110
she was taking the SAT in sixth grade.

39
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:09,840
But anyway, x is equal to k times k minus 2.

40
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,860
Then x plus 1 is equal to what? [COUGH]

41
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,460
Excuse me. x plus 1 is equal to what?

42
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,100
So let's just add 1 to both sides of this equation.

43
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:27,790
So x plus 1 is equal to k times k minus 2 plus 1, right?

44
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,610
I just added 1 to both sides of that equation,

45
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:35,440
and that equals k squared minus 2k plus 1.

46
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,300
And that is choice-- if I can read this properly--

47
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,960
that is choice C. k squared minus 2k plus 1.

48
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,770
Problem number 4.

49
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,220
I should have drank water before starting this video,

50
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:54,040
but I will move forward and complete what I have begun.

51
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:59,250
So they draw a graph that looks something like that.

52
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:04,500
And then there's a line that goes something like this.

53
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,540
And then they tell us-- what do they tell us?

54
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,490
They tell us, well it looks like,

55
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,300
it intersects at this point, at y equals 1.

56
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,020
So this is the point,0,1, right?

57
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,820
x is 0, so this is the x-axis. This is the y-axis.

58
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,420
The figure above shows the graph of a line of y

59
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:26,500
equals ax plus b where a and b are constants.

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,070
Which of the following

61
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:34,050
best represents the graph of the line 2a x plus b?

62
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,510
So let's draw it.

63
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,650
I'm not even going to look at all the choices.

64
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,600
What would this look like?

65
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,500
So it's going to have the same y intercept, right?

66
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,300
It's going to intersect at the same point.

67
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,320
That's the y intercept. Let me draw in this peach color.

68
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,260
So it's going to intersect right here.

69
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,640
And its slope is 2 times the slope of the previous one.

70
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,330
So it's going to be even a steeper slope.

71
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,690
So the line's going to look something like this.

72
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,910
It's going to be twice as steep,

73
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:02,400
so it's going to look like this. All right

74
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,050
And all I just have is that same y intercept, right?

75
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:08,540
Because the b is still , but they've doubled the slope,

76
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,410
so it's going to go up even faster.

77
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,440
And so, if you look at all the choices,

78
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,070
we can immediately rule out all of the choices

79
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,760
that don't have the same y intercept.

80
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,680
And the only choices that have the same y intercept

81
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,210
are choices B and C, right?

82
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,950
Only those that intersect at 0, 1.

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,430
And then between B and C,

84
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,930
B is steeper so B is going to be our answer, right?

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,360
C is actually less steep than this green line.

86
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,650
Choice C looks something like this.

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,620
So its slope is less than a.

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,310
So it's not going to be choice C, so it has to be choice B.

89
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,530
B goes through the same y intercept

90
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,470
and it is steeper than our original green line.

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,660
So that's the answer,choice B.

92
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:06,490
Next problem, problem 5. OK, they drew us a triangle.

93
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,520
That's one side. That's another side.

94
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,950
They have drawn this-- whoops. I can't-- OK, there you go.

95
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,310
That's not as nice looking as I would have liked,

96
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,990
but you get the point. That's a right triangle.

97
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,210
They say that this is x.

98
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,550
And the figure above the perimeter of the triangle

99
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:32,030
is 4 plus 2 root 2.

100
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,830
What is the value of x? So what is the value of this side?

101
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,880
Well Pythagorean theorem, the value of that side

102
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,000
is the square root of x squared plus x squared.

103
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,040
So that equals, what? The square root of 2x squared.

104
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,070
You can take the x out, right?

105
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,000
Square root of x squared is just x.

106
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,010
So that equals x square root of 2.

107
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,670
And they actually even tell you that on the first page of--

108
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,390
if you go back to page 774,they tell you,

109
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,930
you have a 45, 45, 90 triangle, it's x square roots of 2.

110
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,260
But I like to solve it every time.

111
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,200
So this is x, this is x, this is x square root of 2.

112
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,980
So what's the perimeter? It's x plus x plus x root 2.

113
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:17,180
So it's 2x plus x root 2. That's the perimeter, right?

114
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,730
And they also tell us that,

115
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:22,770
that equals 4 plus 2 root to 2, right?

116
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:23,510
That's for the perimeter.

117
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,590
So you could just do pattern matching.

118
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,940
You'd say well, this looks a lot like x is equal to 2.

119
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,210
And it is, because if x is equal to 2, this becomes a 2,

120
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,660
and then this becomes a 4, right?

121
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,880
So that's our answer,x is equal to 2. And that is choice A.

122
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:51,910
Next problem. Let me switch colors. OK.

123
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,390
There's always something for me to draw.

124
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,980
Well before I draw it, let me read the question.

125
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,270
The scores on Tuesday's history test

126
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,410
for 16 students are shown on the table above.

127
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,860
Sam was the only student absent on Tuesday.

128
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,550
He'll take the test next week.

129
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,570
If Sam receives a 95 on the test,

130
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:11,090
what will be the median score for the test? OK.

131
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,100
So they give us a score and number of students.

132
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,880
So I'm actually going to write all this,score

133
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,040
and then number.

134
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:27,430
And so 1 kid got 100; two kids got a 95;

135
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:36,020
90, four kids got it; 85, 1 kid; 80, 3 kids;

136
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:49,080
75,2 kids; 70, 2 kids; 65, no kids; and then 60, 1 kid.

137
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,140
And then Sam comes along and gets a 95 on the exam, right?

138
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,890
So before, there's only 2 kids who got a 95.

139
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:55,870
Now Sam comes along

140
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,860
and there's going to be 3 kids who got a 95 on the exam.

141
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,610
So to figure out the median,

142
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,820
all I do is I list out all the numbers,

143
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,260
and then I pick the middle number.

144
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,880
That's all the median is. So one kid got 100.

145
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:18,610
3 kids got a 95: 95, 95, 95. Four kids got a 90: 1, 2, 3, 4.

146
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:24,910
One kid got an 85. Three kids got an 80: 80, 80, 80.

147
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:33,200
Two kids got a 75. Two kids got a 70. And one kid got a 60.

148
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,390
So how many does that total? I could have just added this.

149
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,680
That's actually what I should have done.

150
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:42,140
But it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,

151
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,040
13, 14, 15, 16, 17. So there's 17 kids.

152
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,630
So the median is going to be the number

153
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,300
that has eight above it and eight below it.

154
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:55,860
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, Bam!

155
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,970
That's the median, because there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6--

156
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:00,910
oh, no, no, that's not the median.

157
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,400
Sorry, sorry, sorry, this is the median: 85.

158
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,670
Because there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 above it.

159
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:12,020
And there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 below it.

160
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,930
So the answer is 85.

161
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,560
Before Sam came in there, then the median actually would be--

162
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,330
you'd have one number less here,so you'd have to move it up.

163
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,670
So it'd probably be 90,or it'd be an average. But anyway,

164
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:28,250
we know that the median is 85. And that is choice C.

165
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,080
See you in the next video.
