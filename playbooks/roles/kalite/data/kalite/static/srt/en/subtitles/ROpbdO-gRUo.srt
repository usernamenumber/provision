1
00:00:02,554 --> 00:00:03,400
I have this article right here from WebMD

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,800
And the point of this isn't to poke holes at WebMD.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,150
I think they have some great articles, and they have some great information on their site.

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,667
But what I want to do here is to think about

5
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:15,400
what a lot of articles you read, or a lot of research you might read, are implying

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,553
and to think about whether they really imply what they claim to be implying.

7
00:00:18,553 --> 00:00:22,314
So this is an excerpt of an article, and the title of the article says:

8
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:26,000
"Eating breakfast may beat teen obesity."

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,974
So they're already trying to create this cause and effect relationship.

10
00:00:31,974 --> 00:00:41,471
The title itself says: 'If you eat breakfast, then you are less likely,

11
00:00:41,471 --> 00:00:45,186
or you won't be obese, you are not going to be obese.'

12
00:00:45,186 --> 00:00:49,605
So the title right there sets up this, that eating breakfast may beat teen obesity,

13
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:51,367
and then they tell us about the study.

14
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:56,401
In the study, published in 'Pediatrics', researchers analyzed the dietary and weight patterns

15
00:00:56,401 --> 00:00:59,304
of a group of 2,216 adolescents over a five-year period

16
00:00:59,304 --> 00:01:03,067
from public schools in Minneapolis, St. Paul, Minesota.

17
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:06,000
and I won't talk too much about -this looks like a good sample size,

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,333
it was over a large period of time, I'll just give the researchers the benefit of the doubt,

19
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:12,307
assume that it was a broad audience, and that they were able to control for a lot of variables,

20
00:01:12,307 --> 00:01:16,200
but then they go on to say that the researcher's right,

21
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,333
that teens who eat breakfast regularly had a lower percentage of total calories from saturated fat

22
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:25,310
and ate more fiber and carbohydrates.

23
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,867
- than those who skipped breakfast-

24
00:01:28,867 --> 00:01:30,976
and to some degree this first sentence is obvious

25
00:01:30,976 --> 00:01:35,933
breakfast tends to be things like cereals, grains, um, you know,

26
00:01:35,933 --> 00:01:37,547
you eat syrup, you eat waffles,

27
00:01:37,547 --> 00:01:41,533
that all tends to fall in the category of carbohydrates and sugars,

28
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:43,933
and frankly, that's not even necessarily a good thing,

29
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:49,133
not obvious to me whether bacon is more or less healthy than downing a bunch of syrup

30
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:53,731
or fruit loops, or whatever else, but we'll let that be right here

31
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:58,467
'In addition, regular breakfast eaters seemed more physically active than their breakfast skippers'

32
00:01:58,467 --> 00:02:02,333
So over here they're once again trying to create this other cause and effect relationship

33
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:08,067
'Regular breakfast eaters seemed more physically active than their breakfast skippers'

34
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:16,882
So the implication here is that breakfast makes you more active

35
00:02:16,882 --> 00:02:19,133
And then this last sentence over here, they say:

36
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:24,219
'Over time, researchers found teens who regularly ate breakfast tended to gain less weight,

37
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:28,000
and had a lower body mass index (BMI) than breakfast skippers'

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,391
So they're telling us that breakfast skipping -this is the implication-

39
00:02:33,391 --> 00:02:40,733
breakfast skipping is more likely, or can be a cause, of making you overweight,

40
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:43,000
or maybe even making you obese.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,667
So the entire narrative here, from the title all the way to every paragraph,

42
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,800
is: 'look, breakfast prevents obesity,'

43
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,400
'breakfast makes you active',

44
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,800
'breakfast skipping will make you obese'

45
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
so you say, 'boy, I HAVE to eat breakfast'

46
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,800
- you should always think about the motivations and the industries around things like breakfast -

47
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,333
But the more interesting question is:

48
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:04,808
Does this research really tell us that eating breakfast can prevent obesity?

49
00:03:04,808 --> 00:03:09,219
Does it tell us that eating breakfast will cause some to become more active?

50
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:14,600
Does it really tell us that breakfast skipping can make you overweight, or make you obese?

51
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,667
Or, what's more likely, are they just showing that these two things tend to go together?

52
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:21,600
And this is a really important difference

53
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,067
And let me kind of state, slightly technical words here

54
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:27,563
and they sounds fancy, but they really aren't that fancy,

55
00:03:27,563 --> 00:03:35,667
Are they pointing out 'causality', which is what it SEEMS like they're implying?

56
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:38,400
'Eating breakfast CAUSES you to not be obese'

57
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,667
'Breakfast CAUSES you to be active'

58
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:43,539
'Breakfast skipping CAUSES you to be obese'

59
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:47,133
So it looks like they're kind of implying causality,

60
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:48,299
they're implying cause and effect,

61
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:51,067
but really what the study looked at is 'correlation'

62
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:57,633
So, the whole point of this is to understand the difference between causality and correlation

63
00:03:57,633 --> 00:03:59,400
'cause they're saying very different things.

64
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,800
'... causality versus correlation...'

65
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:08,133
And, as I said, causality says: 'A causes B'

66
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:12,467
while correlation just says: 'A and B tend to be observed at the same time'

67
00:04:12,467 --> 00:04:15,721
'Whenever I see B happening, it looks like A is happening at the same time,'

68
00:04:15,721 --> 00:04:19,067
'whenever A is happening, it looks like it also tends to happen with B.'

69
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:22,896
And the reason that it's super important to distinguish the distinction between these

70
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:29,050
is you can come to very, very, very different conclusions.

71
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,133
So the one thing that this research does do, assuming that it was performed well,

72
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:33,136
is it does show correlation.

73
00:04:33,136 --> 00:04:34,867
so this study does show correlation.

74
00:04:34,867 --> 00:04:39,893
it does show, if we believe all of their data, that breakfast skipping correlates with obesity,

75
00:04:39,893 --> 00:04:42,067
and obesity correlates with breakfast skipping

76
00:04:42,067 --> 00:04:43,467
we're seeing it at the same time

77
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:47,556
activity correlates with breakfast, and breakfast correlates with activity

78
00:04:47,556 --> 00:04:49,067
and all of these correlate

79
00:04:49,067 --> 00:04:53,941
What they don't say, and there's not data here that lets me know one way or another

80
00:04:53,941 --> 00:04:55,467
'What is causing what?'

81
00:04:55,467 --> 00:04:58,400
or maybe you have some underlying cause that is causing both.

82
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,067
So, for example, they're saying breakfast causes activity,

83
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:04,133
or they're implying breakfast causes activity, they're not saying it explicitely,

84
00:05:04,133 --> 00:05:07,133
but maybe activity causes breakfast,

85
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:13,400
maybe, people who are more active are more likely to be hungry in the morning

86
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,800
'...maybe activity causes breakfast ...'

87
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,600
And then you start having a different takeaway.

88
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,733
Maybe you say, 'wait, maybe if you're active and you skip breakfast'

89
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:24,000
- and I'm not telling you that you should-

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,733
'maybe you'll lose even more weight, maybe it's even a healthier thing to do'

91
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:30,667
we're not sure, so, they're trying to say

92
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:34,267
'look, if you have breakfast, it's gonna make you active, which is a very positive outcome'

93
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:38,067
but maybe you can have the positive outcome without breakfast

94
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:38,895
who knows?

95
00:05:38,895 --> 00:05:43,267
Likewise, they say breakfast-skipping, or they're implying,

96
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:45,049
that breakfast-skipping can cause obesity,

97
00:05:45,049 --> 00:05:46,210
but maybe it's the other way around

98
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:51,733
maybe people who have high body fat, maybe for whatever reason

99
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:53,667
they're less likely to get hungry in the morning

100
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:58,307
so maybe it goes this way, maybe there's a causality there

101
00:05:58,307 --> 00:06:02,881
or what's even more likely, maybe there's some underlying cause which causes both of these things

102
00:06:02,881 --> 00:06:03,733
to happen

103
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:06,295
and you can think of a bunch of different examples of that

104
00:06:06,295 --> 00:06:09,220
one could be the physical activity

105
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,214
so physical activity - and these are all theories, I have no proof for them -

106
00:06:13,214 --> 00:06:16,867
but I just wanna give you different ways of thinking about the same data

107
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:19,600
and maybe not just coming to the same conclusion that this article

108
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,733
-it seems like- is trying to lead us to conclude that we should eat breakfast

109
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:25,312
if we don't want to become obese.

110
00:06:25,312 --> 00:06:35,200
So maybe if you're physically active, that leads to you being hungry in the morning,

111
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,067
so you're more likely to eat breakfast,

112
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:42,067
and, obviously, being physically active makes it so that you burn calories,

113
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:44,800
you have more muscle, so that you're not obese

114
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:53,571
so notice: if you view things this way, if say that physical activity is causing BOTH of these,

115
00:06:53,571 --> 00:06:57,000
Then all of a sudden you lose this connection between breakfast and obesity

116
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:05,533
Now you can't make the claim that if somehow breakfast is the magic formula

117
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:06,933
for somebody to not be obese

118
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:08,867
So let's say that there is an obese person,

119
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:12,933
Let's say that this is the reality, that physical activity is causing both of these things,

120
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:16,333
and let's say there is an obese person, what will you tell them to do?

121
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:19,667
will you tell them 'eat breakfast and you won't become obese anymore'?

122
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:22,572
well, that might not work, especially if they're not physically active

123
00:07:22,572 --> 00:07:26,200
I mean, what's gonna happen if you have an obese person who's not physically active,

124
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:32,467
and then you tell them to eat breakfast?

125
00:07:32,467 --> 00:07:34,067
maybe that will make things worse,

126
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:38,600
and, based on that, that the advice or the implication of the article is the wrong thing,

127
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,267
physical activity may be his thing, that he should be focused on

128
00:07:43,267 --> 00:07:44,585
maybe it's something other than physical activity

129
00:07:44,585 --> 00:07:48,161
maybe you have sleep

130
00:07:48,161 --> 00:07:54,467
maybe people who sleep late and they're not getting enough sleep

131
00:07:54,467 --> 00:08:03,672
maybe that leads to obesity

132
00:08:03,672 --> 00:08:06,667
and obviously because they're not getting enough sleep they wake up as late as possible

133
00:08:06,667 --> 00:08:08,333
and they have to run to the next appointment

134
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,475
- or they have to run to school, in the case of students -

135
00:08:10,475 --> 00:08:15,560
and maybe that's why they skip breakfast

136
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,933
so, once again, if you find someone's obese, maybe the rule here isn't

137
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,600
to force some breakfast down their throats,

138
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,336
maybe it'll become even worse, because maybe it is their lack of sleep

139
00:08:25,336 --> 00:08:28,145
that's causing their metabolism to slow down, or whatever

140
00:08:28,145 --> 00:08:31,000
so it's very very important, when you're looking at any of these studies,

141
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,933
to try to say 'is this a correlation? or is this causality?'

142
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:37,155
If it's correlation, you cannot make the judgement that,

143
00:08:37,155 --> 00:08:40,243
'hey, eating breakfast is necessarily gonna make somebody less obese,'

144
00:08:40,243 --> 00:08:42,565
all that tells you is that these things move together.

145
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:47,209
A better study would be one that is able to prove the causality.

146
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:51,933
And then we can think of other underlying causes that would kind of

147
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:54,867
break down the narratives that this piece is trying to say

148
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,400
-I'm not saying it's wrong!

149
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,067
maybe it's absolutely true that eating breakfast will fight obesity

150
00:08:59,067 --> 00:09:03,067
But I think it's equally or more important to think about what the other causes are,

151
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:05,576
not to just make a blanket statement like that.

152
00:09:05,576 --> 00:09:13,733
So, for example, maybe poverty causes you to skip a breakfast, for multiple reasons,

153
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:17,488
maybe if both of your parents are working, there's no one there to give you breakfast,

154
00:09:17,488 --> 00:09:21,333
um, maybe there's more stress in the family, who knows what it might be,

155
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:27,612
and so, when you have poverty, maybe you are more likely to skip breakfast,

156
00:09:27,612 --> 00:09:29,267
and maybe when there's poverty, maybe you have two

157
00:09:29,267 --> 00:09:31,733
- the parents are working, and the kids have to make their own dinner, and whatever else-

158
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:40,400
maybe they also eat less healthy, so eat less healthy at all times of the day,

159
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,124
and that leads to obesity.

160
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:44,887
So, once again, in this situation, if this is the reality of things,

161
00:09:44,887 --> 00:09:48,800
just telling someone to also eat breakfast regardless of what that breakfast is,

162
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,809
even if it's fruit loops or syrup,

163
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:53,867
that's probably not going to help the situation

164
00:09:53,867 --> 00:10:00,004
Maybe eating unhealthy dinners is the underlying cause

165
00:10:00,004 --> 00:10:03,696
'... unhealthy dinner...'

166
00:10:03,696 --> 00:10:05,460
And if you eat an unhealthy dinner,

167
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,867
maybe by breakfast time, you're not hungry still,

168
00:10:08,867 --> 00:10:12,867
'cause you binged so much on dinner, so you skip breakfast,

169
00:10:12,867 --> 00:10:15,400
and this also leads to obesity.

170
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,951
but once again, if this is the actual reality,

171
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,667
doing the advice that that article is saying may actually be a bad thing.

172
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:26,667
If you eat an unhealthy dinner, and then force yourself to eat a breakfast when you're not hungry,

173
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,959
that may make the obesity even worse.

174
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,953
So the whole point of this video isn't to say that the implications from that article are necessarily

175
00:10:32,953 --> 00:10:34,000
wrong

176
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,877
But the important thing is to just realize that it might be wrong,

177
00:10:36,877 --> 00:10:39,478
and just because you saw this correlation with the data,

178
00:10:39,478 --> 00:10:44,600
it doesn't mean that eating breakfast is somehow magically going to fight obesity
