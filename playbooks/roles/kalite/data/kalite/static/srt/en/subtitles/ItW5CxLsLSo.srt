1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now that we have setup the parameterization let's try to evaluate the integral.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
The next thing we need to do is express ds in terms of du and dv.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
We have seen this before ds is going to be equal to the magnitude of the cross product

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
of partial of r with respect to u crossed with partial of r with respect to v du dv .

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
First lets take the cross product and we will do that with a 3 by 3 matrix , we will do that right over here

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we set up and fill in r of u and r of v in the actual determinant over here. So first we have our components i , j , and k.

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
First think about r sub u is. The partial of r with respect to u. Well it's i component

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is going to be 1 the partial of u with respect to u is 1 so it's i component is 1 , it's j component is going to be zero

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
partial of v with respect to u is zero , v doesnt change with respect to u , so this is going to be 0 , partial of (there have

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to be brackets around here partial of this with respect to u is just going to be 1 again , this is the partial of v squared respect

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
to u is just zero , so this is just 1 again and then r sub v the partial of r with respect to v , the i component is going to be zero

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
j component is going to be 1 and the partial of u plus v squared is going to be 2v , so this is pretty straight forward determinant

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so lets try to evaluate , so i component i so we cross this column and this row , so this be 0 times 2v minus 1 times 1 , so essentially

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it is just going to be negative 1 times i so we are going to have negative i this is equal to negative i and then the j component

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we have to put a negative out front. And remember we have to check out board pattern.

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So cross out that row, that column.
