1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,540
I'm thinking about buying a restaurant.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,370
So I go and ask the current owner, what is the

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,390
distribution of the number of costumers you get each day.

4
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,880
He said, oh I've already figured that out. And he gives me this distribution over here.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,510
It essentially says, %10 of his costumers come on Monday;

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,090
%10 on Tuesday; %15 on Wednesday, so forth and so on.

7
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,520
They're closed on Sundays.

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,380
So this is 100% of their costumers for a week. If you add it all up you will get 100%.

9
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,500
I obviously am a little suspicious. So I decide to see

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:32,090
how good this distribution that he is describing actually fits observed data.

11
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:36,240
So I actually observe the number of costumers when they come in during the week,

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,290
and this is what I get for observed data.

13
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:44,220
So to figure out whether I want accept or reject his hypothesis right here.

14
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,650
I'm gonna do a little of a hypothesis test.

15
00:00:46,990 --> 00:01:02,750
So I'll make the null hypothesis that the owner's distribution is correct.

16
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:08,990
And then the alternative hypothesis is going to be, that it's not correct.

17
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:15,270
That it's not a correct distribution, that I should not feel reasonably okay relying on this.

18
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,690
I should reject the owner's distribution.

19
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:26,960
I want to do this with a significance level of 5%.

20
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,290
Or another way of thinking about it, I'm going to calculate a statistic based on the data right here.

21
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,410
It's going to be a chi-square statistic.

22
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:41,450
Or the statistic I'm going to calculate has approximately a chi-square distribution.

23
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,870
And given it has a chi-square distribution with a certain number of degrees of freedom--

24
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,420
I'm gonna calculate that--

25
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:56,960
what I want to see is the probability of getting a result like this or more extreme &lt; 5%.

26
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:01,010
If the probability of getting a result like this or something less likely than this

27
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:05,280
is less than 5%, then I'm going to reject the null hypothesis,

28
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,610
which is essentially rejecting the owner's distribution.

29
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:16,380
If I don't get that, if I say, hey, the probability of getting a chi-square statistic

30
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:29,030
then I'm not gonna reject it. I have no reason to really assume he's lying. Let's do that.

31
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,780
So to calculate the chi-square statistic,

32
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:40,870
here we're assuming the owner's distribution is correct.

33
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,570
So assuming the owner's distribution was correct

34
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,600
what would have been the expected observed?

35
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,660
So we have the expected percentage here, but what would have been the expected observed?

36
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,380
Let me write it here, expected.

37
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:01,400
So we would have expected 10% of the total customers of that week to come on Monday;

38
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,970
10% of the total customers of that week to come on Tuesday;

39
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,130
15% to come on Wednesday... To figure

40
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:10,220
out what that that actual number is, we need to figure out the total number of customers.

41
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,430
So let's add these numbers right here.

42
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,070
We have-- calculator out--

43
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:26,030
so we have 30+14+34+45+57+20.

44
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,160
So there's a total of 200 customers who came into the restaurant that week.

45
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,320
So let me write this down.

46
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:37,780
So this is equal to-- so I'll write the total over here. Total.

47
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:41,180
Ignore this right here. I had 200 customers coming for the week.

48
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,270
What is the expected number on Monday?

49
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,980
Well, on Monday, we would've expected 10% of the 200 to come in.

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,610
20 customers, 10% times 200.

51
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,620
On Tuesday, another 10%, so we would've expected 20 customers.

52
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:58,910
Wednesday 15% of 200, that's 30 customers.

53
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:05,160
On Thursday, 20% of 200 customers, so that would've been 40 customers.

54
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,800
Then on Friday, 30%, that would've been 60 customers.

55
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:13,990
And then on Saturday, 15% of 200, it would've been 30 customers.

56
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:20,540
So if this distribution is correct, this is the actual number I would have expected.

57
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,410
Now to calculate our chi-square statistic,

58
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:30,120
let me just show it to you. And I'll write it instead of chi, I'm writing a capital X2.

59
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,810
Sometimes someone will write the actual Greek letter chi here.

60
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:36,950
But I'll write the X2 here to show-- let me write it this way,

61
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:44,560
this is our chi-square statistic.

62
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,150
But I'm going to write it with a X instead of a chi, because this is going to be

63
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,970
approximately a chi-square distribution.

64
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,270
I can't assume that it's exactly. So here we're dealing approximation right here.

65
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,780
But it's fairly straight-forward to calculate.

66
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:03,000
We take for each of the days, we take the difference between the observed and the expected.

67
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:07,830
So it's going to be 30-20.

68
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,060
I'll do the first one color coded.

69
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,680
Squared.

70
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,150
Divided by the expected.

71
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,510
So we're essentially taking the square of

72
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:20,350
almost kind of the error between what we observed and expected.

73
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,840
Or the difference between what we observed and expected.

74
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,950
We're kind of normalizing it by the expected right over here.

75
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,780
We want to take the sum of all of these. I'll do all of those in yellow.

76
00:05:29,780 --> 00:06:12,520
So + (14-20)2/20 + (34-30)2/30 + (45-40)2/40 + (57-60)2/60 + (20-30)2/30.

77
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,470
I just took the observed minus expected squared over the expected and took the sum of it.

78
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,860
And this is what gives us chi-square statistic.

79
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,430
Now let's just calculate what this number is going to be.

80
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:32,580
So this is going to be equal to what?

81
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:40,620
30-20 is 10 squared which is 100 divided by 20, which is 5.

82
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,100
I might not be able to do all of them in my head like this.

83
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,090
Plus-- actually, let me I write it this way, so you see what I'm doing.

84
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:50,810
This is going to be 100/20,

85
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:59,280
+ 14-20 is -6 squared is positive 36. So plus 36/20.

86
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:06,900
+ 34-30 is 4, squared is 16, so +16/30.

87
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:14,260
+ 45-40 is 5, squared is 25, so +25/40.

88
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:20,090
+ the different here is three squared is 9, so it's 9/60.

89
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:27,730
+ we have a difference of 10, squared is 100, over 30, +100/30.

90
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:35,880
And this is equal to-- I'll get the calculator out for this. This is equal to--

91
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:56,270
we have 100/20+36/20+16/30+25/40+9/60+100/30.

92
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:02,210
It gives us 11.44.

93
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:10,340
Let me write that down. This right here is going to be 11.44.

94
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,380
This is my chi-square statistic, or you can call it X2. Sometimes

95
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,450
you'll have it written as chi-squared, but this is approximately--

96
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:21,530
this statistic is going to have approximately chi-square distribution

97
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:27,540
Anyway with that said, let's figure out, if we assume that has a roughly chi-square distribution,

98
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:35,390
what is the probability of getting a result at least this extreme?

99
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,480
Or another way to say it,

100
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:42,340
is this a more extreme result than the critical chi-square value

101
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:45,770
that there's a 5% chance of getting result that extreme?

102
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,370
So let's do it that way, let's figure our the critical chi-square value,

103
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:53,160
and if this is more extreme than that, then we will reject our null hypothesis.

104
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,760
So let's figure out our critical chi-square value.

105
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,700
So we have an alpha, 5 percent.

106
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,940
Actually, another thing to figure out is the degrees of freedom.

107
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:08,700
The degrees of freedom here, we're taking 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 sums.

108
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,100
So you might be tempted to say that the degrees of freedom are six.

109
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,130
But one thing to realize is that if you had all of this information over here,

110
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:19,600
you could actually figure out this last piece of information.

111
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,660
So actually have 5 degrees of freedom.

112
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,800
When you have n data points like this, and you're measuring the observed vs expected,

113
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,280
your degrees of freedom are going to be n-1,

114
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,110
because you can figure out that nth data point,

115
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,230
just based on everything else that you have, all of the other information.

116
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,900
So our degrees of freedom here are going to be 5, n-1.

117
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:48,240
Our significant level is 5% and our degrees of freedom is also going to be 5.

118
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,990
So let's look at our chi-square distribution.

119
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:59,030
We have a degree of freedom of five; we have a significance level of 5%.

120
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:05,210
And so the critical chi-square value's 11.07. Let's go to this chart.

121
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:09,000
We have a chi-square distribution with a degree of freedom of 5.

122
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,240
So that's this distribution over here in magenta.

123
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,510
And we care about a critical value of 11.07.

124
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,780
So this is right here. We can't even see it on this.

125
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:27,230
If I were to keep drawing this magenta thing, all the way over here,

126
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,540
you'd have 8,

127
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,970
over here, you'd have 10, over here, you'd have 12.

128
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,860
11.07 may be someplace right over there.

129
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:45,670
So what it's saying is that the probability of getting a result at least as extreme as 11.07 is 5%.

130
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:58,320
Our results, so our critical chi-square value is equal to-- we just saw-- 11.07.

131
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:05,180
Let me look at the chart again. 11.07.

132
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:13,190
The result we got for our statistic is even less likely than that.

133
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,960
The probability is less than our significance level.

134
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:19,040
So then we are going to reject.

135
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:31,130
So the probability of getting-- 11.44 is more extreme than our critical chi-square level.

136
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:35,180
So it is very unlikely that this distribution is true.

137
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:43,350
So we will reject what he's telling us; we'll reject this distribution.

138
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,700
It's not a good fit based on the significance level.
