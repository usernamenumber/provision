1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,300
We are on problem number 11.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,090
I wrote out that chart, although you probably can't read it.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,300
So they say, according to the table above,

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,200
car engine oil with a rating of 5w

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,640
flows how many times as fast as a car engine oil

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,040
with a rating of 20w?

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,300
So how much faster is 5w versus 20w?

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,220
So let's read the chart.

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,000
It says 10w is half as fast as 5w,right?

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:36,290
So 5w is twice as fast as 10w. So 5w is 2 times 10w,right?

11
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:41,560
Then they tell us that 15w is half as fast as 10w.

12
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,110
So 10w is double the speed of 15w.

13
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,120
Actually, let's do it that way.

14
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,380
10w is double the speed of 15w, right?

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,660
And then 15w is double the speed of 20w,right?

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,240
So you have two doublings.

17
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,950
So 10w is going to be 4 times as fast.

18
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,280
It's 2 times as fast as this,

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,620
which is 2 times as fast as this.

20
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,490
So 10w is 4 times faster than 20w.

21
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:15,720
So 10w is 4 times 20w. And 5w is twice 10w.

22
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:20,420
So 5w is going to be 8 times 20w.

23
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,730
And really,

24
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,510
the most confusing thing about this is the fact that

25
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,850
these labels for these ratings involve numbers

26
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,610
that aren't proportional to actually

27
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,180
how much faster they are than each other.

28
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,400
You could actually change this to x, y, z,

29
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,220
and then it might be a little bit easier.

30
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:38,920
But that's all there is to it.

31
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,120
This is twice as fast as this,which is twice as fast as this.

32
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,010
And if you were at 5w up here,

33
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,040
so 5w is twice as fast as this,

34
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,080
which is twice as fast as this,

35
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,620
which is twice as fast as that.

36
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,320
So you're doubling three times,so it's 8 times as fast.

37
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,760
And that's choice C.

38
00:01:54,550 --> 00:02:07,690
Next problem. Let me draw that. We have a line like that.

39
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:16,840
Straight line at the bottom. Then we have a line.

40
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,610
Looks something like that.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:34,330
And this is P, A, Q, B, R.

42
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,030
This is line m. This is line l.

43
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,050
Figure not drawn to the scale. Sure.

44
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,520
In the figure above,

45
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,200
points P, A, and B are equally spaced on line l.

46
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,720
Equally spaced.

47
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,910
So that means that the distance from P to A

48
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,820
is equal to the distance from A to B.

49
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,830
They're equally spaced. That's good to know.

50
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,900
And points P, Q, and R are equally spaced on line m. OK.

51
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,100
So P, Q, and R are equally spaced.

52
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,650
It didn't look like it the way I drew it.

53
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,390
But so this is equal to this.

54
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:15,290
If PB is equal to 4-- so that entire thing is equal to 4.

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,160
So we immediately know that this is 2 and this is 2, right?

56
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,390
Because they're equally spaced. PR is equal to 6.

57
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:28,660
So this entire thing is equal to 6.

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,820
So we know that this is 3 and this is 3. And AQ is 4.

59
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:46,140
What is the perimeter of quadrilateral QABR?

60
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:51,890
Let's see, where is Q? QABR.

61
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:56,620
So we know this side. We know this side. We know this side.

62
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,390
We just have to figure out this side.

63
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,040
And I'll tell you right now that

64
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:09,290
this is going to be a similar triangle problem,I believe.

65
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,480
Because these triangles are going to be proportional

66
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,070
to each other.

67
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:23,260
How do I know that? I'm going to draw two triangles for you.

68
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,840
You have this big triangle,

69
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:32,520
and then you have this smaller triangle.

70
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,830
And the big triangle is similar to the smaller triangle.

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,960
And how do I know that? Well, they share an angle here.

72
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,970
and we know that the bigger triangle,

73
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,550
two of its sides are just double

74
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,690
the sides of the other two angles.

75
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:53,530
Or-- I'm sorry.

76
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,830
We know that, for example,

77
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,630
this side on the big triangle

78
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,810
is double this side on the small triangle, right?

79
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,170
Similar. We know this big side on the big triangle

80
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,170
is double this side on the small triangle.

81
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,680
So two sides are proportional to each other.

82
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,700
We have one common angle.

83
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,160
We know that this is a similar triangle.

84
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,740
So we know that this side is going to be double this side.

85
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,900
So this side is going to be 8.

86
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,880
And you could have probably guessed that

87
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,080
even if you didn't want to prove that

88
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,590
they're similar triangles. So this is 8.

89
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,970
The perimeter that we had to figure out to begin with--

90
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,700
this is the quadrilateral right here.

91
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:37,680
It's going to be 8 plus 3 plus 4 plus 2.

92
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,510
And what is that? That's 8 plus-- 17. Right?

93
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,890
6, 9, right. 17. And that is choice E.

94
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:54,050
Next problem. Problem 13.

95
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,920
OK. 13 and 14 refer to these functions.

96
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:03,360
So g of n is equal to n squared plus n.

97
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,910
h of n is equal to n squared minus n.

98
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,790
So the first problem.

99
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:15,040
They want to know what g of 5 minus h of 4 is.

100
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:19,660
So g of 5. Let's stick in 5 into g.

101
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:25,180
So you get 5 squared plus 5. I just replace 5 where n is.

102
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,790
And then we're going to subtract h of n.

103
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:33,000
So what's h of n? Oh, sorry, h of 4. It looked like an n.

104
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,830
And h of 4. So h of 4 is 4 squared minus 4.

105
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:45,560
And so let's simplify this.That's 25 plus 5 minus 16 plus 4.

106
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:51,530
So that's what? 30 minus 16 plus 4.

107
00:06:53,660 --> 00:07:00,310
30 minus 16 is 14, plus 4, so it's 18.

108
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:01,950
So that is choice D.

109
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,700
All right. Problem 14 also applies to this.

110
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,330
So I'll do it right here.

111
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:11,980
Which of the following is equivalent to h of m plus 1?

112
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,390
So we essentially just, everywhere we see an n here,

113
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,450
we put an m plus 1.

114
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,120
So h of m plus 1 is equal to--we see an n,

115
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,420
so we put an m plus 1 there.

116
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,870
m plus 1 squared minus-- instead of an n-- m plus 1.

117
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,800
Multiply that out.

118
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:40,670
You get m squared plus 2m plus 1, and then minus m minus 1.

119
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,510
Let's see. So this 1 and this 1 cancel out.

120
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,890
And then 2m minus m.

121
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:52,700
So you're left with m squared minus m.

122
00:07:54,890 --> 00:08:00,360
So h of m plus 1 is equal to m squared minus m.

123
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,950
But isn't that the same thing as h of m?

124
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,310
Reminds me of that store.

125
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,920
That's H&amp;M, not h of m,

126
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,280
although that would be a fun name for a store as well.

127
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,490
h of m. Well, what's h of m?

128
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,580
You put an m where you see an n.

129
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,570
So that also equals m squared minus m.

130
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,020
So the answer is h of m. And let me now look at the choices.

131
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:25,220
And that is not there. So I have made a mistake.

132
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,780
m squared plus 1.

133
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,780
They're saying, which of the following is equal to h of m--

134
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:39,230
let me clear things. OK.

135
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:40,510
So they say,

136
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:44,030
which of the following is equivalent to h of m plus 1?

137
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,400
And that is equal to h of m, right? Right.

138
00:08:51,400 --> 00:09:01,700
That is equal to m plus 1 squared minus m plus 1.

139
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:08,840
That's m squared plus 2m plus 1, minus m, minus 1.

140
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,040
So that's m squared-- plus m. Oh, sorry. Plus m.

141
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,930
m squared plus m. And then this cancels out.

142
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:24,570
So h of m plus 1 is equal to m squared plus m. Right?

143
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,320
And what's m squared plus m?

144
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,950
Well, that's the same thing as g of m.

145
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,710
Because take g of n,

146
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,140
or take g of m and that's also m squared plus m.

147
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,870
So that is choice A.

148
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:42,500
Before I cleared it, my mistake was when I did 2m minus m,

149
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,770
I got, for some silly reason, minus m instead of positive m.

150
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,560
Should be a positive m. That was my mistake.

151
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,010
I'll see you in the next video.
