1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710
   

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,360
So we already know that if we
start off with a glucose

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:12,240
molecule, which is a 6-carbon
molecule, that this

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,880
essentially gets split in half
by glycolysis and we end up 2

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,760
pyruvic acids or two
pyruvate molecules.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,230
So glycolysis literally
splits this in half.

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,200
It lyses the glucose.

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,770
We end up with two pyruvates
or pyruvic acids.

9
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:35,350
ruby And these are 3-carbon
molecules.

10
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,580
There's obviously a
lot of other stuff

11
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,480
going on in the carbons.

12
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,470
You saw it in the past. And
you could look up their

13
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,210
chemical structures on the
internet or on Wikipedia and

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:42,940
see them in detail.

15
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,220
But this is kind of the
important thing.

16
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,770
Is that it was lysed,
it was cut in half.

17
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,020
And this is what happened
in glycolysis.

18
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:54,020
   

19
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,650
And this happened in the
absence of oxygen.

20
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:57,210
Or not necessarily.

21
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,860
It can happen in the presence
or in the absence of oxygen.

22
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,520
It doesn't need oxygen.

23
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,420
And we got a net payoff
of two ATPs.

24
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,500
   

25
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,270
And I always say the net there,
because remember, it

26
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,980
used two ATPs in that investment
stage, and then it

27
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,060
generated four.

28
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,980
So on a net basis, it generated
four, used two, it

29
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,790
gave us two ATPs.

30
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,580
And it also produced
two NADHs.

31
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:28,160
   

32
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,540
That's what we got out
of glycolysis.

33
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,160
And just so you can visualize
this a little bit better, let

34
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,610
me draw a cell right here.

35
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,520
Maybe I'll draw it down here.

36
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,340
Let's say I have a cell.

37
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,010
That's its outer membrane.

38
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,460
Maybe its nucleus, we're
dealing with

39
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,000
a eukaryotic cell.

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,400
That doesn't have
to be the case.

41
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,780
It has its DNA and its chromatin
form all spread

42
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,040
around like that.

43
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,490
And then you have
mitochondria.

44
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,000
And there's a reason why people
call it the power

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,810
centers of the cell.

46
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,610
We'll look at that
in a second.

47
00:01:58,610 --> 00:01:59,290
So there's a mitochondria.

48
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,100
It has an outer membrane
and an inner

49
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,370
membrane just like that.

50
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,820
I'll do more detail on the
structure of a mitochondria,

51
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,380
maybe later in this video
or maybe I'll do a

52
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,800
whole video on them.

53
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,870
That's another mitochondria
right there.

54
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,120
And then all of this fluid,
this space out here that's

55
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,890
between the organelles-- and
the organelles, you kind of

56
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:22,710
view them as parts of the cell
that do specific things.

57
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,700
Kind of like organs
do specific things

58
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,220
within our own bodies.

59
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,050
So this-- so between all of the
organelles you have this

60
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,480
fluidic space.

61
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,090
This is just fluid
of the cell.

62
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,340
And that's called
the cytoplasm.

63
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,820
   

64
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,560
And that's where glycolysis
occurs.

65
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,440
So glycolysis occurs
in the cytoplasm.

66
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,360
   

67
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,610
Now we all know-- in the
overview video-- we know what

68
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,150
the next step is.

69
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,990
The Krebs cycle, or the
citric acid cycle.

70
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,761
And that actually takes place
in the inner membrane, or I

71
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:03,340
should say the inner space
of these mitochondria.

72
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,820
Let me draw it a little
bit bigger.

73
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,890
Let me draw a mitochondria
here.

74
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,590
So this is a mitochondria.

75
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,340
It has an outer membrane.

76
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,960
It has an inner membrane.

77
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,950
If I have just one inner
membrane we call it a crista.

78
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,430
If we have many, we
call them cristae.

79
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,565
This little convoluted
inner membrane, let

80
00:03:19,565 --> 00:03:22,410
me give it a label.

81
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,430
So they are cristae, plural.

82
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,540
And then it has two
compartments.

83
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,930
Because it's divided by
these two membranes.

84
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,880
This compartment right here is
called the outer compartment.

85
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,340
This whole thing right there,
that's the outer compartment.

86
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,660
And then this inner compartment
in here, is called

87
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,910
the matrix.

88
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:45,200
   

89
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,270
Now you have these pyruvates,
they're not quite just ready

90
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:53,220
for the Krebs cycle, but I
guess-- well that's a good

91
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,920
intro into how do you
make them ready

92
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,590
for the Krebs cycle?

93
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,430
They actually get oxidized.

94
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,900
And I'll just focus on one
of these pyruvates.

95
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,740
We just have to remember that
the pyruvate, that this

96
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,730
happens twice for every
molecule of glucose.

97
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,660
So we have this kind
of preparation step

98
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,870
for the Krebs Cycle.

99
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,120
We call that pyruvate
oxidation.

100
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,000
   

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,860
And essentially what it does
is it cleaves one of these

102
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,320
carbons off of the pyruvate.

103
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,650
And so you end up with
a 2-carbon compound.

104
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,000
You don't have just two carbons,
but its backbone of

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,740
carbons is just two carbons.

106
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,990
Called acetyl-CoA.

107
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,040
   

108
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,100
And if these names are
confusing, because what is

109
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,590
acetyl coenzyme A?

110
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,380
These are very bizarre.

111
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,030
You could do a web search on
them But I'm just going to use

112
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,360
the words right now, because it
will keep things simple and

113
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,790
we'llget the big picture.

114
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,240
So it generates acetyl-CoA,
which is

115
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,500
this 2-carbon compound.

116
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:56,500
And it also reduces some
NAD plus to NADH.

117
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,010
And this process right here is
often given credit-- or the

118
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,000
Krebs cycle or the citric
acid cycle gets

119
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,070
credit for this step.

120
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,470
But it's really a preparation
step for the Krebs cycle.

121
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:11,870
Now once you have this 2-carbon
chain, acetyl-Co-A

122
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,750
right here.

123
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,200
you are ready to jump into
the Krebs cycle.

124
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,080
This long talked-about
Krebs cycle.

125
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,670
And you'll see in a second
why it's called a cycle.

126
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,970
Acetyl-CoA, and all of this
is catalyzed by enzymes.

127
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,900
And enzymes are just proteins
that bring together the

128
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,540
constituent things that need to
react in the right way so

129
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,970
that they do react.

130
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,260
So catalyzed by enzymes.

131
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:40,280
This acetyl-CoA merges with
some oxaloacetic acid.

132
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,540
A very fancy word.

133
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,880
But this is a 4-carbon
molecule.

134
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,090
   

135
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,580
These two guys are kind of
reacted together, or merged

136
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,570
together, depending on how
you want to view it.

137
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,640
I'll draw it like that.

138
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,100
It's all catalyzed by enzymes.

139
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,000
And this is important.

140
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,210
Some texts will say, is this an
enzyme catalyzed reaction?

141
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:00,740
Yes.

142
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,070
Everything in the Krebs
cycle is an

143
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,720
enzyme catalyzed reaction.

144
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,675
And they form citrate,
or citric acid.

145
00:06:06,675 --> 00:06:09,630
   

146
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,470
Which is the same stuff
in your lemonade

147
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,810
or your orange juice.

148
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:18,330
And this is a 6-carbon
molecule.

149
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:18,990
Which makes sense.

150
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:21,160
You have a 2-carbon
and a 4-carbon.

151
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,520
You get a 6-carbon molecule.

152
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,000
And then the citric acid
is then oxidized

153
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,110
over a bunch of steps.

154
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,450
And this is a huge
simplification here.

155
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:33,540
But it's just oxidized over
a bunch of steps.

156
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,910
Again, the carbons
are cleaved off.

157
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:39,430
Both 2-carbons are cleaved
off of it to get back to

158
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,410
oxaloacetic acid.

159
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,630
And you might be saying, when
these carbons are cleaved off,

160
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,620
like when this carbon
is cleaved off,

161
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,560
what happens to it?

162
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,000
It becomes CO2.

163
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,890
It gets put onto some oxygen
and leaves the system.

164
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:56,840
So this is where the oxygen or
the carbons, or the carbon

165
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,260
dioxide actually gets formed.

166
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,390
And similarly, when these
carbons get cleaved

167
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:04,170
off, it forms CO2.

168
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,720
And actually, for every molecule
of glucose you have

169
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,980
six carbons.

170
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,760
When you do this whole process
once, you are generating three

171
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,505
molecules of carbon dioxide.

172
00:07:13,505 --> 00:07:14,630
But you're going
to do it twice.

173
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:18,000
You're going to have six carbon
dioxides produced.

174
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,970
Which accounts for all
of the carbons.

175
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:24,090
You get rid of three carbons
for every turn of this.

176
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,360
Well, two for every turn.

177
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,400
But really, for the steps after
glycolysis you get rid

178
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,395
of three carbons.

179
00:07:29,395 --> 00:07:31,490
But you're going to do it for
each of the pyruvates.

180
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,350
You're going to get rid of all
six carbons, which will have

181
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,800
to exhale eventually.

182
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,930
But this cycle, it doesn't
just generate carbons.

183
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:43,150
The whole idea is to generate
NADHs and FADH2s and ATPs.

184
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,430
So we'll write that here.

185
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,820
And this is a huge
simplification.

186
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,930
I'll show you the detailed
picture in a second.

187
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:51,730
We'll reduce some NAD
plus into NADH.

188
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:56,030
   

189
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,130
We'll do it again.

190
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,860
And of course, these are
in separate steps.

191
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,240
There's intermediate
compounds.

192
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,200
I'll show you those
in a second.

193
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,130
Another NAD plus molecule
will be reduced to NADH.

194
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:11,040
It will produce some ATP.

195
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,630
   

196
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,170
Some ADP will turn into ATP.

197
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,920
   

198
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,190
Maybe we have some-- and not
maybe, this is what happens--

199
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:30,150
some FAD gets-- let me write
it this way-- some FAD gets

200
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,100
oxidized into FADH2.

201
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,950
And the whole reason why we even
pay attention to these,

202
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,850
you might think, hey cellular
respiration is all about ATP.

203
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,850
Why do we even pay attention
to these NADHs and these

204
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:44,910
FADH2s that get produced
as part of the process?

205
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,430
The reason why we care is that
these are the inputs into the

206
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,870
electron transport chain.

207
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,730
These get oxidized, or they lose
their hydrogens in the

208
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,530
electron transport chain, and
that's where the bulk of the

209
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,500
ATP is actually produced.

210
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,910
And then maybe we'll have
another NAD get reduced, or

211
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,890
gain in hydrogen.

212
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,780
Reduction is gaining
an electron.

213
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,760
Or gaining a hydrogen whose
electron you can hog.

214
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,870
NADH.

215
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:12,170
And then we end up back
at oxaloacetic acid.

216
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,570
And we can perform the whole
citric acid cycle over again.

217
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,460
So now that we've written it
all out, let's account for

218
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:21,180
what we have. So depending on--
let me draw some dividing

219
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,890
lines so we know what's what.

220
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:26,880
So this right here, everything
to the left of that line right

221
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,130
there is glycolysis.

222
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,450
   

223
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,760
We learned that already.

224
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,520
And then most-- especially
introductory-- textbooks will

225
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:38,480
give the Krebs cycle credit for
this pyruvate oxidation,

226
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,500
but that's really a
preparatory stage.

227
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,090
The Krebs cycle is really
formally this part where you

228
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,310
start with acetyl-CoA,
you merge it

229
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,400
with oxaloacetic acid.

230
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,190
And then you go and you form
citric acid, which essentially

231
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,210
gets oxidized and produces all
of these things that will need

232
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:57,750
to either directly produce ATP
or will do it indirectly in

233
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,030
the electron transport chain.

234
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,790
But let's account for everything
that we have. Let's

235
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,630
account for everything
that we have so far.

236
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:06,490
We already accounted for the
glycolysis right there.

237
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:10,110
Two net ATPs, two NADHs.

238
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,360
Now, in the citric acid cycle,
or in the Krebs cycle, well

239
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,730
first we have our pyruvate
oxidation.

240
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,680
That produced one NADH.

241
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,830
   

242
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,040
But remember, if we want to say,
what are we producing for

243
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,600
every glucose?

244
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,430
This is what we produced for
each of the pyruvates.

245
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:29,510
This NADH was from just
this pyruvate.

246
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:33,630
But glycolysis produced
two pyruvates.

247
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:38,130
So everything after this, we're
going to multiply by two

248
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,570
for every molecule of glucose.

249
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,680
So I'll say, for the pyruvate
oxidation times two means that

250
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,080
we got two NADHs.

251
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:52,060
   

252
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,900
And then when we look at this
side, the formal Krebs cycle,

253
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,800
what do we get?

254
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,150
We have, how many NADHs?

255
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:02,110
One, two, three NADHs.

256
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:07,730
So three NADHs times two,
because we're going to perform

257
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:10,520
this cycle for each of the
pyruvates produced from

258
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,960
glycolysis.

259
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:16,170
So that gives us six NADHs.

260
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:19,640
We have one ATP per
turn of the cycle.

261
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,730
That's going to happen twice.

262
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,410
Once for each pyruvic acid.

263
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,980
So we get two ATPs.

264
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:29,260
And then we have one FADH2.

265
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,490
But it's good, we're going
to do this cycle twice.

266
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,390
This is per cycle.

267
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,020
So times two.

268
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:37,430
We have two FADHs.

269
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:42,030
Now, sometimes in a lot of books
these two NADHs, or per

270
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:45,400
turn of the Krebs cycle, or per
pyruvate this one NADH,

271
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,030
they'll give credit to the
Krebs cycle for that.

272
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,170
So sometimes instead of having
this intermediate step,

273
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,560
they'll just write four
NADHs right here.

274
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,590
And you'll do it twice.

275
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,020
Once for each puruvate.

276
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,390
So they'll say eight NADHs get
produced from the Krebs cycle.

277
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,120
But the reality is, six from the
Krebs cycle two from the

278
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,940
preparatory stage.

279
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,130
Now the interesting thing is we
can account whether we get

280
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:10,360
to the 38 ATPs promised by
cellular respiration.

281
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,170
We've directly already produced,
for every molecule

282
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:17,200
of glucose, two ATPs and
then two more ATPs.

283
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,990
So we have four ATPs.

284
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,880
Four ATPs.

285
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,820
How many NADHs do we have?

286
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,360
2, 4, and then 4 plus 6 10.

287
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,850
We have 10 NADHs.

288
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,380
And then we have 2 FADH2s.

289
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:36,470
   

290
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,710
I think in the first
video on cellular

291
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,070
respiration I said FADH.

292
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:42,860
It should be FADH2, just to be
particular about things.

293
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,690
And these, so you might say,
hey, where are our 38 ATPs?

294
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,720
We only have four
ATPs right now.

295
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,600
But these are actually the
inputs in the electron

296
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,350
transport chain.

297
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,370
These molecules right here get
oxidized in the electron

298
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,460
transport chain.

299
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,460
Every NADH in the electron
transport chain

300
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,900
produces three ATPs.

301
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:08,120
So these 10 NADHs are going
to produce 30 ATPs in the

302
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,530
electron transport chain.

303
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:14,810
And each FADH2, when it gets
oxidized and gets turned back

304
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:18,170
into FAD in the electron
transport chain,

305
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,610
will produce two ATPs.

306
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:25,050
So two of them are going to
produce four ATPs in the

307
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,320
electron transport chain.

308
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,140
So we now see, we get
four from just what

309
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,960
we've done so far.

310
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,200
Glycolysis, the preparatory
stage and the Krebs or citric

311
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,220
acid cycle.

312
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,330
And then eventually, these
outputs from glycolysis and

313
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,930
the citric acid cycle, when
they get into the electron

314
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,690
transport chain, are going
to produce another 34.

315
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:48,380
So 34 plus 4, it does get us
to the promised 38 ATP that

316
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,840
you would expect in a
super-efficient cell.

317
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,630
This is kind of your theoretical
maximum.

318
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,830
In most cells they really
don't get quite there.

319
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:58,120
But this is a good number to
know if you're going to take

320
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,680
the AP bio test or in most
introductory biology courses.

321
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,570
There's one other point
I want to make here.

322
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,790
Everything we've talked about
so far, this is carbohydrate

323
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,370
metabolism.

324
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,300
Or sugar catabolism,
we could call it.

325
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,850
We're breaking down sugars
to produce ATP.

326
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,780
Glucose was our starting
point.

327
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:18,030
But animals, including us, we
can catabolize other things.

328
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,870
We can catabolize proteins.

329
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:26,230
We can catabolize fats.

330
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:29,090
If you have any fat on your
body, you have energy.

331
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,300
In theory, your body should be
able to take that fat and you

332
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,730
should be able to do
things with that.

333
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,750
You should be able
to generate ATP.

334
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,250
And the interesting thing, the
reason why I bring it up here,

335
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,880
is obviously glycolysis is of
no use to these things.

336
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:44,200
Although fats can be turned
into glucose in the liver.

337
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,210
But the interesting thing is
that the Krebs cycle is the

338
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:51,000
entry point for these other
catabolic mechanisms. Proteins

339
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,900
can be broken down into amino
acids, which can be broken

340
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,430
down into acetyl-CoA.

341
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:58,550
Fats can be turned into glucose,
which actually could

342
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,070
then go the whole cellular
respiration.

343
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:05,020
But the big picture here is
acetyl-CoA is the general

344
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:09,300
catabolic intermediary that can
then enter the Krebs cycle

345
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,200
and generate ATP regardless
of whether our fuel is

346
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,890
carbohydrates, sugars,
proteins or fats.

347
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:20,750
Now, we have a good sense of how
everything works out right

348
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,210
now, I think.

349
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,890
Now I'm going to show you a
diagram that you might see in

350
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,700
your biology textbook.

351
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,250
Or I'll actually show you the
actual diagram from Wikipedia.

352
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,650
I just want to show you,
this looks very

353
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:32,940
daunting and very confusing.

354
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,570
And I think that's why many of
us have trouble with cellular

355
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,670
respiration initially.

356
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,720
Because there's just so
much information.

357
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,660
It's hard to process
what's important.

358
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,640
But I want to just highlight
the important steps here.

359
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,200
Just so you see it's the same
thing that we talked about.

360
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,070
From glycolysis you produce
two pyruvates.

361
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,300
That's the pyruvate
right there.

362
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,040
They actually show its
molecular structure.

363
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,880
This is the pyruvate oxidation
step that I talked about.

364
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,570
The preparatory step.

365
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,670
And you see we produce
a carbon dioxide.

366
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:03,520
And we reduce NAD
plus into NADH.

367
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,910
Then we're ready to enter
the Krebs cycle.

368
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:11,230
The acetyl-CoA and the
oxaloacetate or oxaloacetic

369
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:14,490
acid, they are reacted
together to

370
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,860
create citric acid.

371
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,180
They've actually drawn
the molecule there.

372
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,110
And then the citric acid is
oxidized through the Krebs

373
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,260
cycle right there.

374
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,220
All of these steps, each
of these steps are

375
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,590
facilitated by enzymes.

376
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,100
And it gets oxidized.

377
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,900
But I want to highlight
the interesting parts.

378
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,960
Here we have an NAD get
reduced to NADH.

379
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,950
We have another NAD get
reduced to NADH.

380
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,960
And then over here, another
NAD gets reduced to NADH.

381
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,750
So, so far, if you include the
preparatory step, we've had

382
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:47,550
four NADHs formed, three
directly from the Krebs cycle.

383
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,120
That's just what I told you.

384
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,220
Now we have, in this diagram
they say GDP.

385
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,310
GTP gets formed from GDP.

386
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,760
The GTP is just guanosine
triphosphate.

387
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,130
It's another purine that can
be a source of energy.

388
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,570
But then that later can be
used to form an ATP.

389
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,530
So this is just the way they
happen to draw it.

390
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,680
But this is the actual ATP
that I drew in the

391
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,069
diagram on the top.

392
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,210
And then they have
this Q group.

393
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,210
And I won't go into it.

394
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:14,260
And then it gets reduced
over here.

395
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,660
It gets those two hydrogens.

396
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,400
But that essentially ends
up reducing the FADH2s.

397
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,270
So this is where the FADH2
gets produced.

398
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:28,119
So as promised, we produced,
for each pyruvate that

399
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:30,280
inputted-- remember, so we're
going to do it twice-- for

400
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:35,990
each pyruvate we produced one,
two, three, four NADHs.

401
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:40,550
We produced one ATP
and one FADH2.

402
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:45,050
That's exactly what
we saw up here.

403
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,000
I'll see you in the
next video.
