1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,010
Problem number 20.

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:07,090
At a local bookstore, books that normally cost b dollars

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:12,020
are on sale for $10 off the normal price.

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:16,650
So not just $10, it's $10 off the normal price.

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,660
So if the normal price is b.

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,080
So b is the normal price.

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,420
The sale price is $10 off the normal price,

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,090
or b minus 10 is the sale price.

9
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:32,560
How many dollars does it cost to buy 3 books on sale?

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,010
So each book on sale is going to be b minus $10.

11
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,770
So if you buy 3 of them, you just multiply that times 3.

12
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,490
So it's going to be 3 times b minus 10.

13
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,070
And you see that choice right there.

14
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,500
Now if they didn't write like this,

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,090
if they multiplied it out,

16
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,750
you would just distribute the 3.

17
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,560
So it would be 3 times b, which is 3b,

18
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,000
minus 3 times 10 or 30.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,890
But that's not one of the choices right there.

20
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,020
And then lucky for us, this choice is there.

21
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,250
3 times b minus 10.

22
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,310
b minus 10 is the cost of each book on sale,

23
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,030
$10 off the normal price.

24
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,050
Problem 21.

25
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:16,020
If a line passes through the points A and B shown below--

26
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,560
so this is A and this is B--

27
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,710
approximately where does the line cross the x-axis?

28
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,640
Approximately.

29
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,010
So they just want us to get a sense.

30
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,550
So they're talking about this line.

31
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,090
Let me draw it here.

32
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,260
This line right there,

33
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,020
and I just keep going like that.

34
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,000
Do my best to draw it straight.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,940
If you had another pencil,

36
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,050
you could actually draw it perfectly.

37
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:41,050
And so where does it cross the x-axis?

38
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,050
The way I drew it,

39
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,000
it does cross the x-axis right there.

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,430
So let's see which of these say that.

41
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,310
So between minus 3 and minus 2.

42
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,000
Well, yeah, I mean just the way I drew it,

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,060
this wasn't exact, but that looks pretty good.

44
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,850
So I'll underline this.

45
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,930
If there were some other choices that were close to that,

46
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,060
I'd have to be a little bit more exact.

47
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,000
But let's see what the other choices say.

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,670
Between 0 and minus 1.

49
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,020
Well, that means here.

50
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,500
And clearly the line didn't cross anywhere near there,

51
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,220
so that's definitely not our answer.

52
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,000
Between 0 and 1.

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,040
The line was nowhere near there, so it's not there.

54
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,350
Between 1 and 2.

55
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,640
Clearly not there.

56
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,190
So we can be very confident that our choice is A.

57
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,320
Out of all of the choices,

58
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,570
that's the one that even gets close to

59
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,040
where even my rough drawing crossed the x-axis.

60
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,850
Actually, even my rough drawing did go right

61
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:29,050
between minus 3 and minus 2.

62
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,040
Problem 22.

63
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,060
Which expression is equivalent to this thing right here?

64
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,040
Let me rewrite it.

65
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,930
So we have 7 times a squared times b,

66
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,070
times 7 times b times c squared.

67
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,100
So when you have multiplication,

68
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,210
it's actually commutative.

69
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,050
You can switch the order of multiplication.

70
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,550
So if we just switch the order of this,

71
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,170
we could say that this is the same thing as

72
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:01,880
7 times 7 times a squared, right?

73
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,980
7 times 7.

74
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,650
That's that right there.

75
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,650
And then you have times an a squared.

76
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,000
That's that right there.

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,710
And then you're left with these two b's,

78
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:16,470
so you could say times b times bc squared, right?

79
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,070
That is that right there.

80
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,490
And so we can just rewrite this.

81
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,090
7 times 7 is 49.

82
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,070
a squared is just a squared.

83
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:31,520
b times b is b squared, and then you have a c squared.

84
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,010
So it's 49a squared, b squared, c squared.

85
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,030
Which is choice C.

86
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,270
49a squared, b squared, c squared.
