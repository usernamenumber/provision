1
00:00:01,231 --> 00:00:05,410
Now that we know what an angle is, let's think about how we can measure them--and we already

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:09,938
hinted at one way to think about the measure of an angle in the last video when we said:

3
00:00:09,938 --> 00:00:17,206
"Look, this angle XYZ seems more open than angle BAC so maybe the measure of angle XYZ

4
00:00:17,206 --> 00:00:23,467
should be larger than the angle of BAC", and that is exactly the way we think about the measures of angles,

5
00:00:23,467 --> 00:00:28,000
but what I want to do in this video is come up with an exact way to measure an angle.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,274
So what I've drawn over here is a little bit of a half circle, and it looks very similar

7
00:00:33,274 --> 00:00:38,568
to a tool that you can buy at your local school supply store to measure angles.

8
00:00:38,568 --> 00:00:45,862
So this is actually a little bit of a drawing of a protractor, and what we do with something like a protractor

9
00:00:45,862 --> 00:00:50,667
--and you can even construct one with a piece of paper--is we've taken a half circle right here,

10
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:56,800
and we've divided it into 180 sections, and each of these marks marks ten of those sections,

11
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,229
and what you do for any given angle is you put one of the sides of the angle--so each of the rays of

12
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:11,146
the angle are considered one of its sides--so you put the vertex of the angle at the center of

13
00:01:11,146 --> 00:01:16,467
this half circle, or if you're dealing with an actual protractor at the center of that protractor

14
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:27,400
and then you put one side along the zero mark. So I'm going to redraw this angle right over here

15
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,000
at the center of this protractor, so we can say if this is "Y", than "Z" goes right over here,

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,249
and then the other ray, "ray YX" in this circumstance, will go roughly in that direction.

17
00:01:41,249 --> 00:01:49,993
And so it is pointing on the protractor to the--let's see this looks like it is the seventieth section,

18
00:01:49,993 --> 00:01:55,937
this is the eightieth section, so maybe this is, I would guess this is the 77th section,

19
00:01:55,937 --> 00:02:02,625
so this is pointing to right over here. So when we measure an angle--so we could say that the measure of XYZ

20
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:07,559
--assuming I drew it the right way right over here--we could say the measure of

21
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:13,933
angle XYZ--sometimes they'll say "angle XYZ is equal to" but this is a little bit more formal-- the

22
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:22,728
measure of angle XYZ is equal to 77--and what we do is we call each of these little sections "degrees"--

23
00:02:22,728 --> 00:02:30,267
so it's equal to 77--sometimes it's written like that, the same way you would write degrees for a temperature outside--

24
00:02:30,267 --> 00:02:35,202
so you could write 77 degrees like that or you could actually write out the word right over there.

25
00:02:35,202 --> 00:02:39,568
So each of these sections are in degrees so we're measuring in degrees, but I want to be clear:

26
00:02:39,568 --> 00:02:44,676
degrees aren't the only way to measure angles. Really anything that measures the openness--

27
00:02:44,676 --> 00:02:49,320
so when you go into trigonometry you'll learn that you can measure angles not only in degrees but

28
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,733
also using something called "radians", but I'll leave that to another day. Let's measure this other angle: "angle BAC".

29
00:02:54,733 --> 00:03:06,333
So once again I'll put A at the center, and then AC I'll put along this zero degree edge

30
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:13,538
of this half circle or protractor, and then I'll put point AB in the--well, assuming I'm drawing it exactly

31
00:03:13,538 --> 00:03:18,067
the way that it is over there--normally instead of moving the angle you could actually move the protractor

32
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:23,933
to the angle--it looks something like that. And you can see that it's pointing to right about--well let's

33
00:03:23,933 --> 00:03:31,400
just say to right about the 30 degree mark. So you could say the measure of angle BAC is equal to 30 degrees.

34
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:37,989
And so you could look just straight up from evaluating these numbers that 77 degrees

35
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:45,071
is clearly larger than 30 degrees, and so it is a larger angle which makes sense because

36
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:52,000
it is a more open angle. And in general, there's a couple of interesting angles to think about.

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,867
If you have a zero degree angle you have something that's just a closed angle--it really is just a ray at that point.

38
00:03:58,867 --> 00:04:04,267
As you get larger and larger or as you get more and more open you eventually get to a point

39
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:09,267
where one of the rays is completely straight up and down while the other one is left to right.

40
00:04:09,267 --> 00:04:17,867
So you could imagine an angle that looks like this, where one ray goes straight up-down like that,

41
00:04:17,867 --> 00:04:23,407
and the other ray goes straight right-left. Or, you could imagine something like an angle that

42
00:04:23,407 --> 00:04:28,800
looks like this, where at least the way you're looking at it one doesn't look straight up-down,

43
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,274
or one doesn't look striaght right-left, but if you rotate it, it would look just like this thing over here,

44
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:38,933
where one is going straight up and down, and one is going straight right and left.

45
00:04:38,933 --> 00:04:45,000
And you can see from our measure right over here that that gives us a 90 degree angle, which is a very

46
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,571
interesting angle that shows up many times in geometry and trigonometry, and there's a special

47
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:56,403
word for a 90 degree angle: it is called a right angle.

48
00:04:56,403 --> 00:05:01,000
So this right over here--assuming if we rotate it around it would look just like this--we would

49
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,841
call this a right angle. And there is a notation to show that it is a right angle: you draw a little

50
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:16,231
kind of part of a box right over there and that tells us that if you were to rotate it exactly

51
00:05:16,231 --> 00:05:22,067
up and down while this is going exactly right and left--if you were to rotate it properly, or vice-versa.

52
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:30,333
And then as you go even wider, you get wider and wider until you get all the way to an angle

53
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:37,897
that looks like this. So you could imagine an angle where the two rays in that angle form a line.

54
00:05:37,897 --> 00:05:45,467
The two rays--so let's say this is point X, this is point Y, and this is point Z-- you could call this

55
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:52,467
angle ZXY, but it's really so open that it has formed an actual line here.

56
00:05:52,467 --> 00:06:00,400
Z,X, and Y are co-linear. And what we have over here, this is a 180 degree angle, or we should

57
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:07,554
say the measure of angle ZXY is 180 degrees. And you can actually go beyond that.

58
00:06:07,554 --> 00:06:15,267
So if you were to go all the way around the circle, so that you'd get back to 360 degrees, and then you'd

59
00:06:15,267 --> 00:06:20,807
keep going round and round and round and you'll start to see a lot more of that when you enter

60
00:06:20,807 --> 00:06:28,000
a trigonometry class. Now there's one last--or two last things that I want to introduce in this video--

61
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,252
is there are special words. And I'll talk about more types of angles in the next video, but if an

62
00:06:34,252 --> 00:06:40,823
angle is less than 90 degrees--so for example both of these angles that we started our

63
00:06:40,823 --> 00:06:50,533
discussion with are less than 90 degrees--we call them acute angles. So anything, this is acute,

64
00:06:50,533 --> 00:06:57,667
that is an acute angle, and that is an acute angle right over here. They are less than 90 degrees.

65
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:02,557
What does a non-acute angle look like? (And there's a word for it other than non-acute) well it

66
00:07:02,557 --> 00:07:07,867
would be more than 90 degrees, so for example--let me do this in a color I haven't used--

67
00:07:07,867 --> 00:07:13,400
an angle that looks like this--let me draw it a little bit better than that--an angle that looks like this,

68
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,555
and that's one side of the angle, or one of the rays,

69
00:07:18,555 --> 00:07:22,572
and then I'll put the other one along the base-line right over here. Clearly this is larger than 90 degrees.

70
00:07:22,572 --> 00:07:28,800
If I were to approximate--let's see that's 100, 110, 120, almost 130--so let's call that maybe a 128 degree angle.

71
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:39,871
We call this an obtuse angle. The way I remember it is acute: it's kind of a cute angle.

72
00:07:39,871 --> 00:07:47,069
It's nice and small. I believe acute, in either latin or greek or maybe both means something like pin or sharp,

73
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:53,000
so that's one way to think about it: an acute angle seems much sharper.

74
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,292
Obtuse, I kind of imagine something that's kind of lumbering and large, so that's how I remember it,

75
00:08:00,292 --> 00:08:03,829
or you can say it's not acute, it's not nice and small and pointy, so that's one way to think about it.

76
00:08:03,829 --> 00:08:08,390
But this is just general terminology for different types of angles:

77
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:12,936
less than 90 degrees you have an acute angle, at 90 degrees you have a right angle,

78
00:08:12,936 --> 00:08:22,200
larger than 90 degrees you have an obtuse angle, and if you get all the way to 180 degrees, your angle actually forms a line.
