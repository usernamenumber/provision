1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let's say we have two people in identical jobs

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Person A and Person B

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and this past year they both got paid in their identical jobs

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they got paid $350,000 in salary

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
now let's assume that Person A has no deductions

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so they just calculate their taxes

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and for the sake of simplicity I'm just going to make up a number

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm not going to go through. . .

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and especially because the tax code changes every year,

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let's just say their regular taxes are $150,000

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
150,000 in regular taxes, regular taxes

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
when you just file taxes, the straight. . . well not the straightforward but just the regular way

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
let's say Person B on the otherhand, even though they have the exact same job

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they donate a bunch to charity

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
they have all of these deductions, they have all of these things that they can write off on their income

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and so Person B's taxable income, let's say that it goes down

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
with all of these deductions, it goes down to $200,000

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and on that taxable income of $200,000

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Person B has to pay $70,000 in regular taxes

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and once again, I'm just making up simple numbers

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
just for the sake of simplicity

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I'm not actually figuring out exactly what Person B's taxes are

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
$70,000 in regular taxes

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Now, the US government or the IRS says
