1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,850
   

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:04,480
I just had dinner so I am well
fed, and I am ready to do more

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,100
SAT problems. So we're on
section seven, on page--

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,660
excuse me, maybe I should
drink some more water--

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,940
section seven of the
sixth test, on page

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,890
733, problem one.

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,110
In a certain game, points are
assigned to every word.

8
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,740
Each q, x and z in a word-- it
sounds like Scrabble-- is

9
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,420
worth 5 points.

10
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,840
And all other letters are
worth 1 point each.

11
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,320
So q, x and z are 5 points each,
and the other ones are 1

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:34,840
point each.

13
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,320
What is the sum of the points

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,970
assigned to the word exquisite?

15
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:43,070
Well this is just-- exquisite.

16
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:48,940
   

17
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,190
So let's see, which of
these does it have?

18
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,420
It has an x, right?

19
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,920
So that's worth 5 points.

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,030
Does it have any
other of these?

21
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,200
No-- well, it has a q, right?

22
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,190
That's worth 5 points.

23
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,830
It doesn't have a z, right?

24
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,440
And so how many one-pointers
are there?

25
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:14,390
There's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

26
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,930
So 7 one-pointers.

27
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,050
So that's 7 points, plus 5 plus
5 plus 10 is equal to 17.

28
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:21,700
So that's B.

29
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,680
So that's really just to make
sure that you don't make

30
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,030
careless mistakes,
that problem.

31
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,950
Next problem.

32
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,230
If you've ever played Scrabble,
that problem would

33
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,010
be a joke for you.

34
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,060
Problem two.

35
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:42,965
If 2x minus 10 is equal to 20,
then x minus 5 is what?

36
00:01:42,965 --> 00:01:45,890
   

37
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:49,510
So the big discovery here is--
you could solve for x, you

38
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,210
could say 2x is equal to 30, x
is equal to 15, and say 15

39
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,660
minus 5 equals 10.

40
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,920
Or you could say, well this is
the same thing as 2 times x

41
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,960
minus 10 is equal to 20, divide
both sides by 2, x

42
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,490
minus 10 is equal to 10.

43
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:10,550
Oh, sorry, maybe that's why you
shouldn't do it this way.

44
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:14,040
2 times x minus 5, x minus
5 is equal to 10.

45
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,700
So that's the other way you
could have done it, you just

46
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,690
factor out a 2, you get 2 times
x minus 5 is 20, divide

47
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:21,000
both sides by 2, you get
x minus 5 is 10.

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,910
The other way is obviously
to say 2x minus

49
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,680
10 is equal to 20.

50
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,760
Add 10 to both sides.

51
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,010
2x is equal to 30.

52
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,570
x is equal to 15.

53
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:33,930
So then x minus 5 is 15 minus
5, which is equal to 10.

54
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,510
I don't know which way might
be faster for you.

55
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,730
This way might-- you have to do
less thinking, and you just

56
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:38,837
kind of chug through
it, so you can just

57
00:02:38,837 --> 00:02:39,700
kind of speed along.

58
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,510
But this way's a few less steps,
but maybe you might

59
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,130
make a careless mistake
like what I just did.

60
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,120
But anyway, let's move on.

61
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,230
Hopefully, either way you
know how to do it.

62
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,520
Problem three.

63
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,120
I'll do it right here.

64
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,360
If t represents an odd
integer, which of the

65
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,270
following represents
an even integer?

66
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,960
So t is an odd integer.

67
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,360
And we can do this kind of
abstractly, but let's just

68
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,600
pick a number.

69
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,280
Let's just say that t is equal
to-- what's an odd integer?

70
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,120
Well, 3, 3 is an odd integer.

71
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,050
So let's just say t equals 3--
they didn't say, we could have

72
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,700
picked t equals 7, who knows.

73
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,250
So then just go through the
choices and say, well, which

74
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,840
one of those is going to
be an even integer?

75
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,820
Choice A is t plus 2.

76
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:26,800
Well 3 plus 2 is 5, that is
still odd, so that's not the

77
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,980
right answer.

78
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,960
B, 2t minus 1.

79
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,980
Well that's 6 minus 1,
that's 5, that's odd.

80
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:44,800
Choice C is 3t minus 2, that's
9 minus 2, which is still 7,

81
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,380
so that's still odd.

82
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:53,700
Choice D is 3t plus 2,
that's 9 plus 2,

83
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,090
which is equal to 11.

84
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,710
And I'm just saying t is 3.

85
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,690
That's still odd.

86
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,700
So it's probably
going to be E.

87
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:06,690
5t plus 1, and 15 plus 1
is 16, and that's even.

88
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,280
So that's our answer.

89
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,160
So sometimes I find it easy
if you just pick a number.

90
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,110
The other way is if you are
familiar with even and odd

91
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,339
numbers, you can just say, well,
the only way to go from

92
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:27,050
an odd to an even number, is you
either have to multiply by

93
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:35,140
an even soon. number, or
add an odd number.

94
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,960
Those are the only ways you can
go from an odd number to

95
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,260
an even number.

96
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,570
So looking at 5t plus 1, you
could say, well when I

97
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,990
multiply an odd number by an odd
number, I'm going to get

98
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,190
another odd number, right?

99
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,470
So this number is odd.

100
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,850
When I take an odd number
and I add 1 to it,

101
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,560
I get an even number.

102
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,830
So you could say 5t plus
1 is definitely going

103
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,800
to be an even number.

104
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,300
And it worked with the odd
number that we picked for t.

105
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,550
Next problem.

106
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:10,530
   

107
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,466
OK, so they drew
a picture here.

108
00:05:13,466 --> 00:05:20,270
So I will draw a picture
here as best as I can.

109
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,670
That's one triangle they drew,
this is the other one.

110
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,110
Looks something like this.

111
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,480
   

112
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,500
Like that.

113
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:36,160
And then this-- they say
this is A, B, C.

114
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,200
This is D, E, F.

115
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,100
These sides are 4, 8, and 9.

116
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:47,870
Now what are they saying?

117
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:52,850
For the triangles above, the
perimeter of ABC equals the

118
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:53,880
perimeter of DEF.

119
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,340
OK, it equals that.

120
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,810
If ABC is equilateral, what
is the length of AB?

121
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:01,040
OK, so it's equilateral,
right?

122
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,390
So let's just say that
AB is equal to x.

123
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:06,180
Well then, so is BC and AC,
because they told us, this is

124
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,350
an equilateral triangle.

125
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,330
All the sides are equal.

126
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,430
And what is the perimeter
of ABC then?

127
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,350
It's going to be x plus x plus
x, and that's just 3x.

128
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,270
And they say that that's the
same thing as the perimeter of

129
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,620
this triangle.

130
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,520
What's the perimeter
of this triangle?

131
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,110
It's 4 plus 8 plus 9.

132
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:28,750
So 3x is equal to--what's
12 plus 9-- is 21.

133
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:33,150
x is equal to 7, and that is
choice C, and we are done.

134
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,400
Next problem.

135
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,430
   

136
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:42,100
They have drawn a diagram
here that I will

137
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,790
now attempt to draw.

138
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,550
OK.

139
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:50,316
And then, let's see they draw
a dividing line, looks like

140
00:06:50,316 --> 00:06:52,690
it's about 1/4 of the circle.

141
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,880
And then they have another one
that's like a little less than

142
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,660
1/4, like that.

143
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,820
Then they have one that's
like that, roughly.

144
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:05,565
Then it goes like that.

145
00:07:05,565 --> 00:07:07,640
Then it goes like that.

146
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,240
And then they fill in
the values too.

147
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,480
So this is K, it's 15%.

148
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,420
J is 25%.

149
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,630
O-- let's just call
that other, is O.

150
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:25,570
Other is 20%.

151
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,410
N is 10%.

152
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:35,090
M is 15% and L is 15%.

153
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:38,380
And these are sales of jeans in
2001, and the letters are

154
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,370
the brands.

155
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,740
The circle graph above
represents all the jeans that

156
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,950
were sold by a retail
store in 2001

157
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,070
according to their brands.

158
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:49,480
If the store sold 900 pairs of
jeans-- so this is the total

159
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,050
of all of these, is 900
pairs of jeans.

160
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:58,620
If the store sold 900 pairs of
jeans other than brands J, K,

161
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,930
L, M and N, how may did
it sell together?

162
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,600
OK, so this isn't the total,
this is the other.

163
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,320
This is essentially this
category, right?

164
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,220
And other is equal to
20% of the total.

165
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,370
And that's what they
want to ask us, how

166
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,030
many did we sell together?

167
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:22,160
So 20% of the total times t for
total-- let me just say t

168
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,200
for total-- is equal to 900.

169
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,840
And you could also write
this as 1/5.

170
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,790
Or 0.2.

171
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:33,320
1/5 of the total is
equal to 900.

172
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,490
Multiply both sides by 5.

173
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,330
That cancels out.

174
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:41,839
So you get t is equal to
4,500 pairs of jeans.

175
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,830
And that is choice E.

176
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,310
Next problem.

177
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,220
Oh, I thought this problem might
apply to this pie graph,

178
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,985
but no, they're talking about
carpets, not jeans.

179
00:08:51,985 --> 00:08:53,950
So I'll do the next problem
in the next video.

180
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,730
I'll see you

181
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:55,833
