1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,610
There are other things, other
than carbons, that might

3
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,760
branch off of the main chain.

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,560
And in this video, I want
to introduce you

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,566
to the alkyl halides.

6
00:00:09,566 --> 00:00:15,190
   

7
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,650
And this is a situation where
one of the halogen elements,

8
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,530
and the halogen elements are
the second to last, or the

9
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:24,260
second to the right, or to the
right most column in the

10
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,050
periodic table.

11
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,920
Fluorine, chlorine,
bromine, iodine.

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,400
It's when one of these replace
one of the hydrogens attached

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,020
to a carbon.

14
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,600
So I've drawn some alkyl
halides here.

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,340
And let's think a little bit
of how to name them.

16
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,670
So like we name all of our
organic molecules so far, you

17
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:47,130
look for the longest chain
first. And the longest chain

18
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,490
that contains a double
bond if there is one.

19
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,840
In this case, there is no double
bond, so the longest

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,280
chain looks like this.

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,500
We start here and we
go over there.

22
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,780
Or we could go either way, but
this is the longest chain.

23
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,860
So it's one, two, three,
four, five, six,

24
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,790
seven, eight carbons.

25
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,430
Let me make sure of that.

26
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,190
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight carbons.

27
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,170
And we want to start at the end
where we're going to run

28
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:17,770
into either some type of halide
first or some other

29
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:18,920
type of branch off of it.

30
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,070
Just something attached
to the carbon change

31
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,000
other than a hydrogen.

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,490
So we're going to start
at this end.

33
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:35,500
So it's one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

34
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,800
So we're dealing
with an octane.

35
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,870
Our main chain has eight
carbons, so we're

36
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,880
dealing with an octane.

37
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,300
And now we have to think about
these different halogens that

38
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:45,970
we have here.

39
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:52,660
So first we have a chlorine
at carbon number two.

40
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:58,490
So that's going to be 2-chloro,
is what we're going

41
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,000
to call that.

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,810
And we're going to put them in
alphabetical order and then

43
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,410
put them in front
of the octane.

44
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:06,470
And then this right here is
a-- it's on the fourth

45
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,834
carbon-- so it is a 4-bromo.

46
00:02:07,834 --> 00:02:10,710
   

47
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:14,340
The actual element is
called bromine.

48
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:21,720
We change the ine to an
oro, so this is bromo.

49
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,180
The ine to an o, I should say.

50
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,590
So this is bromo.

51
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,140
And B comes before C, but we're
not done yet, because we

52
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,860
don't have just halides here.

53
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,060
We don't just have these
halogens over here.

54
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,320
We also have a methyl group.

55
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,380
We have one carbon sitting
over here.

56
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,080
So we don't want to
forget that guy.

57
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,460
So that right there,
that is a 5-methyl.

58
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,390
   

59
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,980
So when we write it all
out, we do it in

60
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,280
alphabetical order.

61
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,730
B takes precedence.

62
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:56,215
So this will be 4-bromo-- I'll
do it over here-- 4-bromo.

63
00:02:56,215 --> 00:02:59,050
   

64
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,960
Then the next thing
we have is C.

65
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,210
So 4-bromo-2-chloro
-5-methyloctane.

66
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:20,230
   

67
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,790
Now if we take look at this
structure over here, our main

68
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:29,710
carbon branch, we only have two
carbons in it right here.

69
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,160
So we're dealing with
eth or ethane.

70
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,440
It's a single bond.

71
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,390
So this tells us that we're
dealing with an ethane.

72
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,880
And let's see what we
have attached to it.

73
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,740
We have a bunch of these
halogens attached to it.

74
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,060
We replaced a bunch of our
hydrogens with halogens.

75
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,160
So we have these
fluorines here.

76
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:56,980
And so we can start at
the end that has more

77
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,150
things attached to it.

78
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:04,000
So in this case, we have one,
two, three fluorines attached.

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,630
So this is going to start off
with-- and then fluorines,

80
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,250
well I'll just leave it
like that for now.

81
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,800
I was going to write it, but
then I have to remember,

82
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,900
you're going to have
to alphabetize it.

83
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,300
So let me just write out.

84
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,560
So at some point in our name,
we're going to have attached--

85
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,749
we're going to start
here-- that's going

86
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:21,570
to be the one carbon.

87
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,880
That is the one carbon.

88
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,750
That is the two carbon.

89
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,890
So at one point in our chain--
let me switch colors

90
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:31,600
actually-- we're going to have
one, two, three flourines.

91
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,420
So it's going to
be a trifluoro.

92
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,170
   

93
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,730
And they're all at
the one carbon.

94
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,980
So it's going to be
a 1,1,1-trifluoro.

95
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,450
   

96
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,510
That'll take care of those
three fluorines there.

97
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,600
And then we're going to have,
at some point in our name,

98
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,730
this bromo is attached to the
two carbon, so 2-bromo.

99
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:58,810
And then you also
have this chloro

100
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,100
attached to the two carbon.

101
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,350
So you're also going
to have 2,2-chloro.

102
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,810
   

103
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,590
So then you go in alphabetical
order.

104
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,910
B takes precedence.

105
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,100
And then you're going to go to
C, and then the trifluoro.

106
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,030
You ignore the tri.

107
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,700
But F still comes
after B and C.

108
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:24,258
So this is going to be 2-bromo
2-chloro-- I want to do that

109
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:32,770
same shade of green--
2-chloro, same idea.

110
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,310
And then we have
1,1,1-trifluoroethane.

111
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:51,830
   

112
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,220
Now I want to make one thing
clear, when you do this.

113
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,510
Double bonds, we saw on the
last video-- we learned a

114
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:59,300
little bit about alkenes-- still
take precedence over

115
00:05:59,300 --> 00:05:59,880
everything.

116
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,060
So if we go to this original
compound-- this original

117
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,950
molecule up here-- if I were to
throw a double bond here.

118
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,820
So let's say I threw
a double bond.

119
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,230
Then all of a sudden that'll
change the naming mechanism.

120
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,350
First of all, we're not doing
with an octane anymore.

121
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,670
We're dealing with an octene.

122
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:20,430
So in this situation, the
chain-- we'll start at the end

123
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:26,980
closest to the double bond--
there's one, two, three, four,

124
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:32,170
five, six, seven, eight.

125
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,010
So now this becomes 7-chloro.

126
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,930
This will be 5-bromo.

127
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,940
This is 4-methyl.

128
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,520
And this compound over here,
it will no longer be this

129
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,250
thing over here, because I've
added this double bond.

130
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,410
It will now be going in
alphabetical order.

131
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,660
It would be 5-bromo.

132
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,170
   

133
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,420
Let me have some space here.

134
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,670
It will be
5-bromo-7-chloro-4-methyl.

135
00:06:54,670 --> 00:07:16,820
   

136
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,520
And then we have oct.

137
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,470
But it's an alkene,
so it's oct.

138
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,510
We have to specify where
we start our

139
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:30,080
double bond, oct-2-ene.

140
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,910
Now if we had two
double bonds.

141
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,480
Let's say we had a situation
where it was, maybe we had,

142
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,020
let's see we don't want to
put too many bonds here.

143
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,350
Carbon will only have
four bonds.

144
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,790
This carbon has three.

145
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,840
This hydrogen, we could have
double bond over here.

146
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,840
In that situation, we're going
to have-- and I actually

147
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,060
didn't specify it correctly in
the last video, so this is a

148
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,960
bit of a correction-- instead of
being 2-ene, this will now

149
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,250
be-- well let me make it instead
of being 2-ene when I

150
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:02,890
add that second carbon there, or
that second double bond, it

151
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:06,890
will now be-- scroll over to
the right a little bit-- it

152
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:11,540
will now be oct dash.

153
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,210
We have a double bond
at the two.

154
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,800
Starting at the two
and at the four.

155
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,760
2 comma 4.

156
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,280
And it's no longer
just an ene.

157
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,570
That was a mistake I did
in the last video.

158
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,870
I said hept, and I
just put an ene.

159
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,780
Now that I have two double
bonds, it's a diene.

160
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,540
   

161
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,240
So you don't want
to forget that.

162
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,690
That tells us that we have
two double bonds here.

163
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,860
Although it's kind of
obvious, because I'm

164
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,130
listing a 2 and a 4.

165
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,590
So it's a little
bit redundant.

166
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,690
2 and 4 diene.

167
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,289
So if you have it with these
two double bonds, we have

168
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,539
5-bromo-7-chloro
-4-methyl-oct-2,4-diene.

169
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:45,190
   

170
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,290
And the whole reason why I
introduced this is really to

171
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,280
make a bit of a correction.

172
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,430
Well to show you two things.

173
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,250
One, that the double bond takes
precedence when you are

174
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,170
deciding which direction
to number in.

175
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,150
And then also to correct a
little bit of a mistake in the

176
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:00,330
last video where I forgot to
put the di when I had two

177
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,580
double bonds.

178
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,133
