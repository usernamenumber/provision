1
00:00:01,556 --> 00:00:08,667
WHAT I WANT TO DO IN THIS VIDEO IS ENTER AN AGE OLD QUESTION, AT LEAST AN INTERESTING QUESTION TO ME. AND THE QUESTION IS

2
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:15,067
LETS SAY I HAVE A LEDGE HERE. A LEDGE, OR CLIFF, OR BUILDING OF SOME KIND

3
00:00:15,067 --> 00:00:20,643
AND LETS SAY IT HAS A HEIGHT h,

4
00:00:20,643 --> 00:00:29,267
RIGHT OVER HERE, AND WHAT I AM CURIOUS ABOUT IS THAT IF I WERE TO EITHER, THIS IS ME OVER HERE

5
00:00:29,267 --> 00:00:40,938
IF I WERE TO JUMP BY MY SELF, OR I THROW SOME THING, LIKE A ROCK, FROM THIS LEDGE, HOW FAST, EITHER MY

6
00:00:40,938 --> 00:00:48,295
SELF OR THAT ROCK BE GOING WHEN IT HITS RIGHT BEFORE THE GROUND.

7
00:00:48,295 --> 00:00:55,715
AND LIKE ALL OF THE OTHER VIDEOS WE ARE DOING ON PROJECTILE MOTION RIGHT NOW, WE GOING TO IGNORE AIR

8
00:00:55,715 --> 00:01:01,742
RESISTANCE, AND FOR SMALL h's AND SMALL VELOCITIES, ITS ACTUALLY REASONABLE, OR THE OBJECT IS AERODYNAMIC

9
00:01:01,742 --> 00:01:10,092
THEN AIR RESISTANCE WILL NOT MATTER LESS, ITS ME KIND OF BELLY FLOPPING FROM HIGH ALTITUDE THEN THE AIR

10
00:01:10,092 --> 00:01:12,038
RESISTANCE WILL START TO MATTER A LOT.

11
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:16,333
BUT FOR THE SAKE OF SIMPLICITY, WE ARE GOING TO ASSUME NO AIR,

12
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:20,333
OR WE ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE INTO THE AFFECTS OF AIR RESISTANCE

13
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:24,729
ASSUME WE ARE DOING THIS ON AN EARTH LIKE PLANET THAT HAS NO ATMOSPHERE.

14
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:26,598
HOW EVER YOU WANT TO DO IT.

15
00:01:26,598 --> 00:01:27,800
SO LETS JUST THINK ABOUT A PROBLEM

16
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,400
MY BE SOME OF YOU SAY THAT IS NOT REALISTIC

17
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,400
BUT IT WILL BE REALISTIC FOR SMALL "h"

18
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,600
IF YOU JUMP OFF A ONE STORY BUILDING,

19
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,933
THE AIR RESISTANCE WILL NOT BE A MAJOR COMPONENT

20
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:40,267
TO DETERMINING YOUR SPEED

21
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:43,000
IF IT WAS TO BE A MUCH LARGER BUILDING, THEN "h" MATTERS

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,800
I DON'T RECOMMEND YOU DO ANY OF THESE THINGS, THOSE ARE ALL VERY DANGEROUS THINGS, ITS BETTER TO DO THIS

23
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,267
WITH AN ROCK, AND THAT ACTUALLY THE EXAMPLE WE ARE GOING TO BE CONSIDERING

24
00:01:50,267 --> 00:01:52,600
SO LETS JUST THINK ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT

25
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,077
WE WANT TO FIGURE OUT THIS...

26
00:01:56,077 --> 00:02:05,411
AT THE TOP, RIGHT WHEN THE ROCK GETS DROPPED, YOU HAVE AN INITIAL VELOCITY OF "0"

27
00:02:05,411 --> 00:02:08,987
AND ONCE AGAIN WE ARE GOING TO USE A CONVENTION HERE THAT

28
00:02:08,987 --> 00:02:16,324
POSITIVE VECTOR MEANS UP, AND NEGATIVE VECTOR MEANS DOWN

29
00:02:16,324 --> 00:02:30,743
SO WE HAVE INITIAL VELOCITY OF "0", AND AT THE BOTTOM WE GOING TO HAVE SOME FINAL VELOCITY.

30
00:02:30,743 --> 00:02:35,200
THAT IS GOING TO BE A NEGATIVE NUMBER

31
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:43,733
OR A NEGATIVE VALUE

32
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:53,133
WE KNOW THAT THE ACCELERATION OF THE GRAVITY FOR AN OBJECT IN FREE FALL NEAR THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH

33
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:55,133
WE GOING TO ASSUME THAT ITS CONSTANT

34
00:02:55,133 --> 00:03:02,000
SO OUR CONSTANT ACCELERATION IS GOING TO BE NEGATIVE NINE POINT EIGHT (-9.8) METERS PER SECOND SQUARED

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,133
SO, THE GIVEN IS "h", THE INITIAL VELOCITY IS ZERO (0 m/s), AND OUR ACCELERATION DUE TO GRAVITY IS 9.8

36
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:13,400
WE WANT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT OUR FINAL VELOCITY IS GOING TO BE

37
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,467
RIGHT BEFORE WE HIT THE GROURD

38
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:21,200
WE GOING TO ASSUME THIS "h" IS GIVEN IN METERS AND THE ANSWER WILL BE IN METERS PER SECOND FOR THIS FINAL VELOCITY

39
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:27,375
SO WE KNOW SOME BASIC THINGS

40
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:33,133
YOU CAN ALWAYS DERIVE THESE MORE INTERESTING QUESTIONS FROM VERY BASIC THING THAT WE KNOW

41
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:44,944
SO WE KNOW THAT THE DISPLACEMENT IS EQUAL TO AVERAGE VELOCITY, TIMES, CHANGE IN TIME

42
00:03:44,944 --> 00:03:54,200
AND WE KNOW THAT AVERAGE VELOCITY, IF WE ASSUME ACCELERATION IS CONSTANT,

43
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:02,400
IS THE FINAL VELOCITY + INITIAL VELOCITY OVER TWO.

44
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:21,067
AND THAT OUR CHANGE IN TIME, IS OUR CHANGE IN VELOCITY DIVIDED BY OUR ACCELERATION.

45
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:24,867
JUST TO MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THIS, IT COMES STRAIGHT FROM THE IDEA THAT

46
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:36,646
CHANGE IN VELOCITY IS JUST ACCELERATION TIMES CHANGE IN TIME

47
00:04:36,646 --> 00:04:40,333
DIVIDE BOTH SIDES OF THIS EQUATION BY ACCELERATION

48
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,267
YOU GET THIS RIGHT OVER HERE

49
00:04:42,267 --> 00:04:44,667
SO THAT IS WHAT OUR DISPLACEMENT IS

50
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:47,733
REMEMBER I WANTED AN EXPRESSION FOR DISPLACEMENT IN TERMS OF THINGS WE KNOW

51
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:50,867
AND THINGS WE WANT TO FIND OUT

52
00:04:50,867 --> 00:04:59,600
WELL, FOR THIS EXAMPLE, RIGHT OVER HERE, WE KNOW COUPLE OF THINGS

53
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,000
WE KNOW OUR INITIAL VELOCITY IS ZERO

54
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,631
SO THIS FIRST EXPRESSION, FOR THE EXAMPLE WE ARE DOING, THE AVERAGE VELOCITY IS GOING TO BE OUR FINAL

55
00:05:10,631 --> 00:05:11,933
VELOCITY DIVIDED BY TWO.

56
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:14,200
SINCE OUR INITIAL VELOCITY IS ZERO.

57
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:25,600
CHANGE IN VELOCITY IS THE SAME THING AS FINAL VELOCITY MINUS INITIAL VELOCITY

58
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:32,267
NOW ONCE AGAIN, WE KNOW THAT INITIAL VELOCITY IS ZERO, SO OUR CHANG IN VELOCITY IS SAME AS FINAL VELOCITY

59
00:05:32,267 --> 00:05:34,267
SO ONCE AGAIN THIS WILL BE TIMES,

60
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:37,667
INSTEAD OF WRITING CHANGE IN VELOCITY, WE CAN JUST WRITE FINAL VELOCITY

61
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:39,733
BECAUSE WE ARE STARTING AT ZERO

62
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:46,067
INITIAL VELOCITY IS ZERO, TIMES OUR FINAL VELOCITY DIVIDED BY OUR ACCELERATION

63
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:49,000
(ONCE AGAIN) FINAL VELOCITY IS CHANGE IN VELOCITY

64
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,067
BECAUSE INITIAL VELOCITY WAS ZERO

65
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:56,667
AND ALL OF THIS IS GOING TO BE OUR DISPLACEMENT

66
00:05:56,667 --> 00:06:01,600
AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE EVERY THING WRITTEN (WHICH) WE KNOW.

67
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,000
SO, IF WE MULTIPLY BOTH SIDES OF THIS EXPRESSION

68
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,933
BY TWO TIMES OUR ACCELERATION

69
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:33,702
ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE, WE GET TWO TIMES OUR ACCELERATION TIMES OUR DISPLACEMENT

70
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:38,267
IS GOING TO BE EQUAL TO ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE

71
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:40,933
TWO CANCELS OUT WITH TWO, ACCELERATION CANCELS OUT WITH ACCELERATION

72
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:50,200
IT WILL BE EQUAL TO FINAL VELOCITY SQUARED

73
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,200
FINAL VELOCITY SQUARED, FINAL VELOCITY TIME FINAL VELOCITY

74
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,067
AND SO, WE CAN JUST SOLVE FOR FINAL VELOCITY HERE.

75
00:06:57,067 --> 00:06:59,467
SO WE KNOW WHAT OUR ACCELERATION IS,

76
00:06:59,467 --> 00:07:03,067
IT'S -9.8 METERS PER SECOND SQUARED

77
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:13,123
SO THIS IS NEGATIVE 9.8 METERS PER SECOND SQUARED

78
00:07:13,123 --> 00:07:19,271
SO IT'S -19.6 METERS PER SECOND SQUARED

79
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:24,000
NOW WHAT OUR DISPLACEMENT IS GOING TO BE

80
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,267
DISPLACEMENT OVER THE COURSE OF DROPPING THIS ROCK OFF OF THIS LEDGE OR ROOF

81
00:07:28,267 --> 00:07:30,733
SO YOU MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO SAY THAT OUR DISPLACEMENT IS "h"

82
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:35,267
BUT REMEMBER THESE ARE VECTOR QUANTITIES, SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET DIRECTIONS RIGHT

83
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:39,667
FROM WHERE THE ROCK STARTED TO WHERE IT ENDS, WHAT'S IT DOING?

84
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:48,364
IT'S GOING TO GO A DISTANCE OF "h" DOWNWARDS, AND OUR CONVENTION IS, DOWN IS NEGATIVE

85
00:07:48,364 --> 00:07:56,267
SO, IN THIS EXAMPLE, OUR DISPLACEMENT, FROM WHERE ROCK LEAVES YOUR HAND TO WHERE IT HITS THE GROUND

86
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:59,467
THE DISPLACEMENT IS GOING TO BE NEGATIVE "h"

87
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:01,267
IT'G GOING TO TRAVEL A DISTANCE OF "h"

88
00:08:01,267 --> 00:08:03,800
BUT ITS GOING TO TRAVEL THAT DISTANCE DOWNWARDS

89
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,533
SO THAT'S WHY THIS VECTOR CONVENTION IS VERY IMPORTANT

90
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:15,333
SO OUR DISPLACEMENT OVER HERE IS GOING TO BE "-h" METERS

91
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:25,267
SO, WHEN YOU MULTIPLY THESE TWO THINGS OUT, LUCKY FOR US, THESE NEGATIVE CANCELS OUT

92
00:08:25,267 --> 00:08:36,667
AND YOU GET 19.6 h METER SQUARED PER SECOND SQUARED

93
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:45,267
IS EQUAL TO OUR FINAL VELOCITY SQUARED

94
00:08:45,267 --> 00:08:48,600
AND NOTICE, WHEN YOU SQUARE SOME THING, YOU LOOSE THE SIGN INFORMATION

95
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,667
IF OUR FINAL VELOCITY IS POSITIVE, YOU SQUARED, YOU STILL GET A POSITIVE VALUE

96
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:54,267
AND IF IT WAS NEGATIVE, YOU STILL GET A POSITIVE VALUE

97
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,867
BUT REMEMBER IN THIS EXAMPLE WE ARE MOVING DOWNWARDS

98
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:58,800
SO WE WANT THE NEGATIVE VERSION OF THIS

99
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:06,333
SO, TO REALLY FIGURE OUT OUR FINAL VELOCITY, WE TAKE THE NEGATIVE SQUARE ROOT OF BOTH SIDES OF THIS EQUATION

100
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:15,267
SO, IF WE WERE TO TAKE SQUARE ROOT OF BOTH SIDES OF THIS

101
00:09:15,267 --> 00:09:20,000
YOU WILL GET, AND I FLIP THEM AROUND, FINAL VELOCITY IS EQUAL TO

102
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:30,200
SQUARE ROOT OF 19.6 h, AND YOU CAN EVEN TAKE THE SQUARE ROOT OF METERS SQUARED PER SECOND SQUARED

103
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:36,667
TREAT THEM LIKE VARIABLE, EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE THE UNITS, AND OUTSIDE OF THE RADICAL SIGH YOU WILL GET METERS PER SECOND

104
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:42,000
AND BE CAREFUL HERE, IF WE JUST TAKE THE PRINCIPLE ROOT, THE PRINCIPLE ROOT HERE IS THE POSITIVE SQUARE ROOT

105
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,933
BUT WE KNOW THAT OUR VELOCITY IS GOING TO BE DOWNWARDS HERE

106
00:09:44,933 --> 00:09:46,333
BECAUSE THAT IS OUR CONVENTION

107
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:51,467
SO, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET NEGATIVE SQUARE ROOT.

108
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:52,867
SO, LETS TRY IT OUT WITH SOME NUMBERS

109
00:09:52,867 --> 00:09:56,600
WE HAVE ESSENTIALLY SOLVED WHAT WE SET OUT TO SOLVE IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS VIDEO

110
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,667
HOW FAST WOULD WE BE FALLING, AS A FUNCTION OF THE HEIGHT

111
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:09,200
LETS TRY IT OUT WITH SOME THING, LETS SAY THAT THE HEIGHT IS 5 METERS

112
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:16,133
WHICH PROBABLY WOULD BE A ONE STORY BUILDING

113
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:23,267
IT WOULD BE ABOUT 15 FEET

114
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:25,867
ABOUT THE ROOF OF A COMMERCIAL BUILDING

115
00:10:25,867 --> 00:10:32,133
SO WHAT DO WE GET? IF WE PUT FIVE METERS IN HERE, WE GET

116
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:44,467
19.6 TIME 5, GIVES US 98, SO ALMOST A HUNDRED AND THEN WE WANT TO TAKE SQUARE ROOT OF THAT

117
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:51,933
SO THE SQUARE ROOT OF 98, IT GIVES US ROUGHLY 9.9

118
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:53,800
WE WANT THE NEGATIVE SQUARE ROOT OF THAT

119
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:59,667
SO IN THAT SITUATION, WHEN THE HEIGHT IS 5 METERS, IF YOU JUMP OFF A ONE STORY COMMERCIAL BUILDING

120
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:12,133
RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM, IT WILL HAVE A VELOCITY OF -9.9 METERS PER SECOND.

121
00:11:12,133 --> 00:11:16,533
SO, NEGATIVE 9.9 METERS PER SECOND

122
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:21,267
I WILL LEAVE IT UP TO YOU AS AN EXERCISE TO HOW FAST THIS IS IN KILOMETERS PER HOUR

123
00:11:21,267 --> 00:11:22,933
OR MILES PER HOUR

124
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,667
IT'S PRETTY FAST, IT'S NOT SOME THING YOU WANT TO DO

125
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:31,000
BUT YOU CAN NEARLY FIGURE THIS OUT, YOU CAN USE THIS REALLY ANY HEIGHT

126
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,667
REASONABLY CLOSE TO THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH AND YOU IGNORE THE AFFECTS OF THE AIR RESISTANCE

127
00:11:36,667 --> 99:59:59,999
AT REALLY HIGH HEIGHT, AND WHEN THE OBJECT IS NOT VERY AERODYNAMIC, THEN AIR RESISTANCE WILL MATTER A LOT.
