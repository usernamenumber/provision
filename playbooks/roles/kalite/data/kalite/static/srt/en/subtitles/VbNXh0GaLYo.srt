1
00:00:00,348 --> 00:00:03,808
What I'm going to attempt to do in the next two videos is really just give an overview

2
00:00:03,808 --> 00:00:08,333
of everything that's happened to Earth since it came into existence.

3
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:13,468
We're going start really at the formation of Earth or the formation of our Solar system or the formation of

4
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:17,000
the Sun, and our best sense of what actually happened is that

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,733
there was a supernova in our vicinity of the galaxy,

6
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:23,475
and this right here is a picture of a supernova remnant,

7
00:00:23,475 --> 00:00:25,960
actually, the remnant for Kepler's supernova.

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,557
The supernova in this picture actually happened four hundred years ago in 1604,

9
00:00:30,557 --> 00:00:34,133
so right at the center a star essentially exploded

10
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:37,867
and for a few weeks was the brightest object in the night sky,

11
00:00:37,867 --> 00:00:41,133
and it was observed by Kepler and other people in 1604,

12
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:42,733
and this is what it looks like now.

13
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:46,045
What we see is kinda the shockwave that's been traveling

14
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:49,876
out for the past 400 years, so now it must be many

15
00:00:49,876 --> 00:00:52,547
light years across. It wasn't, obviously, matter wasn't

16
00:00:52,547 --> 00:00:55,133
traveling at the speed of light, but it must've been traveling

17
00:00:55,133 --> 00:01:00,209
pretty, pretty fast, at least relativistic speeds, a reasonable

18
00:01:00,209 --> 00:01:02,206
fraction of the speed of light.

19
00:01:02,206 --> 00:01:04,133
This has traveled a good bit out now, but what you can

20
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:07,600
imagine is when you have the shockwave traveling out from

21
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,667
a supernova, let's say you had a cloud of molecules,

22
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:16,600
a cloud of gas, that before the shockwave came by just

23
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,933
wasn't dense enough for gravity to take over,

24
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:24,400
and for it to accrete, essentially, into a solar system.

25
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,467
When the shockwave passes by it compresses all of this gas

26
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:32,933
and all of this material and all of these molecules, so

27
00:01:32,933 --> 00:01:36,667
it now does have that critical density to form, to accrete

28
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:39,533
into a star and a solar system.

29
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:41,634
We think that's what's happened, and the reason why we

30
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:46,467
feel pretty strongly that it must've been caused by a supernova

31
00:01:46,467 --> 00:01:49,714
is that the only way that the really heavy elements can form,

32
00:01:49,714 --> 00:01:52,600
or the only way we know that they can form is in kind of

33
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:58,867
the heat of a supernova, and our uranium, the uranium that seems

34
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:02,067
to be in our solar system on Earth, seems to have formed

35
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:05,467
roughly at the time of the formation of Earth, at about

36
00:02:05,467 --> 00:02:07,547
four and a half billion years ago, and we'll talk

37
00:02:07,547 --> 00:02:10,400
in a little bit more depth in future videos on exactly how

38
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,600
people figure that out, but since the uranium seems about

39
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,626
the same age as our solar system, it must've been formed

40
00:02:16,626 --> 00:02:21,133
at around the same time, and it must've been formed by a supernova,

41
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:23,801
and it must be coming from a supernova, so a supernova

42
00:02:23,801 --> 00:02:27,267
shockwave must've passed through our part of the universe,

43
00:02:27,267 --> 00:02:31,333
and that's a good reason for gas to get compressed and begin to accrete.

44
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:34,600
So you fast-forward a few million years.

45
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,867
That gas would've accreted into something like this.

46
00:02:36,867 --> 00:02:39,933
It would've reached the critical temperature, critical density

47
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:43,867
and pressure at the center for ignition to occur, for fusion

48
00:02:43,867 --> 00:02:46,882
to start to happen, for hydrogen to start fusing into helium,

49
00:02:46,882 --> 00:02:52,267
and this right here is our early sun.

50
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:56,400
Around the sun you have all of the gases and particles

51
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,467
and molecules that had enough angular velocity to not fall into the sun,

52
00:03:00,467 --> 00:03:02,333
to go into orbit around the sun.

53
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,533
They were actually supported by a little bit of pressure, too,

54
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:07,667
because you can kinda view this as kind of a big cloud of gas,

55
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:10,467
so they're always bumping into each other, but for the most part

56
00:03:10,467 --> 00:03:14,400
it was their angular velocity, and over the next tens of millions of years

57
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,200
they'll slowly bump into each other and clump into each other.

58
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,733
Even small particles have gravity, and they're gonna slowly

59
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:26,533
become rocks and asteroids and, eventually, what we would call

60
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:30,267
"planetesimals," which are, kinda view them as seeds

61
00:03:30,267 --> 00:03:35,203
of planets or early planets, and then those would have a reasonable amount

62
00:03:35,203 --> 00:03:37,836
of gravity and other things would be attracted to them

63
00:03:37,836 --> 00:03:39,736
and slowly clump up to them.

64
00:03:39,736 --> 00:03:42,772
This wasn't like a simple process, you know, you could imagine

65
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:46,600
you might have one planetesimal form, and then there's another

66
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,800
planetesimal formed, and instead of having a nice, gentle

67
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,733
those two guys accreting into each other, they might have

68
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:56,733
huge relative velocities and ram into each other, and then just,

69
00:03:56,733 --> 00:04:01,733
you know, shatter, so this wasn't just a nice, gentle process of constant accretion.

70
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:04,533
It would actually have been a very violent process,

71
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:08,467
actually happened early in Earth's history, and we actually think

72
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:10,733
this is why the Moon formed, so at some point

73
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:15,067
you fast-forward a little bit from this, Earth would have formed,

74
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:20,400
I should say, the mass that eventually becomes our modern Earth

75
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,133
would have been forming. Let me draw it over here.

76
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:28,800
So, let's say that that is our modern Earth, and what we think

77
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,762
happened is that another proto-planet or another,

78
00:04:31,762 --> 00:04:34,677
it was actually a planet because it was roughly the size of Mars,

79
00:04:34,677 --> 00:04:39,800
ran into our, what it is eventually going to become our Earth.

80
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
This is actually a picture of it.

81
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,867
This is an artist's depiction of that collision, where this planet

82
00:04:46,867 --> 00:04:50,800
right here is the size of Mars, and it ran into what would eventually become Earth.

83
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,600
This we call Theia. This is Theia,

84
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,933
and what we believe happened, and if you look up,

85
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:01,600
if you go onto the Internet, you'll see some simulations

86
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,267
that talk about this, is that we think it was a glancing blow.

87
00:05:04,267 --> 00:05:06,933
It wasn't a direct hit that would've just kinda shattered

88
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:10,600
each of them and turned into one big molten ball.

89
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,467
We think it was a glancing blow, something like this.

90
00:05:13,467 --> 00:05:16,933
This was essentially Earth. Obviously, Earth got changed

91
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:20,933
dramatically once Theia ran into it, but Theia is

92
00:05:20,933 --> 00:05:23,133
right over here, and we think it was a glancing blow.

93
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:27,733
It came and it hit Earth at kind of an angle, and then it

94
00:05:27,733 --> 00:05:31,267
obviously the combined energies from that interaction

95
00:05:31,267 --> 00:05:35,067
would've made both of them molten, and frankly

96
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:36,887
they probably already were molten because you had

97
00:05:36,887 --> 00:05:40,267
a bunch of smaller collisions and accretion events and

98
00:05:40,267 --> 00:05:43,200
little things hitting the surface, so probably both of them

99
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,800
during this entire period, but this would've had a

100
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,898
glancing blow on Earth and essentially splashed a bunch

101
00:05:50,898 --> 00:05:53,667
of molten material out into orbit.

102
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:57,067
It would've just come in, had a glancing blow on Earth,

103
00:05:57,067 --> 00:05:59,733
and then splashed a bunch of molten material,

104
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:02,800
some of it would've been captured by Earth, so this is

105
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,133
the before and the after, you can imagine, Earth is

106
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:12,800
kind of this molten, super hot ball, and some of it

107
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,800
just gets splashed into orbit from the collision.

108
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,400
Let me just see if I can draw Theia here, so

109
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:26,400
Theia has collided, and it is also molten now because

110
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,800
huge energies, and it splashes some of it into orbit.

111
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,733
If we fast-forward a little bit, this stuff that got splashed

112
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:37,800
into orbit, it's going in that direction, that becomes

113
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,600
our Moon, and then the rest of this material eventually

114
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,000
kind of condenses back into a spherical shape and is what

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,933
we now call our Earth.

116
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:53,133
So that's how we actually think right now that the Moon

117
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:54,733
actually formed.

118
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:58,000
Even after this happened, the Earth still had a lot more,

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,467
I guess, violence to experience.

120
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:04,533
Just to get a sense of where we are in the history of Earth,

121
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:09,000
we're going to refer to this time clock a lot over the next few videos,

122
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,867
this time clock starts right here at the formation of our solar system,

123
00:07:12,867 --> 00:07:16,600
4.6 billion years ago, probably coinciding with

124
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,200
some type of supernova,

125
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,800
and as we go clockwise on this diagram,

126
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,067
we're moving forward in time, and we're gonna go

127
00:07:24,067 --> 00:07:26,800
all the way forward to the present period,

128
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,267
and just so you understand some of the terminology,

129
00:07:29,267 --> 00:07:32,267
"Ga" means "billions of years ago"

130
00:07:32,267 --> 00:07:33,133
'G' for "Giga-"

131
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:35,733
"Ma" means "millions of years ago"

132
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:37,467
'M' for "Mega-"

133
00:07:37,467 --> 00:07:40,733
So where we are right now, the Moon has formed,

134
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:42,533
and we're in what we call the Hadean period

135
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:44,000
or actually I shouldn't say "period."

136
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,733
It's the Hadean eon of Earth.

137
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:48,200
"Period" is actually another time period,

138
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,533
so let me make this very clear. It's the Hadean,

139
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:57,133
we are in the Hadean eon, and an eon is kind of

140
00:07:57,133 --> 00:07:59,800
the largest period of time that we talk about, especially

141
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,800
relative to Earth, and it's roughly 500 million to a billion years

142
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,133
is an eon, and what makes the Hadean eon distinctive,

143
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:12,200
well, from a geological point of view what makes it

144
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,467
distinctive is really we don't have any rocks from the

145
00:08:14,467 --> 00:08:17,733
Hadean period. We don't have any kind of macroscopic-scale

146
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:19,800
rocks from the Hadean period, and that's because

147
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,000
at that time, we believe, the Earth was just this molten

148
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,267
ball of kind of magma and lava, and it was molten

149
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:31,733
because it was a product of all of these accretion events

150
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:35,600
and all of these collisions and all this kinetic energy turning into heat.

151
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,133
If you were to look at the surface of the Earth,

152
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:40,133
if you were to be on the surface of the Earth during

153
00:08:40,133 --> 00:08:43,800
the Hadean eon, which you probably wouldn't want to be

154
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,333
because you might get hit by a falling meteorite

155
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:48,133
or probably burned by some magma, whatever,

156
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:50,333
it would look like this, and you wouldn't be able to breathe anyway;

157
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:53,067
this is what the surface of the Earth would look like.

158
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:55,933
It would look like a big magma pool, and that's why we

159
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:57,800
don't have any rocks from there because the rocks were

160
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:03,733
just constantly being recycled, being dissolved and churned

161
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:07,467
inside of this giant molten ball, and frankly

162
00:09:07,467 --> 00:09:10,533
the Earth still is a giant molten ball, it's just

163
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:14,600
we live on the super-thin, cooled crust of that molten ball.

164
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,202
If you go right below that crust, and we'll talk a little bit more

165
00:09:17,202 --> 00:09:18,025
about that in future videos,

166
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:21,533
you will get magma, and if you go dig deeper,

167
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:23,067
you'll have liquid iron.

168
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:26,133
I mean, it still is a molten ball.

169
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:27,800
And this whole period is just a violent,

170
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,400
not only was Earth itself a volcanic, molten ball,

171
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,933
it began to harden as you get into the late Hadean eon,

172
00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:39,959
but we also had stuff falling from the sky and constantly

173
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,723
colliding with Earth, and really just continuing to add

174
00:09:42,723 --> 00:09:45,800
to the heat of this molten ball.

175
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,600
Anyway, I'll leave you there,

176
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,733
and, as you can imagine,

177
00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:50,200
at this point there was no, as far as we can tell,

178
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,733
there was no life on Earth.

179
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:54,533
Some people believe that maybe some life could've formed

180
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:57,667
in the late Hadean eon, but for the most part

181
00:09:57,667 --> 00:10:01,267
this was just completely inhospitable for any life forming.

182
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,000
I'll leave you there, and where we take up the next video,

183
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,369
we'll talk a little bit about the Archean eon.
