Alright, this is a universal remote control; we are going to take it apart today, to see whats inside it and what makes it tick.

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There are 2 different kinds of universal remote controls.

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
There are learning remotes and then there are ones that function on code libraries.

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So this one functions on a code library, the learning remotes tend to be more expensive.

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
What the learning remotes do,

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
you can put it next to the original remote and basically,

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
use the original remote to train the learning remote and then it will

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it will function like the original. Those like I said before tend to be more expensive.

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
As they are more complex. This one just has a code library built in so you

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
enter a certain sequence of numbers and you can pull up a certain code and then that

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
will allow this to trigger what ever devise that code goes with.

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So I have already cut the box apart here

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so lets go ahead and pull the remote out
