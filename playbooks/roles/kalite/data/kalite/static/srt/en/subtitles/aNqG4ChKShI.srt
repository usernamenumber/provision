00:00:00,825 --> 00:00:05,623
Welcome to the video on 'basic subtraction.'

2
00:00:05,623 --> 00:00:10,330
Let's do a little bit a review of 'basic addition' first.

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:19,155
If I said '4 plus 3' (4 + 3), what would this mean?

4
00:00:19,155 --> 00:00:20,690
What did that equal?

5
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,016
Well, there are a couple of ways

6
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:22,928
we could have viewed this.

7
00:00:22,928 --> 00:00:24,301
We could have said, "I had 4 of something."

8
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:27,576
Let's say I had 4 circles – or, I don't know –

9
00:00:27,576 --> 00:00:29,960
I had 4 lemons for breakfast.

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:36,170
So 1, 2, 3, 4 lemons for breakfast.

11
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,857
And let's say I had another 3 lemons for lunch.

12
00:00:40,857 --> 00:00:43,584
1, 2, 3.

13
00:00:43,584 --> 00:00:45,582
And so you could view 4 + 3 as,

14
00:00:45,582 --> 00:00:47,796
"How many total lemons did I have?"

15
00:00:47,796 --> 00:00:49,640
I'm adding 3 to 4.

16
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,843
So how many total did I have?

17
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:55,196
Well, it's (COUNTING: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) 7.

18
00:00:55,196 --> 00:00:59,180
So I had a total of 7 lemons.

19
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,030
Another way we could have viewed that

20
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,060
is we could have drawn our 'number line.'

21
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,230
(And I'll draw it in yellow because we're –

22
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,494
Well that's not wide enough.

23
00:01:09,494 --> 00:01:10,553
I'll draw it in yellow,

24
00:01:10,553 --> 00:01:13,597
because we're talking about lemons.)

25
00:01:13,597 --> 00:01:18,150
So let's say that's our number line.

26
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,678
And if I start at the number –

27
00:01:19,678 --> 00:01:21,702
(Let me draw all of the numbers.)

28
00:01:21,702 --> 00:01:32,010
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

29
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,275
So you could think about this as saying,

30
00:01:34,275 --> 00:01:35,354
"Well, we're on the number line.

31
00:01:35,354 --> 00:01:37,872
We start at the number 4. Right?

32
00:01:37,872 --> 00:01:39,120
(That's this number 4.)

33
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,700
And we're adding 3 to it.

34
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,170
So we'll increase along the number line by 3.

35
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:48,650
So we'll go 1, 2, 3 – and you end up at 7.

36
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,012
So you could say,

37
00:01:50,012 --> 00:01:51,996
"If I have 4, and I get 3 more, I get 7.

38
00:01:51,996 --> 00:01:57,027
Or, "If I increase 4 by 3, I also get 7."

39
00:01:57,027 --> 00:01:59,340
So what's 'subtraction' now?

40
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,450
(Because that's what this video is about.)

41
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,488
I shouldn't waste all of our time

42
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:02,987
talking about addition.

43
00:02:02,987 --> 00:02:05,766
So let's take the example of 4 minus 3 (4 - 3).

44
00:02:05,766 --> 00:02:08,392
What is that equal to?

45
00:02:08,392 --> 00:02:11,530
Let me switch colors, just to keep things interesting.

46
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:18,860
So what is 4 - 3 equal to?

47
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,803
Subtraction – or 'minus' – is the opposite of addition.

48
00:02:22,803 --> 00:02:26,266
So in addition, you're doing something more.

49
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:26,968
You're adding.

50
00:02:26,968 --> 00:02:28,322
(I don't want use the word 'adding'

51
00:02:28,322 --> 00:02:29,676
to define 'addition' –

52
00:02:29,676 --> 00:02:31,030
but that's what you're doing.)

53
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,018
I had 4 lemons, and then I had 3 more.

54
00:02:34,018 --> 00:02:36,556
In 'subtraction,' you're taking away.

55
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:42,248
So in this example, if I started with 4 lemons –

56
00:02:42,248 --> 00:02:44,963
Let's say I had 4 lemons on a plate.

57
00:02:44,963 --> 00:02:46,936
If I'm subtracting 3 –

58
00:02:46,936 --> 00:02:49,131
If I'm saying minus 3,

59
00:02:49,131 --> 00:02:51,663
Instead of adding these 3 here, and getting 7,

60
00:02:51,663 --> 00:02:53,710
I'm going to take 3 away.

61
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,762
So maybe I'm eating them.

62
00:02:54,762 --> 00:02:56,564
Or maybe I'm giving them to you –

63
00:02:56,564 --> 00:02:59,630
in exchange for you watching these videos.

64
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,172
So to take away 3 from this 4 –

65
00:03:02,172 --> 00:03:04,190
Let's say this one goes away.

66
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,607
This one goes away.

67
00:03:05,607 --> 00:03:07,215
And this one goes away.

68
00:03:07,215 --> 00:03:09,900
How many lemons would we have left?

69
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,810
Well, this is the only one that I haven't crossed out.

70
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:16,594
So we would have 1 lemon left.

71
00:03:16,594 --> 00:03:18,120
And this would be the lemon that's left.

72
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,245
It didn't have to be that one.

73
00:03:19,245 --> 00:03:21,102
I could have crossed out any of the 3.

74
00:03:21,102 --> 00:03:21,934
Another way to view that –

75
00:03:21,934 --> 00:03:28,500
(Let's draw the same lemon colored number line.)

76
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:34,394
Let's say that this is the number line, right here.

77
00:03:34,394 --> 00:03:36,349
And I'll draw all the same numbers.

78
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:46,947
So that's 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

79
00:03:46,947 --> 00:03:49,483
Of course, the number line keeps going.

80
00:03:49,483 --> 00:03:52,093
There's no largest number that you can imagine,

81
00:03:52,093 --> 00:03:54,849
any number that you can think of,

82
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:56,503
I can think of one higher than that.

83
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:57,660
So there is no largest number.

84
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,906
So that's why we draw that arrow there.

85
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,720
I could never draw the entire number line.

86
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,020
But anyway – back to subtraction.

87
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,710
So we're starting at 4 lemons, right?

88
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:09,473
When we added 3 – plus 3 –

89
00:04:09,473 --> 00:04:12,701
We went to the right 4 spaces on the number line.

90
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:14,935
And that's because the right is increasing value.

91
00:04:14,935 --> 00:04:16,075
So we went from 4 to 5.

92
00:04:16,075 --> 00:04:17,440
That was 1 more.

93
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,374
5 to 6 was 2 more.

94
00:04:19,374 --> 00:04:21,060
And 7 was 3 more.

95
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,653
Now we're taking away from 4.

96
00:04:23,653 --> 00:04:24,860
So what do we do?

97
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,663
What would you think we do?

98
00:04:26,663 --> 00:04:27,633
Well, since we're taking away,

99
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:29,157
we're going to decrease

100
00:04:29,157 --> 00:04:31,513
the total number of lemons we have. Right?

101
00:04:31,513 --> 00:04:33,680
So if we take away 1 – we get to 3.

102
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,550
Take away 2 – get to 2.

103
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,910
Take away 3. We took away 3, right?

104
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:39,887
So we'll go back [to the left]

105
00:04:39,887 --> 00:04:42,058
1, 2, 3 along the number line.

106
00:04:42,058 --> 00:04:44,169
And we'll end up at 1.

107
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:47,330
And that's this 1 right here.

108
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,529
So, just to review,

109
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:52,355
addition is when you're getting more of something.

110
00:04:52,355 --> 00:04:55,120
Subtraction is when you are taking something away.

111
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,224
If you think about it on the number line, addition is

112
00:04:58,224 --> 00:05:00,600
increasing along the number line by that amount.

113
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,193
So, in this case,

114
00:05:01,193 --> 00:05:04,246
we increased along the number line by 3.

115
00:05:04,246 --> 00:05:06,330
And so we went from 4 to 7.

116
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,862
In the subtraction case,

117
00:05:07,862 --> 00:05:11,350
we decrease back [to the left] on the number line.

118
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,838
So we decrease by the amount

119
00:05:12,838 --> 00:05:13,666
that you're subtracting.

120
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:17,218
So, in this case, we decreased by 3.

121
00:05:17,218 --> 00:05:19,349
So we went back [to the left] 1, 2, 3.

122
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:21,113
and we had 1.

123
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:21,816
And the other way to view it –

124
00:05:21,816 --> 00:05:22,716
if I have 4 of something –

125
00:05:22,716 --> 00:05:23,876
if I give 3 away –

126
00:05:23,876 --> 00:05:25,480
or if I ate 3 of them –

127
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,445
Or if I –

128
00:05:26,445 --> 00:05:27,611
I don't know what I did to 3 of them.

129
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:31,050
If I lost 3 of them I
would have 1 left.

130
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,250
Now let me show you some
interesting things

131
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,830
about subtraction.

132
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:38,500
So we know that 4 minus
3 is equal to 1.

133
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,890
Let me show you something
else that's interesting.

134
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:46,050
What is 4 minus 1?

135
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,500
Well, we could use
either example.

136
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,430
Let's do the lemon example.

137
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,120
Let's do apples now; I'm
bored of the lemons.

138
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:01,160
Let's say I had 1, 2, 3, 4.

139
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,620
I have a new pen, sometimes
it doesn't draw right.

140
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,380
Let's say I had 4 apples.

141
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,130
This is the example
we're dealing with.

142
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,440
And I were to eat one of them.

143
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,820
So one of them were to go away.

144
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,630
How many apples
would I have left?

145
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,560
Well, 3-- 1, 2, 3.

146
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,600
So 4 minus 1 is equal to 3.

147
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,630
And if we did it on the number
line, if we started at 4 and we

148
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,770
subtracted 1-- we took 1 away.

149
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,010
So we're going to
become one smaller.

150
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,370
We go back one, we get 3.

151
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,560
Either way works.

152
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,810
But isn't this interesting?

153
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:37,510
4 minus 3 is equal to 1 and
4 minus 1 is equal to 3.

154
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:41,060
You might say, well, did I pick
the numbers just so it worked?

155
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:45,190
Well, it turns out that
it's always true.

156
00:06:45,252 --> 00:06:47,430
Well, I don't want to get too
technical, but we're already

157
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,860
touching on something that
you'll learn later, maybe

158
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,200
in algebra one day.

159
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,830
But actually I don't want to
go into all that right now.

160
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,450
So where does this come from?

161
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:02,170
Well, this is also based on
the fact that 3 plus 1-- I

162
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,660
didn't want to confuse you.

163
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,690
So I apologize if I did.

164
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,430
But I'll show you another
interesting thing.

165
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,610
What is 3 plus 1?

166
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,700
3 plus 1 is equal to what?

167
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,370
Well, that's easy.

168
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,390
You know that from
basic addition.

169
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:20,720
You can start on the number
line at 3 and add 1 do it.

170
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,000
And where do you end up?

171
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,310
You end up at 4.

172
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,060
3 plus 1 is equal to 4.

173
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:29,420
Or you could have started at 1
on the number line and added 3.

174
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:33,160
1, 2, 3 and you would
have also ended up at 4.

175
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,680
So we also know that you could
have switch this either way.

176
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,870
Both of those are equal to 4.

177
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,130
What do you see here?

178
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,620
Well, there's a bunch of things
I've written here and they all

179
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,930
kind of relate to each other.

180
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,660
1 plus 3 is equal to 4.

181
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,770
3 plus 1 is equal to 4.

182
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,740
4 minus 1 is 3.

183
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,920
Essentially, 4 minus 1 and
getting 3 is the exact same--

184
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:59,190
you're saying the same thing
as 3 plus 1 is equal to 4.

185
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:03,170
This statement says if
I add 1 to 3 I get 4.

186
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:08,120
This is saying if I take
away 1 from 4 I get 3.

187
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,600
So if I start at 4,
move back, I get 3.

188
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,270
This is saying if I start at
3, and I move up 1, I get 4.

189
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,600
Hopefully that gives you a
little bit of intuition

190
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,670
about what subtraction is.

191
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:24,870
In the next video I'll just do
as many basic subtraction

192
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,800
problems I can do
in 10 minutes.

193
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,020
And then you'll be ready
to do the exercises.

194
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:34,607
See you soon.
