1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:03,090
On problem 124.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,100
According to a car dealer sales report,

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,980
1/3 of the cars sold during a certain period were sedans,

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:14,000
and 1/5 of the other cars sold were station wagons.

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:22,040
So 1/3 of the cars sold, so the total, were equal to sedans.

6
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,890
And 1/5 of the other cars sold were station wagons,

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,440
so 1/5 of the remainder of this.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,520
So that's 1/5 of the 2/3 cars that weren't sedans.

9
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:39,880
So 1/5 of the 2/3 of the total were station wagons.

10
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,040
Let's call it W for wagons.

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,420
If N station wagons were sold during that period--

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,720
so W is equal to N-- how many sedans in terms of n were sold?

13
00:00:53,650 --> 00:01:03,000
So we know that 1/5 times 2/3 times the total is equal to N.

14
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,040
Let's just substitute S for T.

15
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,080
If we multiply both sides of this top equation times 3, we

16
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,020
know that the total is equal to 3 times the number of sedans.

17
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,020
So let's substitute that here for T.

18
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:21,820
So you get 1/5 times 2/3 times 3S is equal to N.

19
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:25,400
3 cancels out. 3 divided by 3.

20
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:31,730
So you have 2/5 S is equal to N, or--

21
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,140
let me just write it up here. So multiply both sides by 5/2.

22
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:39,170
You have S is equal to 5/2 N.

23
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:45,160
And that is choice D. Problem 125.

24
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:56,780
If p/q is less than 1, and p and q are positive integers,

25
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:01,080
which of the following must be greater than 1?

26
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:02,850
So think about this.

27
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:09,040
If p/q is less than 1, that tells us that p is less than q.

28
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,020
You can multiply both sides of this times q,and you get that.

29
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,780
p has to be less than q. And they're both positive integers.

30
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,620
So there's nothing tricky here with negative numbers.

31
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,110
So just the instincts, which of the following must be

32
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,340
greater than 1? I don't know if this is going to be a choice,

33
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,560
but if this is less than 1,

34
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,040
if you invert it it's going to be greater than 1.

35
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,630
So divide both sides of this by p.

36
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:34,000
You'll get 1 is less than q/p. And that makes sense.

37
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:40,100
If 1/2 is less than 1,then 2/1 is going to be greater than 1.

38
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:45,040
If 2/3 is less than 1,then 3/2 is going to be greater than 1.

39
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,170
So if p/q is less than 1,

40
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,040
then q over p is going to be greater than 1.

41
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,920
And we did it algebraically by just multiplying both sides by

42
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,000
q and then multiplying both sides by p. That is a choice.

43
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,640
E, q/p. That made it easy.

44
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,030
I thought I might have to do more work if that didn't show up

45
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:09,150
So q/p is definitely greater than 1. Next question, 126.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,450
It would take 1 machine 4 hours to complete a large

47
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:18,430
production order. So machine 1, it would take 4 hours.

48
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:29,460
So you could say 1 order every 4 hours,or 1/4 order per hour.

49
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:30,740
That's machine 1.

50
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,620
And another machine, 3 hours to complete the same order.

51
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:43,960
So machine 2 does 1 order in 3 hours, or 1/3 orders per hour.

52
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,150
How many hours would it take both machines working

53
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,420
simultaneously at their respective constant rates to

54
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,490
complete the order?

55
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,550
If they're working together, you're going to

56
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:56,280
have one machine producing at 1/4 order per hour,

57
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,080
plus another machine producing at 1/3 order per hour.

58
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,000
So their combined rate is going to be what over 12?

59
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,000
And then 1/4 is the same thing as 3/12,

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,710
and 1/3 is the same thing as 4/12.

61
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:14,590
So their combined rate is going to be 7/12 order per hour.

62
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,130
And you want to know

63
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,050
how long it's going to take them to make 1 order.

64
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:25,690
So you can think of production is equal to rate times time.

65
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,840
And time is equal to production divided by rate.

66
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,250
Or if you don't want to think about them,

67
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,080
just think of I can make 7/12 orders per hour,

68
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,170
if I have to make 1 order,

69
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:43,380
I'm just going to be 1 order divided by 7/12 order per hour.

70
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,280
This might seem a little confusing to you,

71
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,050
but if these were constant numbers, try to play with it.

72
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,780
If I had to make 10 orders, and I can make 2 orders per

73
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:55,070
hour. then I just divide 10 b,y 2, which would tell me 5 hours.

74
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,310
But it's just a little more confusing when I have to make

75
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,000
1 order and my rate is 7/12 orders for hour.

76
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,760
But hopefully if you substitute whole numbers in

77
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,460
your head it makes little bit of sense.

78
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:11,420
So this is the same thing as 12/7.

79
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,160
And then of course the orders cancel out,

80
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,830
and you end up with hours in the numerator.

81
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:20,000
So 12/7 hours or 1 5/7 hours. What do they have?

82
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,420
Yes, that's choice C.

83
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,970
Question 127.

84
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:34,850
To mail a package, the rate is x cents for the first pound,

85
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,390
and y cents for each additional pound,

86
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,280
where they tell us that x is greater than y.

87
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:56,130
2 packages weighing 3 pounds and 5 pounds respectively can

88
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,000
be mailed separately or combined as one package,

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,430
so 3 pounds and 5 pounds. That's one package.

90
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,220
Which method is cheaper, and how much money is saved?

91
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,100
Let's think about it.

92
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,720
If you keep them separate, how much are you going to pay?

93
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,550
For the 3 pound packet,

94
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,010
you're going to pay x for the first pound.

95
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,500
And then you're going to have 2 pounds left

96
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,240
that you are going to pay y at. And then for this one,

97
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,730
you are going to pay x for the first pound.

98
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:27,020
You're going to have 4 pounds left, so plus 4y.

99
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,850
So when you add them together,

100
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:34,120
your total expense is going to be 2x plus 6y.

101
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,570
That's if you mail them separately.

102
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:38,790
Now if you combine them into one 8 pound package,

103
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,050
what do you have? You have to pay x for the first pound, and

104
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,380
then you have 7 pounds left that you're going to pay for y.

105
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,910
So it's going to cost x plus 7y.

106
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,570
So first of all, we know that this is going to be more.

107
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,660
Why do we know this is more?

108
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,750
Because essentially we're taking one of the y's-- and

109
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:03,010
when you pay them separately for that one extra pound that

110
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,020
here you're paying it as in x cents,

111
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,750
instead of y cents that you're paying in this case.

112
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,130
And x is more than y.

113
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,800
And that will hold out when we actually subtract the 2 out.

114
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,220
Actually, hopefully you understand the reasoning why

115
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,480
this is going to be larger because x is greater than y.

116
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,560
So let's figure it out. What's the difference?

117
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,460
This is the higher number.

118
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,030
And let's subtract out the lower number, minus x minus 7y.

119
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,060
I just subtracted x plus 7y.

120
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:39,150
And that you end up with x minus y. 6 minus 7y is minus 1y.

121
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,830
So x minus y. And the fact that

122
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,630
x is greater than y lets you know this is positive.

123
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,790
So that also tells you that this is the more expensive of

124
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:51,010
the alternatives. Separate is the more expensive.

125
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,150
And the difference is x minus y.

126
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,360
So they ask which method is cheaper? So

127
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:04,280
the combined method is cheaper and you save x minus y cents.

128
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,790
And that's choice A. Choice B,

129
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,120
they say combined is cheaper with a savings of y minus x.

130
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,050
But y minus x is going to be a negative number.

131
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,040
So you can't say you saved a negative number.

132
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,410
They tell us that x is greater than y,

133
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,050
so you could cancel that out.

134
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,550
And the other ones don't make any sense at all.

135
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,940
Next problem, 128.

136
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:39,060
If money is invested at r% interest compounded annually,

137
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,850
the amount of the investment will double in

138
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,250
approximately 70/r years.

139
00:08:53,900 --> 00:09:01,510
If Pat's parents invested $5,000 in a long-term bond

140
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:09,130
that pays 8% interest compounded annually, what will

141
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,610
be the approximate total amount of the investment 18

142
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:16,570
years later as Pat is ready for college?

143
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:23,720
It doubles every 70/r years, where r is 8.

144
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,220
They gave us that information, so let's try to use it.

145
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,150
So how long does it take to double at an 8% rate?

146
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:35,660
So it's 70 divided by 8 is equal to what? It's equal to 8.5?

147
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,400
8 goes into 70 eight times, 64. 6, 0.

148
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,140
8 goes into 60 seven times. 7 times 8 is 56.

149
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:58,080
And you have a 40. 8.75 years.

150
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,510
This isn't going to be exact, but you're going to double

151
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:05,730
your money roughly every 8.75 years if using this formula

152
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,540
they give you at an 8% interest rate.

153
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,270
And they say what will be

154
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,650
the total amount of the investment 18 years later?

155
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,510
So 18 years, that's roughly two doublings.

156
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,000
So you're going to start with $5,000,

157
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,050
and after 8.75 years you're going to be at $10,000.

158
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,150
You're going to double in 8.75 years.

159
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,380
And then after another 8.75 years,

160
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:36,080
you are going to be at $20,000. This isn't exactly 18 years.

161
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:40,010
This is 17.5,but that's about as close as we're going to get.

162
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:43,750
So in 17.5 years,you get to $20,000.They are asking 18 years,

163
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,350
and this is all about approximation because

164
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,640
they don't want you to do some hardcore exponent math here.

165
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:53,700
And so the answer is A. And if you look at that 8.75,

166
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,500
that's roughly you're doubling every 9 years.

167
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,490
They ask us how long.

168
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,170
So you could say after 9 years I'm at $10,000,

169
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,000
after another 9 years I'm at $20,000.

170
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,490
So after 18 years, I'll be at $20,000.

171
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,020
And I'm all out of time. See you in the next video.
