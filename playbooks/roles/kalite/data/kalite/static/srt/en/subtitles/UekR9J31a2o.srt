1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,850
   

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,810
I told you that the two most
important things you should

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,860
know in thermodynamics that will
get you most of your way

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,890
through most exams is that the
pressure times the volume is

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,440
equal to a constant, and that
the pressure times the volume

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,310
divided by the temperatures
is equal to a constant.

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,200
They all change such that the
initial pressure times the

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,490
volume divided by the initial
temperature is equal to the

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,520
final pressure times volume
divided by the final

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:27,830
temperature.

11
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,380
Assuming that you're not
changing the energy of the

12
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,060
system, and we'll do
more on that later.

13
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,240
The other thing you should
remember is that pressure

14
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,520
times volume is equal
to n, where n is

15
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,970
the number of moles.

16
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,930
Mole is a number like dozen, but
mole is a huge number-- 6

17
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,960
times 10 to the 23 times R.

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:01:02,440
R was the universal gas
constant-- that's 8.31 joules

19
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,780
per mole Kelvin times
the temperature.

20
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,610
Remember, just to be safe,
always convert to Kelvin

21
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,440
first.

22
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,430
Let's see if we can do a problem
that I can make up on

23
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,290
the fly of this situation.

24
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:24,170
Let's say I have a balloon, and
the volume of the balloon

25
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:32,650
is 1 meter cubed, so this
is a big balloon.

26
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,870
That's fairly large, if you
imagine a cubic meter.

27
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,420
The volume is a cubic meter, and
let's say the pressure is

28
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:50,240
equal to 5 pascals, and that's
newtons per meter squared.

29
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,105
   

30
00:01:53,105 --> 00:01:57,480
And let's say we're at a
reasonably warm temperature,

31
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:04,780
so temperature is equal to 20
degrees Celsius, and let's say

32
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,750
that balloon is filled helium.

33
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:13,170
My question to you is, how many
molecules of helium do I

34
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,490
have in the balloon?

35
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,180
Let's just substitute
into the equation.

36
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,150
We have pressure, which is 5--
and I'll actually write the

37
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,670
units, I never do it, but you
should, and you should always

38
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,460
do it on an exam-- 5
newtons per meter

39
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,550
squared times the volume.

40
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:34,330
1 meter cubed is equal to my
number of moles, n, times the

41
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:44,590
universal gas constant, 8.31
joules per mole Kelvin, times

42
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,610
temperature.

43
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:49,210
Remember, and I can't repeat
this enough, always convert

44
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,360
the temperature to Kelvin--
so whatever our Celsius

45
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,000
temperature is, add 273.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,540
Add 273 to that, and
you get 293 Kelvin.

47
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:04,720
So I get 5 times 1, and meters
square, meters cubed cancels

48
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,760
out and just becomes a meter.

49
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,290
Newton meter is joules.

50
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,860
5 joules is equal to
n moles times 8.31

51
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,490
joules per mole Kelvin.

52
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:29,580
This Kelvin and this Kelvin
cancel out, so 8.31 times 293

53
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:45,235
is equal to 2,434.83
joules per mole.

54
00:03:45,235 --> 00:03:48,660
   

55
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,380
To get to the number of moles,
we just divide both sides of

56
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,870
this equation by that.

57
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,570
And the units should work
out, so you get 5.

58
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:10,950
So n is equal to 5 joules
times 1 over 2,434.83.

59
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,740
Since we're dividing by this,
this flips; moles per joule.

60
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,740
This joule cancels out with this
joule, so we just have to

61
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,970
divide 5 by this, and we'll
get the number of moles.

62
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:27,680
Let's take the inverse of what
I had there times 5, and so I

63
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,552
get 0.002 moles.

64
00:04:32,552 --> 00:04:41,400
So this equals 0.0021 moles.

65
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,100
That might seem like a small
number to you, but let's

66
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,370
figure out how many
molecules that is.

67
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,750
   

68
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:54,150
Let me make some space free,
so I can write Avogadro's

69
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,400
number down.

70
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:06,730
   

71
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,720
Did I even say what Avogadro's
number is?

72
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,090
Avogadro's number is the number
of molecules per mole--

73
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,010
it's that number.

74
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:19,690
So, number Avogadro is equal
to 6.022 times 10 to the 23

75
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:24,040
molecules per mole.

76
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,870
The top is molecules, and the
bottom is moles-- I know you

77
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,390
can't read that.

78
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,970
I have 0.0021 moles, so how
many molecules do I have?

79
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:38,750
I just multiply that 0.0021
times how many moles per

80
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:45,580
molecule-- because this is
moles-- times Avogadro's

81
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:52,430
number, which is molecules
per mole.

82
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,910
That's molecules, this is
moles-- maybe I should write

83
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,530
the whole thing-- so then the
moles cancel out, and

84
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:08,070
Avogadro's number is 6.022 times
10 to the 23-- let's

85
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,900
just remember that--
and let's just

86
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:16,650
multiply that times 0.0021.

87
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:32,880
It equals 0.0126 times 10
to the 23 molecules.

88
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,240
This is 0.0126.

89
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:48,260
That's the same thing as 1.26
times 0.01, and then of course

90
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,740
times 10 to the 23.

91
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,710
What's 0.01?

92
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:56,320
That's 10 to the negative 2--
10 to the negative 1 is 0.1,

93
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,110
so this 10 to the negative 2.

94
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:04,410
Then we get 1.26-- 10 to the
negative 2, times 10 to the

95
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:09,760
negative 3, and we add the
exponents times 10 to the 21.

96
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,790
It's roughly 1.26, and then
another 19 zeroes-- or roughly

97
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:19,360
1 followed by 21 zeroes-- is how
many molecules of, in this

98
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,260
case, helium we had
in the balloon.

99
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,230
It's not too difficult.

100
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,950
The hard part is really just
remembering Avogadro's number,

101
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:29,330
remembering the universal gas
constant is 8.31 joules per

102
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,920
mole Kelvin, remembering
to always convert your

103
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,300
temperature to Kelvin, and then
just making sure all your

104
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,390
units match up.

105
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,660
Sometimes that might be tricky:
they might give volume

106
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,660
in liters, and you have to--
especially in this case--

107
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,640
convert it to meters cubed
before you do it.

108
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,830
They might give pressure,
atmospheres, or bars, and you

109
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,980
should know the conversion, and
convert it to pascals or

110
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,040
newtons per meter squared.

111
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,600
Other than that, it's just
substituting and just doing

112
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,210
the hairy math and the
scientific notation.

113
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,600
Hopefully, that was vaguely
clarifying.

114
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,400
See you in the next video.

115
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:01,500
