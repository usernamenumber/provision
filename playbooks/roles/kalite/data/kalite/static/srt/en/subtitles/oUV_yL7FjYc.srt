00:00:01,841 --> 00:00:07,841
What is the slope of the line that contains the points (7/2, -19/4) and (-2/3, 57/8) ?

2
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:13,926
So I will do this problem because those people who wrote this problem want us to do it this way,

3
00:00:13,926 --> 00:00:16,008
by using the formula.

4
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:18,142
But you know I'm not a fan of blindly using formulas.

5
00:00:18,142 --> 00:00:22,408
So maybe after we do this, we will work it out, or we will visualise it a little bit

6
00:00:22,408 --> 00:00:26,841
to show us the formula really is just measuring the inclination of the line.

7
00:00:26,841 --> 00:00:29,091
So if I have two points,

8
00:00:29,091 --> 00:00:32,075
So let's say one point is (x1,y1)

9
00:00:32,075 --> 00:00:41,875
The other point is (X2,Y2). The slope of a line; and they use the letter "m" for the slope of the line.

10
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,559
Is going to be the difference between the "y"s, and you want to make sure

11
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:47,625
you get the order right. So if we start with "Y2"
