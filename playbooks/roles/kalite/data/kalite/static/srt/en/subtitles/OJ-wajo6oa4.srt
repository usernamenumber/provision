1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,857
We've got 9601 - 8023.

2
00:00:05,857 --> 00:00:09,494
And immediately when we try to start subtracting 
in our 1s place, we have a problem.

3
00:00:09,496 --> 00:00:11,659
This 3 is larger than this 1.

4
00:00:11,659 --> 00:00:13,218
And we also have this 
problem in the 10s place.

5
00:00:13,218 --> 00:00:16,008
This 2 is larger than this 0.

6
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:19,489
So we're going to have to do some 
type of borrowing – or regrouping.

7
00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:22,445
And so, the way I like to think about it –
I like to go to the first place value

8
00:00:22,445 --> 00:00:23,745
that has something to give.

9
00:00:23,763 --> 00:00:27,414
Obviously, the 10s place is in no position
to give anything to the 1s place.

10
00:00:27,414 --> 00:00:29,486
It needs things itself.

11
00:00:29,486 --> 00:00:30,851
And so we're going to go 
to the 100s place –

12
00:00:30,907 --> 00:00:33,817
because the 100s place has 
an abundance of value

13
00:00:33,817 --> 00:00:36,381
that can be regrouped into 
the 10s and 1s places.

14
00:00:36,381 --> 00:00:40,101
This 6 right over here
represents 6 hundreds.

15
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:43,729
So why don't we take 1 hundred 
from that 6 hundred –

16
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:46,919
(So then this will become 5 hundred.)

17
00:00:47,053 --> 00:00:51,113
– and then give that 100 over to the 10s place.

18
00:00:51,243 --> 00:00:54,473
Now, if we give 1 hundred to the 10s place,

19
00:00:54,524 --> 00:00:57,084
how would I represent that in the 10s place?

20
00:00:57,207 --> 00:01:01,207
Well I have 0 10s.
And now I'm going to give 100

21
00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:03,889
100is the same thing as 10 10s.

22
00:01:05,289 --> 00:01:07,139
It's going to be 0 + 100.

23
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:10,718
100 in the 10s place is just 10.

24
00:01:11,693 --> 00:01:13,283
So let me write it this way.

25
00:01:13,327 --> 00:01:18,549
So this right over here
is now going to be rewritten as 10.

26
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:20,129
Now you might be saying, "Wait, wait, wait.

27
00:01:20,139 --> 00:01:21,709
"What's going on here Sal?

28
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:23,489
"You took 100 from the 100s place.

29
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:25,239
That's why it became 500.

30
00:01:25,463 --> 00:01:28,403
Now why did this become 10 and not 100?"

31
00:01:28,504 --> 00:01:31,044
Now remember, this is 10 10s.

32
00:01:31,052 --> 00:01:33,652
So this is still representing 100.

33
00:01:33,683 --> 00:01:36,483
You have not changed the value of this top number.

34
00:01:36,978 --> 00:01:41,288
Before, the value was 9000 + 600 + 1

35
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:46,528
Now it's 9000 + 500 + 100 ...

36
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,370
(10 × 10 is 100.) ... + 1.

37
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,280
I have not changed the value here.

38
00:01:51,725 --> 00:01:53,275
Now, we're still not done yet.

39
00:01:53,275 --> 00:01:54,335
We don't want to just subtract, because

40
00:01:54,335 --> 00:01:56,445
we still have the problem with the 1s place.

41
00:01:56,445 --> 00:01:59,225
The 1s place still doesn't have enough value.

42
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,120
Now, the good thing is we've given

43
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,510
some value to the 10s place.

44
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,580
So why don't we take 10s from the 10s place?

45
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:08,580
So if you have 10 10s, and you take

46
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,360
1 10 away, you're going to be left

47
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,891
with 9 10s, or 90.

48
00:02:12,891 --> 00:02:14,941
And then we can take that 10

49
00:02:14,941 --> 00:02:17,031
and give it to the 1s place

50
00:02:17,057 --> 00:02:19,597
So let's do that. 
You take that 10 we just took

51
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,657
from there, and you give it to the 1s place.

52
00:02:21,657 --> 00:02:23,797
You now have 11 here.

53
00:02:24,022 --> 00:02:26,552
And now we are ready to subtract.

54
00:02:26,933 --> 00:02:29,693
11 - 3 is 8.

55
00:02:29,838 --> 00:02:32,928
9 - 2, (this is really 90 - 20) is 70.

56
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,399
Then in the 10s place, we represent that as a 7.

57
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:40,399
5 hundreds - 0 hundred is 5 hundreds (500),

58
00:02:41,636 --> 00:02:43,756
represented as a 5 in the 100s place.

59
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:47,699
9000 - 8000 is 1000.

60
00:02:47,794 --> 00:02:50,054
And we're done. 
And just to make things really clear,

61
00:02:50,059 --> 00:02:53,209
I'm going to redo this problem now 
but with things expanded out.

62
00:02:53,513 --> 00:02:56,633
So, this first number is 9000.

63
00:02:56,956 --> 00:03:06,166
9 thousands + 6 hundreds + 0 tens + 1 one.
(9000 + 600 + 00 + 1.)

64
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:10,586
And this number right here, 
we are subtracting 8 thousands 

65
00:03:10,971 --> 00:03:16,696
we are subtracting 0 hundreds.
We are subtracting 2 tens, which is 20.

66
00:03:17,312 --> 00:03:20,473
Subtracting 20.
And subtracting 3 ones.

67
00:03:20,836 --> 00:03:23,426
So I have just rewritten
this exact same statement

68
00:03:23,426 --> 00:03:25,956
but the regrouping, and the borrowing

69
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,826
is going to become
a little bit clearer now.

70
00:03:28,294 --> 00:03:30,694
So, the same exact thing 

71
00:03:30,696 --> 00:03:34,086
We say "Hey, we can't subtract this 3
from this 1 or the 20 from the 0."

72
00:03:34,086 --> 00:03:36,816
But we have a lot of value
over here in the 600.

73
00:03:37,206 --> 00:03:40,826
So why don't we take 100 
from that, (So it becomes 500.)

74
00:03:41,257 --> 00:03:44,977
 and we give that 100
to the 10s place.

75
00:03:45,753 --> 00:03:50,963
So this becomes 100.

76
00:03:50,963 --> 00:03:56,383
Notice, the value has not changed,
this is 9000 + 500 + 100 + 1

77
00:03:56,383 --> 00:03:59,233
That's the same thing as
9000 + 600 + 1.

78
00:03:59,593 --> 00:04:01,683
We have just put the value
in different places.

79
00:04:01,907 --> 00:04:04,077
And here we have explicitly written 100.

80
00:04:04,086 --> 00:04:08,556
But when represented in the 10s place,
10 10s is the same thing as 100.

81
00:04:08,761 --> 00:04:11,131
Now, we aren't done
regrouping just yet.

82
00:04:11,137 --> 00:04:13,457
We want to give some 
value to the 1s place.

83
00:04:13,468 --> 00:04:16,848
So, we can take 10 from the 10s place
(And this becomes a 90.)

84
00:04:16,848 --> 00:04:21,188
 and give that 10 to the 1s place.

85
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,288
10 + 1 is 11.

86
00:04:24,655 --> 00:04:28,655
So notice, I did the exact borrowing 
the exact regrouping  that I did here.

87
00:04:29,013 --> 00:04:31,113
I just represented it
a little bit differently.

88
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,220
This 500 was represented
by a 5 in the 100s place.

89
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,630
This 90 was represented
by 9 in the 10s place.

90
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,552
But either way, we are 
ready to subtract now.

91
00:04:39,616 --> 00:04:46,216
11 - 3 is 8.
90 - 20 is 70...

92
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:49,299
Let's write a plus (+) there.

93
00:04:49,438 --> 00:04:52,238
500 - 0 is 500.

94
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,070
And then 9000 - 8000 is 1000.

95
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,460
And we got the same result 

96
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:04,400
because 1000 + 500 + 70 + 8 is 1578.
