1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,470
   

2
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:06,250
Solve the equation: x squared
minus x squared minus 4 over x

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:07,570
minus 2 is equal to 4.

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,920
And they tell us that x won't
or cannot be 2 because if it

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,670
was 2, then this would
be undefined.

6
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,460
It would be dividing by 0.

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,535
So let's see what x is.

8
00:00:15,535 --> 00:00:18,860
Let's see the x that actually
satisfies this equation.

9
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,530
So you might be tempted to try
to express this with the

10
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,490
common denominator of x minus
2 and then add these two

11
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:25,580
expressions.

12
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,550
But the thing that jumps out
at me initially is that we

13
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,230
have x squared minus 4 on the
numerator, which is a

14
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,439
difference of squares.

15
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,290
Or if you factor it out, it's
x plus 2 times x minus 2.

16
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,460
So we should be able to factor
this x minus 2 out.

17
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,460
So let's do that.

18
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,580
So if we were to rewrite it,
this is equivalent to x

19
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,940
squared minus-- instead of
writing x squared minus 4, we

20
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,230
know that's a difference
of squares.

21
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:52,300
That is x plus 2 times
x minus 2.

22
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,630
All of that over x minus 2.

23
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,160
And that is equal to 4.

24
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,533
And this whole time we're
assuming that x

25
00:00:58,533 --> 00:00:59,760
won't be equal to 2.

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,990
And because x does not equal to
2, x minus 2 divided by x

27
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,600
minus 2 is going
to be defined.

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,890
And it will be 1.

29
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,720
So those two will cancel out.

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,870
And so we're left with x squared
minus x plus 2 is

31
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,020
equal to 4.

32
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,555
We can distribute the
negative sign.

33
00:01:16,555 --> 00:01:18,450
And I'll just arbitrarily
switch colors here.

34
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,880
We can distribute the negative
sign, so we get x squared

35
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,550
minus x minus 2 is equal to 4.

36
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,350
And what we want to do is put
this in the form ax squared

37
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,190
plus bx plus c is equal to 0.

38
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:35,190
That allows us to either
factor it or apply the

39
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,100
quadratic equation or complete
the square, or any of the ways

40
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,260
that we know how to
solve quadratics.

41
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,000
So let's do that.

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,970
Let's get a 0 on the
right-hand side.

43
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,720
The best way to do that is to
subtract 4 from both sides of

44
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,830
this equation.

45
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:49,820
Subtract 4 and we are left
with x squared minus x.

46
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,330
Negative 2 minus 4
is negative 6.

47
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,460
And then 4 minus 4 is 0.

48
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,270
That was the whole point.

49
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,170
So we have x squared minus
x minus 6 is equal to 0.

50
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,050
Let me write it up here.

51
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:03,330
x squared minus x minus
6 is equal to 0.

52
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,730
And this looks factorable.

53
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,500
We just have to think of two
numbers that when we multiply

54
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,669
them give us negative 6.

55
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:10,660
So they're going to have
different signs.

56
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,570
When I add them I'll
get negative 1.

57
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,420
So it looks like negative
3 and positive 2 work.

58
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:21,430
So if we do x minus
3 times x plus 2.

59
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,200
It's a little bit of trial and
error, but 6 doesn't have that

60
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,630
many factors to deal with and
3 and 2 are one apart.

61
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,780
They have different signs, so
that's how you can think of

62
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,700
how we get to that conclusion.

63
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,360
Negative 3 times 2
is negative 6.

64
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,630
Negative 3 plus 2
is negative 1.

65
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,760
So that is equal to 0.

66
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,620
So we have two possible
ways to get 0.

67
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:47,730
Either x minus 3 is equal to 0
or x plus 2 is equal to 0.

68
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,610
And then if we take x minus 3 is
equal to 0, if we add 3 to

69
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:55,290
both sides of that equation, we
get x is equal to 3 or, if

70
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,190
we subtract 2 from both sides of
this equation, we get x is

71
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,640
equal to negative 2.

72
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,910
So both of these
are solutions.

73
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,320
And let's apply them into
this equation to make

74
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,400
sure that they work.

75
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,200
Because these are solutions to
essentially, the situation

76
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,940
where we got rid of
the x minus 2.

77
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,540
Maybe it had some type
of side effects.

78
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,140
So let's just make sure that
both of these actually work in

79
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,110
the original equation.

80
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,400
So let's try x is equal
to 3 first.

81
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,810
So you get 3 squared minus
3 squared over 4.

82
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,130
Sorry, 3 squared minus
4 over 3 minus 2.

83
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:33,730
So this is equal to 9 minus--
3 squared is 9 --minus 4,

84
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,160
which is 5, over 1.

85
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,720
So 9 minus 5, which
is equal to 4.

86
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,805
Which is exactly what we
needed it to equal.

87
00:03:39,805 --> 00:03:42,440
And let's try it with
negative 2.

88
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:50,000
So if I take negative 2 squared
and I have a minus

89
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,290
negative 2 squared minus
4, all of that over

90
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,210
negative 2 minus 2.

91
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,720
So negative 2 squared is 4.

92
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,680
Minus negative 2 squared,
which is 4.

93
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,320
Minus 4.

94
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,230
All of that over negative
2 minus negative 2

95
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,310
over negative 4.

96
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,480
Well 4 minus 4 is 0, so this
whole thing is just

97
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,740
going to become 0.

98
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,260
So this whole thing is
going to equal 4.

99
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,710
So both of these
solutions work.

100
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,940
And that makes sense, because
when we actually canceled this

101
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,060
out, we actually didn't
fundamentally change anything

102
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:20,779
about the equation.

103
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:23,550
Only if you had the situation
where the x would have been

104
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,000
equal to 2.

105
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,070
That's the only thing that
you're really changing.

106
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,140
So that's why it makes
sense that both of

107
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,910
these solutions work.

108
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:31,266
