1
00:00:00,762 --> 00:00:02,897
I now want to turn my attention

2
00:00:02,897 --> 00:00:05,296
from all of the craziness that's happening in Europe

3
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:07,113
and go halfway around the world

4
00:00:07,113 --> 00:00:10,277
to one of France's colonies in the Caribbean,

5
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:14,181
that's Saint-Domingue.

6
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:17,529
And I know I'm butchering all of the pronunciations.

7
00:00:17,529 --> 00:00:22,531
But Saint-Domingue, and its modern name is Haiti,

8
00:00:22,531 --> 00:00:25,647
It is the western half of the island of Hispaniola,

9
00:00:25,647 --> 00:00:29,462
which is the island that Columbus first stumbled upon

10
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:31,699
when he discovered the New World.

11
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,124
The eastern half of the island,

12
00:00:33,124 --> 00:00:33,741
that you don't see here,

13
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:35,604
I've zoomed in on the western half.

14
00:00:35,604 --> 00:00:38,213
The eastern half is now called the Dominican Republic.

15
00:00:38,213 --> 00:00:40,161
At that time it was called Santo Domingo

16
00:00:40,161 --> 00:00:42,294
and it was in the control of Spain.

17
00:00:42,294 --> 00:00:43,413
Let me write that down.

18
00:00:43,413 --> 00:00:44,479
So Spain is here.

19
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,321
You probably don't see my yellow that well.

20
00:00:47,321 --> 00:00:51,950
And then on this side, France has colonized.

21
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,281
Let's write Spain bolder, there you go.

22
00:00:54,281 --> 00:00:56,923
Spain had colonized the eastern half of the island,

23
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:59,413
France had colonized the western half.

24
00:00:59,413 --> 00:01:03,461
And just to get us up to speed on the history,

25
00:01:03,461 --> 00:01:05,846
in 1492, Columbus showed up

26
00:01:05,846 --> 00:01:07,736
and it was a Spanish colony.

27
00:01:07,736 --> 00:01:09,581
And I'm talking about just the western side.

28
00:01:09,581 --> 00:01:12,030
The eastern side continued to be a Spanish colony.

29
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,692
But in 1697, it was officially given over to the French,

30
00:01:16,692 --> 00:01:19,750
but it was a Spanish colony until then.

31
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,612
And then 1697 until the period

32
00:01:22,612 --> 00:01:24,062
that we're talking about right now,

33
00:01:24,062 --> 00:01:26,329
which is the late 1700s,

34
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:28,380
the period of the French Revolution,

35
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,512
it was a French colony.

36
00:01:30,512 --> 00:01:32,647
It's a French colony.

37
00:01:32,647 --> 00:01:34,745
Now you're probably saying, Sal, why are you.. you know

38
00:01:34,745 --> 00:01:36,830
all of these craziness is happening in France.

39
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,098
Kings are getting toppled, people are getting guillotined.

40
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:41,548
There's wars with all of the empires.

41
00:01:41,548 --> 00:01:44,563
Why are you going all the way to this side of the world

42
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,834
and focusing on this small little island?

43
00:01:46,834 --> 00:01:49,504
Well, the big answer, or I guess the main answer,

44
00:01:49,504 --> 00:01:51,165
especially from the perspective of the French--

45
00:01:51,165 --> 00:01:53,503
there's other historical reasons why this,

46
00:01:53,503 --> 00:01:55,460
I think, is relevant

47
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:00,385
But the major reason is that Saint-Domingue at this time

48
00:02:00,385 --> 00:02:02,671
was the most-- let me write that in--

49
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:15,632
most profitable slave colony in the world

50
00:02:15,632 --> 00:02:18,363
In the world.

51
00:02:18,363 --> 00:02:19,930
Now these colonialists,

52
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,913
they cared about profit pretty much all the time.

53
00:02:22,913 --> 00:02:25,039
To a large degree, at this point in history,

54
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,330
that's all they cared about.

55
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,415
But you have to think about it.

56
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:30,463
Remember, what precipitated the French Revolution--

57
00:02:30,463 --> 00:02:32,422
or what I think was a major factor

58
00:02:32,422 --> 00:02:34,914
was that France was broke

59
00:02:34,914 --> 00:02:37,630
France's broke.

60
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,013
So you have this little island here.

61
00:02:39,013 --> 00:02:40,264
It's a slave colony.

62
00:02:40,264 --> 00:02:43,164
Their plantations produce tons of sugarcane,

63
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:45,096
hugely profitable business.

64
00:02:45,096 --> 00:02:47,647
Anything that goes on in Saint-Domingue

65
00:02:47,647 --> 00:02:50,216
will matter to France, because France is broke

66
00:02:50,216 --> 00:02:51,010
And not only are they broke,

67
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,182
but they have all of these wars

68
00:02:52,182 --> 00:02:55,234
with pretty much everybody in Europe.

69
00:02:55,234 --> 00:02:58,247
So let's go back and remind ourselves

70
00:02:58,247 --> 00:03:00,514
what was actually happening in France at the time.

71
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:01,579
We'll actually go back to France.

72
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:03,027
So 1789,

73
00:03:03,027 --> 00:03:07,237
you had your Convocation of the Estates-General

74
00:03:07,237 --> 00:03:10,431
The Third Estate, they were a little peeved,

75
00:03:10,431 --> 00:03:11,681
so they met at the tennis court,

76
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:13,919
they declared themselves the National Assembly,

77
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:21,811
they had the Tennis Court Oath.

78
00:03:21,811 --> 00:03:24,367
Actually, they declared themselves the National Assembly

79
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:26,294
then they were kicked out of the room.

80
00:03:26,294 --> 00:03:28,197
And then they had to do the Tennis Court Oath,

81
00:03:28,197 --> 00:03:31,222
where they promised that they would create a constitution.

82
00:03:31,222 --> 00:03:34,002
And they started talking about liberty, and fraternity,

83
00:03:34,002 --> 00:03:36,350
and brotherhood, and all men are created equal,

84
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,404
all these great ideas of the Enlightenment.

85
00:03:38,404 --> 00:03:40,934
And while all that was happening,

86
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:46,845
you had this businessman, Vincent Oge.

87
00:03:46,845 --> 00:03:48,816
I don't know if I'm pronouncing it right.

88
00:03:48,816 --> 00:03:53,498
He was a wealthy, mixed-race--so let me write that down,

89
00:03:53,498 --> 00:04:00,883
He was a mixed-race and he was 1/4 African descent,

90
00:04:00,883 --> 00:04:08,847
and he was 3/4 European, or French descent.

91
00:04:08,847 --> 00:04:10,497
And he was in Paris on business.

92
00:04:10,497 --> 00:04:12,811
And while he was there, the French Revolution

93
00:04:12,811 --> 00:04:14,396
and the Convocation of the Estates-General

94
00:04:14,396 --> 00:04:15,281
started happening.

95
00:04:15,281 --> 00:04:16,631
and he said, gee, you know what?

96
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,382
I'm a wealthy, educated guy.

97
00:04:18,382 --> 00:04:21,737
I own land in what is now Haiti,

98
00:04:21,737 --> 00:04:23,197
but in Saint-Domingue at the time.

99
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:24,898
He actually owned slaves.

100
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:26,314
I want to be very clear about this.

101
00:04:26,314 --> 00:04:29,618
He owned slaves as well.

102
00:04:29,618 --> 00:04:32,564
And he's like, I am just as good as all of these,

103
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:36,099
I guess, you could say purely European guys all around me,

104
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:38,249
but I don't get equal rights now.

105
00:04:38,249 --> 00:04:39,631
But all of this great stuff is happening,

106
00:04:39,631 --> 00:04:42,614
with talks of a new constitution,

107
00:04:42,614 --> 00:04:44,048
Let me get in on this.

108
00:04:44,048 --> 00:04:47,514
And so he started lobbying with several other,

109
00:04:47,514 --> 00:04:50,632
I guess you could say, forward-thinking indviduals.

110
00:04:50,632 --> 00:04:56,589
He started lobbying for equal rights.

111
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:59,957
He lobbied for equal rights, the rights to vote

112
00:04:59,957 --> 00:05:08,265
and not to be treated like a second-class citizen.

113
00:05:08,265 --> 00:05:10,466
Now at first, they were kind of ignored.

114
00:05:10,466 --> 00:05:13,450
The National Assembly, they wanted to do good things,

115
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,383
but they didn't want to do something so extreme as

116
00:05:15,383 --> 00:05:17,383
considering this wealthy, educated,

117
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:21,057
probably well-spoken individual an equal.

118
00:05:21,057 --> 00:05:22,417
so they were rebuffed a bit.

119
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:32,933
But eventually, in March of 1790,

120
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:37,062
the National Assembly passed an amendment that

121
00:05:37,062 --> 00:05:46,023
had the wording: all proprietors ought to be --

122
00:05:46,023 --> 00:05:47,539
and there's some other stuff in between

123
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:56,640
--ought to be active citizens.

124
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,860
Well, Mr. Vincent Oge and his collaborators say,

125
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,890
hey, this is our victory.

126
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,504
This is the wording that tells us,

127
00:06:03,504 --> 00:06:05,306
look, anyone who is a proprieter --

128
00:06:05,306 --> 00:06:08,540
I own land, I'm a proprieter-- it says

129
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,290
we ought to be active citizens.

130
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:16,454
This gives us the right to vote.

131
00:06:16,454 --> 00:06:20,111
So he declared that a victory for his rights,

132
00:06:20,111 --> 00:06:22,481
or people like his rights.

133
00:06:22,481 --> 00:06:27,193
And so he goes back to Saint-Domingue

134
00:06:27,193 --> 00:06:28,212
and tells the governor, look,

135
00:06:28,212 --> 00:06:30,677
all of this craziness has been happening in France,

136
00:06:30,677 --> 00:06:32,478
we have a National Assembly,

137
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:35,060
and they've essentially given me the right to vote.

138
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:42,095
Unfortunately, the governor of Saint-Domingue ignores him,

139
00:06:42,095 --> 00:06:43,810
or essentially doesn't listen to him --

140
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,861
ignores what he has to say

141
00:06:46,861 --> 00:06:48,576
and says, I don't care what's going on in France.

142
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:49,906
I'm not going to give you

143
00:06:49,906 --> 00:06:52,529
and people like you the right to vote.

144
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:56,260
So this obviously did not make him a happy individual.

145
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,010
He seems like he has everything going in his favor.

146
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,078
Even the national assembly seems to be going in his favor,

147
00:07:00,078 --> 00:07:01,577
but the governor ignores him.

148
00:07:01,577 --> 00:07:13,045
So he starts a revolt when he returns,

149
00:07:13,045 --> 00:07:15,327
and he's essentially rebuffed.

150
00:07:15,327 --> 00:07:21,827
He returned in October of 1790, ignored by the governor,

151
00:07:21,827 --> 00:07:23,376
so he starts a revolt.

152
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,444
Unfortunately, his revolt wasn't successful.

153
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:26,444
And I want to be very clear.

154
00:07:26,444 --> 00:07:30,511
When he revolted, he wasn't revolting to abolish slavery,

155
00:07:30,511 --> 00:07:34,027
he wasn't revolting to give all black men on the island

156
00:07:34,027 --> 00:07:34,984
for the right to vote.

157
00:07:34,984 --> 00:07:40,312
He was revolting to give freemen of color

158
00:07:40,312 --> 00:07:43,011
who owned land the right to vote,

159
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:45,313
and that was probably his mistake in the revolt.

160
00:07:45,313 --> 00:07:48,711
I want to give you a little sense of the demographics

161
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:51,563
of Sanit Domingue at that time.

162
00:07:51,563 --> 00:07:56,711
There were 500,000 slaves of African descent

163
00:07:56,711 --> 00:08:02,362
you had 40,000 white colonialists,

164
00:08:02,362 --> 00:08:12,446
and you had 28,000 mixed-race, freeman of color,

165
00:08:12,446 --> 00:08:14,611
or however you want to describe them.

166
00:08:14,611 --> 00:08:16,848
Now if you're going to start a revolt

167
00:08:16,848 --> 00:08:21,545
to defend only your rights,

168
00:08:21,545 --> 00:08:23,471
you're going to get some subset of this 28,000

169
00:08:23,471 --> 00:08:28,138
against a very well-armed, in power, 40, 000.

170
00:08:28,138 --> 00:08:29,205
Now, if he had thought

171
00:08:29,205 --> 00:08:32,203
maybe I should speak in a little bit broader terms --

172
00:08:32,203 --> 00:08:34,306
he was essentially trying to become a part of this club,

173
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:36,474
but if he had spoken in slightly broader terms,

174
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,755
maybe he could have tapped into

175
00:08:38,755 --> 00:08:41,338
some of the angst of that 500, 000.

176
00:08:41,338 --> 00:08:44,186
But he didn't, and so his revolt was unsuccessful

177
00:08:44,186 --> 00:08:45,587
and he was captured.

178
00:08:45,587 --> 00:08:59,238
And then in February 1791, he was executed.

179
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,675
So it seems like all was for naught.

180
00:09:00,675 --> 00:09:04,188
He went through all this trouble to get some freedom.

181
00:09:04,188 --> 00:09:05,656
He was ignored, tried a revolt,

182
00:09:05,656 --> 00:09:07,255
his revolt wasn't done that well.

183
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,704
He was executed,

184
00:09:08,704 --> 00:09:14,674
but it started to simmer within the consciousness

185
00:09:14,674 --> 00:09:19,973
of the people of African descent at that time.

186
00:09:19,973 --> 00:09:23,072
And whether or not his revolt directly lead to

187
00:09:23,072 --> 00:09:25,506
what is going to happen over the next few years

188
00:09:25,506 --> 00:09:26,372
is unclear,

189
00:09:26,372 --> 00:09:30,121
but it did happen and at least he was the first one

190
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:33,496
that really did try to start a revolt in a major way.

191
00:09:33,496 --> 00:09:36,598
But anyway, after he was executed,

192
00:09:36,598 --> 00:09:40,307
there started to be a little bit more murmurrings,

193
00:09:40,307 --> 00:09:41,182
especially in the North.

194
00:09:41,182 --> 00:09:43,310
Most of the sugar plantations were focused around the North,

195
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:46,311
and obviously, the more plantations, the more profit.

196
00:09:46,311 --> 00:09:50,319
And there was actually a voodoo ceremony

197
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:53,895
that was run by an individual

198
00:09:53,895 --> 00:09:57,973
whose name was Dutty Boukman.

199
00:09:57,973 --> 00:09:59,891
And I looked for pictures of him. I couldn't find any.

200
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:00,941
Unfortunately, there aren't.

201
00:10:00,941 --> 00:10:03,092
He ran this voodoo ceremony

202
00:10:03,092 --> 00:10:08,211
where he essentially instigated a slave uprising in Haiti,

203
00:10:08,211 --> 00:10:10,492
or what is now Haiti, but in Saint-Domingue.

204
00:10:10,492 --> 00:10:11,940
Now remember, look at those demographics.

205
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,874
As you could imagine,

206
00:10:13,874 --> 00:10:17,174
if the slaves themselves were to rise up

207
00:10:17,174 --> 00:10:18,908
against everyone else on the island.

208
00:10:18,908 --> 00:10:19,975
you could imagine--

209
00:10:19,975 --> 00:10:22,558
even though they might not be as well organized,

210
00:10:22,558 --> 00:10:24,257
or as well equipped as the other members,

211
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:29,093
just by sheer force -- they should probably do pretty good.

212
00:10:29,093 --> 00:10:39,141
And so in 1791, in August 1791,

213
00:10:39,141 --> 00:10:47,742
an all-out slave rebellion begins.

214
00:10:47,742 --> 00:10:51,348
Now you can imagine, this scares France.

215
00:10:51,348 --> 00:10:54,278
Putting aside all of the things of the Revolution

216
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,714
and all these new notions from the Enlightenment,

217
00:10:56,714 --> 00:11:01,326
here is your most profitable colony in the world,

218
00:11:01,326 --> 00:11:03,286
and all of a sudden, there's a revolt.

219
00:11:03,286 --> 00:11:06,526
People on both sides of the equation are getting slaughtered,

220
00:11:06,526 --> 00:11:08,078
plantations are getting burned.

221
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:11,361
From the new government in France's point of view,

222
00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:13,243
that's just going to hurt their own profitability.

223
00:11:13,243 --> 00:11:15,958
This is at a time, remember, France is broke.

224
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,488
They're at wars with other countries.

225
00:11:18,488 --> 00:11:20,459
So France sends a delegation,

226
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:25,970
headed by this guy right there.

227
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,426
His name was--

228
00:11:27,426 --> 00:11:29,412
and I know I'm butchering the pronunciations --

229
00:11:29,412 --> 00:11:33,230
Sonthonax.

230
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,746
I don't know the best way to pronounce it.

231
00:11:35,746 --> 00:11:42,779
And it was him plus 6,000 or 7,000 troops.

232
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:44,812
And they essentially were sent from France

233
00:11:44,812 --> 00:11:47,129
to put down the slave rebellion,

234
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:51,294
to kind of get things back to the way they were.

235
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:52,846
And in order to consolidate

236
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:56,229
everyone on France's side right here,

237
00:11:56,229 --> 00:12:07,121
France in April 1792-- so let me write this down

238
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:09,829
The Legislative Assembly, you might remember,

239
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:13,905
a new constitution was created at the end of 1791,

240
00:12:13,905 --> 00:12:22,831
and that entailed a new Legislative Assembly.

241
00:12:22,831 --> 00:12:25,600
They essentially gave full citizenship

242
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,760
to all free people of color.

243
00:12:31,775 --> 00:12:35,491
So unfortunately, Vincent Oge

244
00:12:35,491 --> 00:12:37,092
was a little bit ahead of his time.

245
00:12:37,092 --> 00:12:38,365
If he had just waited a couple of years,

246
00:12:38,365 --> 00:12:39,376
he wouldn't have had to revolt.

247
00:12:39,376 --> 00:12:42,091
Or maybe he helped to precipitate this.

248
00:12:42,091 --> 00:12:42,906
So it's not clear.

249
00:12:42,906 --> 00:12:43,674
Maybe his revolt,

250
00:12:43,674 --> 00:12:47,712
which maybe helped precipitate the eventual slave revolt,

251
00:12:47,712 --> 00:12:49,960
which eventually might have helped

252
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,701
the Legislative Assembly come to terms with this idea.

253
00:12:52,701 --> 00:12:53,670
Maybe he made it happen or

254
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,472
maybe it would have happened on its own,

255
00:12:55,472 --> 00:13:10,753
but they made full citizens out of free people of color.

256
00:13:10,753 --> 00:13:11,704
And they probably did that--

257
00:13:11,704 --> 00:13:14,199
you could view it kind of in a positive or a negative spin.

258
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:15,720
The positive spin was

259
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,608
this is consistent with the ideas

260
00:13:17,608 --> 00:13:20,521
of the Enlightenment and the Revolution.

261
00:13:20,521 --> 00:13:23,888
Or if you want to kind of view a more strategizing view on it,

262
00:13:23,888 --> 00:13:24,888
they probably said, hey,

263
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:27,171
there's all this craziness going on in Haiti,

264
00:13:27,171 --> 00:13:31,388
if we can at least get these people on our side,

265
00:13:31,388 --> 00:13:32,779
we might be able to

266
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:36,370
properly suppress these people over here.

267
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,170
And let's be clear.

268
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:40,420
Many of these mixed-race freemen of color,

269
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,638
they owned slaves themselves.

270
00:13:42,638 --> 00:13:44,222
So from their own self-interest,

271
00:13:44,222 --> 00:13:46,288
they were actually very similar to the white colonialists

272
00:13:46,288 --> 00:13:48,822
in Saint-Domingue at that time.

273
00:13:48,822 --> 00:13:52,321
If they were a little bit more strategic about it,

274
00:13:52,321 --> 00:13:53,941
it might have been just to kind of

275
00:13:53,941 --> 00:13:56,288
consolidate the power on the free people on the island,

276
00:13:56,288 --> 00:13:57,654
or the landowners on the island.

277
00:13:57,654 --> 00:14:03,100
But they sent that message with Sonthonax and 6,000 to 7,000 troops

278
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,188
to get things back in order.

279
00:14:05,188 --> 00:14:07,624
But you might remember-- and even that--

280
00:14:07,624 --> 00:14:13,522
this made many people very unhappy, even on the island.

281
00:14:13,522 --> 00:14:16,854
As some of those white colonialists at that time,

282
00:14:16,854 --> 00:14:19,038
they weren't the most liberal thinking people

283
00:14:19,038 --> 00:14:20,471
and they probably didn't appreciate this idea of

284
00:14:20,471 --> 00:14:24,472
freemen of color being able to have all of the same rights as they did.

285
00:14:24,472 --> 00:14:30,440
So there was obviously a lot of antagonism against this guy,

286
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,930
against Sonthonax right there.

287
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:36,489
And then you might remember that in February 1793--

288
00:14:36,489 --> 00:14:39,754
we saw that in the previous video, or in several videos ago--

289
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:53,837
February 1793, you start having war with Great Britain.

290
00:14:53,837 --> 00:14:56,846
And Great Britain had control of this, right here.

291
00:14:56,846 --> 00:15:01,878
That is Jamaica.

292
00:15:01,878 --> 00:15:11,341
Just to be clear, in green right here, this is Saint-Domingue.

293
00:15:11,341 --> 00:15:13,988
And right here, this is Santo Domingo,

294
00:15:13,988 --> 00:15:17,283
controlled by the Spanish.

295
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:18,165
So you had a big problem.

296
00:15:18,165 --> 00:15:19,933
Here he is, Sonthonax right there.

297
00:15:19,933 --> 00:15:22,048
He's antagonized some of the whites,

298
00:15:22,048 --> 00:15:24,736
he's trying to put down a slave rebellion,

299
00:15:24,736 --> 00:15:26,787
or at least get things back to normal.

300
00:15:26,787 --> 00:15:28,984
And then all of a sudden you have the British over here,

301
00:15:28,984 --> 00:15:31,624
and you have a lot of these white colonialists

302
00:15:31,624 --> 00:15:34,669
that start saying, hey, if France is going to be like that,

303
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:38,170
we're going to side with the British.

304
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:38,980
We're going to side with the British

305
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,381
or we're going to get help from the British

306
00:15:40,381 --> 00:15:42,381
and we're going to use that help from the British

307
00:15:42,381 --> 00:15:48,735
to essentially get our way back in Saint-Domingue.

308
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,533
Now Sonthonax, as far as I can tell,

309
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,685
he was of a more liberal persuasion in that

310
00:15:54,685 --> 00:15:56,582
he was sympathetic to the plight

311
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:58,650
definitely of people of mixed-race,

312
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:03,253
and even to the plight possibly of slaves themselves.

313
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,836
But also, for strategic reasons,

314
00:16:04,836 --> 00:16:06,432
he saw the writing on the wall as well.

315
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:09,758
He said, gee, I have 500,000 slaves

316
00:16:09,758 --> 00:16:12,750
and we need to fend off the British.

317
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:16,605
So this is a pretty bold action.

318
00:16:16,605 --> 00:16:18,605
In the history of slavery,

319
00:16:18,605 --> 00:16:22,690
this is actually one of the most significant declarations.

320
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:28,817
In 1793, in August of 1793--

321
00:16:28,817 --> 00:16:31,124
it might be a reflection of his own ideas,

322
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:35,550
or it might have just been because of the threat from Britain

323
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:49,390
Sonthonax declares freedom for all the slaves.

324
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,558
He wasn't saying that they would have all of the same rights

325
00:16:51,558 --> 00:16:53,357
as land owning man,

326
00:16:53,357 --> 00:16:56,724
but he's essentially abolishing slavery.

327
00:16:56,724 --> 00:17:01,759
Initially, he did it just in the North,

328
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,225
but in September and October,

329
00:17:04,225 --> 00:17:05,555
he eventually extended it to

330
00:17:05,555 --> 00:17:10,008
all of the French possessions in Saint-Domingue

331
00:17:10,008 --> 00:17:10,750
Now you could imagine

332
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,839
the slaves that were revolting this entire time,

333
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,126
they're a little bit suspicious of this gentleman.

334
00:17:16,126 --> 00:17:20,140
He was, it looks like, sent to Saint-Domingue,

335
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,774
or what is now Haiti, to put down the uprising.

336
00:17:23,774 --> 00:17:26,774
He shows up with 6,000 or 7,000 troops.

337
00:17:26,774 --> 00:17:31,672
He tries to side with essentially the enemies of the slaves

338
00:17:31,672 --> 00:17:33,023
to put down the uprising.

339
00:17:33,023 --> 00:17:34,423
And now all of a sudden,

340
00:17:34,423 --> 00:17:36,356
when the British look like a bit of a threat,

341
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:40,622
he's like, hey, I'm ending slavery by myself.

342
00:17:40,622 --> 00:17:42,423
I am just declaring slavery to be over.

343
00:17:42,423 --> 00:17:45,390
And they've been tricked before and they're saying,

344
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,873
this is probably some type of a trick,

345
00:17:46,873 --> 00:17:50,083
just to make us become a little passive

346
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,672
so that they can get back at us.

347
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:56,542
And so their leaders were a little bit suspicious of it,

348
00:17:56,542 --> 00:18:05,561
but then in February of 1794, this was ratified.

349
00:18:05,561 --> 00:18:09,174
His declaration was ratified

350
00:18:09,174 --> 00:18:21,675
by the French National Convention.

351
00:18:21,675 --> 00:18:25,976
And by the time word got to the freed slaves,

352
00:18:25,976 --> 00:18:28,542
or the rebelling slaves on the island--

353
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:35,720
so we're now in May, 1794-- the rebel slaves' leader--

354
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,204
and this is a super important name to know --

355
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:50,281
Toussaint L'Ouverture

356
00:18:50,281 --> 00:18:57,907
he was the leader of the rebels,

357
00:18:57,907 --> 00:19:00,999
and he was a self-educated former slave himself

358
00:19:00,999 --> 00:19:03,405
And actually he proves himself over and over again

359
00:19:03,405 --> 00:19:06,940
to be one of the best military generals

360
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,221
and actually in much of history.

361
00:19:10,221 --> 00:19:13,915
In May 1794, Toussaint L'Ouverture--

362
00:19:13,915 --> 00:19:22,736
I'll write his name twice --

363
00:19:22,736 --> 00:19:26,262
decides to essentially join sides with the French Republic

364
00:19:26,262 --> 00:19:38,790
join sides with Sonthonax.

365
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,823
Now once again, let's look at the numbers.

366
00:19:40,823 --> 00:19:42,501
You have Toussaint L'Ouverture.

367
00:19:42,501 --> 00:19:44,034
He is essentially the leader

368
00:19:44,034 --> 00:19:48,999
of these 500,000 newly freed slaves.

369
00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:54,579
This is essentially the military of the island.

370
00:19:54,579 --> 00:19:58,034
He is now the leader of the island.

371
00:19:58,034 --> 00:20:01,947
So now he is essentially, you could almost view him

372
00:20:01,947 --> 00:20:07,940
as the general or the governor of the island, of this colony.

373
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:15,080
Despite the fact that he had very good leadership qualities,

374
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:20,933
he also had a bit of a megalomaniacal side for himself.

375
00:20:20,933 --> 00:20:30,225
And so he actually declared himself governor for life.

376
00:20:30,225 --> 00:20:33,969
In 1801, he issues a constitution

377
00:20:33,969 --> 00:20:46,775
that declares himself governor for life.

378
00:20:46,775 --> 00:20:48,059
And in his defense,

379
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:51,068
this wasn't that unusual for this time in the world.

380
00:20:51,068 --> 00:20:52,383
I mean, you look across the Atlantic,

381
00:20:52,383 --> 00:20:53,742
look with Napoleon's doing.

382
00:20:53,742 --> 00:20:55,894
He takes over the French Republic,

383
00:20:55,894 --> 00:20:58,147
he essentially is declaring himself emperor

384
00:20:58,147 --> 00:20:59,891
and what not for life.

385
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:02,460
And this guy says, hey, I have the same right to do it.

386
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,058
I've led these people to essentially their freedom.

387
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:06,839
They trust me.

388
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:08,931
I'll declare myself governor for life.

389
00:21:08,931 --> 00:21:10,449
And also in his defense--

390
00:21:10,449 --> 00:21:14,457
and this also speaks to him being a step ahead

391
00:21:14,457 --> 00:21:16,526
of many of the rulers at this time--

392
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:19,734
is that he didn't have just plain old slash and burn tactics.

393
00:21:19,734 --> 00:21:21,977
He actually did enforce a lot of disciplines

394
00:21:21,977 --> 00:21:22,938
amongst his troops.

395
00:21:22,938 --> 00:21:26,980
And we'll see one of his right-hand men, Dessalines--

396
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,217
I know I'm pronouncing it wrong--

397
00:21:28,217 --> 00:21:31,976
he was much more savage with the people

398
00:21:31,976 --> 00:21:33,977
that he was fighting against.

399
00:21:33,977 --> 00:21:39,177
But Toussaint L'Ouverture was very disciplined,

400
00:21:39,177 --> 00:21:41,147
and when he came to power,

401
00:21:41,147 --> 00:21:43,706
he actually did not try to get revenge

402
00:21:43,706 --> 00:21:46,897
on the mixed-race or on the white plantation owners.

403
00:21:46,897 --> 00:21:48,261
He realized that, hey, you know what?

404
00:21:48,261 --> 00:21:49,940
We are a new people

405
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,906
in charge of what is essentially a new country --

406
00:21:52,906 --> 00:21:54,590
or in his mind it's a new country--

407
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,755
but let's not try to rock too many boats.

408
00:21:56,755 --> 00:21:58,356
Let's try to kind of keep our society

409
00:21:58,356 --> 00:22:00,159
going in some reasonable way,

410
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,135
so that we don't just ruin ourselves into oblivion.

411
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:06,339
And he also did not declare independence from France.

412
00:22:06,339 --> 00:22:07,143
So that's an important point too.

413
00:22:07,143 --> 00:22:12,189
He didn't want to completely disjoint themselves from France,

414
00:22:12,189 --> 00:22:16,422
so no independence.

415
00:22:16,422 --> 00:22:17,379
He was just happy

416
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:18,909
essentially being part of the French empire,

417
00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:22,179
but he himself will be the governor.

418
00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:24,675
You could imagine on two levels,

419
00:22:24,675 --> 00:22:27,551
Napoleon was not happy.

420
00:22:27,551 --> 00:22:30,749
We remember, in 1799, and especially 1800,

421
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:33,777
Napoleon comes to power, calls himself the First Council.

422
00:22:33,777 --> 00:22:40,507
Napoleon not happy

423
00:22:40,507 --> 00:22:44,198
And he's not happy on essentially two grounds.

424
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:47,462
One, there's this upstart here

425
00:22:47,462 --> 00:22:53,390
declaring himself governor for life of this island.

426
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,979
No one can do that but Napoleon.

427
00:22:54,979 --> 00:22:56,835
The other problem that Napoleon had is,

428
00:22:56,835 --> 00:23:01,300
all of a sudden, once you lose 500,000 slaves

429
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,353
and they are now freemen,

430
00:23:02,353 --> 00:23:06,873
and you now have to pay them maybe slightly better wages

431
00:23:06,873 --> 00:23:08,769
instead of just making them do what you want

432
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:10,473
and just extracting all the profits,

433
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:15,623
the island, the colony becomes much, much less profitable.

434
00:23:15,623 --> 00:23:16,651
So in the back of his mind,

435
00:23:16,651 --> 00:23:18,460
he also wanted to reinstate slavery.

436
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:22,327
and you'll see that he does it explicitly later on.

437
00:23:22,327 --> 00:23:29,701
so doesn't like slave freedom

438
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:31,586
So he sends his brother-in-law.

439
00:23:31,586 --> 00:23:33,357
You need a dirty job to do,

440
00:23:33,357 --> 00:23:34,995
you got to send someone you trust.

441
00:23:34,995 --> 00:23:43,232
He sends his brother-in-law Charles Leclerc

442
00:23:43,232 --> 00:23:46,893
with 40,000 troops

443
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:50,658
so Napoleon is definitely taking the situation seriously

444
00:23:50,658 --> 00:23:52,318
-- with 40,000 troops

445
00:23:52,318 --> 00:23:55,209
to essentially take back the island

446
00:23:55,209 --> 00:23:56,883
from Toussaint L'Ouverture.

447
00:23:56,883 --> 00:23:59,077
And so you imagine there's this huge battle

448
00:23:59,077 --> 00:24:02,722
that goes on on the island of Saint-Domingue,

449
00:24:02,722 --> 00:24:04,129
or the western half of the island,

450
00:24:04,129 --> 00:24:06,055
or the part that's controlled by the French.

451
00:24:06,055 --> 00:24:10,573
And eventually, they start to get the upper advantage.

452
00:24:10,573 --> 00:24:13,075
It doesn't help, the fact that Toussaint L'Ouverture's--

453
00:24:13,075 --> 00:24:16,599
some of his closest generals or his closest aides,

454
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:18,624
when they kind of see the writing on the wall,

455
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:19,815
when they see that this guy--

456
00:24:19,815 --> 00:24:20,676
in the next video, I'll talk about

457
00:24:20,676 --> 00:24:24,383
how barbaric some of the things this guy did was.

458
00:24:24,383 --> 00:24:28,047
But once some of Toussaint L'Ouverture's generals

459
00:24:28,047 --> 00:24:29,407
started to see the writing on the wall,

460
00:24:29,407 --> 00:24:31,674
they actually turned on him.

461
00:24:31,674 --> 00:24:33,392
And one of them was--

462
00:24:33,392 --> 00:24:35,292
he actually ends up completing the revoluation,

463
00:24:35,292 --> 00:24:37,960
but while he was fighting for Toussaint L'Ouverture

464
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:49,231
-- this is Jean-Jacques Dessalines--

465
00:24:49,231 --> 00:24:50,188
him and some of the other

466
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:52,318
right-hand men to Toussaint L'Ouverture

467
00:24:52,318 --> 00:24:54,435
he actually joins the side of Leclerc.

468
00:24:54,435 --> 00:24:58,089
Leclerc is kind of making it look like

469
00:24:58,089 --> 00:25:00,075
he's not trying to reinstate slavery,

470
00:25:00,075 --> 00:25:02,172
he's not trying to take citizenship away

471
00:25:02,172 --> 00:25:04,460
from people of African descent.

472
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,235
He makes it look like

473
00:25:05,235 --> 00:25:10,353
he's only trying to take L'Ouverture off of his high horse.

474
00:25:10,353 --> 00:25:11,137
So this guy says, OK, fine,

475
00:25:11,137 --> 00:25:16,702
for the betterment of Saint-Domingue, I'm with you.

476
00:25:16,702 --> 00:25:19,799
And at that point, Toussaint L'Ouverture is essentially

477
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:22,359
in a very tough situation.

478
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:24,901
So Leclerc says, hey, Toussaint,

479
00:25:24,901 --> 00:25:27,523
let's have some negotiations

480
00:25:27,523 --> 00:25:30,841
and maybe we can figure out some way for you

481
00:25:30,841 --> 00:25:33,152
to assimilate you and the people you're leading

482
00:25:33,152 --> 00:25:36,910
into essentially Napoleon's

483
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,038
-- what is now turning into Napoleon's empire.

484
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,450
So Toussaint L'Ouverture--

485
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:42,939
being a kind of upstanding individual

486
00:25:42,939 --> 00:25:45,331
who trusts people and a man of honor-- he says,

487
00:25:45,331 --> 00:25:49,489
oh, this Charles Leclerc must be a man of honor as well.

488
00:25:49,489 --> 00:25:53,650
So he meets with him to discuss the terms of assimilation.

489
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,569
Well, it turns out Charles Leclerc

490
00:25:55,569 --> 00:25:57,261
was not a man of honor.

491
00:25:57,261 --> 00:26:01,390
Maybe I could draw some devil horns on him right there.

492
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,078
And he, when Toussaint L'Ouverture

493
00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:07,186
shows up by himself for a very civilized meeting,

494
00:26:07,186 --> 00:26:11,133
he gets some people to arrest him, capture him,

495
00:26:11,133 --> 00:26:13,290
and then send him on a boat to France,

496
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,926
and essentially Toussaint L'Ouverture,

497
00:26:14,926 --> 00:26:23,256
he dies in France in a prison.

498
00:26:23,256 --> 00:26:24,977
So I'm going to leave this video here.

499
00:26:24,977 --> 00:26:26,444
It's kind of a very sad moment.

500
00:26:26,444 --> 00:26:29,563
You have freedom for the slaves temporarily,

501
00:26:29,563 --> 00:26:33,449
you have this major historic figure Toussaint L'Ouverture

502
00:26:33,449 --> 00:26:35,533
leading the slaves

503
00:26:35,533 --> 00:26:38,371
and trying to establish a new government.

504
00:26:38,371 --> 00:26:41,489
But then it gets violently suppressed

505
00:26:41,489 --> 00:26:43,625
by Napoleon's henchman,

506
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:44,736
by Charles Leclerc, his brother-in-law.

507
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:45,724
And I'm going to finish this video

508
00:26:45,724 --> 00:26:49,477
just with a quote from Toussaint L'Ouverture

509
00:26:49,477 --> 00:26:51,434
because it kind of foreshadows

510
00:26:51,434 --> 00:26:53,388
what's going to happen in the next video.

511
00:26:53,388 --> 00:26:54,695
So this is actually something

512
00:26:54,695 --> 00:26:58,442
that he said on the boat to France after being captured.

513
00:26:58,442 --> 00:27:02,624
Let me make the whole quote here.

514
00:27:02,624 --> 00:27:05,562
"In overthrowing me, you have cut down in Saint-Domingue

515
00:27:05,562 --> 00:27:08,271
only the trunk of the tree of liberty.

516
00:27:08,271 --> 00:27:10,508
It will spring up again from the roots,

517
00:27:10,508 --> 00:27:14,667
for they are many and they are deep."
