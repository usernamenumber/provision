00:00:00,506 --> 00:00:09,049
We are asked to approximate the principal root or the the positive square root of 45 to the hundreths place

2
00:00:09,141 --> 00:00:12,969
and i'm assuming they don't want us to use a calculator cos that would be too easy

3
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:13,570
so lets see if we can approximate this

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,234
just with our pen and paper right over here.

5
00:00:15,234 --> 00:00:19,404
so square root of 45 or the principal root of 45

6
00:00:22,003 --> 00:00:28,419
45 is not a perfect square,it is definitely not a perfect square

7
00:00:30,526 --> 00:00:39,677
let's see what are the perfect squares around it.We know that it is going to be less than the next perfect square above 45.

8
00:00:39,677 --> 00:00:43,340
lets see it's gonna be 49 cos that is 7 times 7.so it's less than the square root of 49

9
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:53,602
and it's greater than the square root of 36,and so the square root of 36 or the principal root of 36 i should say is 6 and the

10
00:00:53,602 --> 00:01:05,954
principal root of 49 is 7.so this value right over here is going to be between 6 and 7

11
00:01:05,954 --> 00:01:20,508
and if we look at it it's only 4 away from 49 and it's 9 away from 36.so looks like the difference between 36 and 49 is 13

12
00:01:20,508 --> 00:01:27,879
so it is a total 13 gap between the 6 squared and the 7 squared.and this is 9 of the way through it

13
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:33,843
so just as a kind of approximation maybe and it may not work out perfectly because we are squaring it.

14
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:43,770
this isn't a linear relationship but it is going to be closer to 7 than it's going to be to 6 and at least the square or the 45 is 9/13ths of the away

15
00:01:43,770 --> 00:02:00,529
so we could try it looks about two thirds of the way so lets try 6.7 as a guess.just based on point 7 it's about 2/3 it looks about the same

16
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,153
and actually we could calculate this right here if we want.

17
00:02:03,153 --> 00:02:13,634
so 9/13ths as a decimal is going to be what?it's going to be 13 into 9 we have to some decimal places over here

18
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:23,500
13 doesn't go into 9 but it does go into 90 .lets see does it go into it 7 times.it goes into it 6 times

19
00:02:37,972 --> 00:02:39,726
this value is almost 0.7

20
00:02:59,307 --> 00:03:01,648
so you get it's about .69

21
00:03:01,695 --> 00:03:10,044
so 6.7 would be a pretty good guess.this is .69 of the way between 36 and 49

22
00:03:10,044 --> 00:03:14,421
so lets go roughly .69 of the way between 6 and 7

23
00:03:14,421 --> 00:03:21,251
so this once again is just to approximate it is not necessarily going to give us the exact answer we have to use that as a good initial guess

24
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:28,236
and then see how well it works.so lets try 6.7

25
00:03:28,236 --> 00:03:30,100
and the real way to try is to square 6.7

26
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:40,221
so 6.7 times 6.7

27
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:43,419
so we have 7 times 7 is 49

28
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:48,219
7 times 6 is 42 plus 4 is 46

29
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:54,039
put a zero now we have now moved up a space to the left

30
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:58,945
so we now have 6 times 7 is 42

31
00:03:58,945 --> 00:04:00,367
carry the 4

32
00:04:00,367 --> 00:04:03,301
6 times 6 is 36 plus 4 is 40

33
00:04:03,301 --> 00:04:05,567
so 9 plus 0 is nine

34
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:07,033
6 plus 2 is eight

35
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:10,960
4 plus 0 is four and we have a four right over here

36
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,968
and we have 2 total numbers behind the decimal point

37
00:04:12,968 --> 00:04:14,368
1,2

38
00:04:14,368 --> 00:04:17,036
so this gives us 44.89

39
00:04:17,036 --> 00:04:22,242
so 6.7 gets us pretty close but we are still not probably right to the hundred.

40
00:04:24,257 --> 00:04:26,833
we've only gone 10's place right over here

41
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:39,701
so if we want to get to 45 this 6.7 squared is still less than 45 or 6.7 is still less than the square root of 45

42
00:04:39,701 --> 00:04:53,013
so lets try 6.71 and increase it a little bit see if we can get from 44.89 to 45

43
00:04:53,013 --> 00:04:54,386
cos this is really close already

44
00:04:56,616 --> 00:04:57,901
lets just try it out 6.71

45
00:04:57,901 --> 00:05:02,170
so once again we have to do some arithmetic by hand

46
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,366
we are assuming they don't want us to use a calculator here

47
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,500
we have 4 numbers behind the decimal point

48
00:06:10,807 --> 00:06:12,967
so when we squared 6.71

49
00:06:12,967 --> 00:06:19,569
6.71 squared = 45.0241

50
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:22,940
so 6.71 is a little bit greater

51
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,568
let me make it clear now

52
00:06:24,568 --> 00:06:34,636
we know that 6.7 is less than the square root of 45 and we know that is less than 6.71

53
00:06:34,636 --> 00:06:38,295
cos when we square this we get something a little bit over the square root of 45

54
00:06:38,295 --> 00:06:42,068
but the key here is when we square this

55
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:56,101
so 6.7 squared got us 44.89 which is a 11 hundreths away from 45

56
00:06:56,101 --> 00:07:06,100
and then if we look at 6.71 squared we're only 2.4hundreths above 45 so this right here is closer to the square root of 45

57
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,100
so if we approximate to the hundreths place definitely wanna go with 6.71
