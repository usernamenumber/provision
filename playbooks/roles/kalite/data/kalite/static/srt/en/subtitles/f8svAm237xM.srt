1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:04,950
Several videos ago I very quickly went through why Side-Side-Angle

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:10,083
is not--why it is not--a valid postulate and what I want to do in this video

3
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:13,816
is explore it a little bit more and its not called angle side side for obvious

4
00:00:13,816 --> 00:00:17,633
reasons because then the acronym would make people giggle in Geometry

5
00:00:17,633 --> 00:00:22,099
class, and I guess we don't want people giggling while doing Mathematics.

6
00:00:22,099 --> 00:00:25,824
So let's just think about a triangle here.

7
00:00:25,824 --> 00:00:30,216
So let's say I have a triangle. Let me draw it. Let's say I have a triangle

8
00:00:30,216 --> 00:00:31,634
that looks something like this.

9
00:00:31,634 --> 00:00:33,899
If I have a triangle that looks something

10
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,932
(I have trouble drawing straight triangles)

11
00:00:35,932 --> 00:00:39,566
So let's say the triangle looks something like that.

12
00:00:39,566 --> 00:00:44,349
It looks like that. And let's say that we found another triangle,

13
00:00:44,349 --> 00:00:47,768
we found another triangle that has a congruent side.

14
00:00:47,768 --> 00:00:51,553
A side that is congruent to this side over here.

15
00:00:51,553 --> 00:00:56,147
That is-- I guess any side on a triangle is next to the other two sides.

16
00:00:56,647 --> 00:01:00,803
Next to that is a side that is congruent to this side right over here,

17
00:01:00,803 --> 00:01:05,762
and then that side is one of the sides of an angle.

18
00:01:05,762 --> 00:01:08,995
So it forms one of the parts of an angle right over here.

19
00:01:08,995 --> 00:01:11,310
That other triangle has a congruent angle right over here.

20
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,271
So this is the angle that that first side is not a part of.

21
00:01:15,302 --> 00:01:18,287
Only the second side is part of this angle.

22
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:22,432
So this is side-side-angle, or you could call it the angle-side-side

23
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,543
and then giggle a little about it.

24
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:28,679
Now, how do we know this doesn't buy itself show this is congruent?

25
00:01:28,679 --> 00:01:32,018
Well, we would have to show that this could actually imply two different triangles.

26
00:01:32,018 --> 00:01:34,074
And to think about that, let's say

27
00:01:34,074 --> 00:01:36,034
we know that the angle,

28
00:01:36,034 --> 00:01:38,974
we know this other triangle has the same yellow angle there.

29
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:41,214
Which means that the blue side,

30
00:01:41,214 --> 00:01:44,238
the blue side has to look something like that.

31
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:46,316
It's going to have to look something like that.

32
00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:49,467
Just the way we drew it over here. This side down here--

33
00:01:49,467 --> 00:01:52,466
I'll make it a green side--this green side down here

34
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:53,783
we know nothing about.

35
00:01:53,783 --> 00:01:55,981
We never said that this is congruent to anything.

36
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:57,329
If we knew, then we could use side-side-side.

37
00:01:57,329 --> 00:01:59,640
We only know this side is congruent, this side is congruent,

38
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,279
and this angle is congruent.

39
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:03,603
So this green side (I'll draw it as a dotted line),

40
00:02:03,603 --> 00:02:07,027
it could be of any length. We don't know what the length is

41
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:08,862
of that green side.

42
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:11,839
Now we have this magenta side, and we have another side

43
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:13,658
that is congruent here.

44
00:02:13,658 --> 00:02:15,082
So this thing could pivot over here.

45
00:02:15,082 --> 00:02:17,795
We know nothing about this angle so it could form any angle

46
00:02:17,795 --> 00:02:19,993
but it does have to get to this other side.

47
00:02:19,993 --> 00:02:22,445
So one possibility is that maybe the triangles are congruent.

48
00:02:22,445 --> 00:02:25,666
So maybe this side does go down just like that.

49
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:28,273
In which case, we actually would have congruent triangles.

50
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,682
But the kind of "A hah!" moment here, or the reason

51
00:02:30,682 --> 00:02:33,384
why SSA isn't possible is that this side could also

52
00:02:33,384 --> 00:02:35,233
come down like this.

53
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:37,631
It could also come down like this.

54
00:02:37,631 --> 00:02:40,199
There are two ways to get down to this base that

55
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:42,233
you want to call that way. It could come down that way

56
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:46,182
or it could kind of come in this way. And so that is why

57
00:02:46,182 --> 00:02:51,267
SSA, by itself with no other information, is ambiguous.

58
00:02:51,267 --> 00:02:53,481
It does not give you enough information;

59
00:02:53,481 --> 00:02:55,284
It does not give you enough information to say that

60
00:02:55,284 --> 00:02:57,949
those triangles are definitely the same.

61
00:02:57,949 --> 00:03:00,167
Now, there are special cases.

62
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:04,502
So in this situation right over here, our angle, the angle in our

63
00:03:04,502 --> 00:03:09,622
SSA, the angle was acute. This is an acute angle right over here.

64
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,450
This is an acute angle right over here.

65
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,586
And when you have an acute angle as one of the side of

66
00:03:13,586 --> 00:03:17,655
your triangle. The other sides could still have an obtuse angle.

67
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:20,281
Remember, acute means less than 90ยบ and obtuse means

68
00:03:20,281 --> 00:03:22,183
greater than 90ยบ.

69
00:03:22,183 --> 00:03:23,989
So you could still have an obtuse angle, and

70
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:26,088
so that is why this is an option.

71
00:03:26,088 --> 00:03:28,870
So one option is you have two other acute angles,

72
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,866
so this is also-- it could be acute, this is also acute.

73
00:03:31,866 --> 00:03:34,016
Also acute, also acute. But then you have the option

74
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,683
where this is even more acute, even narrower, and this becomes

75
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:39,033
an obtuse angle.

76
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:41,865
So that is an obtuse angle, and that is only possible

77
00:03:41,865 --> 00:03:44,333
--you can't have two two obtuse angles in the same triangle.

78
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,733
You can't have two things that have larger than 90ยบ measure

79
00:03:47,733 --> 00:03:49,782
in the same triangle.

80
00:03:49,782 --> 00:03:53,650
And so that is why, there is a possibility where if you have

81
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,749
another triangle that looks like this.

82
00:03:56,749 --> 00:03:59,565
If you have another triangle that looks like this, then

83
00:03:59,565 --> 00:04:01,574
And if I were to tell you, and if I were to tell you

84
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:05,329
very clearly that this angle is obtuse,

85
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:08,466
and if I were to tell you this angle right over here is obtuse.

86
00:04:08,466 --> 00:04:10,932
And that is the A in the SSA

87
00:04:10,932 --> 00:04:13,166
So you have the angle and I'm going to say I have

88
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:16,383
another triangle, where this angle is congruent to that

89
00:04:16,383 --> 00:04:18,917
other triangle, some angle in that other triangle.

90
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:21,382
And then one of the sides adjacent to it is congruent.

91
00:04:21,382 --> 00:04:25,364
And then the next side over is also congruent.

92
00:04:25,364 --> 00:04:27,388
Then, it's not so ambiguous.

93
00:04:27,388 --> 00:04:29,548
Because we can try to draw that.

94
00:04:29,548 --> 00:04:33,066
So let's draw that same, congruent obtuse angle. Let's draw--

95
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:36,198
We know nothing about this side down here,

96
00:04:36,198 --> 00:04:38,281
because we haven't said that that is necessarily congruent.

97
00:04:38,281 --> 00:04:41,766
So that could be of any length.

98
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:44,699
We do know that this triangle is going to have the same

99
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,816
same length for this side.

100
00:04:47,816 --> 00:04:52,865
above the angle, so it looks like this--looks like this.

101
00:04:52,865 --> 00:04:55,016
And then we know that this side -- Let me do that in

102
00:04:55,016 --> 00:04:57,883
I'll do it in orange. We know that this side is

103
00:04:57,883 --> 00:05:01,366
also going to be the same length. And we haven't told you anything

104
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:03,132
about this angle over here.

105
00:05:03,132 --> 00:05:06,000
So this side could pivot over here.

106
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,631
We could kind of rotate it over here.

107
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:10,002
But there is only one way now that this orange side

108
00:05:10,002 --> 00:05:12,115
can reach that green side.

109
00:05:12,115 --> 00:05:15,017
Now the only way is this way over here.

110
00:05:15,017 --> 00:05:17,566
And we were more constrained, or this case isn't ambiguous

111
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:19,948
because we used up our obtuse angle here.

112
00:05:19,948 --> 00:05:21,898
The A here is an obtuse one.

113
00:05:21,898 --> 00:05:25,832
And so then, it constrains what the triangle can become.

114
00:05:25,832 --> 00:05:27,383
So I don't want to make you say,

115
00:05:27,383 --> 00:05:30,699
"Oh, maybe, SSA in general" --if SSA, you do not--

116
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:33,832
do not want to use it as a postulate.

117
00:05:33,832 --> 00:05:36,317
I just wanted to make it clear that there is this special case

118
00:05:36,317 --> 00:05:39,602
where if you know the A in the SSA is obtuse, then it becomes

119
00:05:39,602 --> 00:05:42,085
a little bit less ambiguous.

120
00:05:42,085 --> 00:05:43,935
And so finally there is a circumstance where

121
00:05:43,935 --> 00:05:46,252
this is an acute angle where it would be ambiguous.

122
00:05:46,252 --> 00:05:48,568
You have the obtuse angle and something in between,

123
00:05:48,568 --> 00:05:50,804
which is the right angle, where you have

124
00:05:50,804 --> 00:05:53,734
the A in SSA is a right angle.

125
00:05:53,734 --> 00:05:58,466
So, if you had it like this. If you have a right angle,

126
00:05:58,466 --> 00:06:01,502
and you have some base of unknown length,

127
00:06:01,502 --> 00:06:05,702
but you fix this length, right over here.

128
00:06:05,702 --> 00:06:08,385
If you know that this is fixed because you are saying it is

129
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:10,067
congruent to some other triangle.

130
00:06:10,067 --> 00:06:12,635
And if you know that the next length is fixed, and

131
00:06:12,635 --> 00:06:14,902
if you think about it this next side is going to be

132
00:06:14,902 --> 00:06:17,004
the side opposite the right angle -- It is going to have

133
00:06:17,004 --> 00:06:18,932
to be the hypotenuse of the right angle --

134
00:06:18,932 --> 00:06:21,282
then you know that the only way you can construct this,

135
00:06:21,282 --> 00:06:24,385
and similar to the obtuse case is if -- and if you know

136
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:26,866
the length of this then the only way you could do it,

137
00:06:26,866 --> 00:06:28,432
is to bring it down over here.

138
00:06:28,432 --> 00:06:30,616
So that actually does lead to another postulate called the

139
00:06:30,616 --> 00:06:36,917
right, called the Right Angle Side Hypotenuse postulate.

140
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:41,731
Which is really just a special case of SSA where the angle is.

141
00:06:41,731 --> 00:06:45,149
where the angle is actually a right angle

142
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:47,582
and here they wrote first. You can view this as

143
00:06:47,582 --> 00:06:50,148
Angle Side Side and they're able to do it because

144
00:06:50,148 --> 00:06:52,548
now they can write Right Angle, so it doesn't form that embarassing

145
00:06:52,548 --> 00:06:56,983
acronym. And this can also be a little bit common sense

146
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,749
because if you know two sides of a right triangle,

147
00:06:59,749 --> 00:07:01,348
and we haven't gone into depth with this

148
00:07:01,348 --> 00:07:02,316
in the geometry playlist,

149
00:07:02,316 --> 00:07:04,417
but you might already be familiar with it.

150
00:07:04,417 --> 00:07:08,083
By pythagorean theorem, you can just figure out the third side.

151
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,532
So if you have this information about any triangle,

152
00:07:10,532 --> 00:07:13,132
you can always figure out the third side, and then you

153
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:14,982
can use Side Side Side.

154
00:07:14,982 --> 00:07:17,349
So I just want to show you this special case, but in general,

155
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:21,183
the important thing is that you can't just use SSA

156
00:07:21,183 --> 99:59:59,999
unless you have more information.
