1
00:00:00,361 --> 00:00:04,503
In the last video I just discussed
a personal balance sheet

2
00:00:04,503 --> 00:00:07,399
and what illiquidity or
what insolvency means.

3
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:09,914
And if you understood that,
I think we're now ready to tackle

4
00:00:09,914 --> 00:00:12,331
what a balance sheet 
of some of these

5
00:00:12,331 --> 00:00:14,981
potentially troubled banks 
might look like.

6
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:16,862
And I'm not going to, 
you know, go into the details,

7
00:00:16,862 --> 00:00:20,697
but I'm going to give you the big picture 
and I think that's essentially what matters.

8
00:00:20,697 --> 00:00:23,269
So essentially, these banks
have a bunch of assets.

9
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:26,662
And I'm going to talk about
banks very generally right now

10
00:00:26,662 --> 00:00:27,952
both commercial and
investment banks.

11
00:00:27,952 --> 00:00:30,123
In a future video I'll tell you
the difference between the two

12
00:00:30,123 --> 00:00:33,180
and what regulation means and 
what leverage means and all that.

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,097
Maybe I'll touch on that
in this video.

14
00:00:35,097 --> 00:00:38,175
But let's just kind of think about 
a generic balance sheet for a bank.

15
00:00:38,175 --> 00:00:39,951
So its assets.

16
00:00:40,136 --> 00:00:41,813
So assets.

17
00:00:43,782 --> 00:00:46,931
So, I don't know, I'm just going to make
up some things.

18
00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:56,349
Let's say that it has, I don't know, 
$1 billion -- $1 billion in government bonds,

19
00:00:56,349 --> 00:00:57,911
U.S. government bonds.

20
00:00:57,911 --> 00:01:00,193
I'm just throwing that in there
just as filler just to show you that

21
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:03,581
there could be a lot of 
different types of assets in there.

22
00:01:03,581 --> 00:01:10,544
Let's say that it has another, I don't know,
$10 billion in AAA corporate bonds.

23
00:01:10,544 --> 00:01:19,632
So you know these -- these are loans to really 
solvent or very creditworthy companies.

24
00:01:19,632 --> 00:01:21,469
So AAA corporate bonds.

25
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:24,571
Companies that have really
good cash flow.

26
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:30,103
There's very little chance of them 
defaulting on their loans.

27
00:01:30,103 --> 00:01:31,049
And what is a bond?

28
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,401
Well, a bond is just a loan
to another entity, right?

29
00:01:33,401 --> 00:01:38,757
If you loan me money, I could
give you an IOU, right?

30
00:01:38,757 --> 00:01:41,658
saying that Sal owes you whatever, $10.

31
00:01:41,658 --> 00:01:44,429
And that IOU, you could
call that a Sal bond.

32
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:47,954
So $1 billion of government
bonds, that's an asset that says

33
00:01:47,954 --> 00:01:49,939
the government owes
me a billion dollars.

34
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:52,169
And in the meantime, it's going
to pay me interest.

35
00:01:52,169 --> 00:01:55,687
Similarly, corporate bonds,
that's saying that these corporations,

36
00:01:55,687 --> 00:01:58,401
whoever these bonds are issued by,

37
00:01:58,401 --> 00:02:00,935
they owe me collectively 
$10 billion dollars

38
00:02:00,935 --> 00:02:03,264
and in the meantime, they're 
going to pay me interest.

39
00:02:03,264 --> 00:02:03,989
So that's all it is.

40
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:08,289
And all an asset is, is something 
that has some future economic value.

41
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:09,166
And that's what these are.

42
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:11,162
These bonds have some future
economic value.

43
00:02:11,162 --> 00:02:13,866
They have the value of the
interest payments,

44
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:16,851
plus eventually, they're going 
to pay you the $10 billion back.

45
00:02:16,851 --> 00:02:18,075
Or maybe it's something
less than that.

46
00:02:18,075 --> 00:02:22,427
So the $10 is the interest payments plus what they're 
going to pay you back, which might be $9.9 billion.

47
00:02:22,427 --> 00:02:23,369
I'm making up numbers.

48
00:02:23,369 --> 00:02:24,716
But that's not the issue here.

49
00:02:26,054 --> 00:02:31,217
The crux of the issue is that 
there's this stinky asset here.

50
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:37,967
Actually, let me draw a couple more assets here 
just to show you this is the stinkiest of them all.

51
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:42,388
So let's say I have another
group of assets.

52
00:02:42,558 --> 00:02:52,757
Let's say it's um -- let's say its $10 billion
of commercial mortgages.

53
00:02:53,557 --> 00:02:56,025
Commercial mortgages.

54
00:02:56,841 --> 00:03:04,766
So this is, essentially, I lent money to
companies to buy land or develop land

55
00:03:04,766 --> 00:03:07,499
or buy buildings that they're going
to go rent out to other people.

56
00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:09,835
So once again, it's just
a loan to someone else.

57
00:03:09,835 --> 00:03:12,143
And a loan to someone else that
I've given is an asset.

58
00:03:12,143 --> 00:03:13,522
Because they owe me interest,

59
00:03:13,522 --> 00:03:15,654
and eventually they're going 
to pay the money back to me.

60
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:18,304
And then finally I'm going to throw, 
and I'm not being comprehensive here,

61
00:03:18,304 --> 00:03:21,873
I'm going to throw in the crux
of the issue here.

62
00:03:21,873 --> 00:03:23,878
Let's say that I have

63
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,266
two -- Let me see, I have 21 right now,
let me just make it an even number.

64
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:33,058
Let's say that I have $4 billion, 
so it all adds up to 25.

65
00:03:33,058 --> 00:03:38,763
I have $4 billion in
residential CDOs,

66
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:41,521
collateralized debt
obligations.

67
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,159
Residential

68
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:46,311
CDOs.

69
00:03:46,311 --> 00:03:50,307
And I've done a video on CDOs,
but just to kind of have review,

70
00:03:50,307 --> 00:03:53,557
CDOs are a
derivative instrument.

71
00:03:53,557 --> 00:03:54,782
I know that sounds complicated,

72
00:03:54,782 --> 00:03:57,039
but that just means they are 
derived from another instrument.

73
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:59,343
Which probably,you know, that's a sign

74
00:03:59,343 --> 00:04:03,441
that the stink is starting to emerge 
from this part of the balance sheet.

75
00:04:03,441 --> 00:04:04,957
What does it mean, derivative?

76
00:04:04,957 --> 00:04:07,098
Well, you take a bunch
of mortgages.

77
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:09,033
So I'll just draw
it down here.

78
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:10,590
You take a bunch of mortgages,

79
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,080
so you know, these 
are house mortgages.

80
00:04:14,542 --> 00:04:16,158
Maybe you take a million
of them.

81
00:04:16,158 --> 00:04:18,038
You group them all together.

82
00:04:18,038 --> 00:04:21,407
And you end up with a mortgage
backed security.

83
00:04:21,407 --> 00:04:22,590
Mortgage backed security.

84
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:28,744
All a mortgage backed security
is a loan to a big group of people

85
00:04:28,744 --> 00:04:34,095
and you put them all together so that you can kind of, 
you know, be able to statistically give it properties.

86
00:04:34,095 --> 00:04:36,193
Because if you lend to any one
person, that's hard to trade.

87
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,925
but if you lend to 
a bunch of people,

88
00:04:37,925 --> 00:04:40,981
it starts to become something 
that you could trade with other people

89
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:42,255
because they can understand it.

90
00:04:42,255 --> 00:04:45,761
and, you know, in aggregate, you could say 8% of 
people are going to are going to default and all of that.

91
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:47,513
But anyway, this isn't the
crux of it either.

92
00:04:47,513 --> 00:04:50,495
I have a whole video on mortgage
backed securities.

93
00:04:50,864 --> 00:04:55,615
CDOs, collateralized debt obligations, 
are derived from mortgage backed securities.

94
00:04:55,615 --> 00:04:57,870
And that's why they are called
derivative instruments.

95
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,728
What CDOs are, you take these
mortgage backed securities,

96
00:05:00,728 --> 00:05:03,564
you know, they're loans to some people 
in some region of the country,

97
00:05:03,564 --> 00:05:07,155
or maybe they're diversified across regions, 
then you slice and dice them.

98
00:05:07,155 --> 00:05:09,656
So what you do is,

99
00:05:09,656 --> 00:05:11,775
you slice them into tranches.

100
00:05:11,775 --> 00:05:16,059
And I go into a lot more detail 
on this in the other videos.

101
00:05:16,059 --> 00:05:19,389
And you say, this group
of the CDOs,

102
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:20,888
they'll get the first payments.

103
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:26,218
or if any payments that go, immediately 
go to this very senior tranche, right?

104
00:05:26,218 --> 00:05:27,785
And then the next payments
go to this one.

105
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,725
And then this top tranche, you
could call it the most junior tranche.

106
00:05:30,725 --> 00:05:33,287
it's sometimes called
the equity tranche.

107
00:05:33,287 --> 00:05:37,679
This tranche, they're going to
get whatever is left over.

108
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:40,412
So if everyone pays, 
they get made whole,

109
00:05:40,412 --> 00:05:45,068
but if a lot of people default, all the defaults 
are going to hit this tranche, right?

110
00:05:45,068 --> 00:05:47,971
And to kind of make up for the
fact that this is the riskiest tranche,

111
00:05:47,971 --> 00:05:50,879
or essentially these people 
are taking on all of the risk,

112
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:56,083
or essentially these tranches are 
giving all the risk to this tranche.

113
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,125
And a tranche is just a
layer, just a slice, ok?

114
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,556
I don't want to use
too fancy words.

115
00:06:00,556 --> 00:06:05,070
But in return for taking on all of the risk, 
this person is going to get a higher yield.

116
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,776
So while this person 
might be getting 6%,

117
00:06:07,776 --> 00:06:09,557
this person might be 
getting 7% on their money,

118
00:06:09,557 --> 00:06:12,300
maybe this person gets 
12% on their money.

119
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,818
This is another interesting
thing.

120
00:06:13,818 --> 00:06:15,695
Because this person
is the most secure,

121
00:06:15,695 --> 00:06:19,266
the ratings agency, which I'll probably
do another whole series of videos on,

122
00:06:19,266 --> 00:06:22,036
They might give it, 
I don't know, a AAA rating.

123
00:06:22,036 --> 00:06:23,827
And maybe they 
give this tranche,

124
00:06:23,827 --> 00:06:27,048
and I'm making up things, 
but maybe they give it a AA rating.

125
00:06:27,048 --> 00:06:29,752
But this equity tranche, it
will get a junkier rating.

126
00:06:29,752 --> 00:06:32,677
And because it's a junkier rating, 
no one is going to want to buy it.

127
00:06:32,677 --> 00:06:37,198
So the person who constructed this whole 
collateralized debt obligations

128
00:06:37,198 --> 00:06:40,800
and who sold these tranches 
to the public markets,

129
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,583
and this process by the way is
called securitization,

130
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:48,078
because you're creating securities out
of these assets that you sell to everyone,

131
00:06:48,078 --> 00:06:50,997
maybe the Chinese, or whoever, 
sovereign wealth funds.

132
00:06:50,997 --> 00:06:54,054
But people only want to
buy these tranches.

133
00:06:54,054 --> 00:06:58,072
So the banks have to figure
out what to do with this tranche,

134
00:06:58,072 --> 00:06:59,735
which is the stinky
equity tranche.

135
00:06:59,735 --> 00:07:01,320
So most of them just kept it
on their balance sheet.

136
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,620
They said, oh it looks like
housing never goes down,

137
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,790
we get a really high yield on this,

138
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,288
so we are going to keep
this tranche for ourselves.

139
00:07:08,288 --> 00:07:12,510
And that's what these residential CDOs are, 
that are the crux of the issue.

140
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,412
But anyway, that was
just an aside.

141
00:07:14,412 --> 00:07:18,057
And so I wanted to show you this because 
these aren't just any residential CDOs.

142
00:07:18,057 --> 00:07:19,372
These aren't the AAAs.

143
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,042
These, they might be, some of them.

144
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:24,536
But just for the sake of argument, 
let's say that these are junky ones

145
00:07:24,536 --> 00:07:25,896
or smelly.

146
00:07:27,634 --> 00:07:28,396
Smelly.

147
00:07:28,396 --> 00:07:32,369
So anyway, that's my example bank, 
the asset side of its balance sheet.

148
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:35,776
Let's think about
its liabilities.

149
00:07:35,776 --> 00:07:37,625
So liabilities.

150
00:07:39,164 --> 00:07:40,462
Liabilities.

151
00:07:41,739 --> 00:07:43,446
We'll just say it
has a bunch of loans, right?

152
00:07:43,446 --> 00:07:46,311
So let's say it has loan A.

153
00:07:47,757 --> 00:07:51,653
Loan A for, I don't know, $10 billion dollars

154
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,333
Let me actually throw
some cash in here.

155
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,283
Let's say it has a billion
dollars of cash.

156
00:07:57,283 --> 00:07:59,306
A bank always has to
keep some cash.

157
00:07:59,306 --> 00:08:02,975
Just in case someone asks for
their money immediately.

158
00:08:03,637 --> 00:08:05,370
That's in the context of
a commercial bank, but anyway,

159
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,978
let's say it has some cash 
just for immediate liquidity needs.

160
00:08:08,978 --> 00:08:14,317
So the liability side has loan A.
It owes someone $10 billion.

161
00:08:14,317 --> 00:08:19,495
It has loan B, I don't know, 
let's say it's another $10 billion.

162
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,560
And let's say it has loan C.

163
00:08:24,283 --> 00:08:32,086
Loan C is, just to make it interesting, 
loan C is... let's say it's for $3 billion.

164
00:08:33,594 --> 00:08:37,691
So in this example right now, if we assumed 
that all of these asset values are correct

165
00:08:37,691 --> 00:08:42,554
and all of these liability values are correct, 
what is this bank's equity?

166
00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:44,458
And in this case, if it's a
publicly traded company,

167
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,850
what is its shareholders' equity?

168
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,038
Let's figure it out.

169
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:50,776
It's equity.

170
00:08:54,176 --> 00:09:01,293
Well, its assets are -- let's see one 
plus 21, $25, $26 billion in assets

171
00:09:03,093 --> 00:09:05,706
and its liabilities are $23 billion.

172
00:09:05,706 --> 00:09:10,439
So $26 billion of assets minus
$23 billion of liabilities

173
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:16,302
means that we have $3 billion 
of equity -- of shareholders' equity.

174
00:09:16,302 --> 00:09:18,237
And just to make it clear,
what this equity is,

175
00:09:18,237 --> 00:09:20,153
let's say this is a publicly
traded company.

176
00:09:20,153 --> 00:09:24,250
If you own a share of the company, 
you own a share of this equity.

177
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,077
So lets --actually, 
let's just write it out.

178
00:09:26,077 --> 00:09:33,262
Let's say this company has --um, you know, 
let's call this, I don't know, Yachovia Bank.

179
00:09:33,262 --> 00:09:35,243
No, actually, I shouldn't,
that's too close.

180
00:09:35,243 --> 00:09:37,276
Let's call this Bank A.

181
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:39,302
And let's say that Bank A

182
00:09:40,548 --> 00:09:41,529
Bank A.

183
00:09:43,344 --> 00:09:47,566
has, I don't know, let me make up 
something, let's say that it has

184
00:09:47,566 --> 00:09:52,148
a, I don't know, a billion -- let's say 
it has 500 million shares.

185
00:09:52,887 --> 00:09:54,557
500 million shares.

186
00:09:55,126 --> 00:09:58,350
Right? If go into Yahoo Finance, you said 
how many shares are outstanding?

187
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,699
It has 500 million shares.

188
00:10:01,437 --> 00:10:04,583
So, each share price, or the
book value of each share price,

189
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:09,388
essentially should be this $3 billion 
of equity based on the balance sheet.

190
00:10:09,388 --> 00:10:10,761
And that's why they call
it book equity.

191
00:10:10,761 --> 00:10:14,022
Because the balance sheet
is often called the company's books.

192
00:10:14,022 --> 00:10:17,888
So this is this $3 billion of equity 
divided by the number of shares.

193
00:10:17,888 --> 00:10:22,122
So each share should be worth, let's see, 
$3 billion divided by 500 million,

194
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:33,066
it should be $6 of book equity -- of 
book equity -- equity -- per share.

195
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:34,586
And that's something
important to realize

196
00:10:34,586 --> 00:10:37,886
because a lot of people think
that if a stock price goes to zero,

197
00:10:37,886 --> 00:10:40,240
that means that you're getting
the company for nothing.

198
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,326
No, that's not true.

199
00:10:41,326 --> 00:10:44,628
That just means that the
equity is worth zero.

200
00:10:44,628 --> 00:10:45,719
And I just realized that
I'm out of time.

201
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:47,182
I'm going to continue this
in the next video.

202
00:10:47,182 --> 00:10:49,451
And we'll explore this
a little bit more.

203
00:10:49,451 --> 00:10:51,021
See you soon.
