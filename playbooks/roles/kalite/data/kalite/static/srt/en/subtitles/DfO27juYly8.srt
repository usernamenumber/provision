1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,820
   

2
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,480
Right now, based on what we know
so far, if we wanted to

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,080
name this molecule, we would
say, well, what's the longest

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,450
carbon chain here?

5
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:12,720
Well, we have a two-carbon
chain, and there's all single

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,490
bonds, so we're dealing
with an ethane.

7
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,440
Actually, I'll write
it all at once.

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,700
And then we have on the one
carbon, we can call this the

9
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,730
one carbon, and call this the
two carbon, we have a bromine

10
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:26,780
and a fluorine.

11
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:34,100
So we could call this 1-bromo,
and we're putting the bromo

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,650
instead of the fluoro because
B comes before F

13
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:37,640
alphabetically.

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:46,410
1-bromo-1-fluoro, and then we're
dealing with an ethane.

15
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,400
We have a two-carbon chain,
all single bonds,

16
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,630
fluoroethane.

17
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,010
That's the name of that molecule
there, just a review

18
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,630
of some of the earlier
organic nomenclature

19
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,940
videos we had done.

20
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,850
Now, we know immediately, based
on the last few videos,

21
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,920
that this is also a chiral
carbon, and if we were to take

22
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,740
its mirror image, we would get
another enantiomer of this

23
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,780
same molecule, or that they are
enantiomers of each other.

24
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,710
So what is the mirror
image of this

25
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,430
1-bromo-1-fluoroethane look like?

26
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:23,380
Well, you'd have the
carbon right here.

27
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,670
I want to get all the
colors right.

28
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,050
You would still have the
bromine up above.

29
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,100
You would have this methyl group
that's attached to the

30
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,280
carbon now pointing in the
left direction, CH3.

31
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:42,020
The fluorine would now still be
behind the carbon, and now

32
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,890
the hydrogen would still pop out
of the page, but it would

33
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,600
now pop out and to the right.

34
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,610
   

35
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,080
That is the hydrogen.

36
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,180
Now, based on our naming so
far, we would name this

37
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:01,860
1-bromo-1-fluoroethane, and
we would also name this

38
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:08,100
1-bromo-1-fluoroethane, but
these are fundamentally two

39
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,169
different molecules.

40
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:12,100
Even though they have the same
molecules in them; they have

41
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,280
the same molecular formula;
they have the same

42
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,640
constitution in that this
carbon is connected to a

43
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,810
hydrogen, a fluorine, and a
bromine; this carbon is

44
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,420
connected to the same things;
this carbon is connected to a

45
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,440
carbon, three hydrogens; so
is this one; these are

46
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,675
stereoisomers.

47
00:02:29,675 --> 00:02:32,990
These are stereoisomers, and
they're mirror images of each

48
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,240
other, so they're enantiomers.

49
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,220
   

50
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,500
And actually, they will, one,
polarize light differently,

51
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,070
and they actually can often have
very different chemical

52
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,860
properties, either in a chemical
or biological system.

53
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,190
So it seems not good that
we have the same

54
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,540
names for both of these.

55
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,460
So what we're going to focus on
in this video is how do you

56
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,860
differentiate between the two?

57
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,510
   

58
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,460
So how do we differentiate
between the two?

59
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,470
So the naming system we're going
to use right here is

60
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:12,040
called the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog
system, but it's a different

61
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,000
Cahn, it's not me.

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,835
It's C-A-H-N instead
of K-H-A-N.

63
00:03:17,835 --> 00:03:26,500
Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system, and
it's a way of differentiating

64
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,520
between this enantiomer, which
right now we would call

65
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,110
1-bromo-1-fluoroethane,
and this enantiomer,

66
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,820
1-bromo-1-fluoroethane.

67
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,210
It's a pretty straightforward
thing.

68
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,520
Really, the hardest part is to
just visualize rotating the

69
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,560
molecules in the right way
and figuring out in which

70
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,410
direction it's kind of--
whether it's kind of a

71
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,010
left-handed or right-handed
molecule.

72
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,770
We're going to take
it step by step.

73
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:50,960
So the first thing you do in the
Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system

74
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:56,170
is to, one, identify your
chiral molecule.

75
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,330
Here, it's pretty obvious.

76
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:00,550
It's this carbon right here.

77
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,350
We'll just focus on this left
one, the one we started with

78
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:06,430
first. It's bonded to three
different groups.

79
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,900
And then what you want to do is
you want to rank the groups

80
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,770
by atomic number.

81
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:18,120
So if you go up here, out of
bromine, hydrogen, fluorine,

82
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,130
and a carbon, this is what is
bonded directly to this

83
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,900
carbon, which has the highest
atomic number?

84
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,470
Bromine is over here-- let me
do this in a darker color.

85
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:32,790
We have bromine at 35, we have
fluorine at 9, we have carbon

86
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:37,250
at 6, and then we have
hydrogen at 1.

87
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,500
So of all these, bromine is the
largest. We'll just call

88
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,260
this number one.

89
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,390
Then after that, we
have fluorine.

90
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,690
That is the number two.

91
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,810
Number three is the carbon.

92
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,950
And then hydrogen is
the smallest, so

93
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:55,450
that is number four.

94
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,290
So now that we've numbered
them, the next step is to

95
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,890
orient this molecule so that
the smallest atomic number

96
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,890
group is sitting
into the page.

97
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,060
It's sitting behind
the molecule.

98
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,570
Right now, this hydrogen is the
smallest of all of them.

99
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,860
Bromine's the largest, hydrogen
is the smallest, so

100
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,970
we want to orient it behind
the molecule.

101
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,650
The way it's drawn right
now, it's oriented in

102
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,920
front of the molecule.

103
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,210
So to orient it behind the
molecule, and this really is

104
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,560
the hardest part is just to
visualize it properly.

105
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,480
Remember, this fluorine is
behind; this is right in the

106
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,595
plane of the paper; this is
popping out of the paper.

107
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:30,430
   

108
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,920
We would want to rotate.

109
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,820
You could imagine we'd be
rotating the molecule in this

110
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,800
direction so that--
let me redraw it.

111
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,140
   

112
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,090
We have the carbon here.

113
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,060
And now since we've rotated it
like this, we've rotated it

114
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:54,450
roughly 1/3 around the circle,
so it's about 120 degrees.

115
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:57,220
Now, this hydrogen is where
the fluorine was.

116
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:01,430
   

117
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,730
So that's where the
hydrogen is.

118
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,340
The fluorine is now where
this methyl group is.

119
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,120
   

120
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,960
These dotted lines show
that we're behind now.

121
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,420
This shows that we're
in the plane.

122
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,340
And the methyl group is now
where the hydrogen is.

123
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,640
It's now popping out
of the page.

124
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,370
It's going to the
left and out.

125
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:24,120
So this methyl group is now
popping out of the page, out

126
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,290
and to the left.

127
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,300
That's where our methyl
group is.

128
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,420
So all we've done is we've just
rotated this around about

129
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,950
120 degrees.

130
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,680
We've just gotten this to go
behind, and that's kind of the

131
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,340
first step after we've
identified the chiral carbon

132
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,380
and ranked them by
atomic number.

133
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:38,500
And.

134
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:38,760
Of course.

135
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,360
The bromine is still
going to be on top.

136
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,220
   

137
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,020
Now, once you put the smallest
atomic number molecule in the

138
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,430
back, then you want to
look at the rankings

139
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,630
of one through three.

140
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,510
And we have four
molecules here.

141
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:57,040
We look at the largest, which
is bromine, number one.

142
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,540
Then number two is fluorine,
number two, and then number

143
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,830
three is this methyl group.

144
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,360
That's the carbon that's bonded
to this carbon, so it's

145
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,900
number three right there.

146
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,660
And in the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog
system, we literally just

147
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,640
think about what would it take
to go from number one to

148
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,900
number two to number three?

149
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,400
And in this case, we would
go in this direction.

150
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,250
To go from number one to number
two to number three, we

151
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,020
would go in the clockwise
direction.

152
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,670
We're just ignoring the
hydrogen right now.

153
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,200
That's just sitting behind it.

154
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,310
That was the first step, to
orient it so it's sitting in

155
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,040
the back, the smallest
molecule.

156
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,590
And then the three largest
ones, you just say what

157
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,750
direction do we have to go to
go from number one to number

158
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,780
two to number three?

159
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,570
In this case, we have
to go clockwise.

160
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:42,180
And if we go clockwise now,
then we call this a

161
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,210
right-handed molecule, or we use
the Latin word for right,

162
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:49,410
which is rectus.

163
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:54,510
And so we would call this
molecule right here not just

164
00:07:54,510 --> 00:08:00,700
1-bromo-1-fluoroethane, this
is R, R for rectus.

165
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,210
Or you could even think right,
although we'll see left is

166
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,790
used as S, which is sinister,
so the Latin is really where

167
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,050
the R comes from.

168
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:18,260
But this is
(R)-1-bromo-1-fluoroethane

169
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,470
That's this one right here.

170
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,910
So you might guess, well, this
must be the opposite, this

171
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,450
must be the counterclockwise
version.

172
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,860
We can do it really fast.

173
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,480
So same idea.

174
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,280
We know the largest one.

175
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,960
Bromine is number one.

176
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,970
That's the largest in terms
of atomic number.

177
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,809
Fluorine is number two.

178
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:36,400
Carbon is number three.

179
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,230
Hydrogen is number four.

180
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:40,830
What we want to do is put
hydrogen in the back, so what

181
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,350
we're going to have to do is
rotate it to the back to where

182
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,190
fluorine is right now.

183
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,860
So if we had to redraw this
molecule right here, you'd

184
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,890
have your carbon still.

185
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,015
You still have your bromine
sitting on top.

186
00:08:52,015 --> 00:08:55,030
But we're going to put the
hydrogen now to the back, so

187
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:59,120
the hydrogen is now where
the fluorine used to be.

188
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,370
The hydrogen's there.

189
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:05,120
   

190
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,310
This methyl group, this carbon
with the three hydrogens, is

191
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:12,830
going to be rotated to where
the hydrogen used to be.

192
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,060
It's now going to pop out of
the page, because we're

193
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,710
rotating it in that direction,
so this is our methyl group

194
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,590
right there.

195
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,900
And then this fluorine is going
to be moved where the

196
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:26,740
methyl group was, so this
fluorine will go right here.

197
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,070
And now, using the
Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system,

198
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,240
this is our number one, this
is our number two, just by

199
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,800
atomic number, this
is number three.

200
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,850
You go from number one through
number two to number three.

201
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,620
You go in this direction.

202
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,870
You're going counterclockwise.

203
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:45,520
   

204
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,890
Or we are going to the left, or
we use the Latin word for

205
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:51,890
it, which is sinister.

206
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,420
And the word sinister comes from
the Latin word for left,

207
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,250
so I guess right is good, and
people thought either

208
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,100
left-handed people were bad, or
if you're not going to the

209
00:09:59,100 --> 00:09:59,720
right, it's bad.

210
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,180
I don't know why sinister took
on its sinister meaning now in

211
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,110
common language.

212
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:09,400
But it's now the sinister
version of the molecule.

213
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,700
So we would call this version,
this enantiomer of

214
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:19,840
1-bromo-1-fluoroethane, we
would call this S, S for

215
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,970
sinister, or for left, or
for counterclockwise:

216
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,220
(S)-1-bromo-1-fluoroethane.

217
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:31,440
   

218
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,330
So now we can differentiate
the names.

219
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:38,180
We know that these are two
different configurations.

220
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,540
And that's what the S and the R
tell us, that if you have to

221
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,660
go from this to this, you would
literally have to detach

222
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,150
and reattach different groups.

223
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,570
You'd actually have
to break bonds.

224
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:50,850
You actually have to swap two of
these groups in some way in

225
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,470
order to get from this
enantiomer to this enantiomer.

226
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,410
They're different
configurations, really

227
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:58,270
fundamentally different
molecules, stereoisomers,

228
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,770
enantiomers, however
you want to--

229
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:01,866
