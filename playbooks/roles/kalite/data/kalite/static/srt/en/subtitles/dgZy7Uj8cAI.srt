1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:07,190
We're on problem 55. At a certain picnic each of the guests

2
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,770
was served either a single scoop or a double scoop of

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,110
ice cream. How many of the guests

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,810
were served a double scoop of ice cream?

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:17,300
So let's say that d is the number of guests that were served

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,480
double scoop and that's what we're trying to figure out.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,600
So what are their statements?

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,220
Statement number one says at the picnic 60% of the guests

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,470
were served a double scoop of ice cream.

10
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,610
So 60% percent of the total were served a double scoop.

11
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,560
Let's see if we can write that algebraically.

12
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,800
So 60% of the guests.

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,400
So the total number of guests are the number of guests

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,950
that were served double scoops plus the number of guests

15
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:49,980
that were served single scoops.

16
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,880
Then we have all of the guests,right?

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,090
This is this is equal to the total number of guests.

18
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,770
And then they tell us that 60% of them were

19
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,330
served double scoop. So the number that were served

20
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,720
double scoop is 60% of the total.

21
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,610
So that statement number one is just an algebraic equation.

22
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,470
And this alone though doesn't help me solve this equation.

23
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:13,880
Maybe in the next statement they'll tell us

24
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,460
how many total guests there are. What this is.

25
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,970
And that'll help me but I don't know.

26
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,270
Let's see,statement number two,

27
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,720
they say a total of 120 scoops of ice cream

28
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,030
were served to all the guests at the picnic.

29
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,850
So once again,they're telling us that there are 120 scoops

30
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,260
of ice cream,they're not telling us that there are 120 guests

31
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,280
So let's see,what are the total number of scoops.

32
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,620
So there's the number of single scoops and each of those are--

33
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,710
the number of guests that got singles scoops are s

34
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,400
and then the number of scoops is just 1 times that

35
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,460
because they each got one scoop.

36
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,220
And then you have the number of guests that got double scoops

37
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,040
But then the number of scoops they got is going to be 2

38
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,620
times that. So this is the total numbers scoops,right?

39
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,240
The number of people that got single scoops times 1 plus

40
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,150
the number that got double scoops times 2 and that

41
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,500
is going to be equal to the total number of scoops.

42
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,960
And this alone isn't going to help us solve

43
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,340
how many double scoops were served,

44
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,420
it depends on the singles scooped and all of that.

45
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,050
But if you look at both of these statements

46
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,450
we have two linear equations and two unknowns.

47
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,290
So at this point you should immediately say,unless

48
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,650
somehow these are the same equation

49
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,070
or somehow these are two parallel lines,

50
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:30,240
these should intersect and allow you to solve this equation.

51
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,170
So immediately-- especially if you don't want to waste time--

52
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,890
you should say that both statements together are sufficient.

53
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,780
And if you want me to prove this to you,

54
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,500
let me see if I can solve this.

55
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,970
So I'll do it in a different color.

56
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,070
So let me do some substitution.

57
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:50,380
So here we get s is equal to 120 minus 2d.

58
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,320
And we can substitute this back here.

59
00:02:52,320 --> 00:03:00,420
So you get 0.6 times d plus s,which is 120 minus 2d,

60
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,330
is equal to d.

61
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:10,790
And so you get 0.6 times 120 minus d is equal to d.

62
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:17,540
And what's 0.6 times 120? That's 72,right? 6 times 12 is 72.

63
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:29,640
72 minus 0.6d is equal to d. So you get 72 is equal to 1.6d

64
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:40,060
and then 72 divided by 1.6 is equal to 45.

65
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,700
So there,we solved the problem.d is equal to 45.

66
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,300
45 double scoops were served.

67
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,770
And then we could substitute back into the equation to figure

68
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,540
how many single scoops or how many total guests there were,

69
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,170
but this is all that we had to figure out.

70
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:54,350
And we were able to using both statements combined.

71
00:03:55,210 --> 00:04:02,010
To the next problem. 56. What is the value of xy?

72
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,550
OK. Statement number one:

73
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,180
they tell us that y is equal to x plus 1.

74
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,010
And that's not going to tell me what xy is,I mean there's

75
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,260
a bunch of x's and a bunch of different y's depending on

76
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,340
what I choose.

77
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:26,090
Two: they tell us y is equal to x squared plus 1.

78
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,210
Once again,this by itself--

79
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,360
it completely depends on which xy's I pick,right?

80
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,360
I can pick any combination and get different values.

81
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,470
You could try that out yourself.

82
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,190
But I have two equations and two unknowns.

83
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,230
It's a little tricky because one of them's non-linear,

84
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,370
but let's see if we can figure it out with substitution.

85
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,780
If y equals this and y equals that,we could set these two

86
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,720
equal to each other and see if we can solve for x.

87
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,050
So we get x plus 1,that's the first one,should equal this one

88
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,180
because they're both equal to y. x squared plus 1.

89
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:58,550
Let's see,we can subtract 1 from both sides

90
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,890
and you get x is equal to x squared.

91
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:10,310
And let's see,you could say-- well,you could divide--

92
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:16,640
if we assume that if x does not equal 0--

93
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,490
so there's two solutions here,right?

94
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,530
x could be equal to 0. That's completely legitimate.

95
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,320
They never told us that x isn't equal to 0.

96
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,670
That would satisfy that equation.

97
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,230
And then what other x would satisfy?

98
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,480
x could be equal to 0 or x could be equal to 1.

99
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:37,830
Either of those are completely legitimate answers here,right?

100
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,200
Fair enough. If x is 0 this is true,0 equals 0.

101
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,950
If x is 1,1 is equal to 1 squared.x can't be negative 1.

102
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,120
Negative 1 is not equal to negative 1 squared.

103
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,740
So these are the two solutions for x.

104
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,170
So right now it seems like it's a little shady,but remember,

105
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,520
we're not trying to solve for x or solve for y,

106
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,840
we're trying to solve for xy.

107
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,040
So maybe when we solve for y something,I don't know,

108
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,900
interesting could happen. Let's solve for y.

109
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,900
If you assume x is equal to 0 what's y?

110
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,080
y is equal to 0 plus 1.y is equal to 1 in this case.

111
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,770
That's one solution.

112
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,640
And if you put x is equal to 0 here you also get y is equal 1

113
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,710
So this is one set of solutions.

114
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,800
And in this reality xy is going to be equal to what?

115
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,240
xy is going to be equal to 0,right? 0 times 1 is 0.

116
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,830
Now if x is equal to 1,what is y?

117
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:33,830
Well,if x is equal to 1,y is equal to 1 plus 1,

118
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:38,310
y is equal to 2. Well,then xy is equal to 2.

119
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:44,870
So using both of the statements,

120
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,140
I still don't know whether xy is equal to 0 or 2.

121
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,250
Someone would have to tell me that x is not equal to 0,

122
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,080
x is equal to 0,

123
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,140
and only then can I really solve this equation.

124
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,110
So the answer to this,even though we have two equations

125
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:00,530
and two unknowns,because one of them was a quadratic

126
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:04,810
and had two solutions,we actually don't know what xy is.

127
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:08,650
So the answer is that the statements together

128
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,430
are not sufficient or E.

129
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,390
That's interesting because they actually make you do

130
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,110
a little bit more work than just eyeballing it and saying,

131
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,480
oh, I have two equations to unknowns.

132
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,950
You've got to be a little careful when the equations are

133
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,660
non-linear.

134
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,930
At least I think that's right. Alright,question 57.

135
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:32,270
They want to know what 1/x plus 1/y--

136
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,220
some police sirens outside.

137
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,690
I live in Palo Alto,there's not normally a high crime

138
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,490
scene here but you never know. Anyway,so 1/x plus 1/y.

139
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:49,300
So statement number one is x plus y is equal to 14.

140
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,630
Actually let me try to simplify this a little bit.

141
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:57,500
If I were to try to add these two,what could I do?

142
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,980
Well,when you add two fractions

143
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:01,980
you have to find a common denominator.

144
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,770
An easy common denominator for x and y is just xy.

145
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,510
So 1/x is what over xy?

146
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,080
Well,it's y/xy plus-- right,this is the same thing as 1/x--

147
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,320
plus,and if I had xy here,what's 1/y? Well,that's x/xy.

148
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:25,420
So that can be rewritten as y plus x over xy.

149
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,680
And now when you rewrite this statement like this,

150
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,540
then statement one looks a little interesting.

151
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,670
They gave us the numerator at least.They haven't told us

152
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:36,690
what xy is but they told us that y plus x,

153
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,000
or x plus y is equal to 14.

154
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,750
So statement one,it's kind of part of the puzzle

155
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,570
but it's not completely helping us.

156
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,570
Let's see what statement two tells us.

157
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,460
I suspect,if this is solveable,

158
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,450
they'll have to tell us what xy--

159
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,910
yep,they tell us what xy is.

160
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:56,530
They tell us that xy is equal to 24.So then we're done,right?

161
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:59,550
This simplifies to this and they're telling us what this is.

162
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:03,430
x plus y is 14. So it equals 14/24--

163
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,750
not that we have to really solve for it--

164
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,060
but that is equal to 7/12. But as soon as we got--

165
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,900
you say,oh,that's that,that's that. You're done.

166
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,300
You say,both statements together are sufficient.

167
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,390
So C. 58.

168
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:27,690
If d denotes a decimal is d greater than or equal to 0.5?

169
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,080
They put a 0 here so you make sure you notice the decimal.

170
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,810
d,greater than or equal to 0.5.

171
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,510
Statement number one tells us that

172
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:47,040
when d is rounded to the nearest 10th the result is 0.5.

173
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:57,500
So let's see,it could be 0.52 and when you round it

174
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,270
to the nearest 10th it becomes 0.5.

175
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:05,640
But on the other hand,it could be 0.46 and when you're

176
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,660
round it to the nearest 10th you also get 0.5.

177
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,800
So since statement one says it could be either one of these,

178
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,450
it really doesn't help us to know whether we're greater

179
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,700
than or equal to 0.5. This one is greater; this one isn't.

180
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,610
So statement one by itself doesn't help.

181
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,790
Statement two: when d is rounded to the nearest integer

182
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,190
the result is 1. Now this is interesting.

183
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,660
If something is rounded to the nearest integer

184
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,810
it has to be greater than 0.5,right?

185
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,910
The smallest number that when you round it to the nearest

186
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:41,040
integer equal to 1 is 0.5,right?

187
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,830
So it has to be 0.5 or it has to be 0.51,because 0.499999,

188
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:49,710
when you're round it to the nearest integer,is going to

189
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:53,920
be equal 0. That's the only way it can get rounded to 1,

190
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,250
if you're 0.5 or above.

191
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:00,020
So actually statement two alone is all you need to know

192
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:06,080
that d is greater than or equal to 0.5. So that is choice B.

193
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,390
Statement two alone is sufficient.

194
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,120
Alright,I've realized I've run out of time.

195
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,100
See you in the next video.
