1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,880
   

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,650
Let's say we wanted to figure
out the equilibrium constant

3
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:10,550
for the reaction boron
trifluoride in the gaseous

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,840
plus 3-- so for every mole of
this, we're going to have 3

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:20,570
moles of H2O in the liquid
state-- and that's in

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:21,036
equilibrium.

7
00:00:21,036 --> 00:00:27,060
It's going forward and backwards
with 3 moles of

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,060
hydrofluoric acid, so it's
in the aqueous state.

9
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,760
It's been dissolved
in the water.

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,000
If it wasn't dissolved, if it
was in the solid state, you

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,540
would call this hydrogen
fluoride.

12
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,030
Once it's in water, you call
it hydrofluoric acid, and

13
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,820
we'll talk more about naming
in the future, hopefully.

14
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:50,030
Plus 1 mole of boric acid, also
in the aqueous state.

15
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,820
It's dissolved in the water.

16
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:58,680
H3BO3 in the aqueous state.

17
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,000
So what would the expression for
the equilibrium constant

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,180
look like in this situation?

19
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,370
So you might be tempted say, OK,
that's easy enough, Sal.

20
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,700
So the equilibrium constant,
you just take

21
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,300
the right-hand side.

22
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,280
That's just the convention.

23
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,110
There's symmetry here.

24
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,150
I could've rewritten it either
way, but let's just say you

25
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,370
take the right-hand side and
say, OK, this is dependent on

26
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:27,070
the concentration of the
hydrofluoric acid, the

27
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:31,920
concentration of the HF, or the
molarity of the HF, to the

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,680
third power, times the
concentration of the boric

29
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,840
acid, H3BO3.

30
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,725
   

31
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,355
And remember, this intuition of
why you're taking this to

32
00:01:43,355 --> 00:01:45,760
the third power is what's the
probability-- because in order

33
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,300
for the reaction to go this
way, you need to have 3

34
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,810
molecules of hydrofluoric acid
being very close to 1 molecule

35
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,300
of the boric acid.

36
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,650
So if you watched the last video
I just made about the

37
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:03,270
intuition behind the equilibrium
constant, this is

38
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,820
indicative of the probability of
this reaction happening or

39
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,669
the probability of finding
all of these

40
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,600
molecules in the same place.

41
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,450
Of course, you can adjust it
with a constant and that's

42
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,770
essentially what that does.

43
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,490
But that's on the product
side, or the reactant,

44
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,510
depending on what direction
you're viewing this equation,

45
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:31,150
divided by the molarity of the
boron trifluoride times-- and

46
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:36,360
I'll do this in a different
color-- the molarity of the

47
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,230
H2O to the third power.

48
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,700
And that's, of course,
the H2O liquid.

49
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,410
So there you go.

50
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,580
We'll just figure this out.

51
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:51,200
And my rebuttal to you is I
want you to figure out the

52
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,590
molarity of the water.

53
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,580
What is the concentration
of the water?

54
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,810
Remember, the concentration is
moles per volume, but in this

55
00:02:58,810 --> 00:02:59,960
case, what's happening?

56
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,030
I'm putting some boron
trifluoride gas essentially

57
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,090
into some water, and it's
creating these aqueous acids.

58
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,120
These other molecules
are dissolved

59
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,700
completely in the water.

60
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,600
So what's the solvent here?

61
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,850
The solvent is H2O.

62
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:18,250
   

63
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,980
This might be how the reaction
happens, but pretty much,

64
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,150
there's water everywhere.

65
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,000
The water is in surplus.

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,630
So if you were to really figure
out the concentration

67
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:31,150
of water, it's everywhere.

68
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,860
I mean, you could say everything
but the boron

69
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,820
trifluoride, but it's
a very high number.

70
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,900
And if you think about it from
the probability point of view,

71
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,670
if you say, OK, in order for
this reaction to happen

72
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:43,680
forward, I need to figure out
the probability of finding a

73
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,710
boron trifluoride atom or
molecule-- actually,

74
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,650
molecule-- in a certain volume,
and it also needs 3

75
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,760
moles of water in that
certain volume.

76
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,310
But you say, hey, there's
water everywhere.

77
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,140
This is the solvent.

78
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,740
There's water everywhere, so
I really just need to worry

79
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,360
about the concentration of
the boron trifluoride.

80
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:09,880
So you could say the forward
reaction rate, rate forward,

81
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,200
is going to be dependent on some
forward constant times

82
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,570
just the concentration of
the boron trifluoride.

83
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,510
The water's everywhere, so you
don't have to multiply it

84
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,810
times the concentration of
water, whatever that means,

85
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,650
because the water's
everywhere.

86
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:28,040
So the denominator here, you
do not put the solvent.

87
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,430
So the correct answer for this
one is you only put whatever

88
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,890
is actually dissolved
in the solution.

89
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,710
Because frankly, the
concentration doesn't actually

90
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,255
makes sense for everything else,
and if you think about

91
00:04:38,255 --> 00:04:40,850
it from the probability point
of view, that also makes

92
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,290
sense, because there's
always water around.

93
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,700
If you said, OK, what's the
probability of finding water

94
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,940
at any small volume of our
fluid, it's going to be 1, so

95
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,820
you could just multiply it by
a 1 there, but that doesn't

96
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,270
make a difference.

97
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,720
Now, what about the following
reaction?

98
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,650
   

99
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,410
Any equilibrium where you have
different states of matter is

100
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,020
called a heterogeneous
equilibrium.

101
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:12,420
   

102
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:16,610
And so let me write another
heterogeneous equilibrium.

103
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:21,810
So let's say I have H2O in the
gaseous state and that's

104
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,830
essentially steam-- so it's not
going to be the solvent

105
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,640
this time-- plus carbon
in the solid state.

106
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,120
And let's say that that's an
equilibrium with hydrogen in

107
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,940
the gas state plus carbon
dioxide in the gaseous state.

108
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,060
This is a heterogeneous
equilibrium because you have

109
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,610
things in the gaseous
and the solid state.

110
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,970
And solid state, by definition,
it can't be

111
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,840
dissolved either into the gas
or into the-- when we talk

112
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,490
about solutions, we talked about
colloids and suspensions

113
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,170
and mixtures before, but we're
talking about solutions.

114
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,690
By definition, if this
is in the solid

115
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,620
state, it's not dissolved.

116
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,130
If this was dissolved, we
would write an aq here.

117
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,170
It would be the aqueous state.

118
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,840
So if you talk about the forward
reaction, what's the

119
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,800
forward reaction going
to be dependent on?

120
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,670
So the rate forward, well, the
solid, there's a big block of

121
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,130
carbon sitting there.

122
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:21,880
There's a big cube of carbon
there, and there's steam,

123
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,020
there's water gas
all around it.

124
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,600
So if you pick any volume,
especially if you pick some

125
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,760
volume near the boundary of
the carbon, you're always

126
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,290
going to have carbon around.

127
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,330
It's just what matters
is the concentration

128
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,580
of the water gas.

129
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,180
That's what's going to drive
the forward rate, so the

130
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,150
forward rate is going to be
dependent on some constant

131
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:49,300
times the concentration
of the water gas.

132
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,340
And, of course, the backwards
rate, so you need to get some

133
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:59,060
H2, some molecules of-- let me
draw it like that, because it

134
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:04,230
has 2 hydrogen molecules plus
a carbon dioxide, so maybe a

135
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,170
carbon dioxide looks
like that.

136
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:12,210
So the reverse reaction, so
rate, let's call that reverse,

137
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,100
is going to be equal to some
constant times the probability

138
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,980
of finding both of these
molecules in the same place.

139
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,340
And, of course, the probability
is related to or

140
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,720
it's on a first-level
approximation, depending on

141
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,590
the concentration.

142
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:29,775
So it's concentration of H2
times the concentration-- and

143
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:31,640
to find both of them, you
multiply the probability,

144
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,330
because you need this
and that-- times the

145
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,520
concentration of CO.

146
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,030
So when a reaction is in
equilibrium, these two equal

147
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,640
each other-- this is an r right
here-- so this is going

148
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:49,880
to be equal to the reverse
rate of reaction H2 times

149
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,390
carbon dioxide.

150
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:55,540
Divide both sides by the K's,
both sides by the H2O, and you

151
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:01,020
get the forward coefficient or
constant or whatever you want

152
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,460
to call that, divided by the
reverse constant-- I'm just

153
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:09,440
dividing both sides by that-- is
equal to this-- let me just

154
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:15,480
copy and paste that-- is equal
to that divided by this.

155
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:20,700
   

156
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,930
You take that and you
divide it by that.

157
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:26,440
   

158
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,875
And so if we call this the
equilibrium constant, because

159
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,950
it's just two arbitrary
constants, so we can just call

160
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,360
this the equilibrium constant,
you see that it actually makes

161
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,710
a lot of sense to ignore
the solid state in your

162
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,760
equilibrium reaction.

163
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,770
So the two takeaways here
is when you're trying to

164
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,690
calculate an equilibrium
constant, you should ignore--

165
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,360
especially when it's in a
heterogeneous equilibrium--

166
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,250
you should ignore the

167
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,970
solution-- or not the solution.

168
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,370
Ignore the solvent in that first
example, where I did it

169
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,250
with boron trifluoride
with water.

170
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,890
Water was the solvent,
so I ignored it.

171
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,010
Because water is everywhere,
and you also

172
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,220
ignore the solid state.

173
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,330
Ignore the solid.

174
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,173
Anyway, we'll probably use these
in future things where

175
00:09:13,173 --> 00:09:15,880
we actually calculate the
equilibrium constant.

176
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,890
See you in the next video where
we'll learn about Le

177
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,260
Chatelier's principle.

178
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,004
