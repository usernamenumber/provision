1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,042
so, in this video what I wanted to focus on is one

2
00:00:04,042 --> 00:00:08,233
particular area of the brain, actually 2 areas I'm going to sketch out, not just one

3
00:00:08,233 --> 00:00:11,900
but I'm going to show you how I think that these 2 areas can be kind of uh

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,800
united in a way, so these 2 areas when I'm sketching out these little

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,878
green circles are going to be responsible for breathing

6
00:00:19,878 --> 00:00:23,547
how fast you breathe, how deep you breathe, and there are lots of little neurons

7
00:00:23,547 --> 00:00:27,541
in these 2 areas and these neurons are going to be communicating

8
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:31,535
lets say this neuron sends a little axon down here. Maybe this guy

9
00:00:31,535 --> 00:00:35,633
sends an axon up here. They're going to be communicating information among themselves

10
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:39,800
and between themselves to kind of make sure they're working in coordinated ways

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,467
that the breathing that you do is, uh, is the way that it should be

12
00:00:43,467 --> 00:00:47,696
you know, how fast it should be, given a particular situation. So, the way

13
00:00:47,696 --> 00:00:51,039
I think of it is kind of uniting these 2 areas, in fact sometimes its subdivided

14
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,033
even further, but I kind of just put it all together and say this part

15
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:59,300
of the brain that I'm kind of sketching out in green, this area then, is

16
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,933
our respiratory center. This is going to be responsible for all the important

17
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:07,467
activities of breathing. So let me just write that out here, "respiratory"

18
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:10,633
"center". So, a respiratory center is going to

19
00:01:10,633 --> 00:01:13,900
gather information from different places and then its

20
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,374
going to have to make a decision

21
00:01:15,374 --> 00:01:17,046
and execute based on all the information

22
00:01:17,046 --> 00:01:19,500
it receives. So one key piece of information

23
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,833
is going to come from cells right here, kind of neighborhood cells

24
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:26,400
and these cells are called the 'Central Chemo receptors'

25
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,400
and the reason I'm calling them central is because they're also part of the brain, right

26
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,400
they're right in the same neighborhood and so these central chemoreceptors don't have

27
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,037
to go too far to communicate their information

28
00:01:38,037 --> 00:01:39,198
and specifically they're going to gather

29
00:01:39,198 --> 00:01:42,541
information on things like carbon dioxide levels and pH levels

30
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:46,535
one thing they don't do is oxygen levels, so thats

31
00:01:46,535 --> 00:01:50,033
these guys right here. Now if you have central chemo receptors, you also

32
00:01:50,033 --> 00:01:54,708
probably can expect that there will be some peripheral chemoreceptors and these

33
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:58,800
ones are also very important and they exist

34
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,833
outside of the brain, right, so they're going to be actually sending their

35
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:06,551
information along through neurons that are going to

36
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:10,333
extend all the way into the brain so for example, you might have, uh, two

37
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:14,033
key groups: one is called the aortic body, and the other is

38
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:18,600
called the carotid body. The aortic body and the carotid body. They're coming from

39
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,900
different locations and are actually going to use different nerves to get in

40
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,267
to the brain so the carotid body, for example, is going to lets say extend out

41
00:02:25,267 --> 00:02:28,500
this way, through a neuron. And that's going to be through a nerve

42
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:34,368
called the glossopharyngeal nerve. This is

43
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:39,300
cranial nerve number nine, also called the glossopharyngeal nerve

44
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,833
glossopharyngeal. So this is one of the

45
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,535
key peripheral chemoreceptors, you've also got

46
00:02:46,535 --> 00:02:49,879
some nerves or neurons kind of projecting from the

47
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:53,933
aortic body, going through the vagus nerve. So this is our vagus nerve

48
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:58,967
or cranial nerve number ten. It goes by two different names

49
00:02:58,967 --> 00:03:02,133
our vagus nerve. these peripheral chemoreceptors are going to

50
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:05,267
detect things like oxygen, in fact that's probably one of the

51
00:03:05,267 --> 00:03:09,198
most important things they detect as well as carbon dioxide and pH

52
00:03:09,198 --> 00:03:12,867
so that's information coming to the respiratory center

53
00:03:12,867 --> 00:03:15,700
from our peripheral and central chemoreceptors is

54
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,833
then mostly about chemicals

55
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:21,365
you know in addition, there is another whole group

56
00:03:21,365 --> 00:03:26,000
of, uh, receptors called mechanoreceptors. Mechanoreceptors.

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,864
and these ones are actually going to be sending information about pressure

58
00:03:29,864 --> 00:03:32,100
now you may be thinking "well wait a second,..."

59
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,204
"I thought baroreceptors told us about pressure"

60
00:03:35,204 --> 00:03:38,548
and it turns out baroreceptors are one type of mechanoreceptor

61
00:03:38,548 --> 00:03:41,533
that's found inside of the blood vessels. So there are many

62
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:45,700
other types in many other locations, and so the bigger, kind of more general

63
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,533
term would be mechanoreceptor and you can find them in places

64
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:53,362
like the nose. You can find them in the lungs, in the GI (gastrointestinal) tract

65
00:03:53,362 --> 00:03:55,167
there are lots of different locations for these

66
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:57,200
mechanoreceptors and they're all sending

67
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,767
kind of their own projection over to the, uh

68
00:04:00,767 --> 00:04:04,369
the respiratory center. In fact, the lungs and the

69
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:08,900
GI tract are going to hitch a ride in the vagus nerve and

70
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,542
the nose mechanoreceptors, they're going to travel

71
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:16,033
through another nerve that's called the trigeminal nerve

72
00:04:16,033 --> 00:04:19,694
or cranial nerve number 5. Trigeminal nerve.

73
00:04:19,694 --> 00:04:22,600
So, these are the routes that these receptors are

74
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,367
going to take to get to the respiratory centre

75
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:28,378
but how do these work exactly, these mechanoreceptors

76
00:04:28,378 --> 00:04:30,467
lets take an example. Lets say you're walking

77
00:04:30,467 --> 00:04:34,369
and you inhale some pollen. Well that's going to

78
00:04:34,369 --> 00:04:37,467
trigger one of these mechanoreceptors in your nose and

79
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:40,067
its going to want to relay that information over to

80
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:42,133
your respiratory center so you're going to get

81
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:44,700
you know a little nerve impulse through that

82
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,833
cranial nerve number 5. Similarly, in your lungs

83
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,400
lets say you actually inhale some

84
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,333
cigarette smoke and lets say the lungs don't like that

85
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,833
and the mechanoreceptor feels that little particle

86
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:58,703
its going to trigger cranial nerve number 10, the vagus nerve

87
00:04:58,703 --> 00:05:02,561
Similarly, you have the stretch receptors in the lungs

88
00:05:02,561 --> 00:05:04,627
and these are actually kind of interesting because

89
00:05:04,627 --> 00:05:06,627
what they're doing is they're saying "hey, you know.."

90
00:05:06,627 --> 00:05:09,994
"these lungs are starting to get really, really full, really distended"

91
00:05:09,994 --> 00:05:12,188
and so they want to let the respiratory center know

92
00:05:12,188 --> 00:05:15,361
that maybe its time to exhale. And similarly, in the

93
00:05:15,361 --> 00:05:18,794
GI tract, you can imagine. Lets say a baby is taking milk

94
00:05:18,794 --> 00:05:21,194
and the stomach is getting really distended

95
00:05:21,194 --> 00:05:24,494
you might also imagine that that information would go back

96
00:05:24,494 --> 00:05:26,394
to the respiratory center as well, in this case

97
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:28,427
through cranial nerve number ten

98
00:05:28,427 --> 00:05:31,121
So, we have information about pressure

99
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:32,267
or stretch. We also have information about

100
00:05:32,267 --> 00:05:35,424
chemicals coming in. But what about information

101
00:05:35,424 --> 00:05:36,755
on things like, I don't know, things like

102
00:05:36,755 --> 00:05:39,720
anxiety for instance, or fear. Lets say

103
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,438
someones having these emotions, right?

104
00:05:42,438 --> 00:05:45,088
Their breathing patterns may change.

105
00:05:45,088 --> 00:05:47,755
Maybe they're in pain. So these kinds of things

106
00:05:47,755 --> 00:05:51,755
are actually coming from the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus.

107
00:05:51,755 --> 00:05:54,955
So this is another region of the brain that's sending

108
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,763
information down to the respiratory center and

109
00:05:57,763 --> 00:06:01,121
helping to affect how we breathe. And finally,

110
00:06:01,121 --> 00:06:03,939
this is probably the largest part of our picture,

111
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:06,621
this is our cerebrum and the cerebrum is responsible

112
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:10,255
for all voluntary stuff that we do. Things like singing

113
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:12,588
where you gotta control your breath or maybe

114
00:06:12,588 --> 00:06:14,220
you're playing a musical instrument or maybe,

115
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,188
you're yelling or screaming, lets put yelling down here

116
00:06:18,188 --> 00:06:20,755
anything like that, you're going to want to control

117
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,768
your breath, right, and so that's all voluntary

118
00:06:23,768 --> 00:06:27,020
control. So this is our voluntary control and its

119
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,760
good that actually we have this mechanism so that

120
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,499
we can, if we want to, we can change our breathing

121
00:06:32,499 --> 00:06:34,621
pattern but its also great that our respiratory center

122
00:06:34,621 --> 00:06:37,840
can work on its own. Can you imagine if you had to

123
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,388
always think about taking a breath, you couldn't

124
00:06:40,388 --> 00:06:42,345
do anything else right? You couldn't sleep,

125
00:06:42,345 --> 00:06:44,342
you couldn't eat, you'd always just be thinking

126
00:06:44,342 --> 00:06:46,989
about taking a breath so that you, you wouldn't miss

127
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,821
the next breath and you know, subsequently,

128
00:06:48,821 --> 00:06:52,488
run out of air. So this is all the information coming

129
00:06:52,488 --> 00:06:54,988
into our respiratory center. Let me just scootch this over

130
00:06:54,988 --> 00:06:57,388
and I shall show you now what our brain can do with

131
00:06:57,388 --> 00:06:59,992
that information to actually make sure that we're

132
00:06:59,992 --> 00:07:02,593
breathing comfortably. This is our spinal column

133
00:07:02,593 --> 00:07:06,621
and I'm going to just label out the motor nerves and

134
00:07:06,621 --> 00:07:10,020
some of the muscle groups. So we've got motor nerve

135
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,388
and muscle groups and there are 4 key muscle

136
00:07:12,388 --> 00:07:15,921
groups that are going to be controlled by our

137
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:17,593
respiratory center and we are gonna go through

138
00:07:17,593 --> 00:07:19,172
them kind of one by one. So the first one and

139
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:21,494
the one that people usually always kind of talk about

140
00:07:21,494 --> 00:07:23,787
or think about is this one right here. This is going to

141
00:07:23,787 --> 00:07:30,020
be C3, C4 and C5. So C3 through C5 and the muscle

142
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,055
is the diaphragm. This is the giant muscle that

143
00:07:33,055 --> 00:07:36,588
kinda sits right below our lungs and when it contracts

144
00:07:36,588 --> 00:07:39,095
you take in a nice deep breath. But it doesn't

145
00:07:39,095 --> 00:07:41,121
work alone right? We've got other muscles involved

146
00:07:41,121 --> 00:07:42,996
as well and so I'm actually going to sketch out what

147
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:44,521
these other muscle groups are and the first one

148
00:07:44,521 --> 00:07:49,172
is T1 through T11, all these levels are going to

149
00:07:49,172 --> 00:07:53,166
send off a little nerve and each nerve will go through

150
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:57,345
a different intercostal muscle. So intercostal muscles

151
00:07:57,345 --> 00:08:00,829
these are the muscles that kind of go between the ribs

152
00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:04,265
these are gonna help expand or pull out your ribs

153
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:06,621
right, so these are very important for breathing as well

154
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:11,230
A little bit lower then, you also have these

155
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,624
abdominal muscles. Abdominal muscles here

156
00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:15,456
are gonna be T6 through L1. These are the levels

157
00:08:15,456 --> 00:08:19,687
where the little nerve fibers come out and

158
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:23,421
are gonna help innervate or uh, help these muscles

159
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:26,464
the abdominal muscles contract. So this is our 3rd

160
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:30,132
group of muscles and they're controlled by these

161
00:08:30,132 --> 00:08:33,289
spinal levels and the final group would be this

162
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:35,797
group up here. So this is actually C1

163
00:08:35,797 --> 00:08:40,021
through C3. C1 through C3 and these would be the

164
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:42,624
accessory muscles. Accessory muscles are the ones

165
00:08:42,624 --> 00:08:44,807
that uh usually I think of them as the ones around

166
00:08:44,807 --> 00:08:47,188
your neck area and they're gonna also kinda help

167
00:08:47,188 --> 00:08:49,637
pull out the ribcage and expand the lungs.

168
00:08:49,637 --> 00:08:52,621
So there you have it, you have information coming

169
00:08:52,621 --> 00:08:54,921
in, that's the stuff that we started talking about,

170
00:08:54,921 --> 00:08:57,950
from all the different locations around chemicals

171
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,755
information about pressure and, you know, your

172
00:09:00,755 --> 00:09:02,688
emotional status and what you're thinking about

173
00:09:02,688 --> 00:09:05,255
doing, you know voluntarily. All that information

174
00:09:05,255 --> 00:09:07,821
is going to come in and then the respiratory center has

175
00:09:07,821 --> 00:09:10,628
to decide, uh, how to kind of balance all that

176
00:09:10,628 --> 00:09:12,955
information and then on the way out, its going to be

177
00:09:12,955 --> 00:09:16,294
able to execute by controlling all these different

178
00:09:16,294 --> 00:09:18,355
muscle groups and sending information down

179
00:09:18,355 --> 00:09:21,126
the motor nerves that we just listed to the 4 big

180
00:09:21,126 --> 00:09:22,667
groups of muscles.
