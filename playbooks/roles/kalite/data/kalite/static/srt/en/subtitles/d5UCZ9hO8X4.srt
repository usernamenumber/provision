1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
What we have drawn over here is 5 different triangles

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,790
What I wanna do in this video is

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,700
figure out which of these triangles are congruent

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,370
to which other of these triangles

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,100
And to figure that out I'm just

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,750
over here, going to write our triangle congruency postulates

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,610
So we know that 2 triangles are congruent

8
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,300
if all of their sides are the same

9
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,420
So side, side, side

10
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,660
We also know they are congruent if we have a side

11
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,670
and then an angle between the sides,

12
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,670
and then another side that is congruent

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,800
So side-angle-side

14
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,970
If we reverse the angles and the sides,

15
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,280
we know that's also a congruence postulates

16
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,590
So if we have an angle and then another angle,

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,220
and then the side in between them is congruent,

18
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,100
then we also have 2 congruent triangles

19
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,080
And then finally, if we have an angle and then another angle,

20
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,560
and then a side, then that is also

21
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,980
Any of these imply congruencies

22
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,030
So let's see our congruent triangles

23
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,320
So let's see what we can figure out

24
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,650
right over here for these triangles

25
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,210
So right in this triangle ABC over here,

26
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:02,610
we're given this length 7, then 60 degrees, and then 40 degrees,

27
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,800
or another way, think about it

28
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,410
We're given an angle, an angle, and a side

29
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,390
40 degrees, and 60 degrees, then 7

30
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,000
And in order for something to be congruent here,

31
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,340
they would have to have an angle-angle side given

32
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,990
at least, unless we made

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,620
We have to figure it out some other way,

34
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,200
but I'm guessing for this problem

35
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,850
Though this already gave us the angles,

36
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,520
so do I have to have an angle and angle side

37
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,340
And it can't just be any angle angled side

38
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,610
It has to be 40, 60 and 7

39
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,490
And it has to be in the same order

40
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,860
It can't be 60 and then 40 and then 7

41
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,800
The if the 40 degrees side has

42
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,730
if one of its side has a length 7,

43
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,370
then that is not the same thing here

44
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,460
Here the 60 degrees side has length 7

45
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,740
So let's see if any of these other triangles

46
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,690
have this kind of 40, 60 degrees

47
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,510
and then the 7 right over here

48
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,660
So this has the 40 degrees and the 60 degrees

49
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,390
but the 7 is in between them

50
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,600
So this looks like it might be congruent to some other triangle

51
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,220
Maybe closer to something like angle-side-angle

52
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,720
'cause they have an angle-side-angle

53
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,790
So it wouldn't be that one

54
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,190
This one looks interesting

55
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,010
This is also angle side angle,

56
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,260
so maybe, these are congruent but we'll check back on that

57
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,980
We're still focused on this one right over here

58
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:09,840
And this one we have a 60 degrees, then a 40 degrees, and a 7

59
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,290
This is tempting

60
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,760
We have an angle, an angle and a side,

61
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,910
but the angles are in a different order

62
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,210
Here it's 40-60-7

63
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,510
Here it's 60-40-7

64
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,300
So that's an angle and angle and side,

65
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,600
but the side is not on the 40 degree on the 60 degree angle

66
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,320
It's on the 40 degree angle over here

67
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,680
So this doesn't look right either

68
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:32,960
Here we have 40 degrees, 60 degrees, and then 7

69
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,390
So this is looking pretty good

70
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,190
We have this side right over here

71
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,140
Is congruent to this side right over here

72
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,800
Then you have your,

73
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,240
you have your 60 degree angle right over here

74
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,650
60 degree angle over here

75
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,800
So it may not be obvious 'cause it's flipped

76
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,680
and they've they're drawn a little bit different

77
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,900
We should never assume that

78
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,360
just the drawing tells you what's going on

79
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,350
And then finally, you have your 40 degree angle here

80
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,430
which is your 40 degree angle here

81
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,420
So we can say we can write down that

82
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,390
And I'll do it

83
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,620
Let me think of a good place to do it

84
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,070
I'll write it right over here

85
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:14,320
We can write down that triangle ABC is congruent to triangle

86
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,300
And now we have to be very careful with how we name this

87
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,100
We have to make sure that we have the corresponding

88
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,960
the corresponding vertices mapped up together

89
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,900
So for example, we started this triangle at vertex A,

90
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,950
so point A right over here that's where we have the 60 degree angle

91
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,660
That's the vertex of the 60 degree angle

92
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,990
So the vertex of the 60 degree angle over here is point N

93
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,580
So I'm gonna go to N

94
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,830
And then we work from A to B

95
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,440
B was the side was the vertex that

96
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,700
we did not have any angle for

97
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,120
And we could figure it out

98
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,940
if these 2 guys add up to a hundred,

99
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,280
and this is going to be the A degree angle

100
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,480
So over here, the A degree angle is going to be M,

101
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,860
the one that we don't have any label for

102
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,830
It's kind of the other side

103
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,170
It's the thing that shares the 7, the 7 length side right over here

104
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,900
So then we wanna go to N then M,

105
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,580
and then finish up sorry

106
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:04,990
And M, and M, and then finish up the triangle

107
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,460
And oh!

108
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,700
And I wanna really stress this

109
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:09,110
That we have to make sure we get the order of this right,

110
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,460
'cause then we're kind of referring to

111
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,400
We're not showing the corresponding vertices in each triangle

112
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:18,200
Now we see vertex A or point A maps to point N

113
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,400
on this congruent triangle

114
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,330
Vertex B maps to point M

115
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,170
And so you can say,

116
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,650
"Look AB the length of AB is congruent to NM "

117
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,910
So it all matches up

118
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,360
And we can say that these 2 are

119
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:36,610
congruent by angle, angle side, by AAS

120
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,250
So we did this one is this one right over here is

121
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,920
congruent to this one right over there

122
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,860
And now let's look at these 2 characters

123
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,390
So here we have an angle, 40 degrees,

124
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,620
a side in between and then another angle

125
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:53,040
So it looks like ASA is going to be involved

126
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,870
We look at this one right over here

127
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,160
We have a 40 degrees, 40 degrees, 7 and then 60

128
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,580
And you might say,

129
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,310
"Wait, here the 40 degrees is on the bottom

130
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,240
and here it's on the top "

131
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,770
But remember, things can be congruent if you can flip them

132
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,190
If you can flip them, rotate them, shift them, whatever

133
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,290
So if you flip this guy over, you will get this one over here

134
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,740
And that would not have happened if

135
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,540
you had flipped this one to get this one over here

136
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,730
So you see these 2 by you have

137
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,930
Let me just make it clear

138
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,450
You have this 60 degree angle

139
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,260
Is congruent to this 60 degree angle

140
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,720
You have this side of length 7

141
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,470
Is congruent to this side of length 7

142
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,870
And then you have the 40 degree angle

143
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,640
Is congruent to this 40 degree angle

144
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:34,640
So once again, these 2 characters are congruent to each other

145
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,910
And we can write

146
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,060
I'll write it where I have to

147
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,010
I'll write it right over here

148
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:46,820
We can say triangle DEF, triangle DEF is congruent to triangle

149
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,150
And here we have to be careful again

150
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,880
D point D is the vertex for the 60 degrees side

151
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,440
So I'm gonna start it at H

152
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,790
which is the vertex of the 60 degrees side over here,

153
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,870
is congruent to triangle H

154
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,830
And then we went from D to E

155
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,050
E is the vertex on the 40 degrees side

156
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,050
Kind of the other vertex that shares

157
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,160
the 7 length segment right over here

158
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,350
So we wanna go from H to G

159
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,070
HGI

160
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,670
And we know that from angle-side-angle by,

161
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,960
by angle-side-angle

162
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,260
And so that gives us it

163
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,310
That character right over there is

164
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,420
congruent to this character right over here

165
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,460
And then finally we're left with this pool chap

166
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:28,460
And it looks like it is not congruent to any of them

167
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,660
It is tempting to try to match it up to this one,

168
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,970
especially 'cause the angles here are on the bottom,

169
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,390
and you have the 7 side over here

170
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,280
Angles here on the bottom and the 7 side over here,

171
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,810
but it doesn't match up

172
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,850
because the order of the angles aren't the same

173
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,470
You don't have the same corresponding angles

174
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,790
If you try to do this little exercise,

175
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,330
when you map everything to each other,

176
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,430
you wouldn't be able to do it right over here

177
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,990
And this over here, you know,

178
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,250
it might have been a trick question

179
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,370
or maybe if you did the math,

180
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,040
and this was like a 40 or a 60 degree angle,

181
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,090
maybe then maybe, you could have match this

182
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,250
to some of the other triangles

183
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,590
And maybe some of them to each other,

184
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,570
but this last angle and all of these cases,

185
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,810
40 plus 60 is a hundred

186
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,330
This is going to be an 80 degree angle right over there

187
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,410
They have to add up to an 180

188
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,060
This is an 80 degree angle

189
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,100
This is an 80 degree angle

190
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,370
If this ended up by the math being a 40

191
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,340
or a 60 degree angle,

192
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,840
then it could have been a little bit more interesting

193
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,600
There might have been other congruent pairs

194
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,550
But this is an 80 degree angle in every case

195
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,890
The other angle is 80 degrees

196
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,720
So this is just alone, unfortunately for him

197
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,750
He is not able to find a congruent companion
