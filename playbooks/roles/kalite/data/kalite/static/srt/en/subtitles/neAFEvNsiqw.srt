1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,790
So let's see if we can get a
big picture of everything

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,760
that's happening in this credit
default swap market.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,350
I'll speak in generalities.

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:15,950
Let's say we have Corporation
A, Corporation

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:20,420
B, Corporation C.

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,950
And let's say we have a bunch of
people who write the credit

7
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,830
default swaps, and I'll
call them insurers.

8
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,740
Because that's essentially what
a credit default swap is,

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,250
it's insurance on debt.

10
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,710
If someone doesn't pay the
debt, then the insurance

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,790
company will pay it for you.

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,230
In exchange, you're essentially
giving some of the

13
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,200
interest on the debt.

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,710
So let's say we have Insurer
1, let's say we

15
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,050
have Insurer 2.

16
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,040
And some of these were insurance
companies, some of

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,290
these were banks.

18
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,210
Some of these may have even
been hedge funds.

19
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,120
So these are the people who
write the credit default

20
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,930
swaps, and then there are the
people who would actually buy

21
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,000
the credit default swaps.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,590
In the previous example, I had
Pension Fund 1, that was my

23
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,780
pension fund.

24
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:16,920
Then you could have another
pension fund, Pension Fund 2.

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,950
Let's re-draw some of the
connections between the

26
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,420
organizations.

27
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:32,680
Let's say Pension Fund 1 were
to lend $1 billion to A.

28
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:38,895
A will pay Pension Fund 1 10%.

29
00:01:38,895 --> 00:01:42,770
But Pension Fund 1 wants to
make sure that they'll

30
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,140
definitely get the money,
because they can't lend money

31
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,360
to people with anything less
than stellar credit ratings.

32
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,360
So they get some insurance
from Insurer 1.

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,570
So what they do is out of this
10%, they pay them some of the

34
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:55,380
basis points.

35
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,190
So let's say they pay them
100 basis points.

36
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:06,550
And in exchange, they get-- I'll
call it Insurance On A.

37
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,639
This is this new notation
that I'm creating.

38
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,490
They get Insurance On A.

39
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,450
Fair enough.

40
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:15,820
And the reason why this I1, this
first insurer was able to

41
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,890
do that is because Moody's
has given them a

42
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,380
very high credit rating.

43
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,400
And so when they insure
something, you're essentially

44
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,340
the total package, right?

45
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:30,000
The loan to this guy, plus the
insurance, kind of is like

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,750
you're lending the money to
this guy, but you're just

47
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,990
getting more insurance-- I
mean you're getting more

48
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,080
interest, right?

49
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,305
So this bond becomes
a Double A bond.

50
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:42,250
Because the odds that you are
not going to get your money

51
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,780
are not the odds that this guy
defaults, but it's now the

52
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,550
odds that this guy defaults.

53
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,420
And Moody's or Standard & Poor's have already said.

54
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,860
Hey, these guys are good for
their money, they're Double A

55
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,180
or whatever.

56
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,960
So now your risk is really a
Double A risk and not a Double

57
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,140
B risk, or whatever.

58
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,980
But anyway, this happens.

59
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,880
This is Corporation B, and maybe
Pension Fund 2 wants to

60
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,420
lend to Corporation B.

61
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,710
Maybe they lend them
$2 billion.

62
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,005
They get, I don't know, they get
12%, maybe Corporation B

63
00:03:16,005 --> 00:03:17,590
is a little bit more
dangerous.

64
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,340
But once again, they go
to this first insurer.

65
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,470
And maybe they get some of it--
well let's just say they

66
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,720
get Insurance On B.

67
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,470
And B is a little bit riskier,
so they have to

68
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,800
pay 200 basis points.

69
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,780
200 basis points goes from
Pension Fund 2 to B.

70
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,560
Now this, already, this is a
little bit dangerous, right?

71
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,280
Because you can think about
what's happening.

72
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,730
One, as long as this insurer
does not get a downgrade from

73
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:47,000
their credit ratings from S&P
or Moody's or whoever, they

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,860
can just keep it issuing
this insurance.

75
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,080
There's no limit for how much
insurance they can issue.

76
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,890
There's no law that says, you
know what, if you insure a

77
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,930
billion dollars of debt,
you have to put a

78
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,180
billion dollars aside.

79
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,960
So that if that debt defaults,
you definitely have that

80
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,300
billion dollars there.

81
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,650
Or if you insure 2 billion here,
you don't have to put

82
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,890
that 2 billion aside.

83
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,820
What you have is a bunch of
people who statistically say,

84
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,640
oh, you know, what's the
probability that all of this

85
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,180
debt defaults?

86
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,640
So I just have to keep enough
capital so that

87
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,399
probabilistically, whatever debt
defaults, I can pay it.

88
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,360
But you don't keep enough
capital to pay all of the

89
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,340
defaulting debt.

90
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,540
So you already see an
interesting risk forming.

91
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,180
What if all of these
corporations, for whatever

92
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,900
reason, do start defaulting
simultaneously?

93
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,090
Then all of a sudden this
insurance company has to pay

94
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,050
more out in insurance then it
might even have. So you have

95
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,080
to wonder whether it even
deserves this Double A rating,

96
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,040
because it actually is taking
on a lot of risk.

97
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,240
But in the short term, while
these companies are-- everyone

98
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,600
is doing well and the economy's
doing well, it's a

99
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,030
great business for these guys.

100
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,540
These guys are just collecting
premiums essentially on the

101
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,200
insurance, without having
to pay out anything.

102
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,440
Now let's add another
twist on it.

103
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,800
These pension funds, P1 and P2,
it was reasonable for them

104
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,530
to get insurance, because they
were giving out these loans

105
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,470
and then they got
the insurance.

106
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,500
So they were essentially hedging
the default risk by

107
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,380
buying these credit default
swaps, which was essentially

108
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,790
just an insurance policy
from this Insurer 1.

109
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,790
But you can have
another party.

110
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,690
This is no less legitimate,
really.

111
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,460
But you could call them-- I
don't know-- let's call it

112
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,710
Hedge Fund 1.

113
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,640
And they've done a lot of work,
and frankly, they often

114
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,820
are much more sophisticated
than the pension fund-- in

115
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,830
fact, they almost always are.

116
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,440
And they say, you know what?

117
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,650
Company B looks really, really,
really, really shady.

118
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:44,370
I think 200 basis points for
the chance that Company B

119
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,770
defaults is frankly cheap.

120
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,890
Because I think there's
a huge probability

121
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,450
that Company B defaults.

122
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,390
So what I'm going to do, I'm
not going to lend Company B

123
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,350
money, because if anything, I
think that they're maybe about

124
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,600
to go out of business.

125
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,960
But what I can do is I can buy
a credit default swap on

126
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,480
Company B's debt.

127
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,910
Which is, essentially, I'm
getting insurance that they

128
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,330
fail without actually
lending the money.

129
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,310
So let's say I do that
from Insurer 2.

130
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:16,220
So I can go and I'll pay Insurer
2 200 basis points a

131
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:20,810
year, or 2% on the notional
value of the

132
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,050
insurance I'm getting.

133
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,260
So let's say it's 200 basis
points, and let's say that's

134
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,390
Insurance On-- I'm making a big
bet-- so they're going to

135
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:39,350
give me Insurance On B for--
I don't know-- $10 billion.

136
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,310
And something interesting is
going on here already.

137
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,910
B might not have even borrowed
$10 billion, right?

138
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,230
So all of a sudden you have
this hedge fund that is

139
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,300
getting insurance on more
debt than B has even

140
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,140
borrowed money on, right?

141
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,690
And it's essentially, you just
kind of have this side bet

142
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,220
between these two parties.

143
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,400
This party says,
you know what?

144
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,410
I think it's a good deal.

145
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:03,170
I get 200 basis points on the 10
billion every year, as long

146
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,110
as B doesn't default.

147
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,950
And this guy says, I think
B's going to default.

148
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,180
So I think that's a good
deal on that insurance.

149
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,040
And just so you understand the
math, so the notional value is

150
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,320
$10 billion.

151
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,200
So what's 2% of 10 billion?

152
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:23,710
2% on a billion is 20 million,
so it's $200 million.

153
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,360
200 if I did my math correct.

154
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,690
So they'll pay $200 million
a year to this insurer.

155
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,020
So the 200 basis points
on 10 billion is

156
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,280
equal to 200 million.

157
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,910
These numbers maybe are a little
bit on the big side,

158
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:37,620
but who knows?

159
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,000
Actually, this could be
a huge hedge fund.

160
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,210
This could be a $10 billion
hedge fund.

161
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:47,200
Or even worse, maybe it's a
billion dollar hedge fund, or

162
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,430
maybe it's a $20 million hedge
fund, but they've taken a $180

163
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,700
million loan to essentially
buy this insurance because

164
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,450
they think that B's collapse
is imminent.

165
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,890
So they're willing to take
that bet right now.

166
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,270
You know, it might
be a good bet.

167
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:06,680
If B collapses tomorrow,
what's going to happen?

168
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,410
They only dished out maybe 200
million for maybe that first

169
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,480
year, although you normally pay
it on a quarterly basis.

170
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,680
So they'll pay 50 million
every three months.

171
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,150
Let's say they pay the first
payment, 50 million, right?

172
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:19,280
And then over the next three
months, B just goes bankrupt

173
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,410
and people realize that debt
was worth nothing.

174
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,220
Then these guys get
$10 billion.

175
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,290
Right?

176
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,340
But something else is
interesting here.

177
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,670
They probably did insurance to
a lot of other people too,

178
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:33,549
maybe on B's debt.

179
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:33,950
Right?

180
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:38,150
Or maybe they also
insured A's debt.

181
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,809
So maybe they gave
some insurance on

182
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:42,750
A's debt, as well.

183
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,780
So what happens?

184
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:49,310
Let's say B all of a
sudden defaults.

185
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,230
So a couple of things happen.

186
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:57,480
I1 is going to owe P2
$2 billion, right?

187
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,740
I2, the second insurer, is going
to owe this hedge fund

188
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,840
$10 billion.

189
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,270
Now let's just assume I2's
good for the money.

190
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:09,610
They have $10 billion they
pay to this hedge fund.

191
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:12,370
This hedge fund is great, they
get great bonuses for the year

192
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,720
and they go buy yachts,
et cetera.

193
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,970
But this insurer right here,
they pay the money they were

194
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,560
good for but something
interesting might happen.

195
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,310
All of a sudden Moody's finally
wakes up, these

196
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,710
ratings agencies, and
says, oh, my God.

197
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,100
Well, there's a couple of things
that might make them

198
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,150
say, oh, my God.

199
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,660
First of all, they might
say, oh, look.

200
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,250
You have to pay out
$10 billion.

201
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,470
And I doubt that was the only
person you have to pay, maybe

202
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,670
they have to pay out
a lot of money.

203
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:41,680
Now I2, Insurance Company 2,
you are undercapitalized.

204
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,390
I am now going to downgrade
your rating.

205
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:49,400
So, you were Double A, but since
you had to give out all

206
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,810
of this capital, Moody's is now
going to downgrade you to,

207
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,520
I don't know, B+.

208
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,570
I'm just making these
ratings up.

209
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,620
But that's the sound of how
these ratings happen, right.

210
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,250
A is better, B is worse.

211
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,410
The more A's you have,
the better it is.

212
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:10,120
But all of a sudden, when this
guy is B+, and this guy

213
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,590
insured, let's say, some other
corporation's debt for this

214
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,500
pension fund, now all of a
sudden this insurance that

215
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,560
this pension fund had is no
longer Double A Insurance.

216
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,500
It's now B+ Insurance, and maybe
this pension fund, by

217
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,400
its charter, can't hold
something that

218
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,220
has a B+ credit rating.

219
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,430
So they're going to have to
unwind the transaction, or

220
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:36,220
maybe they'll have to unload
the debt that was insured.

221
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:42,680
So one, just by Company B
defaulting, maybe this guy was

222
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,650
holding some of Company A's
debt, and it was insured by

223
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,900
Insurance Company 1.

224
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,630
Now they're going to have
to unload that debt.

225
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:52,370
So just one default creates this
chain reaction, right?

226
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:56,080
This one default happens, this
guy has to pay this guy money,

227
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,090
then this guy gets
undercapitalized since they

228
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,480
have to pay out money.

229
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,680
Then Moody's says, oh, my God,
you're undercapitalized.

230
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,180
We're going to reduce
your ratings.

231
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:07,530
Maybe this guy was insuring
some of A's debt, but now

232
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:11,860
since he was insuring some of
A's debt, all of a sudden that

233
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,480
insurance is worth less because
it has a lower rating.

234
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,965
And now A's debt, less people
want to hold it, because there

235
00:11:18,965 --> 00:11:20,360
are less people to insure it.

236
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,110
I know that's very confusing,
but this is really the point

237
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:27,140
that Warren Buffett was saying
when he said that the credit

238
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,550
defaults swap market, or in
general, the derivative

239
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:33,060
market, are financial weapons
of mass destruction.

240
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,570
Because you have so many people
who didn't have to set

241
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,590
aside a capital, right?

242
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:39,800
This guy could insure $10
billion worth of debt without

243
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,740
having to set aside
$10 billion.

244
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,620
And you have so many people
making all of these side bets,

245
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,910
but they're all making
two core assumptions.

246
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:50,490
One, that these rating
agencies's ratings are valid.

247
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,810
And two, that the other person
is good for the money.

248
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,420
But if all of a sudden you have
one failure someplace in

249
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,740
the system, you could have
this cascade where one,

250
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,300
there's just a lot
of downgrades.

251
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,260
And then a lot of the people
end up not being

252
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,010
good for the money.
