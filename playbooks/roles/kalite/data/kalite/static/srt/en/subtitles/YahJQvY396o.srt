1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620
   

2
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,960
We need to factor 49x squared
minus 49y squared.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,520
Now here there's a pattern
that you might already be

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,190
familiar with.

5
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,910
But just to make sure you are,
let's think about what happens

6
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,870
if we multiply a plus b-- where
these are just two terms

7
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:21,000
in a binomial-- times
a minus b.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,210
If you multiply this out, you
have a times a, which is a

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:30,660
squared, plus a times negative
b, which is negative ab--

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,280
that's a times negative b-- plus
b times a, which is the

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,150
same thing as ab.

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,780
And then you have b times
negative b, which

13
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,830
is negative b squared.

14
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,230
So when you do that, you have
a negative ab and a positive

15
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,390
ab, they cancel out.

16
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,840
And you're just going
to be left with an a

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,720
squared minus a b squared.

18
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,420
Now, this thing that we have
here is exactly that pattern.

19
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,870
49x squared is a
perfect square.

20
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,030
49y squared is a
perfect square.

21
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,740
We can rewrite it like that.

22
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:05,900
We could rewrite this over here
as 7x squared minus-- and

23
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,560
I'll do it in blue--
minus 7y squared.

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,620
And so you see it's a pattern.

25
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,200
It's a squared minus
b squared.

26
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,600
So if you wanted to factor
this-- if you would just use

27
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,400
this pattern that we just
derived-- you would say that

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:32,090
this is the same thing as a,
7x plus b plus 7y times 7x

29
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,880
minus b, minus 7y.

30
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,290
And you'd be done.

31
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,980
Now there's one alternate way
that you could factor this and

32
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,380
it'd be completely legitimate.

33
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,530
You could start from
the beginning and

34
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,350
say, you know what?

35
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,470
49 is a common factor here, so
let me just factor that out.

36
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:51,380
So you could say it's equivalent
to 49 times x

37
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,615
squared minus y squared.

38
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:58,820
And you say, oh, this fits the
pattern of-- this is a squared

39
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,980
minus b squared.

40
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,190
So this will be x plus
y times x minus y.

41
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,880
So the whole thing would
be 49 times x plus y

42
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,979
times x minus y.

43
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:12,860
And to see that this, right
here, is the exact same thing

44
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:17,140
as this right over here, you
could just factor 7 out of

45
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:17,970
both of these.

46
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,840
You'd factor out a 7 out
of that term, a factor

47
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,530
7 out of that term.

48
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:23,380
And when you multiply them,
you'd get the 49.

49
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:27,650
So these are-- this or this--
these are both ways to factor

50
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,110
this expression.

51
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,800
