1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,640
   

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:00,850
In

3
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:04,750
the last video, I claimed that
this result we got for the area

4
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:09,770
of a triangle that had sides
of length a, b, and c is

5
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,810
equivalent to Heron's formula.

6
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,150
And what I want to do in this
video is show you that this is

7
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,780
equivalent to Heron's formula
by essentially just doing a

8
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,990
bunch of algebraic
manipulation.

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,590
So the first thing we want to
do-- let's just spring this

10
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,590
1/2 c under the radical sign.

11
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:28,170
So 1/2 c, that's the same
thing as the square root

12
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,480
of c squared over 4.

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,910
You take the square root
of that you get 1/2 c.

14
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,270
So this whole expression is
equal to-- instead of drawing

15
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,450
the radical, I'll just write
the square root of this,

16
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:48,200
of c squared over 4
times all of this.

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,530
I'll just copy and paste it.

18
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,040
   

19
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,610
Copy and paste.

20
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,160
So times all of that.

21
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,160
And of course, it has
to be distributed.

22
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,960
So c squared over 4
times all of that.

23
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,390
And then we have to
close the square root.

24
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,990
   

25
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,460
Let me just distribute
the c squared over 4.

26
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,960
This is going to be equal
to the square root.

27
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,940
This is going to be hairy,
but I think you'll find it

28
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,620
satisfying to see how this
could turn into something as

29
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,470
simple as Heron's formula.

30
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:24,660
The square root of c squared
over 4 times a squared is c

31
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:32,560
squared a squared over 4,
minus c squared over 4.

32
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,270
I'm just distributing this.

33
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,600
And I'm going to write it as
the numerator squared over

34
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,060
the denominator squared.

35
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,090
So times c squared plus
a squared minus b

36
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,950
squared, squared.

37
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,815
Over-- if I square the
denominator that's 4c squared.

38
00:01:49,815 --> 00:01:52,790
   

39
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,840
And we immediately see that c
squared and that c squared

40
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,600
are going to cancel out.

41
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,260
Let me close all of the
parentheses just like that.

42
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,530
And, of course, this 4 times
that 4, that's going to

43
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,520
result in-- well let
me write it this way.

44
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,490
That's the same
thing as 4 squared.

45
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,850
And I'm instead of writing
16, you'll see why

46
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,890
I'm writing that.

47
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,880
Now this I can rewrite.

48
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,040
   

49
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,340
This is going to be equal to
the square root-- I'm

50
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,460
arbitrarily switching colors--
of ca over 2 squared.

51
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,390
   

52
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,780
This is the same thing as that.

53
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:25,990
Right?

54
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,150
I'm just writing it as
the whole thing squared.

55
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,360
If I square that, that's the c
squared a squared over 2

56
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,930
squared over 4, minus-- and I'm
going to write this whole thing

57
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,520
as an expression squared.

58
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,800
So that's c squared
plus a squared minus

59
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,360
b squared, over 4.

60
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,810
And we are squaring both the
numerator and the denominator.

61
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,410
   

62
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,740
Now this might look a little
bit interesting to you.

63
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,120
Let me make the parentheses in
a slightly different color.

64
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,775
You might remember from
factoring polynomials that if I

65
00:03:00,775 --> 00:03:03,460
have something of the form x
squared minus y squared, that

66
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:08,520
factors into x plus
y times x minus y.

67
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,000
And we're going to be using
this over and over again.

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,590
Now if you call ca over 2x, and
you call this whole big thing

69
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,110
y, then we have x squared
minus y squared.

70
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,390
So we can factor it.

71
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:27,966
So this whole thing is going to
be equal to the square root of

72
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:34,740
x plus y, or in this case it's
ca over 2 plus the y, which is

73
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:40,960
c squared plus a squared
minus b squared over 4.

74
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,020
Times x minus y.

75
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,570
So this is our x.

76
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:51,370
ca over 2, minus all of
this business over here.

77
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,840
Or even better, let me just
say plus and then let me

78
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,680
just write the negative.

79
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:01,980
So plus minus c squared minus
a squared plus b squared.

80
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,140
All of that over 4.

81
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:10,180
So all I did here is I said
this is the same thing as this

82
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:15,120
plus this, this plus this,
times this minus this, this

83
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,610
minus-- I just said plus
the negative of this.

84
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,770
So minus c squared minus a
squared plus b squared.

85
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:24,470
All I did is that right there.

86
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,610
Now let's see if we can
simplify this, or if we

87
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,870
could add these fractions.

88
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,680
Well, we can get a
common denominator.

89
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,650
ca over 2, that's the same
thing as 2ca over 4.

90
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,910
ca over 2, that's the same
thing as 2ca over 4, just

91
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,160
multiplying the numerator
and the denominator by 2.

92
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,420
And now we can add
the numerators.

93
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:49,540
So our whole expression is now
going to be equal to the square

94
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:55,645
root of this first expression,
will become-- and I'm going

95
00:04:55,645 --> 00:04:56,460
to write it this way.

96
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:07,820
I'm going to write c squared
plus 2ca plus a squared minus b

97
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,820
squared, all of that over 4.

98
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,900
That's our first expression.

99
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:18,010
And then our second expression
is going to become-- well,

100
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,190
everything's going to be over
4, so I'll just write

101
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,070
that right now.

102
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,965
Everything over 4.

103
00:05:21,965 --> 00:05:27,280
   

104
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:36,030
And then we could write this
as b squared, minus c squared

105
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:43,490
minus 2ca plus a squared.

106
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,570
Just to make sure, I have
a minus a squared here.

107
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,320
Plus times a minus, still
it's a minus a squared.

108
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,420
I have a plus 2ca over here.

109
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,080
Minus times a minus,
that's a plus 2ca.

110
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,580
I have a minus c squared here.

111
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,170
I have a minus c squared here.

112
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:00,530
So these two things
are equivalent.

113
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,630
Now the next thing we need to
recognize, or hopefully we can

114
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:09,940
recognize, is that this over
here-- this might get a little

115
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,690
bit messy-- that's the same
thing as c plus a squared.

116
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,350
Let me write this.

117
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:20,860
This is equal to the square
root, open parentheses, of this

118
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:29,940
over here is c plus a squared
minus b squared, over 4.

119
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,480
That's that first term.

120
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,020
And then the second term.

121
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,920
This over here is the same
thing as c minus a squared.

122
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,120
So that whole thing will
simplify to b squared

123
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:47,470
minus c minus a squared,
all of that over 4.

124
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,910
So we're making some headway.

125
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,830
As I told you, this
is a hairy problem.

126
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,950
But we're seeing some neat
applications of factoring

127
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:57,320
polynomials, and we're seeing
how a fairly bizarre looking

128
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,160
equation can be transformed
into a simpler one.

129
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,090
Now we can use this exact same
property-- we have that

130
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,770
pattern-- something squared
minus something else squared.

131
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,310
   

132
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,500
So we can factor it out.

133
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,580
And I'll do it in
the same line.

134
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,120
So this is going to be equal
to-- I'm going to write a

135
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,040
little bit small, just so I
don't run out of space--

136
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,310
the square root.

137
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:20,000
This will factor into
this plus this.

138
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:29,510
So c plus a plus b times
c plus a minus b.

139
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:29,850
Right?

140
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,030
It's the exact same pattern
that I did over here.

141
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,470
This is x squared,
this is y squared.

142
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:41,760
So times c plus a minus
b, all of that over 4.

143
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,260
And then we have this one.

144
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,250
This is going to be
b plus c minus a.

145
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:50,620
   

146
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,180
Let me scroll down to
the right a little bit.

147
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:59,030
Times b plus c minus a--
that's x plus y-- times

148
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:02,640
b minus c minus a.

149
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:09,020
Or that's the same thing
as b minus c plus a.

150
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:13,110
This is the same thing
as b minus c minus a.

151
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,140
Right?

152
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:14,570
All right.

153
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:20,370
And all of that over 4.

154
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,910
Now, I can rewrite this
whole expression.

155
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,580
I don't want to
run out of space.

156
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,305
I can rewrite this whole
expression as, well 4 is

157
00:08:30,305 --> 00:08:32,955
the product of 2 times 2.

158
00:08:32,955 --> 00:08:36,380
   

159
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,620
So our whole area expression
has been, arguably, simplified

160
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,780
to it equals the square root--
and this is really the home

161
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:50,560
stretch-- of this right here,
which I can just write as

162
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,780
a plus b plus c over 2.

163
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,690
That's that term right there.

164
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,640
Times this term.

165
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,480
Times that term.

166
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,340
And let me write a
simplification here. c plus a

167
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:13,200
minus b, that's the same thing
as a plus b plus c minus 2b.

168
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,490
These two things
are equivalent.

169
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:14,700
Right?

170
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:19,450
You have an a, you have a c,
and then b minus 2b is going

171
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:22,510
to be equal to minus b.

172
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,750
Right? b minus 2b,
that's minus b.

173
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:29,690
So this next term is going
to be a plus b plus

174
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:34,330
c minus 2b, over 2.

175
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,240
Or instead of writing it like
that, let me write this

176
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,570
over 2 minus this over 2.

177
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:43,920
And then our next
term right here.

178
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,180
Same exact logic.

179
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:55,360
That's the same thing as a
plus b plus c minus 2a,

180
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,500
all of that over 2.

181
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:56,770
Right?

182
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:59,960
If we add the minus 2a to
the a we get minus a.

183
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,040
So we get b plus c minus a.

184
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,820
These are identical things.

185
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,950
So all this over 2, or we
can split the denominators

186
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,130
just like that over 2.

187
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,680
And then one last term.

188
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,690
And you might already
recognize the rule of

189
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:16,500
Heron's formula popping up.

190
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,570
I was thinking not the rule
of Heron-- Heron's formula.

191
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:23,050
That term right there is
the exact same thing as a

192
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:27,570
plus b plus c minus 2c.

193
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:27,860
Right?

194
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,200
You take 2c away from the c you
get a minus c, and then you

195
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,650
still have the a and the b.

196
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,540
And then all of that over 2.

197
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,640
You could write that over
2 minus that over 2.

198
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,600
And, of course, we're
taking the square root

199
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,540
of all of this stuff.

200
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:52,230
Now, if we define an S to be
equal to a plus b plus c over

201
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,560
2, then this equation
simplifies a good bit.

202
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,800
This right here is S.

203
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,130
That right there is S.

204
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,705
That right there is S.

205
00:11:01,705 --> 00:11:03,940
And that right there is S.

206
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,720
And these simplify
a good bit too.

207
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,030
Minus 2b over 2, that's just
the same thing as minus b.

208
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,880
Minus 2a over 2, that's the
same thing as minus a.

209
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,100
Minus 2c over 2, that's the
same thing as minus c.

210
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:23,590
So this whole equation for our
area now is equal to-- I'll

211
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,620
rewrite the square root.

212
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:30,670
The radical, the square root,
of S-- that's that right there.

213
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,550
   

214
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,500
I'll do it in the same colors.

215
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:46,890
Times S minus b, times this is
S minus a, times-- and we're

216
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,555
at the last one-- S minus c.

217
00:11:49,555 --> 00:11:52,390
   

218
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:56,510
And we have proved Heron's
formula is the exact same thing

219
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,410
as what we proved at the
end of the last video.

220
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,250
So this was pretty neat.

221
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,910
And we just had to do a
little bit of hairy algebra

222
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,150
to actually prove it.
