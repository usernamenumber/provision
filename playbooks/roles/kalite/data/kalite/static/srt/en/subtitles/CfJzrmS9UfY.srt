1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,276
Let's say you're me and you're in math class and you're supposed to be learning about factoring.

2
00:00:03,276 --> 00:00:07,144
Trouble is, your teacher is too busy trying to convince you that factoring is a useful skill

3
00:00:07,144 --> 00:00:10,580
for the average person to know with real-world applications ranging from passing your state exams

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,026
all the way to getting a higher SAT score

5
00:00:12,026 --> 00:00:14,376
and unfortunately does not have the time to show you

6
00:00:14,376 --> 00:00:16,387
why factoring is actually interesting.

7
00:00:16,387 --> 00:00:19,362
It's perfectly reasonable for you to get bored in this situation.

8
00:00:19,362 --> 00:00:21,932
So like any reasonable person, you start doodling.

9
00:00:21,932 --> 00:00:24,507
Maybe it's because your teacher's sophorific voice reminds you of a lullaby

10
00:00:24,522 --> 00:00:27,007
but you're drawing stars.

11
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:29,373
And because you're me, you quickly get bored of the usual 5-pointed star

12
00:00:29,373 --> 00:00:31,696
and get to wondering: why five?

13
00:00:31,696 --> 00:00:33,478
So you start exploring.

14
00:00:33,478 --> 00:00:35,846
It seems obvious that a 5-pointed star is the simplest one-

15
00:00:35,846 --> 00:00:38,249
the one that takes the least number of strokes to draw.

16
00:00:38,249 --> 00:00:41,000
Sure you can make a star with 4 points but that's not really a star

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,578
the way you're defining stars.

18
00:00:42,578 --> 00:00:44,966
Then there's the 6-pointed star which is also familiar

19
00:00:44,981 --> 00:00:46,898
but totally different from the 5-pointed star because

20
00:00:46,898 --> 00:00:48,669
it takes 2 seperate lines to make.

21
00:00:48,669 --> 00:00:50,944
And then you're thinking about how

22
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,973
much like you can put 2 triangles together to make a 6-pointed star,

23
00:00:52,973 --> 00:00:55,380
you can put two squares together to make an 8-pointed star.

24
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,012
And any even numbered star with "p" points can be made of 2 "p over 2" gons.

25
00:01:00,014 --> 00:01:03,878
It is at this point that you realize if you wanted to avoid thinking about factoring

26
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:06,505
maybe drawing stars was not the brightest idea.

27
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:09,341
But wait! 4 would be an even number of points

28
00:01:09,341 --> 00:01:11,276
but that would mean you could make it out of 2 "2-gons"

29
00:01:11,276 --> 00:01:13,778
Maybe you were taught polygons with only two sides can't exist

30
00:01:13,778 --> 00:01:16,881
but for the purposes of drawing stars it works out rather well.

31
00:01:16,881 --> 00:01:19,203
Sure, the 4-pointed star doesn't look too star-like

32
00:01:19,203 --> 00:01:22,547
But then you realize that you can make a 6-pointed star out of 3 of these things

33
00:01:22,547 --> 00:01:25,380
and you've got an asterisk, which is definitely a legitimate star.

34
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,478
In fact, for any star with a number of points that is divisible by 2

35
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:30,713
you can draw it asterisk style.

36
00:01:30,713 --> 00:01:32,181
But that's not quite what you're looking for

37
00:01:32,181 --> 00:01:34,335
what you want is a doodle game, and here it is:

38
00:01:34,335 --> 00:01:36,337
draw "p" points in a circle, evenly spaced.

39
00:01:36,337 --> 00:01:38,197
Pick a number "q".

40
00:01:38,197 --> 00:01:41,075
Starting at one point, go around the circle and connect to the point q places over.

41
00:01:41,075 --> 00:01:42,676
Repeat.

42
00:01:42,676 --> 00:01:44,578
If you get to the starting place before you've covered all the points

43
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:46,046
jump to a lonely point and keep going.

44
00:01:46,046 --> 00:01:47,381
That's how you draw stars.

45
00:01:47,381 --> 00:01:49,835
And it's a successfull game in that previously you were considering

46
00:01:49,835 --> 00:01:51,336
running, screaming, from the room

47
00:01:51,336 --> 00:01:53,383
or the window is open so that's an option too.

48
00:01:53,383 --> 00:01:55,049
But now you're not only entertained,

49
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,743
but beginning to become curious about the nature of this game.

50
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:59,444
The interesting thing is that the more points you have,

51
00:01:59,444 --> 00:02:01,680
the more different ways there is to draw the star.

52
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,039
I happen to like 7-pointed stars because there's two really good ways to draw them.

53
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:06,536
but they're still simple.

54
00:02:06,536 --> 00:02:09,814
I would like to note here that I have never actually left a math class via the window,

55
00:02:09,814 --> 00:02:12,008
not that I can say the same for other subjects.

56
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:14,925
8 is interesting too, because not only are there a couple nice ways to draw it,

57
00:02:14,925 --> 00:02:16,412
but one's a composite of two polygons

58
00:02:16,412 --> 00:02:19,148
while another can be drawn without picking up the pencil.

59
00:02:19,148 --> 00:02:20,573
Then there's 9,

60
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,872
which, in addition to a couple of other nice versions, you can make out of 3 triangles.

61
00:02:22,872 --> 00:02:25,434
And, because you're me, and you're a nerd, and you like to amuse yourself,

62
00:02:25,434 --> 00:02:27,842
you decide to call this kind of star a Square Star.

63
00:02:27,842 --> 00:02:29,844
because that's kind of a funny name.

64
00:02:29,844 --> 00:02:31,445
So you start drawing other square stars.

65
00:02:31,445 --> 00:02:32,333
4 4-gons,

66
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:33,512
2 2-gons,

67
00:02:33,512 --> 00:02:35,847
even the completely degenerate case of 1 1-gon.

68
00:02:35,847 --> 00:02:38,754
Unfortunately 5 pentagons is already difficult to discern,

69
00:02:38,754 --> 00:02:41,808
and beyond that it's very hard to see and appreciate the structure of square stars.

70
00:02:41,808 --> 00:02:44,176
So you get bored and move on to 10 dots and a circle,

71
00:02:44,176 --> 00:02:47,379
which is interesting because this is the first number where you can make a star

72
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:48,991
as a composite of smaller stars,

73
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:50,924
that is, 2 boring old 5-pointed stars.

74
00:02:50,924 --> 00:02:54,261
Unless you count asterisk stars, in which case 8 was 2 4s, or 4 2's. or 2 2's and a 4.

75
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:57,749
But 10 is interesting, because you can make it as a composite in more than one way.

76
00:02:57,749 --> 00:03:01,511
because it's divisible by five which itself can be made in 2 ways.

77
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:05,749
Then there's 11, which can't be made out of seperate parts at all, because 11 is prime.

78
00:03:05,749 --> 00:03:09,177
Though here you start to wonder how to predict how many times around the circle

79
00:03:09,177 --> 00:03:10,754
it will go before getting back to the start.

80
00:03:10,754 --> 00:03:14,208
But instead of exploring the exciting world of modular arithmetic, you move on to 12

81
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,169
which is a really cool number

82
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:17,562
because it has a whole bunch of factors.

83
00:03:17,562 --> 00:03:18,954
And then something starts to bother you:

84
00:03:18,954 --> 00:03:23,198
Is a 25 pointed star composite made of 5 5-pointed stars a Square Star?

85
00:03:23,198 --> 00:03:26,541
You've been thinking only of pentagons because the lower numbers didn't have this question.

86
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,273
How could you have missed that?

87
00:03:28,273 --> 00:03:29,942
Maybe your teacher said something interesting about prime numbers

88
00:03:29,942 --> 00:03:31,831
and you accidentally lost focus for a moment.

89
00:03:31,831 --> 00:03:32,331
And, oh no.

90
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:33,879
It gets even worse.

91
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:36,619
6 squared would be a 36 pointed star, made of 6 hexagons.

92
00:03:36,619 --> 00:03:39,545
but if you allow use of 6 pointed stars, then it's the same as

93
00:03:39,545 --> 00:03:41,037
a composite of 12 triangles.

94
00:03:41,037 --> 00:03:44,049
And that doesn't seem in keeping with the spirit of square stars.

95
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:46,176
You'll have to define square stars more strictly.

96
00:03:46,176 --> 00:03:49,813
But you do like the idea that there's three ways to make the 7th square star.

97
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:53,196
Anyway, the whole theory of what kind of stars can be made with what numbers

98
00:03:53,196 --> 00:03:54,035
is quite interesting

99
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:56,874
and I encourage you to explore this during your math class.
