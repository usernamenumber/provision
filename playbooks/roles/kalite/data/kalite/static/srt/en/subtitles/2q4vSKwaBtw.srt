1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,530
Sal: --the consistent theme
we're discovering in

3
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,540
chemistry, that everything
is about random

4
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,870
bumps between molecules.

5
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,590
And when they bump randomly
into each other, a lot of

6
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,690
different things can happen in
terms of knocking different

7
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,890
parts of the molecules off of
each other and bonding to

8
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,150
different things.

9
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,180
This includes pure water, which
for the most part, one

10
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,380
would think is a pretty
stable substance.

11
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,390
And it really is.

12
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,670
But it turns out-- let's
say if we start

13
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,700
with 2 water molecules.

14
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,000
And when I put a 2 here, and any
of these is going to turn

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,300
into an equilibrium equation.

16
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,229
It could represent 2 molecules,
it could represent

17
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:33,400
2 moles of molecules.

18
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,880
What matters is just the ratios
in these equations.

19
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,210
And I think you know that.

20
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,850
But let me just draw
2 for an example.

21
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,350
So let's say I have
the oxygen end.

22
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,370
Let's have another
oxygen here.

23
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,680
They both are attached
to some hydrogens.

24
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,350
   

25
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,700
They're sharing electrons with
some hydrogens here.

26
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,900
And we know that oxygen is a lot
more electronegative than

27
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,430
hydrogen, so it hogs all of the
electrons and what that

28
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:04,620
creates is a partial positive
charge at the hydrogen side of

29
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,570
the water molecule.

30
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,670
They're almost naked protons
being attached

31
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:08,720
to the water molecules.

32
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,230
This is positive here.

33
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,390
And then the oxygen sides have
a partial negative charge

34
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,080
because they're hogging
all the electrons.

35
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,130
And this bond between the
negative side of the oxygen

36
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,650
molecules and the positive
side of another oxygen

37
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,950
molecule-- this is called a
hydrogen bond-- this is what

38
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,220
keeps water together and what
keeps it definitely in it's

39
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,370
liquid or solid states.

40
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,470
And in solid states, these bonds
become-- they only stay

41
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,210
together in some lattice
structure.

42
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,835
And in a liquid state, they
can kind of break

43
00:01:34,835 --> 00:01:35,760
and form new ones.

44
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,890
But they keep them close to each
other, rubbing against

45
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,790
each other.

46
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,610
Now it turns out if you just
have exactly the right set of

47
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,930
circumstances-- this isn't the
exact some circumstances, but

48
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:47,700
I think you can imagine.

49
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,190
If this moved just exactly close
enough, it had enough

50
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,310
kinetic energy to move right
past this one, there's some

51
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,800
probability-- and I'll draw an
equilibrium reaction here,

52
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,702
because that is what we
are dealing with.

53
00:02:01,702 --> 00:02:03,430
The equilibrium reaction.

54
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,910
There's some probability that
this hydrogen right here gets

55
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,770
stuck to this guy.

56
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,259
He gets so close, and maybe this
guy bounces in some other

57
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:14,700
weird way that we get left
with-- let me draw the same 2

58
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,500
characters, the 2 oxygens.

59
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,020
Actually let, me draw
the second guy.

60
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,780
Let's say that he just he just
somehow passed the other guy.

61
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,440
So he had some movement.

62
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,630
Let's say he moved in
that direction.

63
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,010
This is obviously is not
scientific, but it gives you a

64
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,950
narrative around what
could happen.

65
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,070
This guy's hydrogen protons.

66
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,690
And this was attracted
to this oxygen side.

67
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,110
And if just under the right
circumstances-- Remember.

68
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,680
Everything here is
probabalistic.

69
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,440
There's always a probability of
almost anything happening.

70
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,650
This guy can get attached to
the negative side of this

71
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,210
water molecule, the
water side.

72
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,930
And then this guy is only left
with one hydrogen right here.

73
00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:00,860
And then this molecule as a
whole, this is OH, hydroxide.

74
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,080
And it has a minus
charge, right?

75
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,320
Because water was a
neutral molecule.

76
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,310
You had just as many protons
and electrons.

77
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,610
Now we have 1 less proton
than electrons.

78
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:18,520
So in this case, just the
hydrogen nucleus itself--

79
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,680
which is just a proton because
we learned that hydrogen

80
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,360
doesn't have any neutrons
in it's normal form.

81
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,910
This is essentially a proton
when we draw a hydrogen.

82
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,020
It gets bumped off or scraped
off and ends up on this water

83
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,010
molecule, so this guy lost
a proton, has the

84
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,760
same number of electrons.

85
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,580
So he now has a negative
charge.

86
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,480
This guy has the same number of
electrons, but now he's got

87
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,310
an extra proton.

88
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,550
So he has a positive charge.

89
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:46,440
So this is H3O with
a positive charge.

90
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,660
And this little version right
here where we gave a water

91
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,930
molecule and it somehow gains
an extra hydrogen proton or

92
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,980
hydrogen atom.

93
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,230
This is called hydronium.

94
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:02,910
   

95
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,000
And this process where water
can kind of spontaneously--

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,730
and I'm not saying that water--
you know, a whole

97
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,030
glass of water, this
is going to happen.

98
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,630
It's actually happening
to a very

99
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,210
small number of molecules.

100
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,340
That if you view this is an
equilibrium reaction-- when

101
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:19,360
you have 2 waters, the reaction
is much more weighted

102
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,829
in the leftward direction.

103
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:23,060
But this can happen, and that's
what the whole point of

104
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,990
this is to think about.

105
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,010
But this process is called
autoionization.

106
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,410
Because you just have water by
itself, and just buy some

107
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,110
random circumstances of some
molecules bumping into each

108
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,970
other just right, some
subset of the water

109
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,330
will ionize like this.

110
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:40,810
Where one part will lose
a proton and the other

111
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,290
part will gain one.

112
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,540
So this is autoionization.

113
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:48,670
   

114
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,600
And of course this is an
equilibrium reaction, so now

115
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,430
these guys might go
bump into 2 other

116
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,670
things and become water.

117
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,630
Maybe they'll bump into
each other again and

118
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,310
they'll become water.

119
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,470
So goes back and forth.

120
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,000
So there's some equilibrium
concentration of this.

121
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,510
Let me write it as a proper
equilibrium reaction.

122
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,930
So you could have 2, maybe
moles of water molecules.

123
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:11,215
They are in equilibrium
with H3O positive.

124
00:05:11,215 --> 00:05:14,030
   

125
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,770
And all these are in an
aqueous solution.

126
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,730
And that's a bit of a redundancy
because aqueous

127
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,190
solution means that you're
dissolved in water.

128
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:23,030
So of course water is
dissolved in water.

129
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,730
But then H3O dissolved
in water.

130
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,150
So all around here, you
have water molecules.

131
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,955
This isn't isolation.

132
00:05:28,955 --> 00:05:32,190
You have gazillions of water
molecules all around.

133
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:38,900
Plus OH minus aqueous.

134
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,300
Now.

135
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,130
Sometimes you'll see that exact

136
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,250
reaction written as this.

137
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,450
And it's important if you
realize it's the same thing.

138
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:55,090
H2O in equilibrium with just
1 hydrogen ion popping off.

139
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,670
Everything's in an
aqueous solution.

140
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,460
Let me write that down.

141
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,350
Everything is being dissolved
and water.

142
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:08,270
Plus OH minus in an aqueous
solution And this equation

143
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:12,030
right here-- and what
I wrote at the top.

144
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,160
And let me cut and paste
this so you can see

145
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,210
them at the same time.

146
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,120
Copy.

147
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,120
Go down here.

148
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,070
And paste this.

149
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,240
These are essentially
equivalent, although the

150
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,530
second equation right
here describes

151
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,050
what exactly happens.

152
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,020
So the first equation is
creating a picture.

153
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,080
You have one water molecule
and there's some small

154
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,180
probability that one of its
hydrogens just pop off.

155
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,800
And you're just left with a
hydrogen and a hydroxide,

156
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,040
which is just an oxygen and
a hydrogen atom together.

157
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,250
But the reality is that these
hydrogen protons don't exist

158
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,720
in water on their own.

159
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,030
Whenever they are in water, in
an aqueous solution, they

160
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,320
essentially get a ride with
another water molecule.

161
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,460
And that's what happens here
with the hydronium ion.

162
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,650
But the whole reason why I'm
going into this whole

163
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,040
discussion about the
autoionization of water is

164
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,850
because people really care about
the concentration of--

165
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:12,880
depending on how I view it--
hydrogen atoms, hydrogen

166
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,950
protons in a solution, or you
could say hydronium protons in

167
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,320
a solution.

168
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,840
The concentration of
these 2 things are

169
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,160
going to be the same.

170
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,420
Right?

171
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,360
Because all of these really are
riding on another water

172
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,920
molecule and becoming
hydronium.

173
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,710
   

174
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:31,600
How do you measure this-- or a
better question is what is the

175
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,190
equilibrium of this reaction?

176
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:36,980
So it turns out that in just
regular water, the

177
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,050
concentration-- and I'll maybe
I'll switch to this one.

178
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,250
The concentration of-- this
is in regular water

179
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,250
at 25 degrees Celsius.

180
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,800
Let me write that down.

181
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,910
25 degrees Celsius, which is
roughly room temperature.

182
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:53,950
With pure water.

183
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,940
The concentration
of pure water.

184
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,460
In pure water, the concentration
of hydrogen

185
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,260
ions, and you could also say
that that's the concentration

186
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:06,650
of hydronium ions, or cations,
because they're positive.

187
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:14,490
It equals 10 to the minus
seventh molar.

188
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:14,810
Right?

189
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:25,110
So for every 1 liter of water,
you have 10 to the minus 7

190
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,920
moles of hydronium ions.

191
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,840
Which is still a pretty good
number because it's 10 to the

192
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,059
minus 7 moles, so it's
10 to the minus 7

193
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,549
times Avogadro's number.

194
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,940
So let me just do that.

195
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:42,650
So it's 10 to the minus 7 moles
per liter of water,

196
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:46,440
which is the same thing as 10 to
the minus 7 times-- a mole

197
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,030
is just a number.

198
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,810
6.022 times 10 to the 23.

199
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,140
So you do the math here.

200
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,370
You still end up with what?

201
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:57,790
60 times 10 to the 16th
power molecule.

202
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,910
So you still have a large
number of molecules.

203
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:04,190
It's just a small fraction of
the total number molecules are

204
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,430
actually these hydrogen or
these hydronium ions.

205
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:11,610
And it turns out that your
concentration of hydroxides is

206
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:17,100
also-- so your concentration
of hydroxides is also 10 to

207
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,880
the minus seventh molars.

208
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,790
So if we know that, we can now
actually figure out the

209
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:27,790
equilibrium constant for this
autoionization of water.

210
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,175
We can figure out the
equilibrium constant.

211
00:09:30,175 --> 00:09:31,270
So let's do that.

212
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,070
And we'll do it with
the first one.

213
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:35,390
So let's say you have--
I'll switch colors.

214
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:39,210
H2O in an aqueous solution.

215
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:43,060
It's in equilibrium
with hydrogen ions

216
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,300
in an aqueous solution.

217
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,950
But we know in reality
they've gotten rides

218
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,580
with other water ions.

219
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,710
With the other water molecules,
not ions.

220
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,560
They turn them into
hydronium ions.

221
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:59,930
Plus hydroxide molecule.

222
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,620
The equilibrium for this
reaction, the equilibrium

223
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,510
constant, we'll call it for
the K sub w for water.

224
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:14,650
It equals the concentration of
the products of hydrogen ions

225
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:18,640
times a concentration of
the hydroxide ions.

226
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,060
Now, in a normal situation,
we would divide it by the

227
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,820
concentration of
the reactants.

228
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,440
But in this case, and we learned
this before, the

229
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,540
reactants are what
the solvent is.

230
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,540
We are in water.

231
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,270
So you we won't include this.

232
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,400
And if you want the intuition
behind that, remember this

233
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,550
whole thing comes out from the
probability of-- this is the

234
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,360
probably of the backwards
reaction happening as related

235
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,140
to the concentrations
of these two things

236
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,590
multiplied by each other.

237
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:50,140
And the probably the forward
reaction happening is related

238
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,580
to the probability of finding
two of the product-- of the

239
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,920
reacting molecules
in one space.

240
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,090
And you're always going
to find these

241
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,360
molecules in some place.

242
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,760
It's just going to be a constant
probability that some

243
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,300
water spontaneously turns
into these two products.

244
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,610
So whenever you have a reaction
like this equilibrium

245
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,870
reaction, and the one side is
essentially just a solution,

246
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,300
you just don't include it.

247
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,190
So the equilibrium-- or you
could just think of

248
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,980
it as a 1 down here.

249
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,070
So the equilibrium constant of
this autoionization water is

250
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:18,580
right there.

251
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:22,170
And I just gave you what the
numbers were at room

252
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:22,830
temperature.

253
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,990
So the equilibrium constant is
equal to-- the concentration

254
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:33,150
of hydrogen is 10 to the minus
7 times a concentration of

255
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:37,080
hydroxide is also 10
to the minus 7.

256
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,840
So it equals 10 to the
minus 14th power.

257
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,335
Now.

258
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:45,280
And that's a good thing
to memorize.

259
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,100
The equilibrium constant of the
autoionization of water.

260
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,380
And just so you know, this is
all going to lead into acids.

261
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:55,770
Because essentially people care
a whole bunch about what

262
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,330
this concentration
ends up being.

263
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,180
And we're going to
touch on that a

264
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,180
little bit in this video.

265
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,650
Now it turns out that people
chemistry, for whatever

266
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,190
reason, they don't like talking
in these terms. They

267
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,720
don't like saying 10 to
the minus 14th power.

268
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,630
So what they do is they take
the negative log of things.

269
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,100
Negative log base 10.

270
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,470
And if logs are intimidating to
you, review the videos on

271
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,080
logarithms.

272
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:21,830
So what they do is they take the
minus log of both sides.

273
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,780
And when someone just writes log
without a number, you can

274
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,780
assume it's base 10.

275
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:29,630
But they take the minus log of
the equilibrium constant.

276
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:34,510
The minus log base 10 of 10 to
the minus 14 is equal to--

277
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,570
well 10 to what powers is
10 to the minus 14?

278
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,690
Well, it's minus fourteen,
right?

279
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,290
And then you have that
minus in front.

280
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:49,650
You have this minus, and the
log part is just minus 14.

281
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:54,200
And so the minus log of the
equilibrium constant of water

282
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,560
is equal to 14.

283
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,480
And this idea right here
is called a pKw.

284
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,880
pK.

285
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,910
Let me put the p in a different
color just so you

286
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,760
see where it's-- pKw.

287
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,100
But all p means, whenever you
see it in chemistry, it just

288
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,130
means minus log base 10.

289
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,690
Minus log base 10.

290
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,630
And there's some debate as to
what p stands for, I try to

291
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,430
think of it as power, although
it's a minus log, it's a

292
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,500
exponent-- but whatever.

293
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,640
It means you're taking the
minus log of something.

294
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,310
And what it does is, it's just a
way kind of a way to get out

295
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,840
of the exponent world-- although
I think it's nicer to

296
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,150
stay in the exponent world
because you really know what

297
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,980
you're talking about--
into some nice

298
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,490
clean number like 14.

299
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:40,900
So when someone says that's
the pKw is 14, all they're

300
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,420
saying is that the equilibrium
constant, which is just this

301
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,540
part right here, is 10
to the minus 14.

302
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:52,180
Now, the same convention
is used on the hydrogen

303
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,660
concentration.

304
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:58,130
The next few videos are all
going to revolve around the

305
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:01,710
hydrogen concentration in
water, essentially.

306
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,540
We'll talk a little bit about
what happens when you're

307
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,810
outside of water.

308
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,540
Now the hydrogen concentration
of water at room temperature,

309
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,580
I've told you, has been
determined to be 10 to the

310
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,540
minus 7 molars.

311
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,940
People aren't happy just with
that, so what they want to do

312
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,300
is do the same thing.

313
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,670
They want to take the minus
log of both sides.

314
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,440
So they say that pH--
and you've probably

315
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,490
heard the word pH.

316
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:25,510
It's a lot of cosmetics.

317
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,390
pH balance.

318
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,500
Now you know what it means.

319
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,530
They're really just saying that
we have the right number

320
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:32,560
of hydrogen ions in our lotion
or our perfume or whatever

321
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,760
we're trying to sell you.

322
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:42,930
So the pH is equal to the minus
log of the hydrogen ion

323
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:47,505
concentration, which is equal
to the minus log, remember,

324
00:14:47,505 --> 00:14:51,740
it's just a base 10 if I don't
specify otherwise, of 10 to

325
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:57,410
the minus 7, which is equal to--
well, 10 to what power is

326
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,400
10 to the minus 7?

327
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,580
This is equal to minus 7.

328
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,450
Then we have the minus
outside, so then

329
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,720
this becomes 7.

330
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,100
Now.

331
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:10,105
You can do that same exercise
for the pOH.

332
00:15:10,105 --> 00:15:11,910
pOH.

333
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:15,900
The concentration of
hydroxide ions.

334
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:20,990
What's the negative log of the
hydroxide concentration.

335
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,260
The hydroxide concentration,
we saw, was the same

336
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,570
concentration as the water
concentration.

337
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,540
Oh, I didn't write it there.

338
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,260
Where did I write it?

339
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:28,470
Right there.

340
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,770
10 of the minus seventh
molars.

341
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,870
So water has the same
number of hydroxides

342
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:33,930
and hydrogen ions.

343
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,260
And that's because this water
is just associating into the

344
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,400
two of them.

345
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:42,000
But of course this is equal
to minus 7, right?

346
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,980
Log-based.

347
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,510
This number right here
is 10 to the minus 7.

348
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,100
So it equals 7.

349
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:52,640
So the pH and the pOH of water
is both equal to 7.

350
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,390
Now.

351
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,540
In the next few videos, we're
going to start covering the

352
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,470
notion of acids and bases.

353
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,280
And it turns out that an acid
is just something that

354
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,220
increases the hydrogen
concentration.

355
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,010
Well, that's one version
of acids.

356
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,750
We'll talk about other
broader definitions.

357
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,005
But it's called the
arrhenius acid.

358
00:16:08,005 --> 00:16:10,150
Which we'll talk about
in the next video.

359
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:14,630
But if something is making the
hydrogen concentration go up,

360
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,530
if we put something in water
that makes it go up, what's

361
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:19,180
that going to do the pH?

362
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:23,220
Well, if this number right here
goes up, then the log of

363
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,500
that number is going to go up.

364
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,680
But then the minus log
of that number--

365
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,330
So let's say for example
10 to the minus 7.

366
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:32,920
That's all good.

367
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,690
But let's say we take it
from 10 to the minus 7.

368
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,180
So 10 to minus 7, that's
kind of neutral

369
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,750
water, doing nothing.

370
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,590
We have a pH.

371
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,450
The pH is 7.

372
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,380
We just figured out
this calculation.

373
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,510
That's where the hydrogen
concentration is equal to 10

374
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,520
to minus 7.

375
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,350
Now let's say we were to do
something to the water where

376
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:54,710
the hydrogen concentration
were to increase.

377
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:58,440
So we add hydrogen.

378
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,570
We add concentration
of hydrogen.

379
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,270
So let's say 10 to
the minus 3.

380
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,770
This is obviously a much
higher concentration of

381
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,349
hydrogen than that.

382
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:10,440
So the hydrogen concentration
is now 10 to the minus 3.

383
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,200
What's our new pH?

384
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:17,369
So the new pH is going to be
equal to the minus log base 10

385
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,690
of 10 to the minus 3.

386
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,569
That's equal to that
minus there.

387
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:25,660
10 to the minus 3 power is equal
to 10 to the minus 3.

388
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,775
So it's minus 3.

389
00:17:26,775 --> 00:17:28,210
So this becomes plus.

390
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:33,100
So now our pH is equal to 3.

391
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,430
So the big take-away from this
is we care about the hydrogen

392
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,240
concentration.

393
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,980
When something increases the
hydrogen concentration, that

394
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,630
is considered an acid.

395
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,720
And when you increase the
hydrogen concentration, when

396
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,420
you put an acid into an aqueous
solution, you are

397
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,980
lowering the pH.

398
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:52,890
So the lower the pH, the more
acidic you have, or the higher

399
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:57,830
concentration of hydrogen
protons you have. And we'll

400
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:00,630
talk in the next video about the
opposite of that, which is

401
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,260
which is basic things.

402
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:06,060
And bases increase the
concentration of hydroxide.

403
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,680
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
