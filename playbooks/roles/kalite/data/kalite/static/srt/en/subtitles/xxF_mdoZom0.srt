1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,170
Like we did with parabolic mirrors, what I really want to do in this video

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:09,800
is just for put objects at different distances relative to this convex lens

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,920
and just think about what its image will look like

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,950
And the whole point of doing that is going through all the different situations but

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,990
more is getting practice of how to think about it

6
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,340
So let's first put an object out here

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:28,540
That's more than two focal lengths away from the lens

8
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,720
I'll put the object right here

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,670
We'll do our classic arrow

10
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:37,280
Actually I'll make a point here. When we dealt with parabolic mirrors

11
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,100
we talked about the distance of two focal lengths being our center of curvature

12
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,480
Over here we're just gonna call it 2 focal length, because it's really not

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,540
the center of curvature--

14
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,020
or this distance really isn't the radius of curvature of

15
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,640
each of these curves. So we're just gonna call it 2 focal lengths

16
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:59,150
So with that said, let's actually try to figure out what the image of this thing would look like

17
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,710
as the light from it gets refracted through this lens

18
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:06,390
So like always, it's useful to draw one ray

19
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:10,690
Every point of this object is emitting rays in every direction

20
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,830
because it's diffusely reflecting light

21
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,320
So we can just pick rays that are convenient

22
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,280
So we can go from the tip of the arrow

23
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:22,360
and go parallel to our principal axis just like that

24
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,470
I'm not gonna show all the internal refraction within this lens right here

25
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,270
But we know that if we enter the lens, parallel to the principal axis

26
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:41,630
when we get refracted, we will go through the focal point on the other side of the lens

27
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,100
And on the left side of the lens

28
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,340
we'll do another ray that goes through the focal point on the left side

29
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:59,770
and then comes out parallel

30
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:04,530
The incident ray goes through the left focal point

31
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:10,710
and when it gets refracted, it will now be parallel

32
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:18,790
And so the light that came from that point of the object will reconverge right over here

33
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,530
So if you did this for every point of this object

34
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,310
if you did a point in the middle right over here, it would reconverge right over here

35
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:30,100
If you did this point right over here, it would reconverge right over there

36
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:38,170
So the image of this object is going to look like this

37
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:46,220
So it's going to be a real image. The rays actually converge here. So it's a real inverted image

38
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,980
It was pointing up before. Now it's pointing that down

39
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,370
And in this situation, it's actually going to be smaller than the original

40
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:57,700
So, real, smaller, inverted image

41
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,270
Let's do a couple of other scenarios

42
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:05,580
Let me copy and paste this before starting this video to save on time

43
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:12,910
Let's do a situation now where the object is at the 2 focal distances. I guess we can call that

44
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:20,430
Let's put the object right over here

45
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,850
We can do the exact same thing

46
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,470
You might want to do it on paper on your own to get some practice doing it

47
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,960
We'll do one ray that's parallel

48
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,560
When it gets refracted, it will go through the focal point on the other side

49
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,750
And then we'll do another ray that goes through the focal point on the left side

50
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:45,110
and then it will become parallel

51
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:48,080
And they can reconverge or they converge right over there

52
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,340
So you can see that this is actually a parallelogram

53
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:58,490
This distance right there is going to be the same thing as that distance over here

54
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,690
It is actually--I don't want to say asymmetry. You can't flip it over

55
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,190
But this is a--and this distance right over here is going to be the same

56
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,080
thing as this distance over here. I won't go into all the geometry

57
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:17,210
Anyway, this would be an inverted image of exactly the same size at the exact same distant

58
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,780
Actually I didn't talk about distance in this one over here

59
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,340
Over here, it's a real image; it's smaller and it's also going to be closer in

60
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,150
than this one was. It's gonna be closer to lens

61
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:33,090
But here the image is going to be the same size as the original object

62
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,620
It's going to be inverted, but it's going to be at the same distance from the lens

63
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,470
just on the other side. Once again this is a real image

64
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,920
Let's do another one

65
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,810
Copy and paste

66
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,480
So let's stick something between one focal length and two focal lengths

67
00:04:53,230 --> 00:05:03,020
So what's put my object right over there

68
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,600
So once again, let's go parallel

69
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:16,460
then we will refract through the focus on the other side

70
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,250
And then let's go through the focus on the left side

71
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:25,330
And then we will refract and go parallel

72
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:30,830
So here, we will have--remember, I could use any point. Here I just used the tip

73
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,250
because I know the base will converge over there

74
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,410
If I took 2 points, it would go converge right back there

75
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,760
And then if I did with a point right here

76
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,360
and I did that same exercise, it would go right over there

77
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,150
And so the whole image would show up over here

78
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,580
So here, it's real; it's inverted; and it's larger

79
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:57,220
and it is now further away from the lens than the object on the other side

80
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,020
This is really kind of the reverse of the first example

81
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:04,210
The first example, the object was larger and more than two focal lengths away

82
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,250
and the image was in this range

83
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,870
Now the object is here and now the image's on the other side. So they're kind of--

84
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,790
that's really just the other side of that first examples

85
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:18,850
Let's do a couple more

86
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:27,070
So let's put the object at the focal point and see what would happen

87
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:31,310
And sometimes people memorize this type of things for physics exams

88
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:35,310
You don't need to. All you have to do is remember just think about 2 rays

89
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,830
usually from the tip of the arrow that gives you a sense what the image will look like

90
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:42,380
and you do one parallel and one that goes through the focal point

91
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,800
Well, with that said

92
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,340
we're gonna do something slightly different when something is sitting at the focal point

93
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,910
When something is sitting at the focal point

94
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,130
one is we can do the parallel

95
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,660
It will be refracted through the focal point on the other side

96
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:04,920
And then instead of doing a ray that goes through the focal point on this side

97
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,130
because actually you can't. You're sitting on the focal point right there

98
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:13,610
Let's do a ray that does not get refracted. We did a similar thing with the parabolic mirrors

99
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:19,920
What I want do is a ray that'll go right to the center of the lens

100
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,450
where it won't get refracted

101
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:28,260
It's just go straight through the center of the lens

102
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:35,440
So what you have here is, both of these rays that were diverging from this point from this tip

103
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,100
they don't reconverge anywhere

104
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,690
And they don't even look like they're diverging from another point

105
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:43,050
if someone's eyeball is right over here

106
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:47,010
They're just going to see these as 2 parallel rays of light

107
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:50,820
So no image will form. Not a real image or virtual image

108
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:56,920
So we can say no image is going to form

109
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:08,290
Now the last case is, let's put the object less than one focal distance away

110
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:16,880
Let's put the object right over here. And think about what happens

111
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,520
Once again, the light ray from this tip

112
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,390
where to go parallel. It will be refracted through the focal point on the other side

113
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,720
And then let's do another light ray, going

114
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,590
in a direction as if it were coming the direction of the focal point on this side

115
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,270
So it comes from that direction

116
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,230
The light ray would go like that

117
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:39,790
And then it would come out on the other side parallel

118
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,300
So clearly, these two light rays are not converging

119
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,560
So no real image's going to form

120
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:51,390
But they do look like they're diverging from some point

121
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:59,350
Continue these lines. They both look like they're coming from a point right over there

122
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:04,020
So what's going to happen? If someone's eyes are processing these light rays

123
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,880
they're gonna see the tip of this arrow all the way up here

124
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,200
They're gonna see the base of this arrow down here

125
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:29,700
And essentially, they're going to see a magnified virtual image of the actual arrow

126
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:33,720
Anyway, hopefully you found that interesting
