1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,740
   

2
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,260
Let's say that I'm a pension
fund, and I have money to lend

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,040
to other people.

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,290
And I want to lend it to other
people, because that way I can

5
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,360
get interest on it instead of
it just kind of sitting and

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,240
doing nothing.

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,230
And if I lend it to someone
other than the government,

8
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,580
I'll get better interest. So
let's say that there's-- so

9
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,850
let me draw me, I'm
the pension fund.

10
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,330
Maybe I'll drawn
me in magenta.

11
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,570
So that's me, pension fund.

12
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:28,360
   

13
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,680
And let's say that there's
some corporation,

14
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,170
let's say it's GM.

15
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:32,925
They make cars.

16
00:00:32,925 --> 00:00:35,450
I think you've heard of them.

17
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,180
Some corporation, GM.

18
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,530
Let's just call it
Corporation A.

19
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,560
   

20
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,770
They need to borrow money, maybe
to buy a factory or to

21
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,920
do something else, we're not
going to get involved in what

22
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,990
they need the money for.

23
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,180
And I'd like to lend
them the money.

24
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,980
But there's an issue here.

25
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:55,750
I am a pension fund.

26
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,310
I manage the retirement fund
for the teachers of

27
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,180
California, or for the
auto workers of

28
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,160
Michigan, or whatever.

29
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:09,080
And part of my charter says
that I can only invest in

30
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,870
very, very, very safe
instruments.

31
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:15,580
So I'm not allowed to go gamble
people's money, because

32
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,230
this is people's retirement.

33
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,530
So I can't do very fancy
things with it.

34
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,130
I can only invest in things
that are rated AAA,

35
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:23,930
or let's say AA.

36
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,500
I'm just kind of making
this up on the fly.

37
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,090
So AAA would be like
the highest

38
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,330
rated securities, right?

39
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:32,020
These are things that have a
very low chance of default.

40
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:36,720
But Corporation A is only rated,
I don't know, let's say

41
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,785
it's rated BB.

42
00:01:37,785 --> 00:01:40,720
And actually, this is a good
time to think about well who

43
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,610
is doing all these ratings.

44
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,170
And you might think, oh, it
surely is a government entity,

45
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,360
because only the government
would be objective enough give

46
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,080
all of these corporations
frankly objective ratings.

47
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,970
But unfortunately, it's not.

48
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:57,280
They're private entities,
that are actually

49
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,090
paid to rate things.

50
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,620
And I think I touched on it in
the video on collateralized

51
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,740
debt obligations.

52
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,970
But their incentives are
a little bit strange.

53
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,009
Let's say I have Moody's.

54
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:12,970
Moody's is one of the ratings
agencies, and they rate

55
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,620
Corporation A as BB.

56
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,830
So they've said, these guys,
they're pretty good, but

57
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,690
they're not the U.S. government
or something.

58
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,960
There's a chance that they can
go under, for whatever

59
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,020
reasons, or they're sensitive
to the economy as a whole.

60
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,510
And I say, man, I would love
to lend these guys money.

61
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,330
I would love to lend
these guys the $1

62
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,230
billion that they need.

63
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,120
And these guys are willing to
pay me 8% interest. But I

64
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,980
can't do it, me as
a pension fund, I

65
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,210
cannot lend them money.

66
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:44,550
Because I'm only allowed
to lend money to A or

67
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,210
above types of bonds.

68
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:51,730
Or I can only buy A or above
type of instruments.

69
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,240
So what do I do?

70
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,220
This guy needs money.

71
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,540
I have money to give him, but
his corporate credit rating,

72
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,810
that was given by Moody's, just
isn't high enough for me

73
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,370
to lend him the money.

74
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,430
And this is where credit
default swaps come in.

75
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:12,720
In an ideal world, I would give
Corporation A, I would

76
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,630
give them $1 billion.

77
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:21,270
And then maybe they would
annually give me, let me make

78
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:25,110
up a number, 10% per year.

79
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,900
And then this might have a term
for 10 years, and then

80
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,360
after 10 years, they'll pay me
the $1 billon back and then

81
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,290
I'll be happy.

82
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,340
But as I said multiple times,
I can't do it, because they

83
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,650
are BB rated.

84
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,770
And my charter says I can only
invest in A rated bonds.

85
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,720
So I go to another entity.

86
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,720
And let's call this
entity AIG.

87
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,850
And these entities are
essentially insurance

88
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,690
companies on debt.

89
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:57,430
And I'm calling this
one AIG because AIG

90
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,820
actually did do this.

91
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,510
But it could be anything.

92
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,630
A lot of banks did this,
a lot of insurance

93
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,730
companies did this.

94
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,130
There are some companies that
just specialize in writing

95
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:10,100
collateralized-- sorry, in
writing credit default swaps.

96
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,360
What does AIG do for me?

97
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,270
Well first of all, it's
important to note that Moody's

98
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:19,990
has given AIG, I don't know,
let's give it a AA rating.

99
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,459
I don't know what their
actual rating was.

100
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,120
They said, you know what, they
are almost risk-free.

101
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,030
They're almost like the
U.S. government.

102
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,130
Moody's has looked at their
books, or supposedly, or

103
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,800
hopefully has looked at their
books, and says, oh you know,

104
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,650
if you loan them money,
they're good for it.

105
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,580
So they have a very,
very high rating.

106
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,730
Although, once again, you have
to worry about the incentive.

107
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,250
Because who paid Moody's to
give them that rating?

108
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,690
And whenever you're getting
paid to give a rating, you

109
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,970
have to wonder about what your
incentives are, in terms of

110
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,440
how you rate things.

111
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,610
But anyway that's a discussion
for another video.

112
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,950
But what AIG says is, you
know what pension fund?

113
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,605
I know you want to lend
Corporation A money, and

114
00:04:56,605 --> 00:04:58,760
Corporation A wants to borrow
money from you, but you have

115
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,730
this problem because
they're BB rated.

116
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,200
So what we're going to
do is we're going

117
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,430
to insure this bond.

118
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,650
We're going to insure this loan
that you're giving to

119
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,570
Corporate B.

120
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,830
What we want in return for that
is an insurance premium.

121
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,280
We want you to pay us
a little bit of this

122
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,350
interest every year.

123
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,240
If you pay us a little bit of
this interest every year, we

124
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,900
will insure this payment.

125
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:27,020
So you get 10% a year, and
you give us 1% a year.

126
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,810
So you give us 1% a year.

127
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:36,170
   

128
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,290
And this is also 1%-- just
to learn a little bit of

129
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:42,500
financial jargon-- this is also
someone would say 100

130
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,810
basis points.

131
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:48,290
One basis point is
1/100th of 1%.

132
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,950
So 1% of the same thing
as 100 basis points.

133
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,870
2% is the same thing as
200 basis points.

134
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:58,080
So you pay me 100 basis points
of the 10% per year, and in

135
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:15,690
exchange, I will give you
insurance on A's debt.

136
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,670
And in fact, it might have not
even been structured this way.

137
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,080
It might have been structured
so that Corporation A right

138
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,740
here, before even issuing the
bonds, they include this

139
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,050
insurance with the bond.

140
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:31,210
So instead of giving 10%, they
cut out 1% to insure it.

141
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,800
And then these essentially
become AA bonds.

142
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,530
And why is that?

143
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,710
Well, they're BB, but you're
being insured by

144
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,740
someone who is AA.

145
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,690
So all of the sudden, these
bonds, because they're being

146
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:48,130
insured by this entity that
is AA, which Moody's has

147
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:53,310
determined is AA, these bonds
are now good enough for my

148
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,300
pension fund to hold.

149
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,650
Because I said, you know what
even if corporation A goes

150
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,730
under, I have this AA
guy insuring it.

151
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:01,650
And so I'm fine.

152
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,970
So this is the equivalent
of holding AA bonds.

153
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,850
And what's my effective
interest rate?

154
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,560
I'm getting 9% per
year, right?

155
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,080
I'm getting 10% per year from
Corporation B, and then I have

156
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,430
to pay 1% to AIG.

157
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:18,910
And if Corporation B goes under
tomorrow, AIG is going

158
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,330
to give me my $1 billion back.

159
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,000
And you might say, Sal,
this sounds like

160
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,880
a pretty good situation.

161
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,220
And this is where it starts
to get a little bit shady.

162
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:35,420
Because AIG, they're not just
insuring my debt or my loan

163
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,480
that I gave to corporation A.

164
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,480
And think about it, AIG didn't
have to do anything.

165
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,810
AIG didn't have to put
up any collateral.

166
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:46,420
AIG didn't say, you know what,
out of all of our assets, here

167
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:53,640
is $1 billion that we're going
to set aside, just in case

168
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,210
Corporation A doesn't pay.

169
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:55,800
Right?

170
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,400
You would think that if you
wanted to be guaranteed that

171
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,530
this money was going to come to
you, this AIG corporation

172
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:03,680
would have to set
aside the money.

173
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,650
But they didn't have
to do that.

174
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,470
They just have to say, hey,
Moody's has said we're AA,

175
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,580
we're good for debt.

176
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,170
We're good for insurance.

177
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,850
So you just pay us 1% a year
and trust us, or trust

178
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,620
Moody's, that we really are
good for the money.

179
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,610
They never had to set
aside the money.

180
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:21,660
You're just going on a leap
of faith that, if and when

181
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,570
Corporation A defaults,
AIG is going to be

182
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,890
good for the money.

183
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,760
Now this is where it
gets interesting.

184
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,560
Let me erase Moody's from the
screen-- actually, maybe I'll

185
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,470
go down here.

186
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,520
AIG didn't just insure
my debt.

187
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,909
Let's say that there is
Corporation C's debt.

188
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:43,700
   

189
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,700
Let's say that they're B-- I
don't know, all these ratings

190
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,120
have different terminology.

191
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,130
They're B+ rated.

192
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:50,490
Right?

193
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,680
And let's say there's $10
billion of debt that they

194
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,730
borrow from some other party.

195
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:01,560
And in return, they give 11%.

196
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,100
And this is Pension Fund B.

197
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,630
   

198
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,660
And this pension fund had
the same problem.

199
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:16,040
They can only buy A-rated
or above bonds.

200
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,230
AIG also insures their
debt that they gave

201
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,810
to Corporation C.

202
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,170
Maybe they'll pay them--
Corporation C is maybe a

203
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:27,840
little bit riskier, so out of
the 11% I have to pay maybe

204
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,690
150 basis points.

205
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,810
Or 1 and 1/2%, that's the
same thing as 1%.

206
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:40,140
And in exchange, they
insure C's debt.

207
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,970
   

208
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,580
Now something very interesting
can happen here.

209
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,310
AIG all of the sudden
has an excellent

210
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,760
business model, right?

211
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,480
Because they were able to get
this AA rating from Moody's,

212
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,695
they can just keep insuring
other people's debt, and they

213
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,590
don't have to put any
money aside, right?

214
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:01,720
They don't have to give their
assets to anyone else.

215
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,020
And they just get these
income streams, right?

216
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,400
From my pension fund
they're getting 1%

217
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,530
per year of $1 billion.

218
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:11,370
From this pension fund, they're
getting 1 and 1/2%,

219
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,010
150 basis points, per year.

220
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,910
And they can do this, frankly,
as much as they want.

221
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,700
They could do this
a thousand times.

222
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,280
And as long as Moody's doesn't
get suspicious.

223
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,280
As long as Moody's doesn't
start saying, hey, wait a

224
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,420
second, AIG, you only have $100
billion in assets, but

225
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,710
you have insured $1 trillion
of other people's debt.

226
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:34,220
Something shady going on, I'm
going to lower your rating.

227
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,620
As long as that doesn't happen,
this AIG corporation

228
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,560
can just keep insuring
more and more debt.

229
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,450
And frankly, as long as none
of that debt goes bad, they

230
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,220
just get this excellent income
stream, and their CEO will get

231
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,010
excellent bonuses.

232
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:50,110
I think you start to see where
you're having a single point

233
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:53,790
of failure and a house of cards,
and I'll continue that

234
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,500
in the next video.

235
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,400
