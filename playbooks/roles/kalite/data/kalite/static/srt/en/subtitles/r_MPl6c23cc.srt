1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,290
All right.

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,530
We're in the home stretch of
this first, I guess we could

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,310
have called almost experimental
section, but

4
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,820
hopefully it's been working
out decently.

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,980
So we're on number 17.

6
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:26,830
And it says, if a plus 2, times
x plus 1 is equal to s,

7
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:31,800
what is x plus 1 in
terms of s and a?

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,770
So x plus 1 is essentially
equal to what?

9
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,250
So let's just take this
equation-- so what happens if

10
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,690
we subtract a from both sides?

11
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:49,550
Well, we get 2 times x plus
1 is equal to s minus a.

12
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,550
I just subtracted a
from both sides.

13
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,880
Let me switch colors.

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,820
And then if we divide both sides
by 2, we get x plus 1 is

15
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:02,150
equal to s minus a over 2.

16
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,690
And I think we're done.

17
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:04,390
That's it.

18
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,450
That was choice B.

19
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,520
It was actually surprising to
see a problem that took so

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,430
little time this late in the
test. Because they normally

21
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,360
get kind of harder as
you go through.

22
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,240
And I guess the reason why this
is a little tricky is a

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,420
lot of people's initial
motivation would be to try to

24
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,510
solve for x, and then
try to figure out

25
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,870
what x plus 1 equals.

26
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,440
But the trick is to just not
break apart this x plus 1.

27
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,390
I mean, you could kind of view
this as a variable, once

28
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,820
again, like a couple of problems
ago, where you have

29
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,070
to avoid distributing
this 2 out.

30
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:36,900
If you just keep it as x plus 1
and you solve for x plus 1,

31
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,860
you get very quickly to
s minus a over 2,

32
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,240
which is choice B.

33
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,250
The next problem, number 18.

34
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,350
We are in the home stretch.

35
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,560
And this is normally when
the problems get on

36
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,950
the difficult side.

37
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,050
So let me clear this, because
it looks like it might take

38
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,300
some space.

39
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,350
The shaded region above,
so let me draw the

40
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,600
shaded region above.

41
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:03,570
That's the y-axis-- oh man, I
want to draw it straight, but

42
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,130
anyway, I'll deal.

43
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:06,745
I'll deal.

44
00:02:06,745 --> 00:02:08,030
You can't always be perfect.

45
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:18,570
So this is the y-axis,
this is the x-axis.

46
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:23,130
And then I have this neat
looking curve that looks

47
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,380
something like this.

48
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,840
The curve keeps going.

49
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,620
Let's see, it draws
off some points.

50
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,640
So it's like 1, 2, 3, 4.

51
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,370
And it draws this boundary
line here.

52
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,550
It draws this boundary
line at 4.

53
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,800
So it's like this.

54
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,510
And then they shade the region,
and I have a feeling

55
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,990
you're going to ask about
the shaded region.

56
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,010
Actually, let me-- because
I'm going to use

57
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,290
the shaded in tools.

58
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:05,250
Let me make sure that I don't
end up filling up the whole

59
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,800
screen, so I want to make sure
that I close all the gaps.

60
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,590
So now let me use the
shaded in tool.

61
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,930
Ah, there, it worked out.

62
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,120
All right, so what
do they say?

63
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,380
The shaded region in the figure
above is bounded by the

64
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,300
x-axis, that's this.

65
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,280
The line x equals 4,
that's this line.

66
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,580
And the graph y equals f of x.

67
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,480
That's this, that's
the brown line.

68
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,140
y is equal to-- I never use
grey, maybe I should use grey.

69
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,270
I don't like grey.

70
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,010
Anyway, green.

71
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,330
If the point a, b lies in the
shaded region-- so we don't

72
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:42,660
know where.

73
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,660
It's some place in this-- let
me use a darker color.

74
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,330
Let me use navy blue.

75
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:52,290
This point a, b is some place
in the shaded region.

76
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,300
Which of the following
must be true?

77
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,960
And they have choice number
one-- now I have to use a

78
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:03,630
lighter color-- choice number
one is that a is less than or

79
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,740
equal to 4.

80
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:14,130
Choice number two is that b is
less than or equal to a.

81
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:22,990
And choice number three is
that b is less than or

82
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,700
equal to f of a.

83
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,100
Interesting.

84
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,855
So we know that a, b is in this
grey region, so it's some

85
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:32,040
place around there.

86
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:37,410
So if that's a, b, so that means
that this point-- and

87
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,510
it's not exact. a, b could have
been anywhere in this

88
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,090
grey area, but let's say
that this point is a.

89
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,470
And we know that this
point is b.

90
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,830
So we know a couple of things.

91
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:53,765
We know that a is some place
between 0 and 4.

92
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,540
So that means that a is less
than or equal to 4, because it

93
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,420
could be 4, because we're
including the boundary.

94
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,000
So this is correct.

95
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,800
We know this is true.

96
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,800
Let's see.

97
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:16,180
We also know-- well, we don't
know whether-- let's see, b is

98
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,740
less than a.

99
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,480
How can we come to
that conclusion?

100
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:26,320
Because if we had the point that
was, like, right-- well,

101
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,920
even where it's here, but
let's say that this

102
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,800
point was our a, b.

103
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,580
And I mean, just eyeballing it,
just looking at the graph,

104
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,570
it just looks-- I mean,
we don't know.

105
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,350
It looks like b in this
situation would

106
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,150
be larger than a.

107
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,170
So I definitely don't think we
can make that conclusion.

108
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:48,420
At least, there's no obvious way
to make that conclusion.

109
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,790
Because we don't know what f
of x is. f of x could be

110
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,210
really steep and have a really
high slope, in which case, b

111
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,440
would grow faster than a at
this point earlier on.

112
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,460
So I don't think that
this is right.

113
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,690
So this is not right.

114
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,980
And then let's see, is
b less than f of a?

115
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,840
So what is f of a?

116
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,440
If this is point a,
what is f of a?

117
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,760
Well, f of a is going
to be right here.

118
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,010
This is f of a.

119
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,840
And no matter where you draw it,
b is definitely going to

120
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,430
be less than f of a.

121
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:24,370
If you picked this as our point,
and if you said that

122
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:34,050
this is b, and that this is a,
then this would be f of a in

123
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,210
bloody red.

124
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:40,210
And b would still be less than
f of a, because b is in the

125
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:43,500
shaded region that is less
than f of a, essentially.

126
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,590
So we also know that this
last term is correct.

127
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,410
Hopefully that makes sense.

128
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,600
If this one doesn't make
sense, I want you to

129
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,150
experiment with it.

130
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,290
And you'll see.

131
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:59,420
But we're essentially saying
that the point is all the y

132
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:03,260
values less than f of x.

133
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,650
This is the shaded region
essentially.

134
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:06,820
So let's see, what
choice is that?

135
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,230
One and three.

136
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,320
One and three only,
that is choice D.

137
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,460
D as in dog.

138
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,020
Number 19.

139
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,050
I don't know if we're going
to have time for this.

140
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:21,050
I might have to do it
in the next video.

141
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,850
Actually, let's just do it in
the next video, because I have

142
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,680
two more problems, and I'm going
to have to have another

143
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,930
video no matter what.

144
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,380
So I'll see you in
the next video.
