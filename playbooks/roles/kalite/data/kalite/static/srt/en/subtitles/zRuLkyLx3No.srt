1
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:08,408
We're at the Musee D'Orsay and we're looking at Gustave Courbet's

2
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:12,112
gigantic canvas "The Burial at Ornans."

3
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:15,867
It was painted in 1849-1850 and exhibited

4
00:00:15,867 --> 00:00:18,403
the next year. This is the funeral of Courbet's

5
00:00:18,403 --> 00:00:22,407
great uncle. Courbet came from a relatively

6
00:00:22,407 --> 00:00:26,444
wealthy family in this relatively small town in France

7
00:00:26,444 --> 00:00:29,914
but close to the Swiss border. Right, I think we just read it had

8
00:00:29,914 --> 00:00:33,135
about three thousand people in it at that time so it's a

9
00:00:33,135 --> 00:00:36,706
really small town. We're looking at a group of people where everyone

10
00:00:36,706 --> 00:00:40,543
knows each other, so these long-standing ties.

11
00:00:40,543 --> 00:00:43,813
We see the cliffs are very typical

12
00:00:43,813 --> 00:00:48,402
of this area of France. He's pushed all of the figures really close

13
00:00:48,402 --> 00:00:51,939
to us, it's almost like a classical frieze in the way in which the figures

14
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:55,175
play across this shallow foreground, and they're forced forward

15
00:00:55,175 --> 00:00:59,980
at least optically by those cliffs. And what that does

16
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,702
is it means that these figures which are a little bit bigger than life-size in reality

17
00:01:03,702 --> 00:01:07,083
are really available to us and it's not

18
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:08,906
an idealized representation of what a funeral would be

19
00:01:08,921 --> 00:01:12,090
but it is all of the distractions of a funeral, of an actual

20
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,998
funeral. And I think we all know what that feels like.

21
00:01:15,998 --> 00:01:19,816
So these are very specific people. If exhibited in the salon

22
00:01:19,816 --> 00:01:24,927
it would have someone heroic who had died, and the sky would open up

23
00:01:24,927 --> 00:01:29,487
and there would be a sense of the afterlife. There would be a sense of

24
00:01:29,487 --> 00:01:32,294
redemption and here there isn't that promise

25
00:01:32,294 --> 00:01:37,217
of redemption, but to me the redemption although it doesn't lie in Christ,

26
00:01:37,217 --> 00:01:41,821
lies somewhere else. So the redemption is his faith

27
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:48,879
in these people, his faith in the real. Because of course Courbet was removing

28
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:52,456
that classicism and saying the art that is authentic,

29
00:01:52,456 --> 00:01:56,218
the art that is an expression of what we actually experience,

30
00:01:56,218 --> 00:02:01,058
that art is true and this was the heart of realism and of Courbet's project.

31
00:02:01,058 --> 00:02:05,588
What's interesting though is the representation

32
00:02:05,588 --> 00:02:09,802
of Christ as a sculpture carried by one of the clergymen

33
00:02:09,802 --> 00:02:14,189
amongst the people who are going about the business of the funeral,

34
00:02:14,189 --> 00:02:18,879
carrying the coffin, reading from the Bible, and officiating in general.

35
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,797
The sense of the coffin moving in from the left, its imminence in

36
00:02:24,797 --> 00:02:28,673
the grave feels much more palpable to me, separated

37
00:02:28,673 --> 00:02:32,643
only by the figure who's officiating there at the graveside and

38
00:02:32,643 --> 00:02:36,964
some small children. But there's a real sense of this community in that

39
00:02:36,964 --> 00:02:40,972
we have children, lots of children, and there's old people

40
00:02:40,972 --> 00:02:44,826
and middle-aged people and a dog. But Courbet is not creating that photographic

41
00:02:44,826 --> 00:02:48,441
realism at all. He's creating a synthetic realism. The dog

42
00:02:48,441 --> 00:02:51,762
chancing by becomes kind of an emblem for

43
00:02:51,762 --> 00:02:57,067
the sense of distractiveness, the chaos, the actuality

44
00:02:57,067 --> 00:03:01,472
of a moment. There's something very poignant to me about this community

45
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:04,074
coming together for this funeral, for a long-standing

46
00:03:04,074 --> 00:03:08,424
member of the community, and the way it almost functions

47
00:03:08,424 --> 00:03:11,977
as a modern momento mori. Death comes

48
00:03:11,977 --> 00:03:15,670
to all of us, and all we have in a way

49
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,616
is our moment, our time, our community.

50
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,124
Courbet, I think, underscores that

51
00:03:22,124 --> 00:03:25,698
in a number of ways. First of all there's real beauty to the way he's rendering

52
00:03:25,698 --> 00:03:28,534
these figures, but there's also a discarded skull

53
00:03:28,534 --> 00:03:31,504
at the edge of that hole in the ground, which

54
00:03:31,504 --> 00:03:34,841
seems as if it had been dug up absentmindedly when

55
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:38,662
they dug this fresh grave. And that skull,

56
00:03:38,662 --> 00:03:42,372
a reminder of course of the more traditional paintings of Golgotha

57
00:03:42,372 --> 00:03:46,439
and Christ, of the crucifixion, but here

58
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:50,056
this notion that there was somebody else who died who has now been forgotten.

59
00:03:50,056 --> 00:03:52,415
In the extreme right, there's the

60
00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:56,471
face of a child, and that paint is so black

61
00:03:56,471 --> 00:04:00,174
that the face floats in space.

62
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:04,145
There is this quality of thinking about the nature of selfhood

63
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,468
and of our own mortality that is very poignant.

64
00:04:07,468 --> 00:04:12,557
Because we don't have that typical composition which would have focused us on a main

65
00:04:12,557 --> 00:04:15,963
heroic figure and there's instead this kind of

66
00:04:15,963 --> 00:04:18,843
democracy of attention where everyone

67
00:04:18,843 --> 00:04:24,734
is getting their own portrait. Each person is

68
00:04:24,734 --> 00:04:27,737
in the private space of their own mind at this moment

69
00:04:27,737 --> 00:04:30,860
of a funeral, thinking about mortality

70
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:36,012
but at the same time thinking about maybe dinner. I would argue that there are two things going on.

71
00:04:36,012 --> 00:04:37,480
I think you're absolutely right.

72
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,667
There is that individual that is represented here, that was so important to Courbet.

73
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:44,471
But at the same time there's a kind of type, as well, and that is still

74
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:49,376
here. There's the clergy. There's the town officials.

75
00:04:49,376 --> 00:04:52,501
There are the women going about their traditional role

76
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:56,850
weeping and mourning. There are the children who may be distracted

77
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,155
but are also representing beauty and youth, and a kind of innocence.

78
00:05:00,155 --> 00:05:04,876
And so there are still types at work but he is transcending those types

79
00:05:04,876 --> 00:05:08,074
with that individual experience. This was shown first

80
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:11,696
in Ornans itself and then in the Paris salon

81
00:05:11,696 --> 00:05:17,869
where people were just astounded. What was this thing that Courbet was showing?

82
00:05:17,869 --> 00:05:19,737
Well, I mean it broke every rule.

83
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:22,798
And it didn't look like how art was supposed to look, certainly at this scale.

84
00:05:22,798 --> 00:05:26,829
It wasn't composed. It had no redemptive message

85
00:05:26,829 --> 00:05:30,899
it wasn't ideal. It wasn't the right kind of subject. I mean, it wasn't right

86
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:34,870
in any way. The people who posed for this, some scholars

87
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,407
have suggested felt ridiculed by the Parisans

88
00:05:38,407 --> 00:05:43,697
but for Courbet that notion of the rural

89
00:05:43,697 --> 00:05:46,733
was in fact much more authentic

90
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:52,172
without the polish, and in a sense without the falseness that urban

91
00:05:52,172 --> 00:05:55,342
culture had developed. And of course Courbet's whole

92
00:05:55,342 --> 00:06:00,098
idea is to paint the real and the concrete and to turn his

93
00:06:00,098 --> 00:06:04,936
back on Romanticism and that kind of emotion and to

94
00:06:04,936 --> 00:06:09,574
paint things, I think the famous thing is, "Show me an angel and I'll paint one."
