1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,740
   

2
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,260
Let's see if we can name this
molecule using the-- sometimes

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,740
called the R-S system, or the
Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,830
And the first thing to do is
just to see if there are any

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,830
chiral centers in
this molecule.

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:14,960
If there aren't, then
we don't even have

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,379
to use the R-S system.

8
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:17,960
We can just use our standard
nomenclature

9
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,440
rules and we'd be done.

10
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,760
So if we look here, this carbon
is attached to three

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,230
hydrogens, so it's definitely
not attached to

12
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,490
four different groups.

13
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,180
Same thing about this
carbon right here.

14
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,950
This carbon right here is
attached to a fluorine, but

15
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,130
then it's attached to
two methyl groups.

16
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,030
So it's the same group, so
this is also not a chiral

17
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,480
carbon or an asymmetric
carbon.

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,710
This carbon right here is
attached to a hydrogen and

19
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,740
three other carbons, but each
of these three carbons look

20
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,700
like different groups.

21
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,340
This carbon is attached to two
methyls and a fluorine.

22
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,820
This carbon is attached to two
hydrogens and a bromine.

23
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,570
This carbon is just
a methyl group.

24
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,110
So this right here does look
like a chiral center.

25
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,880
It does look like a
chiral carbon, and

26
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,250
the other ones don't.

27
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,380
This is just a methyl group.

28
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,200
It has three hydrogens, so
definitely not attached to

29
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,620
four different groups.

30
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,680
And this is attached to two
hydrogens, and those are

31
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,960
obviously the same group,
so this is also

32
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,890
not a chiral center.

33
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,490
So we have one chiral
center, so the R-S

34
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,470
naming system will apply.

35
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,110
But a good starting point will
just be naming it using our

36
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,550
standard nomenclature rules.

37
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:24,360
And to do that we look for the
longest carbon chain here.

38
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,970
Let's see, if we start over
here, and I don't know what

39
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,440
direction I'm going to name it
from yet, but I just want to

40
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,780
identify the longest chain.

41
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,280
If we went from here, we
have one, two, three.

42
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,090
We can either go to four or to
four there, so we definitely

43
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,950
have four carbons, Four
carbon, longest chain.

44
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,530
   

45
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:48,410
So that tells us that we will
be using the prefix but-, or

46
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,290
it will be a butane, because
they're all single bonds here,

47
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,830
so it is a butane.

48
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,250
But to decide whether we branch
off, it doesn't matter

49
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,930
whether we use this
CH3 or this CH3,

50
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,100
they're the same group.

51
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,750
But to decide whether we use
this part of the longest chain

52
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,820
or we use that, we think about
the rule that the core chain

53
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,930
to use should have as many
simple groups attached to it

54
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,590
as possible, as opposed to
as few complex groups.

55
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,550
So if we used this carbon as
part of our longest chain,

56
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,590
then this will be a group that's
attached to it, which

57
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:28,670
would be a bromomethyl group,
which is not as simple as

58
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,500
maybe it could be.

59
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,210
But if we use this carbon in our
longest chain, we'll have

60
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:32,830
two groups.

61
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,110
We'll have a bromo attached,
and we'll also

62
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,180
have a methyl group.

63
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,090
And that's what we want.

64
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,630
We want more simple groups
attached to the longest chain.

65
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,900
So what we're going to do is
we're going to use this

66
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,400
carbon, this carbon, this
carbon, and that carbon as our

67
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,350
longest chain.

68
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,980
And we want to start from the
end that is closest to

69
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,930
something being attached
to it, and that

70
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:54,980
bromine is right there.

71
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,320
So there's going to be our
number one carbon, our number

72
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,570
two carbon, our number
three carbon, and

73
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,120
our number four carbon.

74
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,930
And then we can label the
different groups and then

75
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:07,630
figure out what order they
should be listed in.

76
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:13,620
So this is a 1-bromo and
then this will be a

77
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,950
2-methyl right here.

78
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:19,160
   

79
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,840
And then just a hydrogen.

80
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,680
Then three we have a fluoro, so
on a carbon three, we have

81
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:30,450
a fluoro, and then on carbon
three, we also have a methyl

82
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,340
group right here, so we
also have a 3-methyl.

83
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,110
   

84
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,720
So when we name it, we put
in alphabetical order.

85
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,435
Bromo comes first, so this thing
right here is 1-bromo.

86
00:03:41,435 --> 00:03:44,540
   

87
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,380
Then alphabetically, fluoro
comes next, 1-bromo-3-fluoro.

88
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:53,260
   

89
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,140
We have two methyls, so it's
going to be 2 comma

90
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,390
3-dimethyl.

91
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,660
   

92
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,690
And remember, the D doesn't
count in alphabetical order.

93
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:11,330
Dimethylbutane, because
we have the longest

94
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,970
chain is four carbons.

95
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,570
Dimethylbutane.

96
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,680
So that's just the standard
nomenclature rules.

97
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,610
We still haven't used
the R-S system.

98
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,790
Now we can do that.

99
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,959
Now to think about that, we
already said that this is our

100
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,570
chiral center, so we just have
to essentially rank the groups

101
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:29,380
attached to it in order of
atomic number and then use the

102
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,210
Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules,
and we'll do all

103
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,040
that in this example.

104
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,770
So let's look at the different
groups attached to it.

105
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,710
So when you look at it,
this guy has three

106
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,350
carbons and a hydrogen.

107
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,010
Carbon is definitely higher
in atomic number on

108
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:43,900
the Periodic Table.

109
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,580
It has an atomic number 6.

110
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,160
Hydrogen is 1.

111
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,680
You probably know
that already.

112
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,150
So hydrogen is definitely
going to be number four.

113
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,940
So let me put number four there
next to the hydrogen.

114
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,560
And let me find a nice color.

115
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,710
I'll do it in white.

116
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,640
So hydrogen is definitely
the number four group.

117
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,830
We have to differentiate between
this carbon group,

118
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,870
that carbon group, and
that carbon group.

119
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,690
And the way you do it, if
there's a tie on the three

120
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,940
carbons, you then look at what
is attached to those carbons,

121
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,280
and you compare the highest
thing attached to each of

122
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,330
those carbons to the highest
things attached to the other

123
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,760
carbons, and then you
do the same ranking.

124
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,940
And if that's a tie, then you
keep going on and on and on.

125
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,140
So on this carbon right here,
we have a bromine.

126
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:30,390
Bromine has an atomic
number of 35, which

127
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:35,410
is higher than carbon.

128
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,940
So this guy has a bromine
attached to it.

129
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,190
This guy only has hydrogen
attached to it.

130
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,730
This guy has a fluorine
attached to it.

131
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,160
That's the highest thing.

132
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,180
So this is going to be the third
lowest, or I should say

133
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,800
the second to lowest, because it
only has hydrogens attached

134
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,480
to it, so that is
number three.

135
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,430
The one has the bromine attached
to it is going to be

136
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:59,020
number one, and the one that has
the fluorine attached to

137
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,270
it is number two.

138
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,470
   

139
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,720
And just a reminder, we were
tied with the carbon, so we

140
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,100
have to look at the next highest
constituent, and even

141
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,990
if this had three fluorines
attached to it, the bromine

142
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,060
would still trump it.

143
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,610
You compare the highest to the
highest. So now that we've

144
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,120
done that, let me redraw this
molecule so it's a little bit

145
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,545
easier to visualize.

146
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:23,540
So I'll draw our chiral
carbon in the middle.

147
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,920
   

148
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,440
And I'm just doing this for
visualization purposes.

149
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,420
And right here we have
our number one group.

150
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,010
I'll literally just call that
our number one group.

151
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:37,190
So right there that is
our number one group.

152
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,600
It's in the plane
of the screen.

153
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,710
So I'll just call that
our number one group.

154
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,330
   

155
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:49,500
Over here, also in the plane
of the screen, I have our

156
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,750
number two group.

157
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,530
   

158
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,210
So let me do it like that.

159
00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:02,260
So then you have your number
two group, just like that.

160
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,390
And then you have your number
three group behind the

161
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,375
molecule right now the
way it's drawn.

162
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:10,200
I'll do that in magenta.

163
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,860
So then you have your
number three group.

164
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:15,490
It's behind the molecule, so
I'll draw it like this.

165
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,930
This is our number
three group.

166
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,440
   

167
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,480
And then we have our number
four group, which is the

168
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,690
hydrogen pointing
out right now.

169
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,620
And I'll just do that
in a yellow.

170
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,910
We have our number four
group pointing out

171
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,260
in front right now.

172
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:38,480
So that is number four,
just like that.

173
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,860
Actually, let me draw it a
little bit clearer, so it

174
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,190
looks a little bit more like the
tripod structure that it's

175
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:43,790
supposed to be.

176
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,970
So let me redraw the
number three group.

177
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:51,380
The number three group should
look like-- so this is our

178
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,140
number three group.

179
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,390
Let me draw it a little
bit more like this.

180
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,080
The number three group
is behind us.

181
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,160
   

182
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,140
And then finally, you have
your number four group in

183
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,630
yellow, which is just a
hydrogen that's coming

184
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,100
straight out.

185
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,620
So that is coming straight out
of-- well, not straight out,

186
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,240
but at an angle out
of the page.

187
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,020
So that's our number four group,
I'll just label it

188
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,610
number four.

189
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,480
It really is just a hydrogen,
so I really didn't have to

190
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,030
simplify it much there.

191
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:23,120
Now by the R-S system, or by the
Cahn-Ingold-Prelog system,

192
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,440
we want our number four group
to be the one furthest back.

193
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,300
So we really want it where the
number three position is.

194
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,909
And so the easiest way I can
think of doing that is you can

195
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:37,720
imagine this is a tripod that's
leaning upside down.

196
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,140
Or another way to view it
is you can view it as an

197
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,490
umbrella, where this is the
handle of the umbrella and

198
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,880
that's the top of the
umbrella that would

199
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,300
block the rain, I guess.

200
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,000
But the easiest way to get the
number four group that's

201
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,210
actually a hydrogen in the
number three position would be

202
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,070
to rotate it.

203
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,580
You could imagine, rotate it
around the axis defined by the

204
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,300
number one group.

205
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,670
So the number one group
is just going to

206
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,940
stay where it is.

207
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,440
The number four is going
to rotate to the

208
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,670
number three group.

209
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:06,630
Number three is going to rotate
around to the number

210
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:11,190
two group, and then the number
two group is going to rotate

211
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,340
to where the number four
group is right now.

212
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,330
So if we were to redraw
that, let's

213
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,140
redraw our chiral carbon.

214
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,220
So let me scroll over
a little bit.

215
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,110
So we have our chiral carbon.

216
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,430
I put the little asterisk there
to say that that's our

217
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,630
chiral carbon.

218
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,295
The number four group
is now behind.

219
00:09:28,295 --> 00:09:29,590
I'll do it with the circles.

220
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,300
It makes it look a little bit
more like atoms. So the number

221
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,840
four group is now behind where
the number three group used to

222
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,230
be, so number four
is now there.

223
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:41,200
   

224
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,650
Number one hasn't changed.

225
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:46,030
That's kind of the axis that
we rotated around.

226
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:49,270
So the number one group
has not changed.

227
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,140
Number one is still there.

228
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:55,410
Number two is now where number
four used to be, so number two

229
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,920
is now jutting out
of the page.

230
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:05,190
   

231
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:09,670
And then we have number three
is now where number two was.

232
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,030
So number three is there.

233
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:14,050
   

234
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:17,280
And now that we've put our
fourth group behind the

235
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,630
molecule, we literally just
figure out whether we have to

236
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,640
go clockwise or counterclockwise
to go from

237
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,080
one, two to three.

238
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,310
And that's pretty
straightforward.

239
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:27,530
To go from one to two to
three, we have to go

240
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:28,780
counterclockwise.

241
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:35,680
   

242
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,520
Or another way to think of it,
we're going to the left,

243
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,800
counterclockwise.

244
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,510
At least on the top of
the clock, we're

245
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,710
going to the left.

246
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:46,390
And so, since we're going to
left, this is S or sinister.

247
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:50,770
This is S, which stands
for sinister, which

248
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,610
is Latin for left.

249
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,360
So we're done.

250
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,370
We've named it using
the R-S system.

251
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:01,870
This molecule is (S)--
sinister--

252
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,120
1-bromo-3-fluoro-2,3-di--

253
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,266
