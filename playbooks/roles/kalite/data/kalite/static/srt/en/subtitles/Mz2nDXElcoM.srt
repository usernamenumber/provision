1
00:00:01,296 --> 00:00:04,112
Let's say that I have a ramp made of ice

2
00:00:04,112 --> 00:00:08,208
think maybe a wedge or some type of inclined plane made of ice

3
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:12,063
we'll make everything of ice in this video so that we have negligible friction

4
00:00:12,063 --> 00:00:16,277
So this right here is my ramp. It's made of ice

5
00:00:16,277 --> 00:00:20,394
and this angle right over here let's just go with 30 degrees

6
00:00:20,394 --> 00:00:25,529
Let's say on this ramp made of ice I have another block of ice

7
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:28,216
so this is a block of ice

8
00:00:30,315 --> 00:00:31,963
shiny like ice is shiny

9
00:00:31,963 --> 00:00:34,133
and it is has a mass

10
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:38,060
it has a mass of 10 kg

11
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:42,443
and i want to do is think about what's going to happen to this block of ice

12
00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:45,683
so first of all what are the forces that we know are acting on it

13
00:00:45,683 --> 00:00:47,615
well if we're assuming we're on earth

14
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:48,803
and we will

15
00:00:48,803 --> 00:00:52,033
and we're near the surface then there is the force of gravity

16
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:56,661
there's the force of gravity acting on this block of ice

17
00:00:56,661 --> 00:00:59,807
and the force of gravity

18
00:00:59,807 --> 00:01:05,803
is going to be equal to or at least it's magnitude is going to be in the downward direction

19
00:01:05,803 --> 00:01:11,265
and it's magnitude is going to be the mass of the block of ice times the gravitational field

20
00:01:11,265 --> 00:01:13,781
times 9.8 meters per second squared

21
00:01:13,781 --> 00:01:19,616
so it's going to 98 newtons downward

22
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,804
i just took 10 kg

23
00:01:20,804 --> 00:01:22,035
let me write it out

24
00:01:22,035 --> 00:01:33,579
so the force due to gravity is going to be equal to 10 kg times 9.8 m/s^2 downward

25
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:43,021
this 9.8 m/s^2 downward that is the field vector for the gravitational field near the surface of the earth

26
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:44,131
I guess is one way to think about it

27
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:49,936
sometimes you'll see the negative 9.8 m/s^2 and that negative is giving you the direction implicitly

28
00:01:49,936 --> 00:01:54,036
because the convention is normally that positive is upward and negative is downward

29
00:01:54,036 --> 00:01:56,202
but we'll just go with this right over here

30
00:01:56,202 --> 00:01:59,651
the magnitude of this vector is 10 times 9.8

31
00:01:59,651 --> 00:02:04,315
which 98 is kg-m/s^2 which is the same thing as newtons

32
00:02:04,315 --> 00:02:08,065
so the magnitude here is 98 newtons and it is pointing downwards

33
00:02:08,065 --> 00:02:14,868
now what we want to do here is break this vector up into the components that are perpendicular and parallel to the surface of this ramp

34
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,102
so let's do that

35
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:20,617
so first let's think about perpendicular to the surface of the ramp

36
00:02:20,617 --> 00:02:23,056
so perpendicular to the surface of the ramp

37
00:02:23,056 --> 00:02:25,584
so this right over here is a right angle

38
00:02:25,584 --> 00:02:29,398
and we saw in the last video that whatever angle this is over here

39
00:02:29,398 --> 00:02:31,604
that is also gonna be this angle over here

40
00:02:31,604 --> 00:02:36,738
so this angle over here is also going to be a 30 degree angle

41
00:02:36,738 --> 00:02:42,469
and we can use that information to figure out the magnitude of this orange vector right over here

42
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:49,733
and remember this orange vector is the component of the force of gravity that is perpendicular to the plane

43
00:02:49,733 --> 00:02:53,567
and then there is going to be some component that is parallel to the plane

44
00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:55,170
I'll draw that in yellow

45
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:00,256
some component of the force of gravity that is parallel to the plane

46
00:03:00,256 --> 00:03:02,103
and clearly this is a right angle

47
00:03:02,103 --> 00:03:05,721
cause this is perpendicular to the plane and this is parallel to the plane

48
00:03:05,721 --> 00:03:06,823
so they're going to

49
00:03:06,823 --> 00:03:11,016
and it's perpendicular to the plane and it's also perpendicular to this vector right over here

50
00:03:11,016 --> 00:03:13,592
so we can use some basic trigonometry like we did in the last video

51
00:03:13,592 --> 00:03:18,905
to figure out the magnitude of this orange and this yellow vector right over here

52
00:03:18,905 --> 00:03:24,491
this orange vector's magnitude over the hypotenuse is going to be equal to the cosine of 30

53
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:35,036
or you could say the magnitude of this is 98 times the cosine of 30

54
00:03:35,036 --> 00:03:37,701
the cosine of 30 degrees newtons

55
00:03:37,701 --> 00:03:39,907
98 times the cosine of 30 degrees newtons

56
00:03:39,907 --> 00:03:42,470
and if you want the whole vector it's in this direction

57
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:46,576
in the direction going into the surface of the plane

58
00:03:46,588 --> 00:03:48,707
and based on the simple trigonometry

59
00:03:48,707 --> 00:03:52,157
we go into this in little more detail in the last video

60
00:03:52,157 --> 00:03:58,791
we know that the component of this vector that is parallel to the surface of this plane

61
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:04,793
is going to be 98 sine of 30 degrees

62
00:04:04,793 --> 00:04:08,474
sine of 30 degrees

63
00:04:08,474 --> 00:04:11,560
and this comes straight out of this magnitude

64
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,160
which is the opposite to the angle

65
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,374
over the hypotenuse

66
00:04:15,374 --> 00:04:18,360
opposite over hypotenuse is equal to sine of the angle

67
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,726
we did all work over here

68
00:04:19,741 --> 00:04:25,542
I don't want to keep repeating it but I want to emphasize that this coming straight out of basic trigonometry

69
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:28,490
straight out of basic trigonometry

70
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,872
so once you do that we know the different components

71
00:04:30,872 --> 00:04:32,419
we can calculate them

72
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:37,291
cosine of 30 degrees is square root of 3 over 2

73
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,288
sine of 30 degrees is one half

74
00:04:39,288 --> 00:04:40,738
that's just one of those things you learn

75
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:43,942
you can derive it yourself using 30 60 90 triangles

76
00:04:43,942 --> 00:04:45,524
or actually even equilateral triangles

77
00:04:45,524 --> 00:04:46,742
or you can use a calculator

78
00:04:46,742 --> 00:04:50,256
but it's also one of those of things that you memorize when you take trigonometry

79
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:53,808
so no kind of magical trick i did here

80
00:04:53,808 --> 00:05:01,206
so if you evaluate this 98 time square root 3 over 2 newtons tells us that

81
00:05:01,206 --> 00:05:02,937
let me write it in that same orange color

82
00:05:02,937 --> 00:05:08,010
the force, the component of gravity that is perpendicular to the plane

83
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,391
and this kind of implicitly gives us its direction

84
00:05:10,391 --> 00:05:11,691
it's perpendicular to the plane

85
00:05:11,691 --> 00:05:14,026
but the force the component of gravity that is perpendicular to the plane

86
00:05:14,026 --> 00:05:16,872
is equal to 98 times square root of 3 over 2

87
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:23,311
98 divided by 2 is 49 so it's equal to 49 times the square root of 3 newtons

88
00:05:23,311 --> 00:05:26,728
and it's direction is into the surface of the plane

89
00:05:26,728 --> 00:05:28,560
or downward or

90
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,179
let me just write into the suface of the plane

91
00:05:32,179 --> 00:05:36,163
into surface of plane

92
00:05:36,163 --> 00:05:37,839
or the surface of the ramp

93
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:39,121
and it's in this direction over here

94
00:05:39,121 --> 00:05:40,678
and i have to do this because it's a vector

95
00:05:40,678 --> 00:05:43,125
i have to tell to you what direction it's going in

96
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:48,610
and the component of the force of gravity that is parallel

97
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,512
i drew it down here but i can shift it up here

98
00:05:51,512 --> 00:05:53,246
it's the same exact vector

99
00:05:53,246 --> 00:05:58,145
the component of gravity that is parallel to the surface of the plane

100
00:05:58,145 --> 00:05:59,709
is 98 times sine of 30

101
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:01,792
that's 98 times one half

102
00:06:01,792 --> 00:06:04,393
which is 49 newtons

103
00:06:04,393 --> 00:06:07,076
and it's going in that direction

104
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:09,978
or parallel to the surface of the plane

105
00:06:09,978 --> 00:06:14,626
parallel to the surface of the plane

106
00:06:14,626 --> 00:06:16,480
i always have trouble spelling parallel

107
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,496
parallel to the surface of the plane

108
00:06:19,496 --> 00:06:21,175
so what's going to happen here?

109
00:06:21,175 --> 00:06:25,998
well if these were the only forces acting on it

110
00:06:25,998 --> 00:06:32,162
so if we had a net force going into the surface of the plane of 49 square roots of 3 newtons

111
00:06:32,162 --> 00:06:35,675
if this was the only force acting in this dimension

112
00:06:35,675 --> 00:06:38,428
or in the dimension that is perpendicular to the surface of the plane

113
00:06:38,428 --> 00:06:39,943
what would happen?

114
00:06:39,943 --> 00:06:42,129
well the block would just accelerate

115
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:44,608
at least just due to this force it would accelerate downward

116
00:06:44,608 --> 00:06:47,792
it would accelerate into the surface of the plane

117
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:49,657
but we know it's not going to accelerate

118
00:06:49,657 --> 00:06:54,632
we know there's this big wedge of ice here that is keeping it from accelerating in that direction

119
00:06:54,632 --> 00:06:58,308
so at least in this dimension there will be no acceleration

120
00:06:58,308 --> 00:07:04,395
when i talk about this dimension i'm talking about in the direction that is perpendicular to the surface of the plane

121
00:07:04,395 --> 00:07:08,174
there will be no acceleration because this wedge is here

122
00:07:08,174 --> 00:07:13,195
so the wedge is exerting a force that completely counteracts the force

123
00:07:13,195 --> 00:07:16,466
the perpendicular component of gravity

124
00:07:16,466 --> 00:07:17,547
and that force

125
00:07:17,547 --> 00:07:20,666
you might guess what it's called

126
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:23,891
the wedge is exerting a force just like that

127
00:07:23,891 --> 00:07:27,311
that's going to be 98 newtons upward

128
00:07:27,311 --> 00:07:30,261
so i will call it

129
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:33,109
the wedge is going to be exerting a force that is 98

130
00:07:33,109 --> 00:07:34,830
oh sorry, not 98

131
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,381
49 square roots of 3

132
00:07:37,381 --> 00:07:38,496
cause this right here is 49 square roots of 3 into

133
00:07:38,496 --> 00:07:48,309
and so this is 49 square roots of 3 newtons out of the surface

134
00:07:48,814 --> 00:07:51,526
and this is the normal force

135
00:07:51,526 --> 00:07:57,267
it is the force perpendicular to the surface that is essentially you can kind of view as the contact force

136
00:07:57,267 --> 00:08:06,500
that the in this case that the surface is exerting to keep this block of ice from accelerating in that direction

137
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,095
and we're not talking about accelerating straight toward the center of the earth

138
00:08:09,095 --> 00:08:11,385
we're talking about accelerating in that direction

139
00:08:11,385 --> 00:08:16,249
we broke up the force into kind of the perpendicular direction and the parallel direction

140
00:08:16,249 --> 00:08:18,746
so you have this counteracting normal force

141
00:08:18,746 --> 00:08:28,368
that's why you don't have the block plummeting or accelerating into the plane

142
00:08:28,368 --> 00:08:30,649
now what other forces do we have?

143
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:34,501
we have the force that's parallel to the surface

144
00:08:34,501 --> 00:08:36,246
and if we assume that there's no friction

145
00:08:36,246 --> 00:08:42,466
and i can assume that there's no friction in this video cause we are assuming that it is ice on ice

146
00:08:42,466 --> 00:08:43,700
what is going to happen?

147
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,469
there is no counteracting force to this 49 newtons

148
00:08:47,469 --> 00:08:50,285
49 newtons parallel downwards

149
00:08:50,285 --> 00:08:54,836
i should say parallel downwards to the surface of the plane

150
00:08:54,836 --> 00:08:56,353
what's going to happen?

151
00:08:56,353 --> 00:08:58,886
well it's going to accelerate in that direction

152
00:08:58,886 --> 00:09:02,883
you have force is equal to mass times acceleration

153
00:09:02,883 --> 00:09:07,717
force is equal to mass times acceleration (F = ma)

154
00:09:07,717 --> 00:09:09,771
or you divide both sides by mass

155
00:09:09,771 --> 00:09:14,419
you get force over mass is equal to acceleration

156
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:17,034
over here our force is 49 newtons

157
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:19,571
in that direction

158
00:09:19,571 --> 00:09:22,569
parallel downwards to the surface of the plane

159
00:09:22,569 --> 00:09:24,970
so if you divide both by mass

160
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:28,165
if you divide both of these, if you divided by mass

161
00:09:28,165 --> 00:09:31,520
so that's the same thing as dividing it by 10 kg

162
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,121
dividing by 10 kg

163
00:09:33,121 --> 00:09:35,419
that will give you acceleration

164
00:09:35,419 --> 00:09:40,413
that will give you our acceleration

165
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,618
so acceleration is 49 newtons divided by 10 kg

166
00:09:42,618 --> 00:09:44,815
in that direction

167
00:09:44,815 --> 00:09:48,629
in this direction right over there

168
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,599
49 divided by 10 is 4.9

169
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:55,866
newtons divided by kg is meters per second squared

170
00:09:55,866 --> 00:10:03,450
so then you get your acceleration is going to be 4.9 m/s^2

171
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:06,747
maybe i could say parallel

172
00:10:06,747 --> 00:10:15,456
that's two bars or maybe i'll write parallel downwards to surface

173
00:10:15,456 --> 00:10:17,821
to the surface

174
00:10:17,821 --> 00:10:19,818
now i'm gonna leave you there

175
00:10:19,818 --> 00:10:23,483
i'll let you think about another thing that i'll address in the next video

176
00:10:23,483 --> 00:10:26,191
what if you had this just standing still?

177
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:27,948
it wasn't accelerating downwards

178
00:10:27,948 --> 00:10:30,247
it wasn't accelerating and sliding down

179
00:10:30,247 --> 00:10:34,819
what would be the force that's keeping it in sort of a static state?

180
00:10:34,819 --> 99:59:59,999
we'll think about that in the next video
