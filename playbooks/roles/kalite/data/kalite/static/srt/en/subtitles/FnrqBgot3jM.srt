1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
   

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,940
We're asked to graph the
inequality y is less

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,920
than 3x plus 5.

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,920
So if you give us any x-- and
let me label the axes here.

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,170
So this is the x-axis.

6
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,250
This is the y-axis.

7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,040
So this is saying you
give me an x.

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,590
So let's say we take x is
equal to 1 right there.

9
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,840
3 times 1 plus 5.

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,510
So 3 times x plus 5.

11
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,010
So 3 times 1 is 3 plus 5 is 8.

12
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,730
So one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

13
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,970
This is saying that y
will be less than 8.

14
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,810
y will be less than
3 times 1 plus 5.

15
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:41,890
So the y-values that satisfy
this constraint for that x are

16
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,850
going to be all of these
values down here.

17
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,500
Let me do it in a
lighter color.

18
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,820
It'll be all of these values.

19
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,430
For x is equal to 1, it'll be
all the values down here, and

20
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,180
it would not include
y is equal to 8.

21
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,240
Y has to be less than 8.

22
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,030
Now, if we kept doing that, we
would essentially just to

23
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:04,530
graph the line of y is equal to
3x plus 5, but we wouldn't

24
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:05,110
include it.

25
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,520
We would just include everything
below it, just like

26
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,700
we did right here.

27
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,280
So we know how to graph just
y is equal to 3x plus 5.

28
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,570
Let me write it over here.

29
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:18,820
So if I were to write y is equal
to 3x plus 5, we would

30
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,030
say, OK, 3 is the slope.

31
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,450
Slope is equal to 3, and then
5 is the y-intercept.

32
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,700
Now, I could just graph the
line, but because that won't

33
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,070
be included in the y's that
satisfy this constraint, I'm

34
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,090
going to graph it as
a dotted line.

35
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,240
So we'll start with the
y-intercept of 5.

36
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,540
So one, two, three,
four, five.

37
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,900
That's the y-intercept.

38
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,470
And the slope is 3.

39
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,990
So if you go over to
the 1, you go up 3.

40
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:48,240
So let me do that in that
darker purple color.

41
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,750
So it'll look like this.

42
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,660
It will look like that.

43
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,740
That point would be on it.

44
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,970
That point would be on it.

45
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,880
If you go back, you're going
to go down by 3.

46
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,190
So that point will be on it,
that point, and that point,

47
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,530
and I'll just connect the
dots with a dotted line.

48
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,970
   

49
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,680
That dotted line is the graph
of y is equal to 3x plus 5,

50
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,040
but we're not going
to include it.

51
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,480
So that's why I made it a dotted
line because we want

52
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,060
all of the y's that are
less than that.

53
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,930
So for any x-- so
you pick an x.

54
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,700
Let's say x is equal
to negative 1.

55
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,840
If you evaluate 3x plus 5 for
that x, you'd get here.

56
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,220
But we only care about
the y's that are

57
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,660
strictly less than that.

58
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,220
So you don't include the line.

59
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,110
It's everything below it.

60
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,680
So for any x you pick, it's
going to be below that line.

61
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,500
You take the x, go up to that
line and everything below it.

62
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,125
So for all of the x's, it's
going to be this entire area.

63
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:44,460
   

64
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,630
Let me draw it a little
bit neater than that.

65
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:50,120
It's going to be this entire
area that's under the line.

66
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,010
I'll do it in this orange.

67
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,000
It's a little bit
easier to see.

68
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,270
So this entire area under the
line is y is less than 3x.

69
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,800
