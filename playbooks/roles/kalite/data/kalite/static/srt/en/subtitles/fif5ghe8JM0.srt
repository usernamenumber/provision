1
00:00:01,184 --> 00:00:05,642
This is Sal here and I'm at Stanford Medical School with Dr. Andy Connelly.

2
00:00:05,642 --> 00:00:10,240
Hi there Sal, I'm here to discuss with you histology today.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,745
Histology! And, and forgive me, for what is probably a simple question, but what is histology?

4
00:00:14,745 --> 00:00:20,178
So it will be the -ology, the study of, in this case the histo-, means tissues.

5
00:00:20,178 --> 00:00:28,800
We're going to be looking up the cellular components of organs.

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,300
Cool... yeah.

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,578
So what we're going to be looking at today is the histology of the colon.

8
00:00:32,578 --> 00:00:39,683
And so for the colon we often have colon specimens coming in from pathology.

9
00:00:39,683 --> 00:00:45,813
And so the colon, like you were saying before, is the large intestine.

10
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:53,150
So if you have this piece of large intestine, and its removed from the patient because there is an area

11
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,451
of cancer.

12
00:00:54,451 --> 00:01:01,324
It might be cancer, they're actually pretty good now about doing colonoscopy.

13
00:01:01,324 --> 00:01:03,460
Looking from the inside--

14
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:09,637
They'll often have looked inside think it looks like cancer

15
00:01:09,637 --> 00:01:12,795
take a little piece and send it to us before hand, and then they remove it.

16
00:01:12,795 --> 00:01:15,488
And the reason why they want to send it to you is

17
00:01:15,488 --> 00:01:18,089
even if they know its cancer how severe is this cancer?

18
00:01:18,089 --> 00:01:22,686
How severe is the cancer? They also want to get a really good tissue diagnosis

19
00:01:22,686 --> 00:01:28,027
to make sure if they're going to go remove a piece of your colon, that they really know that its cancer

20
00:01:28,027 --> 00:01:30,349
rather than it just looks like cancer.

21
00:01:30,349 --> 00:01:32,485
So its the definitive proof before they remove it.

22
00:01:32,485 --> 00:01:38,011
So then if this is the cancer that's removed they clearly want to be able to check the margins

23
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:41,773
to make sure its removed in its entirety.

24
00:01:41,773 --> 00:01:46,417
But often inside of there, they'll find other pieces of tissues, like here's a polyp

25
00:01:46,417 --> 00:01:50,597
And when we say check the margins, this is literally, just making sure

26
00:01:50,597 --> 00:01:53,197
you've covered enough material so that you've gotten all the cancer in it

27
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:56,030
that you're not kind of cutting through the cancer and that you've missed something.

28
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,445
That's right, because this is actually one of the traditional

29
00:01:58,445 --> 00:02:01,464
surgical cures of cut it out to cure.

30
00:02:01,464 --> 00:02:04,296
Colon cancer, that tends to still be the case.

31
00:02:04,296 --> 00:02:07,036
Because you cut it out to make sure you cure it.

32
00:02:07,036 --> 00:02:09,916
There are many other kinds of cancers that which spread so widely early on

33
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:12,238
that you don't usually cut out.

34
00:02:12,238 --> 00:02:17,625
So then the polyp can be found in a piece of colon removed

35
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:20,458
a polyp is something that just sticks up.

36
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,940
Any tissue that sticks up. It's not necessarily cancer.

37
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,677
No, so for instance another common place you hear about is

38
00:02:28,677 --> 00:02:30,953
some people in the sinuses might have sinus trouble

39
00:02:30,953 --> 00:02:32,903
and they'll have a sinus polyp

40
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,947
those are almost always just inflamed.

41
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:40,705
And then we'll find areas in which it's just the lining

42
00:02:40,705 --> 00:02:43,167
that's been roughened, and we'll take sections of those.

43
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:46,835
And that can happen from just someone being allergic to food

44
00:02:46,835 --> 00:02:48,832
Yeah, irritations of such.

45
00:02:48,832 --> 00:02:51,108
Yes, irritations of certain sites.

46
00:02:51,108 --> 00:02:54,544
So we're going to have the areas where its kind of irritated

47
00:02:54,544 --> 00:02:56,774
some in which there's a polyp sticking out

48
00:02:56,774 --> 00:02:59,328
and we'll look at it under a microscope

49
00:02:59,328 --> 00:03:02,439
and then that's the thing that we're mainly worried about

50
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:06,479
So that's what we're going to cover in the slides

51
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,616
that we look at today.

52
00:03:08,616 --> 00:03:11,170
So this first one we're looking at is an example of

53
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,842
a normal margin

54
00:03:12,842 --> 00:03:14,792
And so it's from a little piece

55
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:16,139
from the edge

56
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:18,832
So they actually call the tissue margin?

57
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:20,040
Yeah, tissue margin

58
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,805
Normal tissue.

59
00:03:21,805 --> 00:03:25,613
So this is the edge of the specimen, and [the surgeons will] say, "Is the margin clear?"

60
00:03:25,613 --> 00:03:29,049
Dr: In this case this is an example where the margin IS clear.

61
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:30,814
This is normal-looking colon.

62
00:03:30,814 --> 00:03:34,808
S: This is a cross-section, crossing the boundary of the colon,

63
00:03:34,808 --> 00:03:43,306
this area at the top right here, would be the inside of the colon, where the poop is...

64
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:51,665
Dr: Doctors say stool. That's the stool in the middle, and the supportive tissue is underneath.

65
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,941
S: Part of the structural tissue of the tube?

66
00:03:53,941 --> 00:03:59,328
Dr: Right. Now let's drive around the slide.

67
00:03:59,328 --> 00:04:04,622
This is a virtual slide where we took the typical glass microscope slide, and put it in a special

68
00:04:04,622 --> 00:04:09,452
machine which took lots and lots of photographs at high power, then stitched them all together

69
00:04:09,452 --> 00:04:13,214
as one massive image. So that allows you to zoom in and look around.

70
00:04:13,214 --> 00:04:16,511
S: To let me get my own bearings, this polyp...

71
00:04:16,511 --> 00:04:20,690
Dr: No, this is just regular tissue--a little bit of a fold, not a polyp.

72
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:25,102
S: So how large is this, about a centimeter?

73
00:04:25,102 --> 00:04:31,464
Dr: About like that. If I had to guess, about 5-6mm.

74
00:04:31,464 --> 00:04:43,167
So, now to drive around, these are the controls for zooming in and out.

75
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:55,288
So I can look at something more closely, and this is the mucosa.

76
00:04:55,288 --> 00:04:57,935
S: Mucosa. Sounds very similar to mucus.

77
00:04:57,935 --> 00:05:03,369
Dr: Right. The mucosa is the lining that makes the mucus, it's the slimy part.

78
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:07,270
S: This white stuff up here?

79
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:16,418
Dr: This suff is the slimy mucus. So, it keeps the insides from drying out--

80
00:05:16,418 --> 00:05:21,666
because it's a very hydrated gel. It also means that things can glide along without

81
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:25,613
abrading the surface. When you look at it, it has architecture in which

82
00:05:25,613 --> 00:05:36,016
these glands, they're like test-tubes sticking down, and the purpose is to increase the surface area.

83
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:42,285
S: And the term gland, is any structure containing fluid and releases the fluid?

84
00:05:42,285 --> 00:05:49,066
Dr: A gland is an epithelial structure, so it's made of cells that are packed tightly,

85
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:54,220
and the cells have a top and a bottom, and they're formed into some sort of enfolding

86
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,285
or structure, so that there is a middle and an outside.

87
00:05:57,285 --> 00:06:04,112
S: When we say something is epithelial, it's the stuff facing the outside world?

88
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:09,824
Dr: Yes. The epithelium is a special class of cells in which they are facing the outside world,

89
00:06:09,824 --> 00:06:13,168
again, tightly packed, and there's a top and a bottom.

90
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:19,437
S: And even though to a layperson this area right here does not seem like the outside world,

91
00:06:19,437 --> 00:06:21,806
it seems like it's inside of you, we're kind of like big donuts.

92
00:06:21,806 --> 00:06:27,239
Dr: That's right. And the colonoscopist proves that it's connected to the outside world.

93
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:29,793
S: MUAHAHA!! I guess they do prove that! XD

94
00:06:29,793 --> 00:06:40,428
Dr: So that's still the outside world. This is the architecture where you have enfoldings to increase

95
00:06:40,428 --> 00:06:42,843
the surface area. And it's creating this mucus.

96
00:06:42,843 --> 00:06:50,831
Let me look at the highest power. Look at these cells! When we look at these cells,

97
00:06:50,831 --> 00:06:56,914
there are two main types of cells. There's this one here, which is the goblet cell.

98
00:06:56,914 --> 00:07:05,691
S: Goblet cell. It's not just this white part, it goes all the way down there?

99
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:13,075
Dr: Yeah...let me have that pen! It has a top like that, and you see this wine glass?

100
00:07:13,075 --> 00:07:20,366
S: It's literally shaped like a goblet! I was circling the wrong handle.

101
00:07:20,366 --> 00:07:23,524
Dr: That nucleus belonged to some other cell.

102
00:07:23,524 --> 00:07:32,627
What's next to it is these thin cells here, which do not have all the mucus inside of them.

103
00:07:32,627 --> 00:07:35,367
These guys are the tall ones.

104
00:07:35,367 --> 00:07:39,685
S: Where you see only the nucleus? The white part is just the mucus inside the cell.

105
00:07:39,685 --> 00:07:52,781
Dr: Yes. Mucus is the term for either the overall structure or the material that is elaborated up here,

106
00:07:52,781 --> 00:07:59,608
chemically it is called mucin, and mucin is almost like that goo runners eat,

107
00:07:59,608 --> 00:08:02,813
it is just a lot of sugar holding a lot of water.

108
00:08:02,813 --> 00:08:08,014
S: I see. I guess it would be bad branding to call it Mucus-In-A-Bag. MUAHAHA!! >:-}

109
00:08:08,014 --> 00:08:13,354
Dr: Exactly! So they stick with "goo". But this one has a lot of sugar, takes in lots of water,

110
00:08:13,354 --> 00:08:16,419
that is released and it forms this surface here.

111
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:19,159
S: To let stuff flow by.

112
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:23,246
Dr: What the other cell does is the other main thing in addition to letting things flow through,

113
00:08:23,246 --> 00:08:29,144
is to absorb water. So the idea is you do not want to release the 2L of fluid you have

114
00:08:29,144 --> 00:08:32,766
around every one of your meals. You want to get a lot of that back.

115
00:08:32,766 --> 00:08:35,042
S: That's one of the main functions of the large intestine?

116
00:08:35,042 --> 00:08:38,618
Dr: It is. It is a consolidation process to the stool. So you're going to absorb a lot of water

117
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:44,423
and doing it through these cells.

118
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:54,686
S: The mucin comes out here, and the water absorbed by parts without mucin, so right there.

119
00:08:54,686 --> 00:09:02,256
Dr: Yupperz. That's right. The two main functions of the colon are right there with those two cells.

120
00:09:02,256 --> 00:09:13,494
S: To get a perspective of where we are, the whole thing is about .5cm, what's our scale here?

121
00:09:13,494 --> 00:09:26,776
Dr: Our favorite scale-bar here is to look for blood vessels, for red blood cells,

122
00:09:26,776 --> 00:09:30,120
One right there, is 7micro- m in diameter.

123
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:36,296
S: 7micro-m. A micrometer is a millionth of a meter, or 1/1000th of 1mm.

124
00:09:36,296 --> 00:09:41,219
Dr: That's right. Let's round off to 1/100th of 1mm.

125
00:09:41,219 --> 00:09:47,024
S: You put 100 of these next to each other you get 1mm. So 1mm would be bigger than our entire screen.

126
00:09:47,024 --> 00:09:54,826
Dr: Right. You see with these glands, 1mm would be this span, which we're saying is about like that,

127
00:09:54,826 --> 00:09:57,240
That's why from here to here it might be about 7mm.

128
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:03,928
Dr: RBCs are found in just about every microscopic field, and they're always 7micro-m.

129
00:10:03,928 --> 00:10:16,513
When looking here, this is very well formed. You can see these tubular glands,

130
00:10:16,513 --> 00:10:20,646
just a hint over here, because they are like test-tubes, sometimes they're not going straight up and

131
00:10:20,646 --> 00:10:22,690
down, sometimes they look a little on an angle...

132
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:28,262
S: They actually are reaching the surface, we just don't see it based on the way it's cut?

133
00:10:28,262 --> 00:10:34,764
So this one right here, it was cut at an angle, so it looks embedded there in 2D,

134
00:10:34,764 --> 00:10:37,318
but in 3D we would see a full tube.

135
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:43,820
Dr: Just to go back to the microscopy, we're seeing this because it's only 4microns thick,

136
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:48,185
and we're sending light through this tissue.

137
00:10:48,185 --> 00:10:53,293
So that's why you can get a cross-section that doesn't show you 3D. Very much 2D.

138
00:10:53,293 --> 00:11:03,928
S: Cool! So this is what a healthy margin tissue would look like?

139
00:11:03,928 --> 00:11:08,340
Dr: Yes, this is a healthy colon, so you would thankfully say on the proximal margin,

140
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:13,727
which is up more towards the mouth, that's clear. You take another section like this from the distal

141
00:11:13,727 --> 00:11:17,999
margin, more towards the end, and you say that's clear, so that means they removed the cancer.

142
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:20,786
S: When you say proximal margin is close to the mouth,

143
00:11:20,786 --> 00:11:27,241
you're saying the mouth of that cut of the tube, not mouth of the person.

144
00:11:27,241 --> 99:59:59,999
Dr: That's right. So the proximal and distal margins are clear, if they look like this.
