1
00:00:01,267 --> 00:00:02,867
Solve for y.

2
00:00:02,867 --> 00:00:07,733
We have three y plus seven is less than two y and

3
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:11,800
four y plus eight is greater than negative forty-eight.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,867
So we have to find all the y's that meet both of these constraints

5
00:00:14,867 --> 00:00:20,133
so let's just solve for y in each of the constraints and just remember that this "and" is here.

6
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:24,933
So we have three y plus seven is less than two y

7
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:27,533
so let's isolate the y's on the left-hand side

8
00:00:27,533 --> 00:00:30,467
so let's get rid of this two y on the right-hand side

9
00:00:30,467 --> 00:00:34,800
and we can do that by subtracting two y from both sides.

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,933
So we're going to subtract two y from both sides,

11
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:40,733
the left-hand sides we have three y minus two y,

12
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:43,533
which is just y, plus seven

13
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:47,133
is less than two y minus two y and there's nothing else there

14
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:49,267
that's just going to be zero.

15
00:00:49,267 --> 00:00:51,213
And then we can get rid of this seven here

16
00:00:51,213 --> 00:00:54,267
by subtracting seven from both sides

17
00:00:54,267 --> 00:00:57,400
so let's subtract seven from both sides,

18
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,200
left-hand side, y plus seven minus seven, those cancel out, we just have a y

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,933
is less than zero minus seven, which is negative seven.

20
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:08,000
so that's one of the constraints. That's this constraint

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,600
right over here.

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,400
Now let's work on this constraint.

23
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:20,000
We have four y, plus eight is greater than negative forty-eight.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,267
So let's get rid of the eight from the left-hand side

25
00:01:22,267 --> 00:01:28,400
so we can subtract eight from both sides, subtract eight from both sides,

26
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,933
the left-hand side we're just left with a four y because

27
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:33,200
these guys cancel out.

28
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,800
Four y is greater than negative forty-eight minus eight

29
00:01:37,800 --> 99:59:59,999
So we're going to go another eight negative,
