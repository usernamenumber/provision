1
00:00:00,037 --> 00:00:09,003
In order to maintain a trade imbalance, we know that the Chienese Central Government needs to keep its currency artificially weak.

2
00:00:09,003 --> 00:00:16,047
and to do that they essentially can print their currency and use that to buy US dollars.

3
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:25,013
so what they do is they increase the supply of Yuan and they increase the demand for dollars

4
00:00:25,013 --> 00:00:27,004
keeping their currency weak

5
00:00:27,004 --> 00:00:29,037
Now the next question you might ask is

6
00:00:29,037 --> 00:00:34,027
what do they do with the actual dollars that they bought with the Yuan

7
00:00:34,027 --> 00:00:38,046
that they printed.Well, they do not want to just sit on those dollars

8
00:00:38,046 --> 00:00:41,086
they don't want to. They prefer to be collecting some type of interest

9
00:00:41,086 --> 00:00:46,089
on that money. So instead of just keeping it all in some warehouse in some place

10
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:51,061
they actually just lend that money to the US Government and they lend

11
00:00:51,061 --> 00:00:58,053
that money by buying US treasury bonds, by buying T-Bills and T-notes

12
00:00:58,053 --> 00:01:02,069
So that money that they use that they bought with their printed

13
00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:07,079
Yuan, that goes to the US Treasury. that goes to the US treasury

14
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:13,090
The US Treasury gives the Chinese Central Bank Treasury bonds

15
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,073
Gives them Treasury bonds

16
00:01:16,073 --> 00:01:19,090
So these are Treasury bonds.

17
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,089
Now what is the effects of this.

18
00:01:22,092 --> 00:01:26,058
Clearly the Bank of China is getting interest on

19
00:01:26,058 --> 00:01:30,058
its money now. Its helping to finance the US Goverment's debt

20
00:01:30,058 --> 00:01:35,050
But may be even more interestingly, it is creating

21
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:43,076
incremental demand for T-bonds. So it is creating demand for T-bonds

22
00:01:43,076 --> 00:01:46,066
for Treasury bonds. Now what does that do?

23
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:49,057
Well if you are increasing the demand for anything thats also

24
00:01:49,057 --> 00:01:54,026
going to increase the price. So the price of

25
00:01:54,026 --> 00:01:58,026
Treasury bonds, of T-bills and T-notes goes up

26
00:01:58,026 --> 00:02:01,088
T-bills are of durations less than one year but notes

27
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,066
are durations more than a year

28
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:06,010
So the price goes up. What happens if the price goes up

29
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,084
that means that the interest

30
00:02:08,084 --> 00:02:13,025
The interest that the government has to pay on this debt

31
00:02:13,025 --> 00:02:18,078
goes down. So that means that the interest goes down.

32
00:02:18,078 --> 00:02:21,096
I will explain that more in depth in other videos

33
00:02:21,096 --> 00:02:25,026
Now the interest goes down, that means the cost of borrowing

34
00:02:25,026 --> 00:02:27,023
for the US government goes down

35
00:02:27,023 --> 00:02:29,093
But thats also the benchmark rate for the cost of debt

36
00:02:29,093 --> 00:02:33,027
in general. so in general it finances US debt

37
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:37,059
Both of the Government and really just credit, more broadly

38
00:02:37,059 --> 00:02:39,076
So debt becomes cheaper

39
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:45,003
Debt cheaper inside of the United States.

40
00:02:45,003 --> 99:59:59,000
