1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
   

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,790
Now I'll give you a slightly
more complicated choice

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,320
between two payment options.

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,100
Both of them are good, because
in either case

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,260
you're getting money.

6
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,510
So choice one.

7
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:17,620
   

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:28,510
Today I will give you $100.

9
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,820
I'll circle the payment when
you get it in magenta.

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,720
So today you get $100.

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,912
Choice two.

12
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:39,990
And I'll try to write this
choice a little bit neater.

13
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:45,410
Choice two is that not in
1 year, but in 2 years.

14
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:46,660
So let's say this is year 1.

15
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,650
   

16
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:55,270
And now this is year 2.

17
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,390
Actually I'm going to give
you three choices.

18
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,425
That'll really hopefully
hit things home.

19
00:01:00,425 --> 00:01:03,930
So actually let me scoot this
choice two over to the left.

20
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,380
   

21
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,000
Back to green.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,500
So now I'm back in business.

23
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:21,530
So choice two, I am willing to
give you, let's say, oh I

24
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,820
don't know, $110 in 2 years.

25
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,650
So not in 1 year.

26
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:30,460
In 2 years I'm going
to give you $110.

27
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,280
And so I'll circle in
magenta when you

28
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,450
actually get your payment.

29
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,570
And then choice 3.

30
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,150
And choice 3 is going
to be fascinating.

31
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,830
   

32
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:46,400
I've done it in a slightly
different shade of green.

33
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:52,430
Choice 3, I am going to pay
you-- I'm making this up

34
00:01:52,430 --> 00:02:01,910
on the fly as I go-- I'm going
to pay you $20 today.

35
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:09,566
I'm going to pay you
$50 in 1 year.

36
00:02:09,566 --> 00:02:11,500
That's $70.

37
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,780
Let me make this
so it's close.

38
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:26,080
And then I'm going to pay you –
I don't know – $35 in year 3.

39
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,580
So all of these are payments.

40
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,740
I want to differentiate between
the actual dollar

41
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,920
payments and the
present values.

42
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,930
And just for the sake of
simplicity, let's assume that

43
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,810
I am guaranteed.

44
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,820
I am the safest person
available.

45
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:45,230
If the world exists, if the sun
does not supernova, I will

46
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,730
be paying you this
amount of money.

47
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:53,180
So I'm as risk-free as the
federal government.

48
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,250
And I had a post on the previous
present value, where

49
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,550
someone talked about,
well is the federal

50
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,060
government really that safe?

51
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,330
And this is the point.

52
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,740
The federal government, when
it borrows from you, say, $100 –

53
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,720
Let's say it borrows $100
and it promises

54
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,730
to pay it in a year.

55
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,690
It'll give you that $100.

56
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,700
The risk is, what is
that $100 worth?

57
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,290
Because they might inflate
the currency to death.

58
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,850
Anyway, I won't go into
that right now.

59
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:22,860
Let's just go back to this
present value problem.

60
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,010
And actually sometimes
governments

61
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:24,930
do default on debt.

62
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,610
But the U.S. government
has never defaulted.

63
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,970
It has inflated its currency.

64
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,880
So that's kind of a roundabout
way of defaulting.

65
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,580
But it has never actually said,
"I will not pay you" –

66
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,720
because if that happened, our
entire financial system would

67
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,970
blow up, and we would all be
living off the land again.

68
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,490
Anyway, back to this problem.

69
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,080
Enough commentary from Sal.

70
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,380
So let's just compare Choice
1 and Choice 2 again.

71
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:51,870
And once, again let's say that –
risk-free – I could put money –

72
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,900
I could lend it to the federal
government at 5%.

73
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,630
And it doesn't matter over what –

74
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:04,090
WRITING: Risk-free rate is 5%.

75
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,990
And for the sake of simplicity--
in the next video

76
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:11,120
I will make that assumption less
simple-- but for the sake

77
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,830
simplicity, the government will
pay you 5% whether you

78
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,750
give them the money for 1 year,
whether you give them

79
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,380
the money for 2 years, or
whether you give them the

80
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,490
money for 3 years, right?

81
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:26,380
So if I had $100, what would
that be worth in 1 year?

82
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,210
We figured that out already.

83
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,400
It's 100 times 1.05.

84
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,550
So that's $105.

85
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,440
And then if you got
another 5%?

86
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,800
So the government is giving
you 5% per year.

87
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,000
It would be 105 times 1.05.

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,310
And what is that?

89
00:04:51,310 --> 00:05:08,230
So I have 105 times 1.05,
which equals $110.25.

90
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,010
So that is the value
in 2 years.

91
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,500
So immediately, without even
doing any present value, we

92
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,540
see that you'll actually be
better off in 2 years if you

93
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,120
were to take the money now
and just lend it to the

94
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,550
government.

95
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,080
Because the government,
risk-free, will give you

96
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:28,150
$110.25 in 2 years, while I'm
only willing to give you $110.

97
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,610
So that's all fair and good.

98
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,860
But the whole topic, what we're
trying to solve, is

99
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,550
present value.

100
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,570
So let's take everything
in today's money.

101
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:39,470
And to take this $110 and say
what is that worth today, we

102
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:43,000
can just discount it backwards
by the same method, right?

103
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,350
So $110 in 2 years, what
is its 1-year value?

104
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:54,280
Well, you take $110 and
you divide it by 1.05.

105
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,710
You're just doing the reverse.

106
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,160
And then you get some
number here.

107
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,450
Well that number you get
is 110 divided by 1.05.

108
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,680
And then to get its present
value, its value today, you

109
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,530
divide that by 1.05 again.

110
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:11,280
So you get 110 divided.

111
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,260
If I were to divide by 1.05
again what do I get?

112
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:19,310
I divide by 1.05, and then
I divide by 1.05 again.

113
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,440
I'm dividing by 1.05 squared.

114
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,040
And what does that equal?

115
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,550
And I'm writing this on purpose,
because I want to get

116
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,690
you used to this notation.

117
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,110
Because this is what all of
our present values and our

118
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:34,020
discounted cash flow, this type
of dividing by 1 plus the

119
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:38,300
discount rate to the power of
however many years out, this

120
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,820
is what all of that's
based on.

121
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,520
And that's all we're doing
though, we're just dividing by

122
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,670
1.05 twice because we're
2 years out.

123
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,930
So let's do that.

124
00:06:47,930 --> 00:07:08,390
110 divided by 1.05 squared
is equal to $99.77.

125
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,830
So once again we have verified,
by taking the

126
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:15,610
present value of $110 in 2
years to today, that its

127
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,330
present value-- if we assume
a 5% discount rate.

128
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:23,530
And this discount rate, this
is where all of the fudge

129
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:24,930
factor occurs in finance.

130
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,600
You can tweak that discount
rate and make a few

131
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,110
assumptions in discount
rate and

132
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,160
pretty much assume anything.

133
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,900
But right now, for
simplification, we're assuming

134
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,770
a risk-free discount rate.

135
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:39,180
But when the present value is
based on that, you get $99.77.

136
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,070
You say, wow, yeah, this really
isn't as good as this.

137
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:48,530
I would rather have $100 today
than $99.77 today.

138
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,960
Now this is interesting.

139
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,490
Choice number three.

140
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,780
How do we look at this?

141
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,020
Well what we do is, we
present value each of

142
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,540
the payments, right?

143
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:01,570
So the present value of $20
today, well that's just $20.

144
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:07,160
What's the present value
of $50 in 1 year?

145
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:12,000
Well the present value of that
is going to be-- so plus $50

146
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,460
divided by 1.05, right-- that's
the present value of

147
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,530
the $50, because it's
1 year out.

148
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,990
And then I want the present
value of the $35.

149
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:25,510
So that's plus $35 divided by
what-- it's 2 years out,

150
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,390
right, so you have to
discount it twice--

151
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:31,230
divided by 1.05 squared.

152
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,780
Just like we did here.

153
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,309
So let's figure out what
that present value is.

154
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:36,590
Notice I'm just adding up the
present values of each of

155
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:39,000
those payments.

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,299
Get out my virtual TI-85.

157
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,740
Let's see, so the present value
of the $20 payment is

158
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,580
$20, plus the present value
of the $50 payment.

159
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:56,920
Well that's just 50 divided by
1.05, plus the present value

160
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,685
of our $35 payment.

161
00:08:58,685 --> 00:09:03,240
35 divided by-- and it's 2 years
out, so we discount by

162
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:12,120
our discount rate twice-- so
it's divided by 1.05 squared.

163
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:25,600
And then that is equal to--
we'll round it-- $99.37.

164
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,770
So now we can make a very
good comparison

165
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:29,760
between the three options.

166
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,270
This might have been
confusing before.

167
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,080
You know, you have this
guy coming up to you.

168
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,380
And this guy is usually in
the form of some type of

169
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,790
retirement plan or insurance
company, where they say, hey,

170
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,440
you pay me this for years a,
b, and c, and I'll pay you

171
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,790
that in years b, c, and d.

172
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,990
And you're like, boy, how do I
compare if that's really a

173
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,840
good value?

174
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,010
Well this is how
you compare it.

175
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,490
You present value all of the
payments and you say well what

176
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,440
is that worth to me today.

177
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,590
And here we did that.

178
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,870
We said well actually choice
number one is the best deal.

179
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,450
And it just depended on how
the mathematics work out.

180
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,130
If I lowered the discount rate,
if this discount rate is

181
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,160
lower, it might have changed
the outcomes.

182
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,430
And maybe I'll actually do that
in the next video, just

183
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,360
to show you how important
the discount rate is.

184
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,400
Anyway I'm out of time,
and I'll see

185
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,650
you in the next video.

186
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,900
