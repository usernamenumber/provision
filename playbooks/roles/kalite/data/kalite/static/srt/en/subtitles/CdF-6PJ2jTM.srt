1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,000
We're on question 95.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,380
A certain sales person's weekly salary is equal to a

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,000
fixed base salary plus a commission that is directly

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,260
proportional to the number of items sold during the week.

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,000
So let me write this. 95.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:26,530
So the salary is equal to some base plus a commission that is

7
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,740
directly proportional to the number of items sold

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,160
during the week. So let's say the number of items sold is x.

9
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,010
x items times the commission per item.

10
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,620
So, I'll call that lowercase c.

11
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,160
And this is the total commission. Fair enough.

12
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,220
If 50 items are sold this week, what will be the sales

13
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,460
person's salary for this week? OK,

14
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,840
so they actually told us that there's 50 items. Fair enough.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,590
What will be the sales person's this week?

16
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:06,040
So statement number 1 tells us, last week 45 items were sold.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,400
So 45 in last week. That alone doesn't tell me much.

18
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,040
Because I don't know how much he made last week. Statement 2.

19
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:26,010
Last week's salary was $405. Well, does this help me still?

20
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:30,600
Last week. Because in order to figure out--we need to figure

21
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,550
out-- right now we need to know how much of his salary in any

22
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,640
given week is base,

23
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,010
and how much commission does he get per unit.

24
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,650
And the only way we can figure that out is if you tell us

25
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:47,830
that last week we know that he sold 45 items. So,

26
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,000
for example, last week he made $405.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,560
If I use both statements, let me see if I can get anywhere.

28
00:01:53,080 --> 00:02:00,040
He made $405 last week, which is equal to his base plus 45

29
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:05,010
units sold times his commission per unit.

30
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:09,010
So that's all this information gives me.

31
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:14,020
Actually if I use both statements, that's all it gives me.

32
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,440
That 405 is equal to b plus 45 times c.

33
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,060
And we need to figure out s is equal to b plus 50c.

34
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,570
What is s equal when you sell 50 units.

35
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,780
And so we have two linear equations.

36
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,240
But we have how many unknowns?

37
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,730
We have one unknown, two unknown, three unknowns. Sorry.

38
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,410
One unknown, two unknown, three unknowns.

39
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,040
b and c was already there.

40
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,220
So we have 3 unknowns, but only two linear equations.

41
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,490
So we don't have enough information to solve it.

42
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,200
So the answer is E.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,570
All of these statements still do not give us enough

44
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,410
information.

45
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:01,000
96. If Juan had a doctor's appointment on a certain day,

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,380
was the appointment on a Wednesday?

47
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,470
So we want to know, was it on a Wednesday?

48
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:12,010
1, exactly 60 hours before the appointment it was Monday.

49
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,720
60 hours before the appointment it was Monday.

50
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:29,370
This is interesting.OK, so how many days? 60 hours is 2 days.

51
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:35,110
2 days is 48 hours. It's exactly 2 and 1/2 days.

52
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:39,100
48 and then another 12. So this is equal to 2 and 1/2 days.

53
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,100
So this is interesting.

54
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:52,620
If we said that 2 days before, it was a Monday,

55
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,000
then his appointment had to have been on a Wednesday, right?

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,460
Because if you pick any hour in Wednesday and you go exactly

57
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:04,520
48 hours ago, it would be that same exact hour on Monday.

58
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,750
So if you said 48 hours ago it was Monday then this would be

59
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,620
enough information. This is 2 and 1/2 days ago.

60
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,940
So for example, if his appointment-- and you know it might

61
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:27,040
sound weird-- but if his appointment was at Thursday 1 a.m.

62
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,730
and you go 2 and 1/2 days before-- let's see if you go 2

63
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,660
days before you to Wednesday 1 a.m., Tuesday 1 a.m., and then

64
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,050
you go 12 hours before. You would end up at Monday at 1 p.m.

65
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,740
So, I've given a case that meets condition 1,

66
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,470
where his appointment wasn't on Wednesday.It was on Thursday.

67
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,370
But of course, I can give a condition where his appointment

68
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:54,010
was on Wednesday. His appointment was on Wednesday at 10 p.m.

69
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:59,080
Then if you go 1 day back you're at Tuesday 10 p.m.

70
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,560
I'm sure you can't read that. Then you go another day.

71
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,860
You're at Monday 10 p.m. And then you go a half a day.

72
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,020
You're at Monday 10 a.m.

73
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,910
So, statement 1 does not give us enough information.

74
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,620
That's because of this pesky half day.

75
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,040
Now let's see what statement 2 gets us.

76
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,610
Statement 2. The appointment was between 1 p.m. and 9 p.m.

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,570
Now, this by itself,obviously,is useless. I mean,

78
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,530
you could have an appointment any day between 1 p.m.and 9 p.m

79
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,460
But used in conjunction with each other, it seems like I

80
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,630
have enough information.

81
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,660
Because let's say the appointment was at 9 p.m.

82
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,020
and 2 and 1/2 days ago it was a Wednesday.

83
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,440
So let me see, sorry, 2 days ago it was a Monday.

84
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,260
So if I have it at Wednesday 9 p.m., if I go back 1 day,

85
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,830
I'm at Tuesday 9 p.m.

86
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,030
Sorry. 1 day back I'm at Tuesday 9 p.m.

87
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:11,010
2 days back I would be at Monday 9 p.m.

88
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:18,060
And then if I go 1/2 a day more, I'm at Monday 9 a.m.

89
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,420
And if I take the lower bound. Wednesday at 1 p.m.

90
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:28,060
Do the same logic and you're going to end up at Monday 1 a.m.

91
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:33,000
So at either end of this range, if I know that if you

92
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,750
go 2 days ago, you end up at Monday, the only day that

93
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,200
works is Wednesday.

94
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,960
You could try this with Thursday or Tuesday.

95
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,680
You won't end up on Monday if you go 2 and 1/2 days back.

96
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,260
So for this problem, both statements are necessary in

97
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:50,080
order to know whether his appointment was on Wednesday.

98
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,760
Next problem. 97.

99
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:05,200
What is the value of 5x squared plus 4x minus 1.

100
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:14,000
First they tell us, x time x plus 2 is equal to 0.

101
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,800
Well let's see,

102
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,000
can we use this alone? Let's just multiply it out.

103
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,020
We get x squared plus 4 x is equal to 0.

104
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,060
And that tells us that x squared is equal to minus 4x.

105
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,010
Well maybe we could substitute this in for 4x,

106
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,440
or for x squared. So we get 5 times x squared.

107
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,020
Well we know that x squared is minus 4x.

108
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:46,910
Minus 4x plus 4x minus 1. That's minus 20x plus 4x minus 1.

109
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:47,950
No it doesn't get us anywhere,

110
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,290
even playing around with the algebra.

111
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,640
So we get minus 16x minus 1.

112
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,400
So statement 1 by itself,at least as far as I can figure out,

113
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,770
does not help us solve this problem. Statement number 2.

114
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,560
x is equal to 0.

115
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,900
Well that's all we need. x is equal to 0, then this is 0.

116
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,010
This is 0. And we're just left with negative 1.

117
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,650
So this is the only piece of information we need to solve

118
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,410
this problem. And statement 1 doesn't really help us much.

119
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:22,060
So only statement 2 is necessary. What is that, B?

120
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,020
Next problem.

121
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,090
98. At Larry's Auto Supply Store,

122
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,450
brand x antifreeze is sold by the gallon.

123
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:44,520
So x by gallon. And brand y is sold by the quart.

124
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:55,440
Excluding sales tax, what is the total cost for 1 gallon of

125
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:07,070
brand x antifreeze-- so 1 of x-- and 1 quart of brand y?

126
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:14,020
OK, so we want to know the cost. Equals how much dollars?

127
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,500
So let x be the number of gallons of x and y be the

128
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,630
number of quarts of y.

129
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:23,000
So we'd have to know their prices in order to figure out

130
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,450
how much the combination costs.

131
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,000
So let's see, at least I think. Statement 1.

132
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,930
Excluding sales tax, the cost for 6 gallons of brand x

133
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:44,040
antifreeze and 10 quarts of y-- so plus 10 of

134
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,050
y-- is equal to $58.

135
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,390
Well this, once again, by itself does not help me much.

136
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,420
I have two unknowns with one linear equation.

137
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,060
So I can't solve for what x plus y is equal to.

138
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,470
If I could have factored out-- if this was 10x plus 10y I

139
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,860
could have factored out a 10, and I would have had x plus y

140
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,470
sitting there.

141
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,760
So actually I probably could have solved, if it was that way.

142
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,500
But this isn't quite as easy. So statement number 2.

143
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:19,450
Excluding sales tax, the total cost for 4 gallons of brand x

144
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:30,130
plus 12 quarts of brand y-- so it's 12 quarts of brand y--

145
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,030
is equal to $44.

146
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,800
And actually,just to be exact,I realize I misspoke something.

147
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:45,070
Let x be the cost of x antifreeze per gallon.

148
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:51,020
And y is equal to the cost of y antifreeze per gallon.

149
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,410
And so we are still trying to figure out x plus y,

150
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,570
but I just wanted to be exact. Because we've got 6 gallons.

151
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,010
So the cost would be 6 times x plus 10 quarts of y.

152
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,660
So this would be 10 times y to get 58. Et cetera, et cetera.

153
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,000
But now we have two equations with two unknowns.

154
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,860
So it's trivial now to solve for x and y.

155
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,470
This is your algebra 1 problem.

156
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:15,000
So, both equations combined are enough to solve for it.

157
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,630
But each independently are not enough.

158
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,410
Because you can't just factor out a number and just be left

159
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,550
with x plus y here.

160
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,360
That could have been a trick, if this was a tricky problem.

161
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,080
But it's not. Anyway, see you in the next video.
