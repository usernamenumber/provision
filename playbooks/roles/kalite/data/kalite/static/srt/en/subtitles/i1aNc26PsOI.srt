1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,650
We are on problem number 12. Problem 12.

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,910
OK,what is the greatest of five consecutive integers if

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,760
the sum of these integers is 185?

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,630
So what is the greatest?

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,300
Let's assume x is the greatest.

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,040
And they're consecutive integers,

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,320
so what's the second greatest?

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,960
Well,that would be x minus 1.

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,280
The third greatest would be x minus 2.

10
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,230
x minus 3. x minus 4,right?

11
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,770
These are five consecutive integers

12
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:29,680
where x is the largest,right?

13
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,180
If x was 150,x minus 4 would be--

14
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:39,840
these numbers would be 150,149,148,147,146 like that,right?

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,030
So these are consecutive integers,x is the largest.

16
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,130
And they're telling us that the sum is 185.

17
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:49,480
So the sum is equal to 185.

18
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,020
So what is this sum? How do sum these up?

19
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,390
So we have five x's,right? So get 5x.

20
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:59,210
And then what's minus 1,minus 2,minus 3,minus 4?

21
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,280
So 1 plus 2 is 3,3 plus 3 is--

22
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,200
this is where I always mess up--

23
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,240
3 plus 3 6,6 plus 4 is 10,right?

24
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,720
So you get 5x minus 10 is equal to 185.

25
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,270
Add 10 to both sides. 5x is equal to 195.

26
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,310
And you could eyeball this,you could say well,

27
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:25,130
how many times does 5 go into 200,

28
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,200
and it's going to be 1 less than that,right?

29
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,770
Five goes into 200,what,if it goes into it 40 times,

30
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,880
it'll be 39 or you can divide.

31
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,290
If you didn't want to do it that way,

32
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:43,250
you could say 5 goes into 195,3 times 5 is 15. 45,39.

33
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,260
So that's our answer,x is 39.

34
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,890
It's the largest of the consecutive numbers.

35
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:53,080
So those numbers are 39,38,37,36,35.

36
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,740
Those are our five consecutive numbers.

37
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:02,660
Next problem. Problem 13.

38
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:12,730
A salesman's monthly gross pay consists of $1,200 plus 20

39
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,400
percent of the dollar amount of the sales.

40
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,230
So plus 20 percent of the sales,s I'll say is for sales.

41
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:24,740
If his gross pay for one month was $2,500,

42
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:31,780
what was the dollar amount of the sales for that month?

43
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,530
Well when I read it,I essentially set up this equation,right?

44
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,400
His compensation is $1,200 plus 20 percent of the sales.

45
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,020
And we know that that equals $2,500 in this month.

46
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,920
So let's subtract $1,200 from both sides.

47
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:51,740
So you get 0.2s is equal to $1,300,right?

48
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:57,030
And so s is equal to $1,300 divided by 0.2.

49
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,740
And the way I like to think about this,0.2,instead of

50
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,730
having to do this decimal,

51
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,290
which you could do,is I could have rewritten this.

52
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,760
20 percent is the same thing as 1/5,right?

53
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,590
So it's also 1/5 s is equal to $1,300.

54
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,870
And now this is easy.

55
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,460
Multiply both sides by 5,

56
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:19,490
you get s is equal to $1,300 times 5,which equals what?

57
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:24,340
Thirteen times 5 is 65,and add the two 0's.

58
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,820
So s is equal to $6,500.

59
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,580
So that's the monthly sales that month.

60
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,860
I was a little redundant with the word "monthly" just now.

61
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:43,060
Next problem. Problem 14. OK,so they've drawn a circle.

62
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:59,460
And then,let's see,they've told us that this is,let's see.

63
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,980
They tell us that this is 40 degrees.

64
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:14,100
Let's see,Naomi makes silver jewelry.

65
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,180
For one style of earring,

66
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,980
she cuts wedges from a silver disk,

67
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,560
which I guess is depicted here,as shown in the figure above.

68
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,970
Each wedge makes a 40-degree angle at the center of the disk.

69
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,160
If the weight of each uncut disk is

70
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,720
a uniformly distributed 2.5 grams--

71
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,450
that's how much this whole silver disk--

72
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,120
I should've done it in grey instead of magenta

73
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,140
because it's silver,but anyway--

74
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,590
how many grams does each wedge weigh?

75
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:46,270
So we essentially just have to figure out what fraction of

76
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,500
the entire circle is each wedge?

77
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,960
Well,each wedge is 40 degrees.

78
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,670
How many degrees are in the entire circle?

79
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,070
Hopefully it's second nature to you right now,

80
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,400
but there's 360 degrees in an entire circle,right?

81
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,780
So the wedge is what fraction of the entire circle?

82
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:13,790
Each wedge is 40 over 360 of the entire circle.

83
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,430
And that's what? That's equal to 1/9.

84
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,650
Divide the top and the bottom by 40,right?

85
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,970
Four goes into 36,right,9 times.

86
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,330
So each wedge is 1/9 of the entire circle,

87
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,500
and I just did that based on the fact

88
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,140
that it's 40 degrees over 360 degrees.

89
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:33,120
So if each wedge is 1/9 of the entire silver piece and

90
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,420
the silver piece weights 2.5 grams,

91
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:43,460
then each wedge will weigh 1/9 times 2.5 grams,right?

92
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:50,950
And if we want to write 2.5 as a fraction,how do we do that?

93
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,090
That might be convenient right now.

94
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,350
Well,I'll tell you,that's the same thing.

95
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,810
And you could multiply it out,and that's all fine,but you

96
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,760
could also recognize that 2.5 can also be written as 9/4.

97
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:08,970
Oh no,no it can't,sorry. 2.5 can be written as 5/4.

98
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:19,120
No. I'm pathetic. 2.5 can be written as 10/4,right?

99
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,890
Because four goes into 10 two times.

100
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,300
Why am I even writing 10/4?

101
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,970
See,my brain is malfunctioning.

102
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:29,120
2.5 can be written as 5/2,which is 10/4.

103
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,240
I was somehow thinking of the number 9,

104
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,180
and I'm not going to make excuses for my deficits. Anyway.

105
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,330
So what's 1/9 times 5/2? It's 5/18.

106
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:44,280
So each wedge is going to weight 5/18 of a gram.

107
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,130
The other option is you could have divided 2.5 by 9

108
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:51,480
and you would have gotten another answer with decimals.

109
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,860
Either one would have worked

110
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,500
because these are free answer questions. Next problem.

111
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,230
Can you actually use a calculator on the SAT these days?

112
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:05,360
If you can,that would've been an option as well. Problem 15.

113
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,260
If x squared minus y squared is equal to 10

114
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:17,250
and x plus y is equal to 5,what is x minus y?

115
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,720
Before I even read the rest of the question,when I saw this,

116
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,510
it should be like your knee-jerk reaction

117
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,260
when you take the SAT.

118
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,130
When you see x squared minus y squared equals 10,

119
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,740
well that's the same thing as x plus y times x minus

120
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,340
y is equal to 10.

121
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,580
You just factor this difference of squares immediately.

122
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,390
You almost can do that

123
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,720
before you read the rest of the question.

124
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,540
And they tell us what's x plus y? x plus y is 5.

125
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,720
So 5 times x minus y is equal to 10.

126
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:48,610
Divide both sides by 5,you get x minus y is equal to 2.

127
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,800
That's it. Next problem.

128
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,330
So they draw us--let me color.

129
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:05,600
So they draw us a rectangle.

130
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,810
And then within that rectangle there is another rectangle.

131
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,430
It looks like this. Another square,really.

132
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,380
And what I've drawn doesn't look that much like a square,

133
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:20,690
but it's close enough,I think. You get the idea.

134
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,830
And this is,I see,a right angle,right angle,

135
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,230
right angle,right angle.

136
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:31,440
They tell us that this distance is 2,this distance is 3.

137
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,450
In the figure above,what is the area of the shaded square?

138
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,860
So this is a bit of a trick.

139
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,630
And actually,let me do it in the next video

140
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,550
so I can kind of delve deeper into the trick.

141
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,200
I'll see you in the next video.
