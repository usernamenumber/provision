1
00:00:02,074 --> 00:00:06,623
I figure now is as good a time
as any to learn about probably

2
00:00:06,623 --> 00:00:08,161
what most people focus the
most on when they analyze

3
00:00:08,161 --> 00:00:10,189
companies, and that's the
income statement.

4
00:00:10,189 --> 00:00:13,803
And the income statement is
one of the three financial

5
00:00:13,803 --> 00:00:15,978
statements that you'll look at
when you look at a company.

6
00:00:15,978 --> 00:00:17,369
There's the income statement
and the other two are the

7
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:22,539
balance sheet, which I have
drawn a lot in a lot of the

8
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:24,411
other explanations I've done
on the financial crisis and

9
00:00:24,411 --> 00:00:25,208
whatever else.

10
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:27,220
And actually, in this video,
we're going to see how the

11
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,893
income statement relates
to the balance sheet.

12
00:00:28,893 --> 00:00:30,640
And, of course, the last one--
well, it's not of course if

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,353
you don't know it-- is the
cash flow statement.

14
00:00:36,444 --> 00:00:36,944
And we'll focus on that a
little bit later because

15
00:00:36,944 --> 00:00:41,271
that's a little bit more
nuanced relative

16
00:00:41,271 --> 00:00:42,419
to the income statement.

17
00:00:42,419 --> 00:00:44,724
So the income statement is
literally just saying how much

18
00:00:44,724 --> 00:00:46,561
a company might earn in a given
period, and it's always

19
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:48,235
related to a period.

20
00:00:48,235 --> 00:00:51,208
So it could be an annual
income statement.

21
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,640
It could be for the year 2008.

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,955
It could be a quarterly
income statement.

23
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:57,222
Those are usually the two
types that you see, but

24
00:00:57,222 --> 00:00:58,103
sometimes, there's monthly or
six-month income statements.

25
00:00:58,103 --> 00:00:59,239
And the general format is pretty
consistent, although

26
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:00,544
there is a lot of variation
depending on what a business

27
00:01:00,544 --> 00:01:09,674
does, but in this video, I
really just want to cover

28
00:01:09,674 --> 00:01:13,222
almost a plain vanilla income
statement for a company that

29
00:01:13,222 --> 00:01:15,076
just sells a widget.

30
00:01:15,076 --> 00:01:16,535
So the first thing when you sell
a widget is you make it

31
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:19,929
and you just sell it.

32
00:01:19,929 --> 00:01:20,429
You sell the widget.

33
00:01:20,429 --> 00:01:21,959
You give a customer a widget,
and they give you some money.

34
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:28,411
And that money that they give
you-- and I'm not going to get

35
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:28,911
too technical about the
accounting right now-- is

36
00:01:28,911 --> 00:01:30,789
considered revenue.

37
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:38,977
It's sometimes considered
sales.

38
00:01:38,977 --> 00:01:42,396
And that's literally the money
that they give you at a

39
00:01:42,396 --> 00:01:44,193
certain period of time.

40
00:01:44,193 --> 00:01:46,258
And some of you accountants out
there are like, oh, well,

41
00:01:46,258 --> 00:01:47,937
no, that's not just the money
that they give you.

42
00:01:47,937 --> 00:01:49,192
It's the money that you've
earned in a certain period of

43
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,678
time, and that's true.

44
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:52,655
But for our sake, let's just
say that when you give the

45
00:01:52,655 --> 00:01:55,272
widget, you have earned the
money that they give you, and

46
00:01:55,272 --> 00:01:57,262
that's revenue sales.

47
00:01:57,262 --> 00:01:57,762
Later on, we'll talk about
different ways to account

48
00:01:57,762 --> 00:02:00,364
revenue and sales.

49
00:02:00,364 --> 00:02:01,511
So let's say the revenue or the
sales in this case in a

50
00:02:01,511 --> 00:02:02,663
given period, let's say
that this is an income

51
00:02:02,663 --> 00:02:05,689
statement for 2008.

52
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:08,311
So over 2008, we sold
let's say $3

53
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:12,749
million worth of widgets.

54
00:02:17,147 --> 00:02:20,001
So let's say it's $3 million.

55
00:02:24,926 --> 00:02:27,147
So a lot of times when you look
at income statements for

56
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,339
companies, if you go to Yahoo!

57
00:02:30,247 --> 00:02:31,599
Finance, you could do this right
now, instead of writing

58
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,956
$3 million, you'll
see $3,000 there.

59
00:02:32,956 --> 00:02:34,413
It's like, oh, my God!

60
00:02:34,413 --> 00:02:35,814
This company, they're hardly
selling anything.

61
00:02:35,814 --> 00:02:39,428
But it's kind of a standard that
they tend to write things

62
00:02:39,428 --> 00:02:40,556
in thousands.

63
00:02:40,556 --> 00:02:41,998
So 3,000 would be
3,000 thousands,

64
00:02:41,998 --> 00:02:44,411
which would be 3 million.

65
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:47,112
And for really big companies,
they actually sometimes write

66
00:02:47,112 --> 00:02:48,573
their numbers in millions.

67
00:02:48,573 --> 00:02:50,827
So if you saw 3,000 there, it
would actually mean 3 billion.

68
00:02:50,827 --> 00:02:53,161
But we'll actually look at real
income statements in the

69
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:54,693
not-too-far-off future.

70
00:02:54,693 --> 00:02:57,689
So that's how much money
they give us.

71
00:02:57,689 --> 00:02:59,995
But that's not how much income
we made, because there was a

72
00:02:59,995 --> 00:03:03,188
lot of cost that went into
making that widget that we

73
00:03:03,188 --> 00:03:04,794
have to account for.

74
00:03:04,794 --> 00:03:06,031
It's not like when someone gives
me $3 million, I can

75
00:03:06,031 --> 00:03:07,263
just say, oh, I made
$3 million.

76
00:03:07,263 --> 00:03:09,408
Let me just put it
all in the bank.

77
00:03:09,408 --> 00:03:11,176
I'm done.

78
00:03:11,176 --> 00:03:12,779
That was all income.

79
00:03:12,779 --> 00:03:15,210
So the first thing that you
tend to see on an income

80
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,313
statement is the cost of those
actual widgets, the cost of

81
00:03:17,313 --> 00:03:19,224
producing those widgets.

82
00:03:19,224 --> 00:03:21,089
And I'll put all my expenses
in magenta.

83
00:03:21,089 --> 00:03:27,258
So it'll sometimes be written
as cost of sales or cost of

84
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,304
goods sold.

85
00:03:29,013 --> 00:03:36,689
And this is literally-- well,
there's two things.

86
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:41,426
There's a variable cost which
is, each widget, they might

87
00:03:41,426 --> 00:03:45,454
have used some amount of metal
and some amount of energy to

88
00:03:45,454 --> 00:03:47,992
produce it and some
amount of paint if

89
00:03:47,992 --> 00:03:49,626
it's a painted widget.

90
00:03:49,626 --> 00:03:51,492
And so that the cost of goods
is literally how much did it

91
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:53,012
cost to buy the metal and the
paint and provide the

92
00:03:53,012 --> 00:03:58,280
electricity to make those $3
million worth of widgets.

93
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,812
That's the variable cost. And
then on top of that you have

94
00:04:00,812 --> 00:04:02,946
the fixed costs, or the
relatively fixed costs, where

95
00:04:02,946 --> 00:04:07,024
just to have the factory open,
it costs a certain amount of

96
00:04:07,024 --> 00:04:09,681
money every year, regardless of
how many widgets you make.

97
00:04:09,681 --> 00:04:11,962
And we'll go into more detail
on that, But for simplicity,

98
00:04:11,962 --> 00:04:14,615
let's say all those costs
of making the

99
00:04:14,615 --> 00:04:17,231
widgets were $1 million.

100
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:19,830
So sometimes someone might say
it's a $1 million cost. When I

101
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:22,273
make models, I like to put
a minus there, so that I

102
00:04:22,273 --> 00:04:24,489
remember that that's a cost.
Anything that detracts from

103
00:04:24,489 --> 00:04:30,006
income I put as a minus.

104
00:04:30,006 --> 00:04:32,476
Anything that adds is a plus,
although that's not

105
00:04:32,476 --> 00:04:34,239
necessarily the standard
convention.

106
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:36,777
Some people say, oh, it's a
positive $1 million cost,

107
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,380
which means you subtract.

108
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,011
But either way I think
you get the point.

109
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:44,176
And then if you subtract your
costs from your revenue, or if

110
00:04:44,176 --> 00:04:48,448
you just add these two numbers,
because this one is

111
00:04:48,448 --> 00:04:52,981
negative, you have your
gross profit.

112
00:04:58,497 --> 00:05:01,794
And in this case, it would
be $2 million.

113
00:05:05,682 --> 00:05:09,990
And this number tells you, how
much money did you make, or

114
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,859
how much profit did
you make just from

115
00:05:12,859 --> 00:05:14,494
selling these widgets?

116
00:05:14,494 --> 00:05:22,417
So the more widgets you sell,
in most circumstances, the

117
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:24,582
larger this number
is going to be.

118
00:05:24,582 --> 00:05:29,952
So this is your profit before
all of the other expenses that

119
00:05:29,952 --> 00:05:30,664
a company has to incur,
like the taxes

120
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,112
and the CEO's salary.

121
00:05:32,112 --> 00:05:33,886
The CEO's salary doesn't
go in here, right?

122
00:05:33,886 --> 00:05:36,315
Because the CEO doesn't go out
there to the factory in most

123
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:41,285
cases and actually help
make the widget.

124
00:05:41,285 --> 00:05:43,263
So the CEO's salary or the
CFO's salary or the

125
00:05:43,263 --> 00:05:45,602
headquarters in a nice
skyscraper, that doesn't get

126
00:05:45,602 --> 00:05:48,100
factored in here.

127
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,299
Or the marketing
expense, right?

128
00:05:49,299 --> 00:05:50,667
You have to tell people, hey,
we make good widgets.

129
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:52,493
So none of that is
factored in here.

130
00:05:52,493 --> 00:05:54,529
So that goes into
the next line.

131
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:56,551
And oftentimes, you'll see it
broken up, where they'll have

132
00:05:56,551 --> 00:06:01,363
marketing expense.

133
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:06,477
Sometimes you have to pay
salespeople, so you might have

134
00:06:06,477 --> 00:06:08,883
sales expense, and then the
stuff like the corporate

135
00:06:08,883 --> 00:06:15,243
office and the CEO's salary, and
you have to hire auditors

136
00:06:15,243 --> 00:06:17,103
and accountants and
all of that.

137
00:06:17,103 --> 00:06:18,899
That might be included
as general.

138
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:21,398
Actually, I should be doing this
in magenta because it's

139
00:06:21,398 --> 00:06:23,045
all expenses.

140
00:06:23,045 --> 00:06:25,281
Marketing, sales, and then
G&A you'll sometimes see.

141
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:27,502
Sometimes you'll see SG&A.

142
00:06:27,502 --> 00:06:30,046
G&A just stands for general and
administrative expenses.

143
00:06:30,046 --> 00:06:32,386
If you see SG&A-- sometimes
instead of that you'll see

144
00:06:32,386 --> 00:06:37,632
SG&A-- that mean selling,
general and

145
00:06:37,632 --> 00:06:39,135
administrative expenses.

146
00:06:39,135 --> 00:06:42,169
Selling is things like, it could
be the commissions that

147
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:43,497
the salespeople get.

148
00:06:43,497 --> 00:06:45,068
It could be just the cost of
having salespeople travel

149
00:06:45,068 --> 00:06:47,352
around the country and taking
people out to steak dinners.

150
00:06:47,352 --> 00:06:49,580
And then the general and
administrative, that's just

151
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,265
all the stuff that the corporate
office does, and all

152
00:06:53,265 --> 00:06:55,182
the people who are
at that level.

153
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:57,781
So if you subtract these, and
I'm just making up these

154
00:06:57,781 --> 00:06:59,052
numbers as I go.

155
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:05,496
Say, in marketing, the company
is spending $500,000.

156
00:07:05,496 --> 00:07:08,227
And I'm putting it as a minus
because I like to remember

157
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:09,165
it's an expense.

158
00:07:09,165 --> 00:07:10,295
Some models you'll
see, they'll say

159
00:07:10,295 --> 00:07:12,398
it's $500,000 expense.

160
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:16,127
Sales, let's say, this
is just G&A here.

161
00:07:16,127 --> 00:07:17,630
I want to make a separate
line for sales.

162
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,789
So let's say sales, selling
expenses is $200,000.

163
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:26,703
And let's say G&A, the corporate
offices and all of

164
00:07:26,703 --> 00:07:31,383
that, let's see that's
another $300,000.

165
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:37,579
And now we're ready to figure
out how much money did the

166
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:39,799
operations of this
business make?

167
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:43,546
So this is operating profit.

168
00:07:46,084 --> 00:07:48,436
This is really important to pay
attention to, because so

169
00:07:48,436 --> 00:07:50,017
many people say, oh, a company
made this much.

170
00:07:50,017 --> 00:07:51,911
And you'll hear these numbers,
gross and operating profit and

171
00:07:51,911 --> 00:07:54,149
net profit and pretax profit,
and it's very hard to

172
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:58,079
understand that these are
actually very, very different

173
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,966
things, because they all have
the word "profit," and what

174
00:07:59,966 --> 00:08:02,567
does gross and operating
and all that mean?

175
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:04,494
But here you see it means very,
very different things.

176
00:08:04,494 --> 00:08:06,036
Let's calculate this number
first before I go off on one

177
00:08:06,036 --> 00:08:08,116
of my tangents on all the
differences between the

178
00:08:08,116 --> 00:08:09,647
operating and the
gross profit.

179
00:08:09,647 --> 00:08:11,049
But let's see, 2 million
minus 1 million.

180
00:08:11,049 --> 00:08:16,178
My head I think implicitly
made the

181
00:08:16,178 --> 00:08:17,819
numbers work out nicely.

182
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:21,919
So my operating profit
here is $1 million.

183
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,114
So already we have some
new nuance on profit.

184
00:08:26,114 --> 00:08:30,468
I made $2 million just from
actual widget sales, but then

185
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,179
when you take out all of the
overhead of the company, the

186
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,772
marketing, the sales, the
general and administrative

187
00:08:35,772 --> 00:08:37,914
expenses, I'm only left
with $1 million.

188
00:08:37,914 --> 00:08:41,498
And this is the profit from the
operations of the company,

189
00:08:41,498 --> 00:08:45,002
or you could say from the assets
or from the business or

190
00:08:45,002 --> 00:08:46,812
from the enterprise
of the company.

191
00:08:46,812 --> 00:08:48,112
That's what it is generating.

192
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:50,467
But we can see-- I've drawn a
bunch of balance sheets before

193
00:08:50,467 --> 00:08:50,967
and I think this is a good time
to draw a balance sheet.

194
00:08:50,967 --> 00:08:56,285
So you have kind of the
assets of a company.

195
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:59,179
And we'll talk a little bit
more about assets and

196
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:02,113
enterprise value, and there's
a little bit of a nuance

197
00:09:02,113 --> 00:09:06,181
there, but essentially
the company itself.

198
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:08,549
Before you think about how the
company is paid for or how

199
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,870
it's funded, if you just think
about the enterprise itself,

200
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,529
the assets.

201
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:15,344
The assets are generating
this.

202
00:09:15,344 --> 00:09:19,932
They're generating the operating
profit, and that's a

203
00:09:19,932 --> 00:09:21,983
very important thing to realize
in the future when we

204
00:09:21,983 --> 00:09:23,962
talk about return on assets.

205
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:25,964
Actually, we could talk
about it now.

206
00:09:25,964 --> 00:09:28,517
Let's say our assets, if we
paid $10 million for these

207
00:09:28,517 --> 00:09:34,464
assets, and these assets-- this
is the income statement

208
00:09:34,464 --> 00:09:38,064
for 2008-- are spitting out $1
million a year, or at least $1

209
00:09:38,064 --> 00:09:41,427
million in this year, our return
on asset-- I wasn't

210
00:09:41,427 --> 00:09:43,079
planning on introducing this,
but it doesn't hurt to

211
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:45,881
introduce it right now-- our
return on asset, often

212
00:09:45,881 --> 00:09:53,681
acronymed ROA, would be-- well,
the numerator is the

213
00:09:53,681 --> 00:10:00,380
return, which is $1 million.

214
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,899
The denominator is the
assets, $10 million.

215
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:03,879
So we got a 10% return
on our assets.

216
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:06,710
For a $10 million investment,
we're getting

217
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,965
$1 million a year.

218
00:10:07,965 --> 00:10:12,012
We're getting 10% of our asset
investment back every year.

219
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:14,216
So that's a nice thing to keep
in the back of your mind, this

220
00:10:14,216 --> 00:10:16,046
return on asset concept, and
it's very closely tied to

221
00:10:16,046 --> 00:10:18,811
operating profits and the
actual assets of a firm.

222
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:24,577
What we've learned, and
especially if you watched some

223
00:10:24,577 --> 00:10:26,668
of my other economics videos,
that all companies aren't

224
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,313
financed the same.

225
00:10:29,313 --> 00:10:30,568
A lot of them might
have some debt.

226
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:32,694
So let's say that company had
$10 million of assets, but

227
00:10:32,694 --> 00:10:36,033
let's say they paid for it
with $5 million of debt.

228
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:41,681
And let's say the interest rate
on that debt is-- let me

229
00:10:41,681 --> 00:10:51,865
think of a good number-- 5%.

230
00:10:52,365 --> 00:10:54,233
Let's make it easier.

231
00:10:54,233 --> 00:11:01,614
Let's make it 10% interest.

232
00:11:01,614 --> 00:11:04,032
So this is the operating
profit.

233
00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:05,527
This is the money that just
comes out of the asset itself.

234
00:11:05,527 --> 00:11:07,177
But, of course, that's not the
money that we get to take

235
00:11:07,177 --> 00:11:08,996
home, because we have to pay
this interest. So let's throw

236
00:11:08,996 --> 00:11:10,900
that in there as an expense.

237
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,759
Interest expense.

238
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,977
And obviously, a company that
has no debt will have no

239
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,193
interest expense, but
in this case, we do.

240
00:11:20,193 --> 00:11:21,866
And this is an annual
income statement.

241
00:11:21,866 --> 00:11:24,567
So let's see, if we have $5
million of debt, and we're

242
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:30,012
paying 10% on that, 10% of $5
million is $500,000 a year in

243
00:11:30,012 --> 00:11:35,036
interest. So we have to
essentially take half of our

244
00:11:35,036 --> 00:11:38,563
operating profit and give
it back to the bank.

245
00:11:38,563 --> 00:11:43,315
And now we are left with our--
we're getting close to where

246
00:11:43,315 --> 00:11:49,296
we need to get to--
pre-tax income.

247
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:55,315
And if we do the subtraction,
we're at $500,000.

248
00:11:55,315 --> 00:12:00,364
And you could guess what the
next line is going to be,

249
00:12:00,364 --> 00:12:01,980
given that this says pre-tax.

250
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,302
This is what the owners of the
company get before they pay

251
00:12:04,302 --> 00:12:05,919
the government.

252
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:07,915
So you can guess what
the next line is.

253
00:12:07,915 --> 00:12:09,101
It's going to be taxes.

254
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:16,279
Let's say that it's a 30%
corporate tax rate, and you're

255
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:17,783
going to take 30% of this
number right here.

256
00:12:17,783 --> 00:12:19,530
30% of that number
right there.

257
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,745
So 30% of $500,000
is $150,000.

258
00:12:20,745 --> 00:12:27,647
And then we are done.

259
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:34,914
We finally have paid off
everybody we need to pay off.

260
00:12:34,914 --> 00:12:37,311
So we started off with
$3 million up here.

261
00:12:37,311 --> 00:12:39,334
We kept paying a bunch of
expenses, and then now we're

262
00:12:39,334 --> 00:12:42,111
left with what?

263
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,446
This is $350,000
of net income.

264
00:12:47,712 --> 00:12:56,201
And this is what goes to the
owners of the company.

265
00:12:56,201 --> 00:13:00,060
This net income right here.

266
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,848
So going back to our balance
sheet, we had a $10 million

267
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,063
asset, we had $5 million
of debt.

268
00:13:04,063 --> 00:13:07,166
We know what's left over
is the equity.

269
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:11,694
So let me do that in
a vibrant color.

270
00:13:11,694 --> 00:13:13,310
Equity is what's left over.

271
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,819
So let's say this is
all book value.

272
00:13:14,819 --> 00:13:16,431
So we have $5 million
of equity.

273
00:13:16,431 --> 00:13:18,720
And when I say book value,
that's just a fancy way of

274
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,500
saying this is what our
accountants say that we paid

275
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,694
for the stuff.

276
00:13:24,694 --> 00:13:25,251
This is what we have
on our books.

277
00:13:25,251 --> 00:13:26,049
And we'll talk later about
depreciation and amortization

278
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:30,899
and how we might change what
these values are, but a very

279
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:33,284
simple way is, if you went out
and bought $10 million worth

280
00:13:33,284 --> 00:13:34,901
of stuff, you'd write on
your books, I have

281
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:36,378
a $10 million asset.

282
00:13:36,378 --> 00:13:38,225
And if you took a $5 million
loan, then what you really

283
00:13:38,225 --> 00:13:42,978
own, if you were to kind of sell
all of this, you would

284
00:13:42,978 --> 00:13:44,395
get $5 million of equity.

285
00:13:44,395 --> 00:13:49,812
And I think this is an
interesting thing.

286
00:13:49,812 --> 00:13:51,298
When we did return on asset,
we looked at the operating

287
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:52,801
profit, because this is what our
company generated before

288
00:13:52,801 --> 00:13:57,882
we paid the bank or Uncle Sam
or anything like that.

289
00:13:57,882 --> 00:14:04,383
And so we took this number as
the numerator and we divided

290
00:14:04,383 --> 00:14:05,367
by the number of assets.

291
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:07,617
Now we can do another notion,
and that's return on equity.

292
00:14:08,117 --> 00:14:15,850
In return on equity, the
numerator is the net income

293
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:20,378
that we got, so it's $350,000.

294
00:14:20,378 --> 00:14:22,945
And the denominator here is the
equity, the book value of

295
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,545
our equity, so that's
$5 million.

296
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:28,498
One, two, three.

297
00:14:28,498 --> 00:14:29,399
One, two, three.

298
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:32,885
Let's cancel some zeroes out.

299
00:14:32,885 --> 00:14:33,819
So it's like 35/500.

300
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:38,182
35/500 is the same thing
is 7/100, so it equals

301
00:14:38,182 --> 00:14:40,595
7% return on equity.

302
00:14:40,595 --> 00:14:44,729
And that's interesting because,
well, why that's

303
00:14:44,729 --> 00:14:49,249
lower is-- well, I don't want
to go into too much depth

304
00:14:49,249 --> 00:14:51,030
because I realize I'm already
pushing my time limit.

305
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:54,077
But at this point, you should
have a good understanding of

306
00:14:54,077 --> 00:14:55,982
at least a basic income
statement of a company that

307
00:14:55,982 --> 00:14:58,886
sells widgets.

308
00:14:58,886 --> 00:15:00,802
And in the future, we're gonna
look at a lot of different

309
00:15:00,802 --> 00:15:02,120
companies, financial companies,
insurance

310
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,719
companies, natural gas pipeline
companies, that will

311
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:05,901
have very different-looking
income statements, but this

312
00:15:05,901 --> 00:15:10,082
gives you the general template
for how things work.

313
00:15:10,082 --> 00:15:13,888
And at least it'll give you a
sense of how revenues, gross

314
00:15:13,888 --> 00:15:16,843
profit, operating profit,
pre-tax income and net income

315
00:15:16,843 --> 00:15:18,764
really are different.

316
00:15:18,764 --> 00:15:20,580
A lot of times in the
popular press.

317
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,429
They're all jumbled up as just
kind of the company is making

318
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:24,411
this much money.

319
00:15:24,411 --> 00:15:25,870
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
