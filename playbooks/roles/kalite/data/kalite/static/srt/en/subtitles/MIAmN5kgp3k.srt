1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,630
   

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,815
Let's say I have three position
vectors here in R2.

3
00:00:03,815 --> 00:00:06,180
Let me scroll this over
a little bit.

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,900
Let's say my first position
vector is x0 and it is equal

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:17,140
to minus 2, minus 2.

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,400
So if I were to graph x0 I would
go minus 2, minus 2.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,430
x0 looks like that.

8
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:29,420
My next position vector I have
is x1 and I'll say that's

9
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,002
equal to minus 2, 2.

10
00:00:33,002 --> 00:00:36,130
If I were to graph
here, minus 2, 2.

11
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,740
That's my next position
vector right there.

12
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,180
And this is x1.

13
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,860
And when I say it's a position
vector, they specify a

14
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,510
specific coordinate in R2.

15
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,370
Let me draw a third one
just for fun, x2.

16
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:58,400
Let's say that that is
equal to 2, minus 2.

17
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,600
So if I were to draw this, 2
minus 2, it goes right here.

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,860
So that vector right
there is x2.

19
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,070
Now, what I'm curious
about or, I

20
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,560
guess, not curious about.

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,570
What I want to do here is define
the line segments that

22
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:14,900
connect these points.

23
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,820
So let's say I have my
first line segment.

24
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,350
Let me call it L1, or
let me call it L0.

25
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,860
And I want it to be the
line segment that

26
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,350
connects x0 to x1.

27
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,560
How can I construct that?

28
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,650
So I want to construct this line
segment right here, this

29
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,240
little-- let me do it in a
different color actually.

30
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,390
Let me do it in orange, L0.

31
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,540
So what I want to do is I want
to find the set of all of

32
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,370
these values right here, all of
the position vectors that

33
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,490
define points on this
line right there.

34
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,890
Well we could define it as,
we could start off at x0.

35
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:55,310
We could say that orange line is
x0 plus scaled versions of

36
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,580
the difference of x1 and x0.

37
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,740
If you take x1 minus x0, you get
this vector right there.

38
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:04,530
That's x1 minus x0.

39
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,470
That orange vector.

40
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,080
I know I wrote it right there
so it's hard to read.

41
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,940
But if you just take x1 minus x0
you get that and that make

42
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,990
sense. x0 plus this orange
vector is equal

43
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,270
to that blue factor.

44
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,130
So if you just take different
scaled up versions of this

45
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,640
guy, you're going to
end up at different

46
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,810
points in this direction.

47
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,020
We're starting at x0, maybe
I should do that in green.

48
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,340
We're starting at x0 and then
we're going to add up scaled

49
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,540
up versions of this orange
vector, which is just the

50
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,550
difference of x1 and x0.

51
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,255
Let me write that.

52
00:02:32,255 --> 00:02:39,230
So scaled up versions
of x1 minus x0.

53
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,850
Now, we have to constrict.

54
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,220
If we just want to be in this
line segment, we have to

55
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,200
constrict Rt.

56
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,300
If we said t was a member of
real numbers, if it was any

57
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,530
real number, then we would
essentially be defining the

58
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,700
set of this entire vertical
line going up and down to

59
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,990
infinity in the upwards
direction and

60
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,810
the downwards direction.

61
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,210
But we just want to restrict
it to start here

62
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,110
and then go up here.

63
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,740
And it doesn't necessarily have
to have any direction.

64
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,900
We could say this is true, our
little line segment here is

65
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,010
true, for t-- let me
write it this way.

66
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,160
t is greater than
or equal to 0.

67
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,410
So when t equals 0, this term
cancels out and we just have

68
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,140
this point or this position
right here.

69
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,410
Let me draw it in green.

70
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,070
We just have that
position there.

71
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:28,140
And then t is going to be
less than or equal to 1.

72
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,060
What happens when
t is equal to 1?

73
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,960
When t is equal to 1, this
becomes x1 minus x0.

74
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,030
You have an x0 there.

75
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,980
This x0 and that x0 cancel out
and you're just at this point

76
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,710
right there.

77
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,890
When t is equal to 1/2, just
to make sure this all make

78
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,030
sense to you, what happens?

79
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,080
You have x1 minus x0, which is
this orange vector right here.

80
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,320
When t is equal to 1/2 you're
essentially scaling that

81
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,480
orange vector by half and you
end up right at that point,

82
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,710
which is exactly where
you want to be.

83
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,290
You want halfway along
that line segment.

84
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,810
At t is equal to 0.25, you're
going to be here.

85
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,670
t is equal to 0.75, you're
going to be there.

86
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,890
So at any value for t being any
real number between 0 and

87
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,800
1, you're going to end up at all
of the points along that

88
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,520
line segment.

89
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,500
So that's our L0.

90
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,510
It's just a set of vectors.

91
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,260
Now we can do the same exercise
if we wanted to find

92
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,700
out the line, the equation
of the line, that goes

93
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,860
between x1 and x2.

94
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,970
If we wanted to find the
equation of that line, we

95
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,220
could call this L1.

96
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,330
   

97
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:41,140
And L1 would be equal to x1 plus
t times x2 minus x1 for 0

98
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,640
is less than or equal to t is
less than or equal to 1.

99
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,740
That's L1.

100
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,140
And then finally, if we want
to make a triangle out of

101
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,100
this, let's define this
line right here.

102
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,320
Let's define that as L2.

103
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,270
L2 would be equal to the set
of all of vectors where you

104
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,530
start off at x2.

105
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:03,860
Set of all of vectors that are
x2 plus some scaled up sum of

106
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,230
x0 minus x2.

107
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,650
x0 minus x2 is this
vector right here.

108
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:16,020
So x0 minus x2 such that 0 is
less than or equal to t is

109
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,430
less than or equal to 1.

110
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,900
And so if you take the
combination, if you were to

111
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:27,620
define kind of a super set-- I
could have defined my shape

112
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:33,070
as-- let's say it's the union
of all of those guys.

113
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,310
Well, let me just write it.

114
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,410
L0, L1, and L2.

115
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:40,550
Then you'd have a nice
triangle here.

116
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,670
If you take the union of all of
these three sets, you get

117
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,080
that nice triangle there.

118
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,790
Now, what I want to do in this
video, I think this is all a

119
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,640
bit of review for you.

120
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,510
But it's maybe a different way
of looking at things than

121
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,550
we've done in the past. Is
I want to understand what

122
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:59,240
happens to this set right here
when I take a transformation,

123
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,580
a linear transformation,
of it?

124
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,630
So let me define a
transformation.

125
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,100
I'll make it a fairly
straightforward

126
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,690
transformation.

127
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:12,730
Let me define my transformation
of x, of any x,

128
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:21,630
to be equal to the matrix
1 minus 1, 2, 0 times

129
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,970
whatever vector x.

130
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,960
So times x1, x2.

131
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,680
And we know that any linear
transformation can actually be

132
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,010
written as a matrix
and vice versa.

133
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,730
So you might have said, hey,
you know, you're giving an

134
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,580
example with the matrix, what
about all those other ways to

135
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,320
write in your transformation?

136
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,580
You can write all of
those as a matrix.

137
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,580
So let's translate-- let's try
to figure out what this is

138
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,410
going to look like.

139
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:45,060
What our triangle is going to
look like when we transform

140
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,700
every point in it.

141
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,650
Let me take the transformation
first. The transformation of

142
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:59,710
L0 is equal to the
transformation of this thing.

143
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,050
This is just one of the
particular members.

144
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,730
For a particular t,
this is one of the

145
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:04,830
particular members of L0.

146
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:12,900
So it's going to be equal to the
transformation of x0 minus

147
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:19,950
the transformation of x1 minus
x0 such that-- sorry.

148
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,130
Minus t times x1 minus x0.

149
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,250
That's a lowercase t, not
the transformation.

150
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,590
Such that 0 is less than or
equal to t is less than or

151
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:28,770
equal to 1.

152
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:30,280
Let me switch colors.

153
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,720
This, just by the properties
of linear transformations,

154
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,920
this is equal to the
transformation-- let me put

155
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:41,730
the brackets out-- of x0 minus
the transformation of our

156
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:51,000
scalar t times x1 minus x0 for
all t's between 0 and 1.

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,750
That part is getting a little
redundant to keep saying it.

158
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,540
And then, what does
this equal to?

159
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,420
If you I take the transformation
of a scaled up

160
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,710
vector, that's just
the scaled up

161
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:59,970
transformation of that vector.

162
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:03,290
So this is going to be equal
to this part, the

163
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:10,250
transformation of x0 minus t,
our scalar multiple t, times

164
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:15,200
the transformation of the
vector x1 minus x0.

165
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,250
And then let me make sure I
get my parentheses right.

166
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,730
Such that 0 is less than or
equal to t is less than or

167
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:20,590
equal to 1.

168
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,510
And then the transformation of
the sum of two vectors is

169
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,370
equal to the sum of their
transformations.

170
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,070
We've all seen this before.

171
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:31,370
So our transformation of our
first line-- this one right

172
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:37,669
here-- L0, is equal to the set
where it's the transformation

173
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:46,830
of x0 minus t times the
transformation of x1 minus the

174
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,580
transformation of x0.

175
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,420
And we've just done our
first line so far.

176
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,070
I have a parentheses there.

177
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:57,820
For 0 is less than t is less
than or equal to 1.

178
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,010
Now this is a pretty neat
result and it's going to

179
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,950
simplify our lives a lot.

180
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:11,220
The transformation of the line
segment that goes from x0 to

181
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:16,420
x1 ends up just being the line
segment that goes from the

182
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,450
transformation of x0 to the
transformation of x1.

183
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,170
Let me make this clear.

184
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,750
What is the transformation
of x0?

185
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,680
Let's calculate these things.

186
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,630
So x0 was minus 2, minus 2.

187
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:33,030
Let me write out the
transformation of x0.

188
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:38,500
So the transformation of x0 is
equal to-- let me write it

189
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,130
out, so I don't make any
careless mistakes.

190
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:45,920
1, 2, minus 1, 0 times minus
2 minus, minus 2.

191
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,990
And so what would this
be equal to?

192
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:52,860
1 minus 2 minus-- so it's
1 minus 2 plus minus

193
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,760
1 times minus 2.

194
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,670
That's going to be plus 2.

195
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,910
So it's minus 2 plus a plus
2, so it's equal to 0.

196
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:02,200
And then we have 2 times minus
2, which is minus 4.

197
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,280
2 times minus 4.

198
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,000
And then plus 0 times,
so it's minus 4.

199
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,345
So that's the transformation
of x0.

200
00:10:08,345 --> 00:10:09,940
Let me graph it.

201
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,690
So it's 0 minus 4.

202
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,400
So our x0 vector.

203
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,260
So this is the transformation
of x0.

204
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:23,480
So the transformation associated
this vector with

205
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,300
this vector down here, the one
that goes straight down.

206
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,420
Now let me take the
transformation

207
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,930
of the other guys.

208
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,480
The transformation of x1.

209
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,110
I'll just do it right here.

210
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,660
I'm running out of space.

211
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:39,420
The transformation of x1 is
equal to 1, 2, minus 1, 0

212
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,685
times minus 2, 2.

213
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:46,830
   

214
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,520
So what is this equal to?

215
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:53,580
This is equal to 1 times minus
2, plus minus 1 times 2.

216
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,460
So that's minus 4.

217
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:59,520
And then 2 times minus
2 is minus 4.

218
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,190
Plus 0.

219
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:04,180
So minus 4, minus 4.

220
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,390
So x1 is minus 4, minus 4.

221
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:10,020
So our x1 looks like this.

222
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:15,290
Our transformation of x1 is this
vector right here in R2.

223
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,250
Our transformation is
going from R2 to R2.

224
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,560
So that's why I'm able to draw
them both on this nice

225
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,010
Cartesian coordinate plane.

226
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,380
And we have one left.

227
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,490
Let's take our transformation
of x2.

228
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:33,820
So the transformation of x2 is
equal to our transformation

229
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:41,760
matrix 1, 2, minus 1,
0 times 2, minus 2.

230
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,610
And so this will be equal
to 1 times 2 is 2.

231
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,630
Plus minus 1 times minus 2.

232
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,940
So it's 2 plus 2 is 4.

233
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,440
And then have 2 times 2 is 4.

234
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,770
Plus 0 times minus 2.

235
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,560
So it's 4, 4.

236
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,420
So x2 is 4, 4.

237
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,020
So it's this point right here.

238
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,130
4, 4 right there.

239
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:07,030
   

240
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:11,030
So the transformation of x2 is
that vector right there.

241
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,340
And so, we are able to take the
transformation of each of

242
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,470
these points of this triangle.

243
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,110
But who knows what the
transformation does to

244
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,590
everything in between, to all
of these other-- the actual

245
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,220
sides of the triangle.

246
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,940
We're able to do a little
math and we just

247
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,910
did the first side.

248
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:29,230
We just did L0 right there
we found, just using the

249
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,510
properties of a linear
transformation, the definition

250
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:34,070
of a linear transformation
actually, we were able to find

251
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:39,480
that the transformation of L0 of
this vertical line here, it

252
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,170
just ends up becoming the line
where we can start off at the

253
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,550
transformation of x0.

254
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,140
   

255
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,780
The point specified by this
vector right here.

256
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,540
And to that I add up scaled
multiples of the

257
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,040
transformation of x1 minus
the transformation of x0.

258
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,560
What is this, the transformation
of x1 minus the

259
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,110
transformation of x0?

260
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:05,450
The transformation of x1 is just
this vector right here.

261
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,880
The transformation of x0
is just that vector.

262
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,800
So this whole term right here is
just this vector minus that

263
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,170
vectors or it's this
vector right there.

264
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,920
It's just that vector
right there.

265
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,960
And so, what we essentially
have, we've defined the same

266
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,430
way that we did in the first
part of this video.

267
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:24,900
This is just the same thing as
the line segment that connects

268
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,870
the point defined here and
the point defined there.

269
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,390
We took the difference of the
two and we have scaled up

270
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:33,930
versions of that between
t is equal to 0 and 1.

271
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,480
So the transformation of L0
really just became the

272
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,040
transformation-- is just
the line between the

273
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,260
transformations of both of the
endpoints, which is a pretty

274
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,210
neat result.

275
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:45,530
It makes our lives simple.

276
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,910
We can do the exact same logic
to say, you know what?

277
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:52,880
What's going to be the
transformation of L1?

278
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,130
Well L1 was between the
points x1 and x2.

279
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,940
It was between that point
and that point.

280
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,060
That was L1.

281
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,020
So using the same logic,
we can do the

282
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,160
math all over again.

283
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,540
But it applies to any line.

284
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,500
I did it all abstractly here.

285
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:13,030
The transformation of L1 is
going to be the line that

286
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,420
connects the transformation
of the two endpoints.

287
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,830
So it's going to be the
line that connects the

288
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,930
transformation of x1 and the
transformation of x2.

289
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:22,880
   

290
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,630
Let me make this right here, is
the transformation of L1.

291
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:32,850
This right here is the
transformation of L0.

292
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:36,190
And then finally, what's the
transformation of L2?

293
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,750
   

294
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:43,330
L2 connects the points
x2 and x0.

295
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,760
So that is L2 right there.

296
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,590
So the transformation of it
using the same math that we've

297
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,140
done before is really just
the line connecting the

298
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,540
transformations of
those two points.

299
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,950
So the transformation of L2 is
going to be equal to the line

300
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:59,410
that connects the transformation
of x2 to the

301
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,920
transformation of x0.

302
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,570
So it's going to be that
line right there.

303
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,390
   

304
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:11,120
So this is the transformation
of L2, or if we defined our

305
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,060
whole shape or our whole
triangle as the set of all of

306
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,160
these, the transformation
of that.

307
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,750
So the transformation of
our whole shape is

308
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,880
now this skewed triangle.

309
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,900
I think you're now getting a
sense of why this might be

310
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,020
useful in things like computer
graphics or game development.

311
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,920
Because when you look at things
from different angles,

312
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,160
you start to skew them
and whatever else.

313
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,920
But taking this transformation,
we were able

314
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:41,280
to turn this set of vectors or
the positions-- or I guess

315
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,860
this shape, which is specified
by this set of

316
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,660
vectors right here.

317
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,945
We were able to change it into
this shape in R2 specified by

318
00:15:48,945 --> 00:15:50,970
a different set of vectors.

319
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:55,610
But the whole takeaway from this
video is, you don't have

320
00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:00,280
to individually figure out,
gee, what does this point

321
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,540
right here translate
into over here?

322
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,450
All you have to say is what
were my endpoints?

323
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,450
Figure out their transformations
and then

324
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:08,140
connect the dots in
the same order.

325
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:11,470
That's what is essentially the
big takeaway from here.

326
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,350
And this idea of when you
transform one set into another

327
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,690
set, they have some terminology

328
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,100
associated with it.

329
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,760
So let's say the transformation
of L0.

330
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,010
L0 was the set of vectors
that specified

331
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,240
this line right here.

332
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:37,000
The transformation of L0, which
is this set, is a set of

333
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,190
vectors-- sorry.

334
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:42,000
L0 was this set.

335
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,720
It was the set of vectors in our
co-domain that specified

336
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,000
these points.

337
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:58,780
This is called the image
of L0 under T.

338
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,490
And it kind of makes sense.

339
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,750
Why do they call it the image?

340
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:08,859
Because t is taking this thing
right here, this L0, and kind

341
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:11,780
of distorting it or creating
a new image

342
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,810
of it in the co-domain.

343
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:16,540
It's taking a set in the domain
and creating a new

344
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,939
image of it in the co-domain
right there.

345
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:22,589
   

346
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:27,250
We could say that t of the
transformation of our entire

347
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,400
shape, I defined our entire
shape up here as this whole

348
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,920
triangle right there.

349
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,440
That's the image and that
turned into this purple

350
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,630
triangle here.

351
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:43,710
That's the image of s under T.

352
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,060
So hopefully you found that
pretty interesting.

353
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,080
This is actually a super useful
takeaway if you ever

354
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,740
want to become a 3D programmer
of some type.

355
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,580
In then next video, we'll
explore what happens when s is

356
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,590
no longer just a subset
of our domain.

357
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:01,120
Everything we've been dealing
so far-- L0, L1, and L2, or

358
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,380
our entire triangle, these
were all subsets or Rn.

359
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,040
In the next video we'll talk
about what happens when you

360
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,660
take the transformation
of all of Rn.

361
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,074
