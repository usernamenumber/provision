1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,190
What I want to do in this video
is talk a little bit

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,500
about the kidney-- and this is
a big picture of a kidney--

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,200
and to talk about how it
operates at its-- I guess you

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,500
could call it its smallest
functional level and that's

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,420
the nephron.

6
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,700
So we're going to talk about
the kidney and the nephron.

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,780
And I think you might already
know the kidney.

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,680
We have two of them.

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,270
They're the organ that, I guess,
is most famous for

10
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,860
producing or allowing
us to excrete waste.

11
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:32,229
But part of that process, it
also helps us maintain our

12
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:36,410
water, the correct level, and
actually the amount of salts

13
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,010
or electrolytes we have and our
blood pressure, but I'll

14
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,870
just say maintain water.

15
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,960
And it also produces hormones
and things, and I'm not going

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,190
to go into a lot of detail
on that right now.

17
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,580
I really just want to focus on
these first two to kind of

18
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,210
just understand the overview
function of the kidney.

19
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,130
And most of us have
two of these.

20
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,480
They're kind of closer to our
back on either sides of our

21
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,210
spine behind our liver.

22
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,470
And this is a zoomed-in
version of it.

23
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,239
If you're watching this in full
screen, it's not going to

24
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,150
be as big as this picture is,
but we've sliced it so we can

25
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,980
see what's going on
inside the kidney.

26
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,130
Just to understand the different
parts here, just

27
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,660
because it will actually be
significant when we start

28
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,520
talking about the functional
units or the nephron within

29
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,930
the kidney, this area right here
from here to here, this

30
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,910
is called the renal cortex.

31
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,550
Whenever we talk about something
with the kidney, if

32
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,110
you see a renal anything, that's
actually referring to

33
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:34,580
the kidney.

34
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,800
So this right here is
a renal cortex, that

35
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,230
outer part right there.

36
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:44,380
And then this area right here,
this is the renal medulla.

37
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,480
And medulla comes from middle.

38
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,050
So you can almost view it as
the middle of the kidney.

39
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,400
   

40
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,680
Besides just understanding these
words, we're going to

41
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,350
see that they actually play a
very important role in this

42
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,720
actual filtration or this
excretion of waste and this

43
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,730
ability to not dump too much
water or excrete too much

44
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,020
water when we're trying to
filter out our blood.

45
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,720
So I've said before, and you
might have heard it already

46
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,330
from other lectures or from
other teachers, that the

47
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,490
functional unit of the kidney
is the nephron.

48
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:22,510
   

49
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,040
And the reason why it's called
a functional unit-- I'll put

50
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,290
it in quotes-- is because that's
the level at which

51
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,250
these two things
are happening.

52
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,980
The two major functions of the
kidney: the waste excretion

53
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,580
and the maintenance
of the water level

54
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,730
in our blood system.

55
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,730
So just to get an idea of how a
nephron fits in within this

56
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,840
picture of a kidney-- I got this
picture from Wikipedia.

57
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,420
The artist tried to draw a
couple of nephrons over here.

58
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,630
So a nephron will look something
like this, and it

59
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,680
dips down into the medulla, and
then it goes back into the

60
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,640
cortex, and then it dumps into
collecting ducts, and

61
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,620
essentially the fluid will end
up in the ureters right here

62
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,960
and end up in our urinary
bladder that we can later

63
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,880
excrete when we find
a suitable time.

64
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,770
But that's about-- I guess
you can imagine

65
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,780
the length of a nephron.

66
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,030
This is where it starts and
then it dips down again.

67
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,840
So multiple nephrons are going
to keep doing that, but

68
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,840
they're super thin.

69
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,140
These tubes or these tubules,
maybe I should

70
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,800
say, are super thin.

71
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,190
Your average kidney will contain
on the order of one

72
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,440
million nephrons.

73
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,320
   

74
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,470
You can't really say, my
nephrons are microscopic.

75
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:39,390
They kind of have a-- at least
their length when they dip

76
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,880
down, you can say, I can
see that distance.

77
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,510
You can still jam a lot of them
inside of one kidney.

78
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:49,580
With that said, let's actually
figure out how a nephron

79
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,880
filters the blood and actually
makes sure that not too much

80
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,530
water or not too much of the
good stuff in our blood ends

81
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,330
up the urine.

82
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:04,070
So let me draw here a nephron.

83
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:07,200
So I'm going to start
like this.

84
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,850
We'll start with
the blood flow.

85
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:13,480
So the blood's going to come
in an arterial-- that's an

86
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,780
arterial capillary,
you could say.

87
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,589
So it's going to come
in like that.

88
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:21,820
This is actually called
the afferent arterial.

89
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,230
You don't have to know
the names, but you

90
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,480
might see that sometime.

91
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,670
   

92
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,170
Blood is coming in.

93
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:32,060
Then it goes into this
big windy place.

94
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,810
It really winds around
like that.

95
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,060
This is called the glomerulus.

96
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:43,490
   

97
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,870
And then it leaves via the
efferent arterial.

98
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:57,100
   

99
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,610
Efferent just means away
from the center.

100
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,750
Afferent towards, efferent
away from the center.

101
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,340
And I'll talk about it more
in the future, but it's

102
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,830
interesting that we're
still dealing with an

103
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,040
artery at this point.

104
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,770
It's still oxygenated blood.

105
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:12,260
Normally, when we leave a
capillary system like the

106
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,950
glomerulus right there, we're
normally dealing with the

107
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,650
venous system, but here we're
still an arterial system.

108
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,280
And it's probably because
arterial systems have higher

109
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,760
blood pressure, and what we
need to do is we need to

110
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:28,730
squeeze fluid and stuff that's
dissolved in the fluid out of

111
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,970
the blood and in the glomerulus
right here.

112
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:35,420
So this glomerulus is very
porous and it's surrounded by

113
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,460
other cells.

114
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,710
This is kind of a
cross-section.

115
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:44,470
   

116
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:49,200
It's surrounded like that by
this structure, and these are

117
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,350
cells here so you can imagine
these are all cells over here.

118
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,980
And, of course, the actual
capillaries have cells that

119
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,960
line them so there
are cells here.

120
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,140
So when I draw these lines,
these lines are actually made

121
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,420
up of little cells.

122
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,540
What happens is the
blood comes in

123
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,900
at really high pressure.

124
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,960
This is very porous.

125
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,410
These cells out here, they're
called podocytes.

126
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,880
They're a little bit more
selective in what gets

127
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,630
filtered out, and essentially
about a fifth of the fluid

128
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:20,640
that's coming in ends up going
into this space right here

129
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,550
that's called the
Bowman's space.

130
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,690
Well, actually, this whole
thing is called

131
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,940
the Bowman's capsule.

132
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,270
   

133
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,650
It's a sphere with an opening in
here that the capillary can

134
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:34,050
kind of wind around in, and the
space right here, this is

135
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,890
the Bowman's space.

136
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:41,270
It's the space inside the
Bowman's capsule, and the

137
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,150
whole thing has cells.

138
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,200
All these structures are
obviously made-- or maybe not

139
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,830
so obviously-- they're
made up of cells.

140
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,730
And so we end up having
filtrate in it.

141
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:53,190
Filtrate is just the stuff
that gets squeezed out.

142
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,380
We can't call it urine just yet
because there's a lot of

143
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:01,720
steps that have to occur for
it to earn the name urine.

144
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,400
So it's only filtrate right now,
and essentially what get

145
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,220
squeezed out, I said it's about
a fifth of the fluid,

146
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,450
and things that are easily
dissolved in fluid, so small

147
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:16,430
ions, sodium, maybe some small
molecules like glucose, maybe

148
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:19,570
some amino acids.

149
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,086
There are tons of stuff
in here, but this is

150
00:07:21,086 --> 00:07:22,080
just to give an idea.

151
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,370
The things that do not get
filtered are things like red

152
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:31,340
blood cells or larger molecules,
larger proteins.

153
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,510
They will not get filtered.

154
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:36,700
It's mainly the micromolecules
that'll get filtered, that'll

155
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,910
be part of this filtrate
that shows up here

156
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:42,390
in the Bowman space.

157
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,110
Now, the rest of what the
nephron does, the Bowman's

158
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,960
capsule is kind of the beginning
of the nephron, and

159
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,280
just to get an idea of our big
picture of our kidney, let's

160
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,760
say we're near an arterial.

161
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,980
This is a Bowman's capsule
right here.

162
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,075
It looks something like that,
and the whole nephron is going

163
00:07:59,075 --> 00:08:00,580
to be convoluted like this.

164
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,150
It's going to dip down into
the medulla, and then come

165
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,220
back, and then it's going to
eventually dump into a

166
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,980
collecting duct, and I'll
talk more about that.

167
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:12,250
So what I've drawn just here,
this is a zoomed-in version of

168
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,660
that part right there.

169
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,250
Now what I want to do is zoom
out a little bit because I'm

170
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,550
going to run out of space.

171
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,290
So let me zoom out.

172
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:23,220
So we had our arterial go in.

173
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,520
It gets all bunched in the
glomerulus, and then most of

174
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,160
the blood leaves, but
one-fifth of it gets

175
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,390
essentially filtered in to
the Bowman's capsule.

176
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,780
That's the Bowman's capsule
right there.

177
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,450
I've just zoomed out
a little bit.

178
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,530
So we have our filtrate here.

179
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,080
Maybe I'll make it a
little bit yellow.

180
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,440
   

181
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,800
The filtrate that just comes out
at this point, sometimes

182
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,270
it's called the glomerular
filtrate because it's been

183
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,170
filtered by the glomerulus, but
it's also been filtered by

184
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,060
those podocyte cells
on the inside of

185
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,470
the Bowman's capsule.

186
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,120
But now it's ready to go
to the proximal tubule.

187
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,080
   

188
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,530
Let me draw something
like this.

189
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,300
And obviously, this is not
exactly what it looks like,

190
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,580
but it gives you the sense.

191
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:17,470
This right here, this is
the proximal tubule.

192
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,560
And it sounds like a very fancy
word, but proximal just

193
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,590
means near and tubule, you can
imagine, is just a small tube.

194
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,740
So it's a small tube that's
near the beginning.

195
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,880
That's why it's called
a proximal tubule.

196
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,700
And it has two parts.

197
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,245
The whole thing is
often called a

198
00:09:31,245 --> 00:09:32,870
proximal convoluted tubule.

199
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,870
   

200
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,390
That's because it's
all convoluted.

201
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,830
The way I've drawn
it is all curvy.

202
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,750
And I just drew it curvy
in two dimensions.

203
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,170
It's actually curvy in
three dimensions.

204
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,470
But the reality is there's a
curvy part and then there's a

205
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,220
straight part near the end
of the proximal tubule.

206
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,570
So we'll call this whole thing
the proximal tubule.

207
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,060
This is the convoluted part.

208
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,670
That's the straight
part, but we don't

209
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,340
have to get too picky.

210
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:59,040
But the whole point of this part
of the nephron-- and just

211
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,810
to remember where we are, we're
now at this point of the

212
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,890
nephron right there-- the
whole point is to start

213
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:09,700
reabsorbing some of the stuff
that is in the filtrate that

214
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,670
we don't want to lose.

215
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,880
We don't want to lose glucose.

216
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,900
That's hard-earned stuff
that we ate that

217
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,090
was good for energy.

218
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:18,790
We don't want to lose
necessarily as much sodium.

219
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:24,040
We've seen in multiple videos
that that's a useful ion to

220
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,480
have around.

221
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,490
We don't want to lose
amino acids.

222
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:30,490
Those are useful for building up
proteins and other things.

223
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,320
So these are things we don't
want to lose so we start

224
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,670
absorbing them back.

225
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,840
I'll do a whole video on exactly
how that happens, but

226
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,480
it's done actively.

227
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,575
Since we're using ATP, and just
as a bit of a summary,

228
00:10:40,575 --> 00:10:43,900
you're using ATP to actually
pump out the sodium and then

229
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,660
that actually helps bring
in the other things.

230
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,160
That's just kind of a tidbit
on what's happening.

231
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,190
So we're reabsorbing, so just
imagine what's happening.

232
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:56,370
You have cells lining the
proximal tubule right now.

233
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,310
And actually, they have little
things that jut out.

234
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,790
I'll do a whole video on that
because it's actually

235
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,630
interesting.

236
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,910
So you have cells out here.

237
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,660
On the other side of the cells,
you have an arterial

238
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,110
system, or a capillary system,
I should say, actually.

239
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:12,080
So let's say you have a
capillary system here that is

240
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:16,580
very close to the cells lining
the proximal tubule, and so

241
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,140
this stuff actually gets
actively pumped, especially

242
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,000
the sodium, but all of it, using
energy, gets pumped back

243
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,890
into the blood selectively,
and maybe a

244
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:25,870
little bit of our water.

245
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:32,480
So we're pumping back some
sodium, some glucose, and

246
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,710
we'll start pumping a little
bit of the water back in

247
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,540
because we don't want to
lose all of that water.

248
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,620
If all of the water that was
originally in the filtrate we

249
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,560
were just leaving in our urine,
we'd be excreting

250
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,240
gallons and gallons of water
every day, which we do not

251
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,310
want to do.

252
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,500
So that's the whole point.

253
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,130
We're starting the absorption
process.

254
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,400
And then we'll enter the loop
of Henle, and actually, this

255
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,610
is, in my mind, the most

256
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:55,370
interesting part of the nephron.

257
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:59,930
So we're entering the loop of
Henle, and it dips down, and

258
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:03,680
then comes back up.

259
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,740
And so most of the length
of the nephron

260
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,900
is the loop of Henle.

261
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,916
And if I go back to this diagram
right here, if I'm

262
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:13,270
talking about the loop of Henle,
I'm talking about this

263
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,440
whole thing right there.

264
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,450
And you can see something
interesting here.

265
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:21,050
It crosses the border between
the cortex, this light brown

266
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:24,820
part, and the renal medulla,
this kind of reddish or orange

267
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,170
part right there, and it does
that for a very good reason.

268
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm going to draw it here.

269
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,710
So let's say this is the
dividing line right here.

270
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,460
This right here was
the cortex.

271
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:39,550
This right here is
the medulla.

272
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,060
So the whole point-- well,
there's two points

273
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,590
of the loop of Henle.

274
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:48,570
   

275
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:57,830
One point is to make the renal
medulla salty, and it does

276
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:00,502
this by actively pumping
out salts.

277
00:13:00,502 --> 00:13:03,090
So it actively pumps out salts,
and it does that in the

278
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:06,140
ascending part of the
loop of Henle.

279
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:12,390
So it actively pumps out salts:
sodium, potassium,

280
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,440
chloride, or chlorine,
I should say.

281
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,500
Chlorine ions.

282
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,990
It actively pumps out these
salts right here to make the

283
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:27,670
entire medulla salty, or if we
think about it in terms of

284
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,990
kind of osmosis, make
it hypertonic.

285
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:33,320
You have more solute out here
than you have in the filtrate

286
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,010
that's going through
the tubules.

287
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,240
And it uses ATP to do this.

288
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,910
All of this stuff requires ATP
to actively pump against a

289
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,570
concentration gradient.

290
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:46,110
So this is salty and it's
salty for a reason.

291
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:50,820
It's not just to take back these
salts from the filtrate,

292
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,230
although that's part of the
reason, but by making this

293
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:57,620
salty, the ascending part is
only permeable to these salts

294
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,270
and these ions.

295
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,830
It's not permeable to water.

296
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:06,110
   

297
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:09,050
The descending part of the
loop of Henle is only

298
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,300
permeable to water.

299
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,390
   

300
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,380
So what's going to happen?

301
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,430
If this is all salty because the
ascending part is actively

302
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:21,260
pumping out salt, what's going
to happen to water as it goes

303
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,110
down the descending loop?

304
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,870
Well, it's hypertonic
out here.

305
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:28,830
Water will naturally want to go
and kind of try to make the

306
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,540
concentrations balance out.

307
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,510
I've done a whole
video on that.

308
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,680
It doesn't happen by magic.

309
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,710
And so the water will-- because
this is hypertonic,

310
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,620
it's more salty, and this is
only permeable to water, the

311
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,930
water will leave the membrane on
the descending part of the

312
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,560
loop of Henle right now.

313
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,710
And this is a major part
of water reabsorption.

314
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:52,870
I've thought a lot about why
don't we use ATP somehow to

315
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,360
actively pump water?

316
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,850
And the answer there
is, there's no

317
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:56,650
easy way to do that.

318
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:01,130
Biological systems are good at
using ATP to pump out ions,

319
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,360
but it can't actively
pump out water.

320
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,360
Water's kind of a hard thing
for proteins to operate on.

321
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,580
So the solution is to make it
salty out here by pumping out

322
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,540
ions and then water, if you
make this porous only to

323
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,750
water, water will naturally
flow out.

324
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,170
So this is a major mechanism of
gaining back a lot of the

325
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,820
water that gets filtered
out up here.

326
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,390
And the reason why this is so
long is to give time for this

327
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:27,560
water to secrete out, and that's
why it dips nice and

328
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,490
pretty far down into
this salty portion.

329
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,710
So then we'll leave the loop of
Henle and then we're almost

330
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,110
done with the nephron.

331
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,790
Then we're in another convoluted
tubule, and you

332
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,710
might even guess the name of
this convoluted tubule.

333
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,860
If this was the proximal one,
this is the distal one.

334
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,070
And actually, just to make my
drawing correct, it actually

335
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:51,560
passes very close to the
Bowman's capsule, so let me do

336
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,810
it in a different color.

337
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:57,230
   

338
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:01,920
The distal convoluted tubule
actually goes pretty close to

339
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,970
the Bowman's capsule.

340
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:06,000
And once again, I've made
it all convoluted in two

341
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,740
dimensions, but it's actually
convoluted in three.

342
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,840
And it's not that long, but I
just had to get over here and

343
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,830
I wanted to get over that
point right there.

344
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:12,830
It's called distal.

345
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,510
Distal is further away.

346
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,750
It's convoluted and
it's a tubule.

347
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:24,450
So this right here is the distal
convoluted tubule, and

348
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,690
here we have more reabsorption:
calcium, more

349
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:28,820
sodium reabsorption.

350
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,250
We're just reabsorbing more
things that we didn't want to

351
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,600
lose in the first place.

352
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,180
There's a lot of things we
could talk about what get

353
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,330
reabsorbed, but this is
just the overview.

354
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,870
And we're also reabsorbing a
little bit of more water.

355
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,420
But then at the end
right here, our

356
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,800
filtrate has been processed.

357
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,290
A lot of the water's
been taken out.

358
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,760
It's a lot more concentrated.

359
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,700
We've reabsorbed a
lot of the salts,

360
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,290
electrolytes that we want.

361
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:52,100
We've reabsorbed the glucose and
a lot of the amino acids.

362
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,770
Everything that we want,
we've taken back.

363
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,630
We've reabsorbed.

364
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:59,710
And so this is mainly waste
products and water that we

365
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,670
don't need anymore and then
this gets dumped into

366
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,920
collecting ducts.

367
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,140
   

368
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,230
And you can kind of view this
as the trash chute of the

369
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:12,384
kidney, where multiple
nephrons are going

370
00:17:12,384 --> 00:17:13,740
to dump into this.

371
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,960
So that might be the distal
tubule of another nephron

372
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:22,010
right here and this is a
collecting duct, which is just

373
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,569
a tube that's collecting
all the

374
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:27,040
byproducts of the nephrons.

375
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,620
And the interesting thing is
that the collecting duct

376
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,040
further goes into the
medulla again.

377
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,210
It goes into the medulla again
to the salty part again.

378
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,090
So if we're talking about the
collecting duct, maybe the

379
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:40,400
collecting ducts come back
into the medulla, collecting

380
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,070
all of the filtrate from
the different nephrons.

381
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:46,860
And because it goes back through
that super salty spot

382
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,240
in the medulla, we actually
have [a] hormone called

383
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,540
anti-diuretic hormone that
can dictate how porous this

384
00:17:54,540 --> 00:18:00,910
collecting tube is, and if it
makes it very porous, it

385
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:04,430
allows more water to leave as we
go to the medulla, because

386
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,110
this is very salty,
so the water will

387
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,690
leave if this is porous.

388
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,740
And when we do that, what that
does is it makes the

389
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,100
filtrate-- and we can maybe
start calling it urine now--

390
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,170
even more concentrated so we
lose even less water, and it

391
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,490
keeps collecting, collecting,
collecting until we end up

392
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:23,650
here, and it leaves the kidney
and goes via our ureters to

393
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,030
the urinary bladder.

394
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,200
So hopefully, you found
that helpful.

395
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,650
I think the neatest thing here
is just how we actively

396
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,150
reabsorb the water and how we--
well, actually, in my

397
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,770
mind, that is the neatest part
in the loop of Henle.
