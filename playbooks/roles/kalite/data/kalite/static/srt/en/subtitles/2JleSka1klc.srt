1
00:00:05,987 --> 00:00:08,971
We're still on the fourth floor in the Museum of Modern Art,

2
00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:18,282
and we're standing in front of one of Jackson Pollock's great, seminal, signature works of painting called "One: Number 31, 1950."

3
00:00:18,282 --> 00:00:19,784
That's a lot of numbers.

4
00:00:19,784 --> 00:00:22,131
You know, he made a real decision.

5
00:00:22,131 --> 00:00:26,024
Is it like Chopin, you know - "Nocturne No. 22?"

6
00:00:26,024 --> 00:00:30,176
It's exactly what it is. He had titles and, actually, he would occasionally title again,

7
00:00:30,176 --> 00:00:34,310
or sometimes accept the title that his friends developed for a painting after it was finished.

8
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:39,578
But scholars have thought that Pollock numbered because he wanted not to close down meaning.

9
00:00:39,578 --> 00:00:44,982
He wanted the meaning to remain open and the system that was used by composers did that.

10
00:00:44,982 --> 00:00:46,328
That makes sense.

11
00:00:46,328 --> 00:00:51,002
So he didn't want any text associated with this image and wanted instead something very open-ended.

12
00:00:51,002 --> 00:00:55,105
The same year he produced this, in fact, at the same time that he produced this,

13
00:00:55,105 --> 00:00:57,436
he produced "Autumn Rhythm," which hangs up at the Met.

14
00:00:57,436 --> 00:00:58,742
Which does have a name.

15
00:00:58,742 --> 00:01:02,444
It does have a name and people look for, you know, the colors of fall. They look for...

16
00:01:02,444 --> 00:01:03,671
The rhythm.

17
00:01:03,671 --> 00:01:04,670
Yeah, exactly.

18
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,079
And they wonder what that is. It's a series of associations.

19
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:11,728
A minute ago, when we walked into the room, you said that you could tell when it was upside down,

20
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:13,315
which I don't think many people could do.

21
00:01:13,315 --> 00:01:18,704
So that would mean that there is something very intentional about the drips and their direction

22
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:23,862
and the form that this image takes that I think is probably lost on most viewers.

23
00:01:23,862 --> 00:01:26,477
See, that is a really interesting and, I think, complicated set of issues.

24
00:01:26,477 --> 00:01:31,716
When we think of Pollock's drip paintings, we, I think quite rightfully, think of a kind of improvisation.

25
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:34,371
And these paintings are kind of improvisation.

26
00:01:34,371 --> 00:01:37,048
Like jazz musicians going off on a riff.

27
00:01:37,048 --> 00:01:42,101
Right, exactly. But that same jazz musician probably knows how to control a saxophone brilliantly.

28
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:46,085
And Pollock, I think, really understood how to control the paint in his incredibly unique way.

29
00:01:46,085 --> 00:01:48,779
It's interesting that we don't want to allow him that control.

30
00:01:48,779 --> 00:01:53,003
We love the idea of the artists as the idiots of art, we want it with Van Gogh, we want it with everybody.

31
00:01:53,003 --> 00:01:56,062
These people who are somehow brilliant in this very narrow way.

32
00:01:56,062 --> 00:02:00,390
But Pollock was very sophisticated visually and really understood, I think, what he was up to.

33
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,845
So how does top and bottom work here?

34
00:02:02,845 --> 00:02:07,462
Well, if you look at the canvas, this is a huge canvas, first of all, and it's one he painted in the spring.

35
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:13,030
He painted it horizontally, unstretched and unprimed on a piece of rock and [...]

36
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,821
And he walked around the canvas quite famously and certainly.

37
00:02:16,821 --> 00:02:21,823
There've been many photographic documentations of him painting.

38
00:02:21,823 --> 00:02:27,270
But if you look at the painting, you'll see that he really ordered the canvas in these really particular ways.

39
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:32,606
First of all, the density of the paint is towards the center and there really is a frame around the edge...

40
00:02:32,606 --> 00:02:34,100
The edge of the architecture.

41
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,825
So he knew exactly where he was going and where he was ending.

42
00:02:36,825 --> 00:02:44,115
But at the same time, the density becomes most extreme a little bit more than a third of the way up the canvas and, in fact,

43
00:02:44,115 --> 00:02:49,879
there's a sort of a loose horizontal that's about one third of the way up the canvas...

44
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,068
I see.

45
00:02:51,068 --> 00:02:57,439
...which in some ways functions to, I think, anchor the canvas and give it a kind of center of gravity

46
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:00,308
that's low rather than high, so it doesn't feel unwieldy.

47
00:03:00,308 --> 00:03:06,760
But in the classroom, if you take a slide of this painting and flip it over, the painting falls apart.

48
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,444
Really?

49
00:03:07,444 --> 00:03:08,061
Yeah.

50
00:03:08,077 --> 00:03:09,665
I wish we could do that here.

51
00:03:09,665 --> 00:03:12,002
Your mention of the horizontal reminded me of a horizon line.

52
00:03:12,002 --> 00:03:17,772
Which is a funny thing to think about, because he's got the canvas flat on the floor, there is no horizon line.

53
00:03:17,772 --> 00:03:19,723
I was consciously avoiding the word "horizon line."

54
00:03:19,723 --> 00:03:22,360
It's a pretty inevitable association here, though.

55
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,715
Yeah, it is. We really do see a kind of space, it's the way in which those schemes of paint, those lines,

56
00:03:26,715 --> 00:03:32,298
really fold into each other and become this incredible sort of dense, spacial...

57
00:03:32,298 --> 00:03:41,660
It's quite powerful to stand in front of it, it feels very enveloping and around one, even though one is standing separate from it.

58
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,096
It's true. I want to go back to the idea of his intent, though,

59
00:03:44,096 --> 00:03:50,131
because there's been a lot of discussion. These two sort of great critical framers, early on.

60
00:03:50,131 --> 00:03:51,056
Greenberg?

61
00:03:51,056 --> 00:03:55,563
Greenberg and Rosenberg had very different views on what Pollock was doing

62
00:03:55,563 --> 00:04:00,835
and Rosenberg very famously says that what we're seeing in the museum is, in some sense,

63
00:04:00,835 --> 00:04:04,687
just a fossil of the original work of art, which was the act of making.

64
00:04:04,687 --> 00:04:05,637
The performance.

65
00:04:05,637 --> 00:04:08,166
The performance, the performative element itself.

66
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:11,938
Whereas Greenberg said that it only became a work of art when it was lifted off the floor,

67
00:04:11,938 --> 00:04:16,366
into the realm of the vertical and sort of entered into this continuum of the history of art.

68
00:04:16,366 --> 00:04:21,150
It's an interesting thing, because we're not looking at it the way the artist himself looked at it and created it,

69
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,714
which is probably something that had never happened before.

70
00:04:24,714 --> 00:04:30,715
And because of that sometimes I find myself going to the edge of the canvas and cuffing my head to the side,

71
00:04:30,715 --> 00:04:33,705
so that I can see across the canvas, the way that Pollock would have.

72
00:04:33,705 --> 00:04:35,387
It's a very different exterior.

73
00:04:35,387 --> 00:04:38,284
I wonder how he kept both of those things in his head.

74
00:04:38,284 --> 00:04:43,807
He was very conscious of what [...]. He was very conscious of what his painting would look like when it did reach the vertical.

75
00:04:43,807 --> 00:04:49,050
Well, he must have. I mean, he was speaking to a tradition of painting, to the history of painting.

76
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:54,424
There is one case, though, when he asked Tony Smith, who put together some of his most important exhibitions,

77
00:04:54,424 --> 00:05:00,337
to hang a painting horizontally, on the ceiling, in the gallery.

78
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:02,739
Really? That's interesting.

79
00:05:02,739 --> 00:05:07,569
So there was one case when you actually would have looked across the canvas - or at least up at it.

80
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:13,746
I'm looking now and there are some people standing in front of it and pretending that they're dripping.

81
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:22,171
They've figured out that dense network of drips and lines, it looks so strange.

82
00:05:22,171 --> 00:05:26,501
There are a very famous photographs of Vogue models actually,

83
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:29,857
it's in front of one of these canvases, and they look incredibly striking.

84
00:05:29,857 --> 00:05:34,184
You know, there are so many ways to approach this painting,

85
00:05:34,184 --> 00:05:38,102
but I think that one of the most important things to take away from Pollock

86
00:05:38,102 --> 00:05:45,072
is that this is not a canvas that's about representing a bouquet of flowers or a human body.

87
00:05:45,072 --> 00:05:51,130
It's really a painting that represents the action and the activity of painting itself.

88
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,133
The gesture. This is about the painterly gesture.

89
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:57,482
And the act of making. But yes, gesture, absolutely.

90
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:00,741
But there's no paintbrush, which is the thing we think abotu when we think about gesture.

91
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:04,147
Think about it this way. Would you look at any of those individual lines of paint?

92
00:06:04,147 --> 00:06:07,141
They get thicker and thinner and sometimes they pull.

93
00:06:07,141 --> 00:06:11,464
And when they pull, you get the sense that Pollock stopped and the paint continued to drip.

94
00:06:11,464 --> 00:06:19,107
When his arm moves slowly, you have a thicker line, and when you have this thinning line, you know that he sped up.

95
00:06:19,107 --> 00:06:22,217
So this becomes almost a kind of choreographic notation

96
00:06:22,217 --> 00:06:25,831
where you can almost begin to reconstruct how he moved around this.

97
00:06:25,831 --> 00:06:28,177
And so in some places it's a broader gesture.

98
00:06:28,177 --> 00:06:32,438
It's not the gesture of the brush, it's not the gesture even of the hand, it's the gesture of the entire body.

99
00:06:32,438 --> 00:06:37,864
I can feel that, but at the same time I can feel the tension.

100
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:48,972
There's some way that in its multifariousness and in its density it seems like a natural thing and not something that was made.

101
00:06:48,972 --> 00:06:53,965
And that's maybe tying back into the point you made earlier about us not wanting Pollock to have been overly conscious.

102
00:06:53,965 --> 00:06:59,162
We want this to somehow be an act of nature and that ties in beautifully with this whole myth.

103
00:06:59,162 --> 00:07:01,919
There's a very famous moment early in Pollock's career,

104
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,984
when Lee Krasner, an extraordinary artist in her own right, and, off course, Pollock's wife,

105
00:07:06,984 --> 00:07:11,311
would introduce him to Hans Hofmann, the great German abstractionist.

106
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:14,073
And Hofmann would say to Pollock that he needs to look more closely at nature,

107
00:07:14,073 --> 00:07:16,490
when Hofmann was reviewing Pollock's early work.

108
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,397
And Pollock is said to have responded: "I am Nature."

109
00:07:20,397 --> 00:07:21,953
Oh. Interesting.
