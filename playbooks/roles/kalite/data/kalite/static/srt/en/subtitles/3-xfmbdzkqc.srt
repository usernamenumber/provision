1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
   

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,140
In the last video, we started
with the 2 by 2 matrix A is

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,440
equal to 1, 2, 4, 3.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:21,925
And we used the fact that lambda
is an eigenvalue of A,

5
00:00:21,925 --> 00:00:27,170
if and only if, the determinate
of lambda times

6
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,560
the identity matrix-- in this
case it's a 2 by 2 identity

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,360
matrix-- minus A
is equal to 0.

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,380
This gave us a characteristic
polynomial and we solved for

9
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:40,050
that and we said, well, the
eigenvalues for A are lambda

10
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,090
is equal to 5 and lambda
is equal to negative 1.

11
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,420
That's what we saw in
the last video.

12
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:52,160
We said that if you were trying
to solve A times some

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,160
eigenvector is equal to lambda
times that eigenvector, the

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,790
two lambdas, which this equation
can be solved for,

15
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,920
are the lambdas 5 and minus 1.

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,730
   

17
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:09,725
Assuming nonzero eigenvectors.

18
00:01:09,725 --> 00:01:18,110
   

19
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:21,300
So we have our eigenvalues,
but I don't even call that

20
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,110
half the battle.

21
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,510
What we really want is our
eigenvectors and our

22
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:24,850
eigenvalues.

23
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,000
So let's see if we
can do that.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,580
So if we manipulate this
equation a little bit and

25
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,320
we've manipulate it in the past.
Actually, we've even

26
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,320
come up with this statement
over here.

27
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,650
We can rewrite this over here
as the 0 vector is equal to

28
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:43,180
lambda times my eigenvector
minus A times my eigenvector.

29
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,780
I just subtracted Av
from both sides.

30
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,860
We know lambda times some
eigenvector is the same thing

31
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:54,330
as lambda times the identity
matrix times that eigenvector.

32
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:58,040
So all I'm doing is rewriting
this like that.

33
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,470
You multiply the identity matrix
times an eigenvector or

34
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,230
times any vector, you're just
going to get that vector.

35
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,950
So these two things
are equivalent.

36
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,200
Minus Av.

37
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,750
   

38
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,440
That's still going to be
able to the 0 vector.

39
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,470
So far all I've done is
manipulated this thing.

40
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,080
This is really how we got
to that thing up there.

41
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,470
You factor out the v so to speak
because we know that

42
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,710
matrix vector products exhibit
the distributive property.

43
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:28,450
And we get lambda times the
identity matrix minus A times

44
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:33,020
my eigenvector have got
to be equal to 0.

45
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:43,960
Or another way to say it is, for
any lambda eigenvalue, and

46
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:51,030
let me write it for any
eigenvalue lambda, the

47
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,610
eigenvectors that correspond
to that lambda, we can call

48
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:59,220
that the eigenspace
for a lambda.

49
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,740
So that's a new word,
eigenspace.

50
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,560
   

51
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,430
Eigenspace just means all
of the eigenvectors that

52
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,950
correspond to some eigenvalue.

53
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:16,040
The eigenspace for some
particular eigenvalue is going

54
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,390
to be equal to the set
of vectors that

55
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,810
satisfy this equation.

56
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,790
Well, the set of vectors that
satisfy this equation is just

57
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:26,450
the null space of that
right there.

58
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:29,120
So it's equal to the
null space of this

59
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,050
matrix right there.

60
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:34,090
The null space of lambda times
the identity matrix.

61
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,940
And by an identity
matrix minus A.

62
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,040
And so everything I've done
here, this is true-- this is

63
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,840
the general case.

64
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,450
But now we can apply
this notion to this

65
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,690
matrix A right here.

66
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:48,840
So we know that 5 is
an eigenvalue.

67
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,600
Let's say for lambda is equal
to 5, the eigenspace that

68
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:59,140
corresponds to 5 is equal
to the null space of?

69
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,510
Well, what is 5 times
the identity matrix?

70
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,980
It's going to be the 2
by 2 identity matrix.

71
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:15,730
5 times the identity matrix is
just 5, 0, 0, 5 minus A.

72
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,959
That's just 1, 2, 4, 3.

73
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:27,600
So that is equal to the null
space of the matrix.

74
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,870
5 minus 1 is 4.

75
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,640
0 minus 2 is minus 2.

76
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,240
0 minus 4 is minus 4.

77
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,090
And then, 5 minus 3 is 2.

78
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,130
So the null space of this matrix
right here-- and this

79
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,560
matrix is just an actual
numerical representation of

80
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,150
this matrix right here.

81
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,760
The null space of this matrix
is the set of all of the

82
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,030
vectors that satisfy this or all
of the eigenvectors that

83
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,950
correspond to this eigenvalue.

84
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,100
Or, the eigenspace that
corresponds to

85
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,590
the eigenvalue 5.

86
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,540
These are all equivalent
statements.

87
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,010
So we just need to figure out
the null space of this guy is

88
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:09,200
all of the vectors that satisfy
the equation 4 minus

89
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,790
2, minus 4, 2 times some
eigenvector is

90
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,730
equal to the 0 vector.

91
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:19,170
And the null space of a matrix
is equal to the null space of

92
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,290
the reduced row echelon
form of a matrix.

93
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:24,260
So what's the reduced row
echelon form of this guy?

94
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:29,440
Well, I guess a good starting
point-- let me keep my first

95
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,570
row the same, 4 minus 2.

96
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:34,350
And let me replace my second
row with my second row

97
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,590
plus my first row.

98
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:38,040
So minus 4 plus 4 is 0.

99
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,910
2 plus minus 2 is 0.

100
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:44,850
Now, let me divide my
first row by 4 and I

101
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,890
get 1, minus 1/2.

102
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,810
And then I get 0, 0.

103
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,340
So what's the null
space of this?

104
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,280
This corresponds to v.

105
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,550
This times v1, v2-- that's just
another way of writing my

106
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:03,100
eigenvector v-- has got to
be equal to the 0 vector.

107
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:08,560
Or another way to say it is that
my first entry v1, which

108
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,810
corresponds to this pivot
column, plus or minus 1/2

109
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,970
times my second entry has
got to be equal to

110
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,730
that 0 right there.

111
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:24,530
Or, v1 is equal to 1/2 v2.

112
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,120
And so if I wanted to write all
of the eigenvectors that

113
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,320
satisfy this, I could
write it this way.

114
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:35,780
My eigenspace that corresponds
to lambda equals 5.

115
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,360
That corresponds to the
eigenvalue 5 is equal to the

116
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:48,250
set of all of the vectors, v1,
v2, that are equal to some

117
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,310
scaling factor.

118
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,360
Let's say it's equal
to t times what?

119
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,170
If we say that v2 is equal to t,
so v2 is going to be equal

120
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:01,140
to t times 1.

121
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:05,550
And then, v1 is going to be
equal to 1/2 times v2

122
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,850
or 1/2 times t.

123
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,390
   

124
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,640
Just like that.

125
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,550
   

126
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,150
For any t is a member
of the real numbers.

127
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,850
If we wanted to, we could
scale this up.

128
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,260
We could say any real
number times 1, 2.

129
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,610
That would also be the span.

130
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,500
Let me do that actually.

131
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,060
It'll make it a little
bit cleaner.

132
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,070
Actually, I don't
have to do that.

133
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:32,820
So we could write that the
eigenspace for the eigenvalue

134
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:42,060
5 is equal to the span of
the vector 1/2 and 1.

135
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,030
So it's a line in R2.

136
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,190
Those are all of the
eigenvectors that satisfy--

137
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,700
that work for the equation
where the

138
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,960
eigenvalue is equal to 5.

139
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,620
Now what about when
the eigenvalue is

140
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,080
equal to minus 1?

141
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,120
   

142
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,750
So let's do that case.

143
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:07,620
When lambda is equal to minus
1, then we have-- it's going

144
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,660
to be the null space.

145
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,370
So the eigenspace for lambda is
equal to minus 1 is going

146
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:18,760
to be the null space of lambda
times our identity matrix,

147
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:23,000
which is going to be minus
1 and 0, 0, minus 1.

148
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,440
It's going to be minus 1 times
1, 0, 0, 1, which is just

149
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,570
minus 1 there.

150
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,800
Minus A.

151
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,460
So minus 1, 2, 4, 3.

152
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:37,620
And this is equal to the null
space of-- minus 1,

153
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,760
minus 1 is minus 2.

154
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,230
0 minus 2 is minus 2.

155
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:49,160
0 minus 4 is minus 4 and minus
1 minus 3 is minus 4.

156
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,270
And that's going to be equal
to the null space of the

157
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,320
reduced row echelon
form of that guy.

158
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,550
So we can perform some row
operations right here.

159
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,730
Let me just put it in reduced
row echelon form.

160
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:06,430
So if I replace my second row
plus 2 times my first row.

161
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,070
So I'll keep the first
row the same.

162
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,470
Minus 2, minus 2.

163
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,550
And then my second row, I'll
replace it with two times--

164
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,740
I'll replace it with it plus
2 times the first. Or even

165
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,560
better, I'm going to replace it
with it plus minus 2 times

166
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,025
the first. So minus
4 plus 4 is 0.

167
00:09:20,025 --> 00:09:23,170
   

168
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,940
And then if I divide the top
row by minus 2, the reduced

169
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,110
row echelon form of this matrix
right here or this

170
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:34,210
matrix right here is going
to be 1, 1, 0.

171
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:38,140
So the eigenspace that
corresponds to the eigenvalue

172
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:48,690
minus 1 is equal to the null
space of this guy right here

173
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,930
It's the set of vectors
that satisfy this

174
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:54,320
equation: 1, 1, 0, 0.

175
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,110
And then you have v1,
v2 is equal to 0.

176
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,720
Or you get v1 plus-- these
aren't vectors,

177
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,070
these are just values.

178
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,200
v1 plus v2 is equal to 0.

179
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,610
   

180
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,020
Because 0 is just equal to
that thing right there.

181
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,170
So 1 times v1 plus 1 times v2 is
going to be equal to that 0

182
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,080
right there.

183
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,910
Or I could write v1 is
equal to minus v2.

184
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:28,510
Or if we say that v2 is equal to
t, we could say v1 is equal

185
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,430
to minus t.

186
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:34,450
Or we could say that the
eigenspace for the eigenvalue

187
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:41,770
minus 1 is equal to all of the
vectors, v1, v2 that are equal

188
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:50,180
to some scalar t times v1 is
minus t and v2 is plus t.

189
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:54,410
Or you could say this is equal
to the span of the vector

190
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,940
minus 1 and 1.

191
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,710
So let's just graph this a
little bit just to understand

192
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:00,960
what we just did.

193
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,860
We were able to find
two eigenvalues for

194
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,390
this, 5 and minus 1.

195
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,370
And we were able to find all
of the vectors that are

196
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,310
essentially-- or, we were able
to find the set of vectors

197
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:14,670
that are the eigenvectors that
correspond to each of these

198
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,020
eigenvalues.

199
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,460
So let's graph them.

200
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,750
So if we go to R2, let
me draw my axes, this

201
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,120
is my vertical axis.

202
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,230
That's my horizontal axis.

203
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:30,430
So all of the vectors that
correspond to lambda equal 5

204
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:33,970
are along the line 1/2, 1.

205
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,460
Or the span of 1/2, 1.

206
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,320
So that is 1.

207
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,750
That is 1.

208
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,170
So you go 1/2 and 1
just like that.

209
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:46,150
So that's that vector,
spanning vector.

210
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:49,770
But anything along the span of
this, all the multiples of

211
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:52,060
this, are going to be
valid eigenvectors.

212
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,360
So anything along that line,
all of the vectors when you

213
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,920
draw them in standard
position, point to a

214
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,540
point on that line.

215
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,900
All of these vectors, any vector
on there is going to be

216
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,430
a valid eigenvector and the
corresponding eigenvalue is

217
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,020
going to be equal to 5.

218
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:11,250
So you give me this
guy right here.

219
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,270
When you apply the
transformation, it's going to

220
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,805
be five times this guy.

221
00:12:14,805 --> 00:12:18,120
   

222
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,040
If this guy is x, t of
x is going to be

223
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,870
five times this guy.

224
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,940
Whatever vector you give along
this line, the transformation

225
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,860
of that guy, the transformation
is literally,

226
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,140
multiplying it by
the matrix A.

227
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,330
Where did I have the matrix A?

228
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,040
The matrix A right up there.

229
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,660
You're essentially just scaling
this guy by 5 in

230
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,320
either direction.

231
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,160
This is for lambda equal 5.

232
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,390
And for lambda equals 1, it's
the span of this vector, which

233
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:48,730
is minus 1, 1.

234
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,100
Which looks like this.

235
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,460
So this vector looks
like that.

236
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,800
We care about the span of it.

237
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,170
   

238
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:01,370
Any vector that when you draw in
standard position lies, or

239
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:05,770
points to, points on this line,
will be an eigenvector

240
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:08,170
for the eigenvalue minus 1.

241
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:11,500
So lambda equals minus 1.

242
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,860
Let's say you take the
spanning vector here.

243
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,010
You apply the transformation,
you're going to get

244
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,730
minus 1 times it.

245
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,240
So if this is x, the
transformation of x is going

246
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,100
to be that right there.

247
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,670
Same length, just in the
opposite direction.

248
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,340
If you have this guy right
here, you apply the

249
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,510
transformation, it's going to
be in the same spanning line

250
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,570
just like that.

251
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:35,580
So the two eigenspaces for the
matrix-- where did I write it?

252
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:40,610
I think it was the matrix
1, 2, 3-- 1, 2, 4, 3.

253
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:45,280
The two eigenvalues were
5 and minus 1.

254
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,220
And then it has an infinite
number of eigenvectors, so

255
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,890
they actually create
two eigenspaces.

256
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:54,040
Each of them correspond to
one of the eigenvalues.

257
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,270
And these lines represent
those two eigenspaces.

258
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,480
You give me any vector in
either of these sets and

259
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,360
they're going to be
an eigenvector.

260
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,520
I'm using the word
vector too much.

261
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,590
You give me any vector in either
of these sets, and they

262
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:08,420
will be an eigenvector
for our matrix A.

263
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,520
And then, depending on which
line it is, we know what their

264
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,810
transformation is going to be.

265
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,930
If it's going to be on
this guy, we take the

266
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,060
transformation, the resulting
vector's going to be five

267
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,620
times the vector.

268
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,510
If you take one of these
eigenvectors and you transform

269
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,920
it, the resulting transformation
of the vector's

270
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,550
going to be minus 1
times that vector.

271
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,900
Anyway, we now know what
eigenvalues, eigenvectors,

272
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,010
eigenspaces are.

273
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:33,560
And even better, we know how
to actually find them.

274
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:33,806
