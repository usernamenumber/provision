1
00:00:00,592 --> 00:00:07,896
Let's see if we can add 9.087 to 15.31.

2
00:00:07,896 --> 00:00:11,341
And I encourage you to pause the video and try to do it on your own.

3
00:00:12,687 --> 00:00:15,232
So I'm assuming you have tried to do it on your own.

4
00:00:15,247 --> 00:00:17,753
And now let's see how we could actually tackle this.

5
00:00:18,174 --> 00:00:19,673
Now one thing I want to point out.

6
00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:22,772
Some of you all might see these numbers all lined up, and immediately want to say,

7
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:25,139
"Hey. 7 + 1 is 8.

8
00:00:25,139 --> 00:00:26,348
And 8 + 3 is 11.

9
00:00:26,395 --> 00:00:28,156
Carry the 1, etc., etc."

10
00:00:28,156 --> 00:00:31,692
And if you did that, you would be making a mistake.

11
00:00:32,063 --> 00:00:34,878
Because, you see, right over here, these decimals aren't lined up.

12
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:39,681
Here, if you did that, you'd be adding the 7 thousandths to 1hundredths.

13
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:43,126
You'd be adding 0 tenths to 5 ones.

14
00:00:43,287 --> 00:00:48,254
You'd be adding 9 to 1 tens, because essentially, this is a 10 right over here.

15
00:00:48,254 --> 00:00:51,292
So the places would be all mixed up.

16
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:57,160
So what you need to do is to actually align the decimals so that your place values are aligned.

17
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,321
So what you want to do is you want to align things up.

18
00:01:00,321 --> 00:01:04,929
So we could write 9.087.

19
00:01:04,929 --> 00:01:06,845
And then we want to align the decimals.

20
00:01:06,845 --> 00:01:07,794
So let's align the decimals.

21
00:01:07,794 --> 00:01:09,856
This is what has to match up.

22
00:01:09,856 --> 00:01:13,694
And this is going to be 15.31.

23
00:01:13,694 --> 00:01:13,918
   

24
00:01:13,918 --> 00:01:16,205
And this should hopefully make sense to you, as well.

25
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:20,292
This is 9.<something> + 15.<something>.

26
00:01:20,323 --> 00:01:26,613
So is going to be – if you add 9.<something>. to 15.<something>., you get will be 24.<something>, give or take a little bit.

27
00:01:26,613 --> 00:01:29,860
So now you see that here.Here you have a 9 plus 15.

28
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,956
You have lined up the appropriate place values.

29
00:01:31,956 --> 00:01:34,931
And now we are ready to add.

30
00:01:34,931 --> 00:01:43,464
It's a good idea to start with the smallest place value, so if you have any extra at a certain place, you can bring into some you can bring something into the next place value.

31
00:01:43,464 --> 00:01:45,612
So here you say 7 –

32
00:01:45,612 --> 00:01:47,078
This is 7 thousandths.

33
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:48,884
This is in the thousandths place.

34
00:01:48,884 --> 00:01:50,587
And you might say, "What do I add it to?

35
00:01:50,587 --> 00:01:52,319
There are no thousandths right over here."

36
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,100
And you're right.

37
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,034
There are no thousandths.

38
00:01:54,034 --> 00:01:56,261
So we could rewrite that as 0 thousandths.

39
00:01:56,261 --> 00:02:00,484
So 7 thousandths + 0 thousandths is 7 thousandths.

40
00:02:00,484 --> 00:02:05,616
8 hundredths + 1 hundredth is 9 hundredths.

41
00:02:05,616 --> 00:02:11,164
0 + 0 tenths + 3 tenths is 3 tenths.

42
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,019
We got our decimal.

43
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:18,131
Then you have 9 ones + 5 ones is 14 ones.

44
00:02:18,131 --> 00:02:23,462
Well 14 ones is the same thing as 4 ones and 1 tens.

45
00:02:23,462 --> 00:02:25,948
So we'll carry that 1 right over there.

46
00:02:25,948 --> 00:02:30,212
This is just 1 ten + 4 ones which is 14.

47
00:02:30,212 --> 00:02:34,465
And so finally we have 1 ten plus another ten is 2 .

48
00:02:34,465 --> 00:02:39,369
So we get 24.397.
