1
00:00:00,069 --> 00:00:04,528
We could have a debate about what the most interesting cell in the human body is

2
00:00:04,697 --> 00:00:08,878
but I think easily the neuron would make the top five,

3
00:00:09,002 --> 00:00:12,302
and it's not just because the cell itself is interesting.

4
00:00:12,318 --> 00:00:14,640
The fact that it essentially makes up our brain and our

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,420
nervous system and is responsible for the thoughts

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,810
and our feelings and maybe for all of our sentience,

7
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:24,625
I think, would easily make it the top one or two cells.

8
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,520
So what I want to do is first
to show you what a neuron looks like.

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,290
And, of course, this is kind of the perfect example.

10
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,670
This isn't what all neurons look like.

11
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,350
And then we're going to talk a little bit about how it

12
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:37,769
performs its function, which is
essentially communication,

13
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:40,760
essentially transmitting signals across its length,

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,400
depending on the signals it receives.

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,101
So if I were to draw a neuron-- let me pick a better color.

16
00:00:51,042 --> 00:00:52,060
So let's say I have a neuron.

17
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,120
It looks something like this.

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,272
So in the middle you have your
soma and then from the soma--

19
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,850
let me draw the nucleus.

20
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,390
This is a nucleus, just like any cell's nucleus.

21
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,190
And then the soma's considered the body of the neuron and

22
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:10,383
then the neuron has these little things sticking out from it

23
00:01:10,383 --> 00:01:13,680
that keep branching off.

24
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,080
Maybe they look something like this.

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,910
I don't want to spend too much
time just drawing the neuron,

26
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:23,700
but you've probably seen drawings like this before.

27
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,810
And these branches off of the
soma of the neuron, off of its body,

28
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,010
these are called dendrites.

29
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,455
They can keep splitting off like that.

30
00:01:34,455 --> 00:01:36,990
I want to do a fairly reasonable drawing

31
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,040
so I'll spend a little time doing that.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,140
So these right here, these are dendrites.

33
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,423
And these tend to be-- and nothing is always the case in biology.

34
00:01:50,515 --> 00:01:53,160
Sometimes different parts of different 
cells perform other functions,

35
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,863
but these tend to be where the neuron receives its signal.

36
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,220
And we'll talk more about what it means to receive and

37
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:05,032
transmit a signal in this video and probably in the next few

38
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:09,630
So this is where it receives the signal.

39
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,160
So this is the dendrite.

40
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,322
This right here is the soma. Soma means body.

41
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,130
This is the body of the neuron.

42
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:22,569
And then we have kind of a-- you can almost view it as a tail of the neuron.

43
00:02:22,723 --> 00:02:24,254
It's called the axon.

44
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,880
A neuron can be a reasonably normal sized cell, although

45
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,820
there is a huge range, but the axons can be quite long.

46
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,870
They could be short.

47
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,520
Sometimes in the brain you might have very small axons,

48
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,610
but you might have axons that go down the spinal column or

49
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,190
that go along one of your limbs-- or if you're talking

50
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,240
about one of a dinosaur's limbs.

51
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,190
So the axon can actually stretch several feet.

52
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,160
Not all neurons' axons are several feet,

53
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,150
but they could be.

54
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:55,037
And this is really where a lot of the distance of the signal gets traveled.

55
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,190
Let me draw the axon.

56
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,620
So the axon will look something like this.

57
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,803
And at the end, it ends at the axon terminal

58
00:03:06,126 --> 00:03:11,606
where it can connect to other dendrites or maybe to other types of tissue or muscle

59
00:03:11,698 --> 00:03:14,882
if the point of this neuron is to tell a muscle to do something.

60
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:19,533
So at the end of the axon, you have the axon terminal right there.

61
00:03:19,778 --> 00:03:22,170
I'll do my best to draw it like that.

62
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:22,830
Let me label it.

63
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,270
So this is the axon.

64
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,545
This is the axon terminal.

65
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,890
And you'll sometimes hear the word--

66
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:36,590
the point at which the soma or the body of the neuron connects to the axon

67
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,369
is as often referred to as the axon hillock--

68
00:03:39,446 --> 00:03:41,254
maybe you can kind of view it as kind of a lump.

69
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:46,631
It starts to form the axon. So it's the axon hillock

70
00:03:47,082 --> 00:03:54,610
And then we're going to talk about how the impulses travel.

71
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,970
And a huge part in what allows them to travel efficiently are

72
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:04,235
these insulating cells around the axon.

73
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,520
We're going to talk about this in detail

74
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,507
and how they actually work, but it's good just to have the anatomical structure first.

75
00:04:10,507 --> 00:04:17,158
So these are called Schwann cells and

76
00:04:17,643 --> 00:04:20,450
they're covering-- they make up the myelin sheath.

77
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:24,225
So this covering, this insulation, at different intervals around the axon,

78
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,710
this is called the myelin sheath.

79
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,540
So Schwann cells make up the myelin sheath.

80
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,287
I'll do one more just like that.

81
00:04:32,378 --> 00:04:40,472
So I'll say Schwann cells or myelin Sheath

82
00:04:40,687 --> 00:04:42,780
And then these little spaces between the myelin sheath--

83
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,390
just so we have all of the terminology from

84
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,896
-- so we know the entire anatomy of the neuron--

85
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:56,008
these are called the nodes of Ranvier.

86
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,950
I guess they're named after Ranvier.

87
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,910
Maybe he was the guy who looked and saw

88
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,810
they had these little slots here where you don't have myelin sheath.

89
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,280
So these are the nodes of Ranvier.

90
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,503
So the general idea, as I mentioned, is that you get a signal here.

91
00:05:09,626 --> 00:05:11,295
We're going to talk more about
what the signal means-- and

92
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,890
then that signal gets-- actually, the signals can be summed

93
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,580
so you might have one
little signal right there,

94
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,727
another signal right there, and then you'll have maybe

95
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:21,487
a larger signal there and there--

96
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:26,072
and that the combined effects of these signals get
summed up

97
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:30,430
and they travel to the hillock and if they're a
large enough,

98
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,571
they're going to trigger an action potential on
the axon,

99
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:38,111
which will cause a signal to travel down the
balance of the axon

100
00:05:38,111 --> 00:05:44,335
and then over here it might be connected
via synapses to other dendrites or muscles

101
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,190
And we'll talk more about synapses and those might help trigger other things.

102
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,770
So you're saying, what's triggering these things here?

103
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:56,492
Well, this could be the terminal end of other neurons' axons like in the brain.

104
00:05:56,685 --> 00:05:58,910
This could be some type of sensory neuron.

105
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,490
This could be on a taste bud someplace, so a salt molecule

106
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:07,772
somehow can trigger it or a sugar molecule
-- or this might be some type of stress sensor.

107
00:06:07,772 --> 00:06:09,110
It could be a whole bunch of different things

108
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:14,515
and we'll talk more about the different types of neurons.
