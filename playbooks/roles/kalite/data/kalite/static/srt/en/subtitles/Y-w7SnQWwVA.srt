1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
Bitcoin is a new virtual currency system

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,700
that's been gathering a lot of attention recently

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,890
I thought I would do a series of videos where I,

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,060
where we dive into the innards of Bitcoin &amp; explain

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,680
how it works in detail

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,030
&amp; my plan for this first video in this series,

7
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,490
is descibe some of those mechanics at a high level

8
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,080
&amp; what I'll do in subsequent videos is

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,000
dive a bit deeper into all the underlying aspects that I've touched upon

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,360
within this 1st video

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,720
&amp; my hope is that by the end of this video series, you'll know

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,410
not only what a Bitcoin is, but you also understand the mechanics of how

13
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,010
of how transactions are initiated, you'll see how

14
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,250
verification occurs in those transactions, &amp; you'll also learn

15
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:45,050
what it means for someone to really engage in a process known as Bitcoin mining

16
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:49,240
that maybe a term that you've heard, if you've had any interest in Bitcoin recently

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:54,710
I do wanna point out also, that the Bitcoin scheme is fairly involved, it requires

18
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,850
some time to really cover all the relevant details, and

19
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:03,430
to me the best way to really wrap your head around a scheme like Bitcoin is to

20
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,250
to really suspend belief for a bit &amp; get exposed

21
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,250
to all these relevant details

22
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,420
now definitely you have a lot of questions along the way

23
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,970
but my hope is that by the end of this video series

24
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:18,860
all the relevant stones will have been overturned &amp; your questions will have been properly answered

25
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,090
but it might take some time to get there

26
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,970
okay, &amp; partly that's because I try to describe things in a way that's sensible, &amp; that might

27
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,400
involve leaving some details out

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,540
until I can explain enough

29
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,810
pieces of the scheme &amp; then adding those details in as I go along

30
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,640
so that you're not inundated by too many

31
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,200
minor points &amp; nuances along the way

32
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,540
but you get a view of the overall system as I go through things

33
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,620
so with that, let me go ahead &amp; just dive right in, &amp; first of all I do want to point out that Bitcoin

34
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,550
has been described, really, a decentralized

35
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:54,260
currency, because there's no real central bank or entity

36
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,840
that's involved in generating / transacting Bitcoins

37
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,350
&amp; in fact what happens in the context of Bitcoin, is that all the transactions really

38
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:06,840
require what's known as peer-to-peer network, a network of just individual hosts

39
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,260
that essentially, collectively agree on different aspects of how the protocol

40
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,150
is implemented &amp; used

41
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:19,150
okay, Bitcoin itself is also referred to sometimes as a crypto currency

42
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,080
&amp; by crypto currency, I mean that, we use a lot of cryptographic techniques

43
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,740
in order to facilitate / to really enable

44
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,610
Bitcoin transactions to take place

45
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,890
And I'll do separate videos on some of these techniques

46
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:35,290
but just take it at face value right now that it's decentralized &amp; it's a type of crypto currency

47
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,800
now I also wanna point out that the term Bitcoin itself can, in fact be

48
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,980
a bit confusing, &amp; in many ways, Bitcoin transactions don't really

49
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:51,720
resemble traditional coin transactions so much as they represent entries in some type of a global ledger

50
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,140
&amp; by that I mean, let's say you have

51
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:59,530
a transaction taking place, let's say the transaction is taking place within

52
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,520
among 2 parties, we'll call them Alice &amp; Bob

53
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:08,800
which are traditional names that are used in many cryptographic protocols to describe the parties involved

54
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,840
&amp; imagine that Alice wants to transfer / assign

55
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,770
a certain number of Bitcoins she possesses over to Bob, okay

56
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,820
&amp; you can think of this transaction really, as an entry

57
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,340
in a ledger, of some sort

58
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,630
okay, &amp; I also wanna point out before proceeding that even though I

59
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,630
used terms like Alice &amp; Bob

60
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:35,310
what it really means in the context of Bitcoin is, it's not the actual identities

61
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,730
in the physical sense, but really that

62
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:42,890
Alice &amp; Bob's identities in the Bitcoin system, &amp; these identities are just

63
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,740
in actual implementation, are just collections of numbers

64
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,220
that do not have to be tied

65
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,550
with Alice &amp; Bob's real world identities

66
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:58,760
so in that capacity, you can think of Bitcoin identities, really, as effectively being pseudonyms

67
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,770
rather than real names

68
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:04,650
And the idea is that Bitcoin then becomes more of a pseudo anonymous protocol, where

69
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,960
people are addressed by their pseudonyms &amp; that provides some level of privacy

70
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,420
to users who wanna transact using the Bitcoin system

71
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:17,170
now in a transaction between Alice &amp; Bob, what Alice will basically do is

72
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,700
specify a few different numbers

73
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,780
she has to specify how many Bitcoins she wants to allocate to Bob.

74
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,280
Let's say Alice started off with 50 Bitcoins of her own

75
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,860
She might decide she wants to give, let's say 30 of these Bitcoins over to Bob

76
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:35,510
&amp; let's say she wants to have some number of Bitcoins returned back to her

77
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,080
Alice has to specify

78
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,570
how much changes she's gonna get

79
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,900
So in this case, let's say her change is gonna be 18 Bitcoins for herself

80
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,850
&amp; the remaining 2 Bitcoins are going to be

81
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,570
a transaction fee

82
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,780
&amp; we'll talk about what a transaction fee means

83
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,290
a little later, &amp; I think I'll also dive into future videos

84
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,290
but it's basically an incentive for

85
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,020
other nodes in the Bitcoin network to help Alice

86
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,760
in, essentially, validating some of the details of this transaction for Bob

87
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:08,500
now Alice will take these transaction details &amp; apply

88
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,980
what's known as a digital signature

89
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,900
to this transaction details. A digital signature is basically the

90
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,690
mathematical analog of traditional signatures. It, really, binds

91
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,980
Alice's identity to the details

92
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,050
of this transaction.

93
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,520
And by Alice's identity, again, I mean her identity within the Bitcoin system

94
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,980
And this binding is really done in a cryptographically strong way

95
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:35,320
Now the details of this transaction, once it takes place

96
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,890
are going to be broadcasted out. Alice's is gonna take these transaction details &amp; effectively just broadcast them out

97
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,790
to all the nodes

98
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,960
in the peer-to-peer network

99
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,810
that represent Bitcoin nodes

100
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,570
Now Bob, when he receives information

101
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,800
about this transaction, he receives it over the peer-to-peer network,

102
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,520
he'll probably check (?) some part of the transaction, for example,

103
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,680
he might check, that the numbers were ??? correctly. That Alice, let's say started out with fifty

104
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,650
Bitcoins, &amp; she's not trying (?) to transfer more than 50 Bitcoins to him &amp; so on &amp; so forth

105
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:11,370
he's gonna have some mathematical assurance, because of some of the cryptography involved

106
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,530
that, some of these claims are accurate, that Alice

107
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:17,540
let's Alice has the Bitcoins that she claims to possess

108
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,800
&amp; that she expressed interest to

109
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,480
assign those Bitcoins to him

110
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,280
but what he won't know yet, is whether Alice has, really,

111
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,600
tried to transfer those same Bitcoins to anyone else

112
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,910
over the course of time, or maybe just prior to that point

113
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,960
And the way we handle that situation, &amp; by the way I should point out that,

114
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,190
this concept of Alice trying to let's say spend

115
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,330
coins twice, in the context of digital cash

116
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,200
&amp; electronic currency systems

117
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,780
this concept is known as

118
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,280
as "double spending", &amp; it's something you have to worry about

119
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,860
when you have virtual currencies, because it's very easy for someone to just copy

120
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,770
the numbers that represent this transaction &amp; try to

121
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,300
use them elsewhere

122
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,210
And the way we basically handle &amp; reduce the risk of double spending

123
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,520
is through a specific set of nodes

124
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,200
in this peer-to-peer network

125
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,340
who are known as Bitcoin miners

126
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,540
okay, so you might have heard of this term, Bitcoin miners, &amp; the Bitcoin miners are basically

127
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:17,200
specific individuals / specific nodes within this peer-to-peer network

128
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,200
what they basically do is they take

129
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,570
all the transactions they see &amp;

130
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:26,650
remember they're listening (?) to all these transactions, not just Alice &amp; Bob's, but other transactions that are taking place

131
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:31,040
&amp; they take those transactions &amp; ultimately they will take those transactions &amp; compile them

132
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,950
into what's known as a "transaction block"

133
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,780
okay, so it's basically a recording of all the

134
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,630
the previously unrecorded transactions

135
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:44,210
so if you think of a single transaction, let's say, as a ledger item

136
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:49,300
you could think of a transaction block, as representing, let's say, entire page in a ledger book

137
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,920
&amp; these Bitcoin miners will also include in this block

138
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,800
in addition to all these unrecorded transactions, they will also include in this block

139
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:03,110
a special transaction that's meant just for themselves, to basically reward themselves

140
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,820
for the effort of doing this mining

141
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,820
now transaction block will also contain an encoding of the previous transaction block

142
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,310
okay, so there's gonna be some level of continuity

143
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:19,330
&amp; then Bitcoin miners will also include a specially crafted sequence of numbers

144
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:23,100
associated with this transaction, &amp; these sequence of numbers

145
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,420
is known as a "proof of work"

146
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,170
??? called a proof of work because it's something that's really hard to generate

147
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,720
something that requires a lot of effort.

148
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,840
To do that kind of makes it hard for just anybody to get involved with Bitcoin mining willy nilly

149
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,380
but it requires that they really exhibit / exert some computational efforts

150
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,940
basically in exchange for getting this extra reward of payment

151
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:51,340
&amp; also in exchange for getting this transaction fee they're gonna be (?) promised by Alice

152
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,230
to engage in this sort of work

153
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:57,700
And I'll talk about what a proof of work protocols are in a separate video in more detail

154
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:02,020
Now, because each transaction block contains information about

155
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,790
previous transaction,

156
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,950
really what you end up having is not just

157
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:09,590
a single block, you ultimately have what you can think of as a chain

158
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:14,260
of transactions. And you can call this a "transaction block chain"

159
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,410
And the idea is that as soon as a Bitcoin miner

160
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:23,200
is able to construct a transaction block chain containing all these unrecorded transactions &amp; these proof of works

161
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,500
it will broadcast the details

162
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,650
of that chain out to all the nodes

163
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:32,480
all the peers on that peer-to-peer network for Bitcoin

164
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,480
And then once

165
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,690
the newly broadcasted chain gets verified / meets certain properties, the nodes on the network

166
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:44,750
are just gonna go ahead &amp; start using it. And the nodes are (?) appending new transaction blocks

167
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,780
to that chain

168
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,200
they're gonna take anything (?) that hasn't yet been processed &amp; start

169
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,430
incorporate it into the transaction chain that was

170
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:56,520
broadcasted out by the node who came up with the proof of work correctly

171
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,970
now this transaction block chain, really,

172
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,890
what we're gonna be doing in the context of Bitcoin is

173
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,720
the nodes are only going to consider

174
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,770
the transaction block chain that reflects the greatest amount of work

175
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,960
??? contents

176
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,210
And again, there is this proof of work that I mention that

177
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,450
is used to kind of

178
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,650
determine / identify what the

179
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:20,180
what work goes (?) involved in coming up with this transaction block chain

180
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,880
&amp; the one that's the longest is going to be considered sacrosant within the Bitcoin system

181
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,230
And future miners are supposed to only work off the chain that has the most work put into it

182
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,540
Now what's remarkable here

183
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,920
is that this whole process is decentralized. There's no bank or no

184
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,730
centrally trusted entity that was actually involved in the transaction

185
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:44,970
so hopefully this first video gives you a bit of description, a flavor if you will,

186
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,620
for the high level mechanics of the Bitcoin system

187
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,850
there are a lot of stones I have left unturned &amp; what I'll do in subsequent videos is

188
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,680
start covering those details &amp; I'm sure you have a lot of questions. But hopefully the

189
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,310
the future videos will help answer some of those questions for you
