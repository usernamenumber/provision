1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,730
   

2
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,310
In the last video we saw a
method of figuring out what

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:06,590
the basis for column space is.

4
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,260
And we use these
exact examples.

5
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,960
Whereas this was matrix A, I
just took it and I put it in

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,610
reduced row echelon form.

7
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,920
And I figured out which of these
columns in my reduced

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,330
row echelon form of A,
are pivot columns.

9
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,490
And it turned out to be the
first one, the second one, and

10
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:22,430
the fourth one.

11
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,510
And then the method is, you say
look, the corresponding

12
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,940
columns in A-- so the first one,
the second one, and the

13
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,550
fourth one-- form my basis
for my column space.

14
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,430
And since they form the basis,
and if you want to know the

15
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,000
dimension of your basis of your
column space, which is

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,020
also called the rank,
you just say, well

17
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,230
there's three in there.

18
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,890
So it has a rank of
one, two, three.

19
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,350
In this video I want to discuss
a little bit about why

20
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:45,890
this worked.

21
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,370
Why were we able to just take
the corresponding columns?

22
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,360
Why did linear independence of
these three guys, imply linear

23
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,060
independence of these
three guys?

24
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,420
Why was the fact that I can
represent these guys-- this

25
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,040
guy right here as a linear
combination of these three, or

26
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,930
this guy as a linear combination
of these three--

27
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:06,430
why does that imply that I can
construct this guy as a linear

28
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,790
combination of my
basis vectors?

29
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,270
So the first thing that wasn't
too much of a stretch of the

30
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,380
imagination in the last video,
was the idea that these pivot

31
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,650
vectors are linearly
independent.

32
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,980
So r1, r2, and r4.

33
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,960
And everything I'm doing, I'm
kind of applying to the

34
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,420
special case just so that it's
easier to understand.

35
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,630
But it should be
generalizable.

36
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,950
In fact, it definitely
is generalizable.

37
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,330
That all of the pivot columns
in reduced row echelon form

38
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,500
are linearly independent.

39
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,700
And that's because the very
nature of reduced row echelon

40
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:46,040
form, is that you are the only
pivot column that has a 1 in

41
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,580
that respective row.

42
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,420
So the only way to construct
it is with that vector.

43
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,140
You can't construct it with
the other pivot columns

44
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,420
because they're all going
to have 0 in that row.

45
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,560
And when I say it's linearly
independent, I'm just saying

46
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,000
the set of pivot columns.

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,770
So let me say this in general.

48
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:12,940
The set of pivot columns for any
reduced row echelon form

49
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,150
matrix is linearly
independent.

50
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,000
And it's just a very
straightforward argument.

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,380
Because each column is
going to have a 1 in

52
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,170
a very unique place.

53
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,630
All of the other pivot columns
are going to have a 0 in that

54
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,110
same place.

55
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,290
And so you can't take any linear
combinations to get to

56
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,410
that 1 because 0 times anything,
minus or plus 0

57
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,540
times anything, can never
be equal to 1.

58
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,560
So I think you can
accept that.

59
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:48,250
Now, that means that the
solution to c1 times r1, plus

60
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:55,610
c2 times r2, plus, let
me say, c4 times r4.

61
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,500
The solution to this equation,
because these guys are

62
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,680
linearly independent, we know
that this only has one

63
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:07,200
solution, and that's c1, c2,
and c4 is equal to 0.

64
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,840
That's the only solution
to that.

65
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,690
So another way we could say it
is, if we write r times some

66
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:18,200
vector x-- well I'll just write
it times this particular

67
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:26,680
x-- where I write it as
c1, c2, 0, c4, and

68
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,460
0 is equal to 0.

69
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,800
So this will be some special
member of your null space.

70
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,210
It's a particular solution
to the equation.

71
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:39,830
This is equal to one, two,
three, four 0's because we

72
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,430
have four rows here.

73
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,270
Now, if we just expand
this out.

74
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:51,410
If we just multiply 1 times c1,
plus 0 times c2, minus 1

75
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:56,870
times 0, plus 4 times 0, you'll
get-- or actually a

76
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,770
better way to explain it-- this
multiplication right here

77
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:04,120
can be written as-- and we've
seen this multiple times-- c1

78
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:13,460
times r1, plus c2 times
r2, plus 0 times r3.

79
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:19,589
So we could just ignore that
term, plus c4, c4 times r4,

80
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:23,450
plus 0 times r5.

81
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,850
That's r5 right there.

82
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,740
All of that equal to 0.

83
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,360
So the only solution to this,
because we know that these

84
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,200
three columns are linearly
independent-- or the set of

85
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,690
just those three columns, those
three pivot columns are

86
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,050
linearly independent-- the only
solution here is all of

87
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:38,720
these equal to 0.

88
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,120
That's exactly what I
said right up here.

89
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,870
So the only solution here, where
if these two are 0, is

90
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:49,110
that these guys also all have
to equal 0, if I already

91
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,670
constrain these two.

92
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,460
Now, the one thing that we've
done over and over again, we

93
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,790
know that the solution set of
this equation, the solution

94
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:03,310
set of Rx is equal to 0, is the
same as the solution set

95
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,870
of Ax is equal to 0.

96
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,740
Now, how do we know that?

97
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,820
Or what do I mean?

98
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,640
Well the solution set of this
is just the null space.

99
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,850
The solution set is just
the null space of r.

100
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,590
It's all of x's that satisfy
this equation.

101
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:22,160
And we know that is equal to the
null space of a, because r

102
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,550
is just a in reduced
row echelon form.

103
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,240
So this is the null space of
a, is all of the x's that

104
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,040
satisfy this equation.

105
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,550
Now, the only version of this
that satisfied this equation

106
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,440
was when c1, c2, and
c4 are equal to 0.

107
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:48,380
So that tells us that the only
version of this, c1, c2, 0,

108
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:55,180
c4, 0, that satisfies this
equation, or this equation, is

109
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,240
when c1, c2, and c4
is equal to 0.

110
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,390
Or another way of saying that
it if this is vector a1, a2,

111
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:07,780
a4 right here, if you multiply
this out, you get c1-- let me

112
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:16,760
do it over here, let me do it in
blue-- you get c1 times a1

113
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:28,040
plus c2 times a2, and then 0
times a3, plus c4 times a4 is

114
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,200
equal to 0.

115
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,820
Now these guys are going to be
linearly independent, if and

116
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:37,640
only if the only solution to
this equation is they all

117
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,930
equal to 0.

118
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,150
Well we know that the only
solution to this is that they

119
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,670
all equal 0 because anything
that's a solution to this is a

120
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,850
solution to this.

121
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:50,220
And the only solution to this
was, if I go ahead and I

122
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,030
constrain these two terms to
being equal to 0, the only

123
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:56,320
solution to this is all of
these c's have to be 0.

124
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,580
So likewise, if I constrain
these to be 0, the only

125
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:04,120
solution to this is that c1,
c2, and c4 have to be 0.

126
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:09,500
So those guys have to be 0,
which imply that these three

127
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:16,580
vectors, a1, a2, and a4, so that
implies that the set a1,

128
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:22,950
a2, and a4 are linearly
independent.

129
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,920
So we're halfway there.

130
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,970
We've shown that because the
pivot columns here are

131
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,240
linearly independent.

132
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,900
We can show and they have
the same solution set.

133
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,410
The null space of the reduced
row echelon form is the same

134
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,510
as the null space of our
original matrix.

135
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,920
We were able to show that the
only solution to c1 times this

136
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,240
plus c2 times this plus c4 times
this is when all the

137
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,970
constants are 0, which shows
that these three vectors or a

138
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,740
set of those three vectors
are definitely linearly

139
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,900
independent.

140
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,520
Now, the next thing to prove
that they are a basis, is to

141
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,990
show that all of the other
column vectors can be

142
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,420
represented as multiples
of these three guys.

143
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:07,440
And I realize, just for the sake
of clarity, or maybe not

144
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,340
boring you too much, I'll do
that in the next video.

145
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:13,100
So in this one we saw that if
the pivot columns are linearly

146
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,330
independent, they always are.

147
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,560
All pivot columns, by definition
are linearly

148
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:16,830
independent.

149
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,500
Or the set of pivot columns
are always linearly

150
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,520
independent when you take away
the non-pivot columns, then

151
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,000
the corresponding columns in
your original vector are also

152
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,910
linearly independent.
