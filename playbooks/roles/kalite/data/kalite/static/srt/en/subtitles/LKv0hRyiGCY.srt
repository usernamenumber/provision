1
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
ine of the great renessaince spaces

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
is the Pazzi chapel of Santa Croce

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and we are sitting in it, and we're sitting on a bench that lines the wall

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
because this was originally used as a chapter house

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
meaning a meeting room for the monks of Santa Croce

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so the would have sat right were we're sitting

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
just of the cloister

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
which is the traditional place for the chapter house, so we're really looking at

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
something that is true really renesaince

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
work of architecture by Brunelleschi although it was completed after

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
his death and we see all of these

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
That we come to expect if burleneschi these of petra serena

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
green, stone that articulates the

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
elements on the wall but it also articulates the walls themselves

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and the dominance of the perfect geometry

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so we immediately have sense of rectangles and squares

17
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and circles and semicircles but

18
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
my overwhelming feeling of walking here was that

19
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
into an ancient Roman tample

20
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
a so thisi is very close to a central planned space

21
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
it's something like the Pantheon and there is

22
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
intenion to the kind of perfect geometry

23
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and centrality that we realy do associate with the ancient world so I think you're right

24
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
I think he's been woring very hard to create these

25
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
classicism this revival of the

26
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
ideas os ancient world, lovely

27
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
pluted philaters long walls and the hemispherical

28
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
dome with oculars in the centre and windows

29
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
piercing it sides of this really lovely

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
light taht comes into the chapel, the dome on pendentives and

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
inpendentive triangular spaces

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
that the dome rests on

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
we see roundels, terracotta and

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
this what have been made by Luca de la Robbia who has recently

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
perfected the ability to fire to the high temperature

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
what he used what we consider modern glazes

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
raly is the sesne of a centrally planned space
