00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:15,140
What I want to do in this video is think a little bit about the estate tax.

2
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,934
and as the name of the tax implies

3
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:19,395
it is a tax on someone's estate.

4
00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:21,730
Or when someone passes away;

5
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,827
it is a tax on what they want to leave behind,

6
00:00:24,827 --> 00:00:27,165
to... whoever they want to leave it to.

7
00:00:27,165 --> 00:00:28,959
Either in their will, or in their family,

8
00:00:28,959 --> 00:00:30,678
or whoever they want to leave their stuff to.

9
00:00:30,678 --> 00:00:36,643
Sometimes it's referred to as an inheritance tax.

10
00:00:36,643 --> 00:00:40,499
and sometimes, you'll hear them talk this way on the news,

11
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:42,292
maybe it's a little bit derisive,

12
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:46,935
it's called a death tax.

13
00:00:46,935 --> 00:00:51,813
The general idea, lets say that right now my entire net-worth...

14
00:00:51,813 --> 00:00:56,912
I am worth $3 million.

15
00:00:56,912 --> 00:01:03,272
and then I pass away. So this $3 million goes into my estate.

16
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:06,166
So this is my estate.

17
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,444
And so this $3 million could be all of my savings,

18
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:09,798
could be my stock portfolio,

19
00:01:09,798 --> 00:01:11,725
could be the value of my land, my real-estate,

20
00:01:11,725 --> 00:01:13,492
every thing I own, my car...

21
00:01:13,492 --> 00:01:15,126
Everything combined is worth $3 million

22
00:01:15,126 --> 00:01:18,844
it goes into my estate after I pass.

23
00:01:18,844 --> 00:01:24,876
Lets say I leave everything in my estate to my daughter.

24
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:27,963
So I leave it to my daughter.

25
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:32,426
It's at this point that the estate tax comes into question;

26
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:35,054
Of how much money will my daughter get?

27
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:38,766
It turns out for $3 million, my daughter is exempt.

28
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:45,856
For inheritance from and individual the first $5 million are exempt.

29
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:50,318
So in this situation where I'm leaving $3 million for my daughter,

30
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:56,366
she actually will get the entire $3 million.

31
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,296
Lets say I'm even richer then that,

32
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,663
lets say that i have $6 million.

33
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,499
So lets say that the scenario where I have $6 million,

34
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:07,169
it all goes into my estate...

35
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,832
It all goes into the estate after my death.

36
00:02:09,832 --> 00:02:13,508
And now the first $5 million is exempt.

37
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:17,189
So let me write my daughter over here.

38
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:23,082
So my daughter will get the first $5 million tax free.

39
00:02:23,082 --> 00:02:26,605
And then the increment above that exemption,

40
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:29,566
the increment above what has been excluded,

41
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,936
will then be taxed at a certain rate.

42
00:02:31,936 --> 00:02:34,174
And that rate is constantly changing

43
00:02:34,174 --> 00:02:37,505
but for the sake of simplicity I'm going with the rate of 35%,

44
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:40,596
and that's the rate in 2011.

45
00:02:40,596 --> 00:02:49,428
So the rest of the $1 million is taxed at 35%.

46
00:02:49,428 --> 00:02:53,382
So the federal government will tax 35% of the $1 million.

47
00:02:53,382 --> 00:03:00,717
So they will essentially take $350 thousand for themselves,

48
00:03:00,717 --> 00:03:04,992
and my daughter will be left with $5,650,000.

49
00:03:04,992 --> 00:03:06,617
Right, because of this $1 million

50
00:03:06,617 --> 00:03:10,274
you take out $350 thousand and you have $650 thousand left.

51
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:23,125
So my daughter in this situation will be left with $5.65 million,

52
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,434
the federal government took $350 thousand.

53
00:03:25,434 --> 00:03:31,462
If I am super rich. lets say that I am worth...

54
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:32,834
Let me make a number to make the math easy

55
00:03:32,834 --> 00:03:35,061
so that I don't have to get a calculator out.

56
00:03:35,061 --> 00:03:41,733
Lets say that I am worth $1,005,000,000.

57
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:44,085
So this is my net worth.

58
00:03:44,085 --> 00:03:48,437
In this situation the first $5 million will be excluded.

59
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:53,192
So my daughter will get the $5 million...

60
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:55,199
directly, that will be excluded

61
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,490
and that eveything above that will be taxed at 35%.

62
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:09,374
So in this situation you have $1 billion taxed at 35%.

63
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:14,563
So in this scenerio the federal government...

64
00:04:14,563 --> 00:04:20,510
will take $350 million.

65
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,013
And so that will leave of this $1 billion,

66
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:26,350
$650 million left for my daughter.

67
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,772
So in total she would get

68
00:04:27,772 --> 00:04:29,460
this $650 million,

69
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,005
plus the $5 million that was excluded.

70
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:37,034
She would end up with a total of $655 million.

71
00:04:37,034 --> 00:04:40,743
So I wouldn't feel too bad for her, she should be pretty ok.

72
00:04:40,743 --> 00:04:43,075
So that's just how the estate tax works.

73
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:46,422
And these examples I gave of the $5 million that's excluded

74
00:04:46,422 --> 00:04:50,415
this is for an individual... when they pass away.

75
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,161
If it's being done as a couple,

76
00:04:52,161 --> 00:04:54,452
this exemption is actually $10 million.

77
00:04:54,452 --> 00:04:59,549
So if between my wife and I, we have $1,005,000,000

78
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,993
and lets say I pass away, and we own everything collectively,

79
00:05:02,993 --> 00:05:07,260
she actually gets the extra joint exemption passed onto her.

80
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,412
And if and when she passes away this would be $10 million

81
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:13,131
that will be tax free.

82
00:05:13,131 --> 00:05:15,899
So in this scenario, if this is being done as a couple,

83
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:19,276
my daughter would get the entire $6 million.
