1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,069
So where I'd left off in the last video,

2
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:05,600
we had kind of talked about the scenario

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,010
where my buddies and I, we came up with this idea to sell socks online.

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,890
We went to a rich investor we called an angel investor,

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,440
who's usually kind of a rich uncle type of figure

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,230
who gets excited by young guys innovating in the world.

7
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,750
And we say hey, we need $5 million, he says sure enough.

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,603
I think the idea you have, by itself

9
00:00:24,603 --> 00:00:26,730
or maybe some kind of prototype you might have made or something,

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,670
that's worth $5 million.

11
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,775
So I'll give you another $5 million of cash to kind of get started,

12
00:00:32,775 --> 00:00:34,260
rent some space, hire some people.

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,810
And for that, since what you had was $5 million,

14
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,780
that's what you're bringing to the table,

15
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,240
I'm bringing $5 million cash to the table,

16
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,310
I essentially get half the company.

17
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,014
And the way that works is,

18
00:00:44,014 --> 00:00:46,540
it's not like we each gave him half of our shares.

19
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,020
Instead, since we are the board of the company,

20
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,132
we issue another million shares,

21
00:00:52,132 --> 00:00:54,600
so we double the share count and we give it to him.

22
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,970
And this pre-money valuation is really, really important.

23
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:02,520
Because if we had agreed-- if we said this wasn't five million,

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,900
if we said this is, I don't know,

25
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,230
if he is a hard negotiator and he says no,

26
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,700
that's only worth a million dollars.

27
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,220
And I'm going to give $5 million.

28
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,470
So let me ask you, how many shares would we have to issue?

29
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,130
So think about it.

30
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,680
If he was a hard negotiator-- let me draw it down here,

31
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,210
I don't want to mess up the issue-- because our idea--

32
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,550
I mean it really is a hard thing to estimate

33
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,230
what an idea is worth.

34
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,680
So if he negotiates hard,

35
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,070
at the end of the day, we're desperate.

36
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,640
Financial markets have collapsed.

37
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,470
So we'll take money from

38
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,866
whoever is willing to give it to us.

39
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:41,610
And we really want to quit our jobs.

40
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,650
So he says that what we have right now,

41
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,030
our idea is only worth a million dollars.

42
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,050
And he's going to give us $5 million.

43
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,090
So how many shares do we have to give him?

44
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,090
This right here, this is a million shares.

45
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,270
That's what we started off with.

46
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,264
So when he says that what we have right now is worth a million dollars,

47
00:02:01,264 --> 00:02:02,738
he's essentially saying

48
00:02:02,738 --> 00:02:04,990
that it's worth a dollar per share.

49
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,919
So my 200,000 shares are worth $200,000

50
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,560
according to his valuation.

51
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,390
Up here, we said that what we had before was worth $5 million

52
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,520
in the previous video.

53
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,295
If what we had before is worth $5 million

54
00:02:19,295 --> 00:02:24,995
and there were a million shares initially,

55
00:02:24,995 --> 00:02:26,222
then the pre-money valuation

56
00:02:26,222 --> 00:02:29,166
--or actually it's the valuation either pre- or post-money--

57
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:33,602
would be $5 per share.

58
00:02:33,602 --> 00:02:36,641
And in the $5 per share world,

59
00:02:36,641 --> 00:02:39,330
what we did was we issued another million shares

60
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,650
and sold them for $5 million.

61
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,880
Or we sell them for $5 per share to get the $5 million.

62
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,850
And so, we ended up with a 50/50 split of the company.

63
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:53,350
This is the angel investor, and this is all of us down here,

64
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,090
and all of this is equity.

65
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,800
No debt, no liabilities just yet.

66
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,260
Now in this reality, if he's valuing what we have right now

67
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,650
at essentially $1 per share--he says it's worth a million dollars,

68
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,480
you have a million shares, it's $1 per share.

69
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,572
In order for him to give $5 million,

70
00:03:15,572 --> 00:03:20,700
he's essentially going to buy $5 million worth of stock at $1 per share.

71
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:27,978
So he's essentially going to need five million shares.

72
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,612
And notice, in the situation up here-- before,

73
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:40,610
when I have 200,000 shares-- well, when I had 1/5 of $5 million--

74
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,461
when I had 1/5 of $5 million,

75
00:03:43,461 --> 00:03:45,970
the value of my shares was $1 million, right?

76
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:51,590
And then when I have 1/10 of two million shares,

77
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:56,035
I still have 1/10 of $10 million of total asset value,

78
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,630
because now he threw in his $5 million.

79
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,780
And so my share is still worth $1 million.

80
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,640
I have 1/10 of ten million

81
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,240
as opposed to 1/5 of five million.

82
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:11,100
In this situation I used to have 1/5 of one million,

83
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,550
which would be $200,000.

84
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,959
And now I have 200,000 over

85
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,950
--how many total shares are there now?--

86
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,940
there are now six million shares.

87
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:28,800
So now I have 1/60--is that right?

88
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:36,950
I now have 200,000 over six million.

89
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:40,170
That's 6,000 thousands, that cancels out.

90
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,960
I now own 1/30 of the company.

91
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,170
Before I had 1/5.

92
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,160
And we're valuing it at six million

93
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,080
because I have a million here and five million here-- times six million.

94
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,820
And so, what's 1/30 of six million.

95
00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:02,900
6/30 is equal to 1/5 of a million

96
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,550
so this is still $200,000.

97
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,968
So no matter what I do,

98
00:05:08,968 --> 00:05:11,044
between the pre-money and the post-money valuation,

99
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,330
my per share value doesn't change any.

100
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,425
And I wanted to show you that.

101
00:05:14,425 --> 00:05:15,550
But this matters a lot, right?

102
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,780
Because based on what this pre-money valuation is

103
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,790
it tells us how many shares,

104
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,198
or what percentage of the company,

105
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,680
our angel investor gets for investing his $5 million.

106
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,770
In this case he gets 5/6 of the company, what is that?

107
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:35,830
Five times-- that's like 80% of the company.

108
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:39,290
I think, roughly, and we are left with the other

109
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:43,940
-- no, 1/6 is, no it's more than 80%, it's like 84%--

110
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,790
and we're left with, like, 16% of the company.

111
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,899
So it's a very different scenario

112
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:50,190
depending on what our pre-money valuation is.

113
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:53,510
And of course the pre-money valuation is just--

114
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,245
you just take the pre-money valuation

115
00:05:55,245 --> 00:05:56,400
plus the amount of cash they're giving us.

116
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,070
That's post-money valuation, right?

117
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,440
The amount of money you get.

118
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,180
Pre-money and then post-money, you add the money in,

119
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,745
and that's where you get the $6 million valuation.

120
00:06:05,745 --> 00:06:06,753
Fair enough.

121
00:06:06,753 --> 00:06:09,100
I think I've beaten this horse dead now.

122
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,310
I think you have a good sense of it.

123
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,570
Let's say that we end up lucky.

124
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,470
The guy wasn't a hard negotiator

125
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,210
and we ended up with that first situation.

126
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,120
So let me redraw it.

127
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:27,930
So now if I were to draw the assets of this corporation,

128
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:32,450
at least at the time of that guy's investment,

129
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,980
where the very intangible asset, we called it the idea,

130
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,330
now has a value, $5 million.

131
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:44,459
And we have some cash, we have $5 million in cash.

132
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:47,190
And then, if we do the shares

133
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:52,708
--let me do that in another box--

134
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:53,950
there you go, there are the shares.

135
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:59,558
And of that share, we have 2 million shares outstanding.

136
00:06:59,558 --> 00:07:05,012
I have one million to the angel investor,

137
00:07:05,012 --> 00:07:06,640
so he has 50% of the shares.

138
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,340
And just because I like to keep track of my slice,

139
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,650
there's 200,000 shares that go to Sal.

140
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,900
Fair enough.

141
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,170
Now, obviously the whole point of this

142
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,640
wasn't just to negotiate, raise money and quit our jobs.

143
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,070
The whole point of this was to start a business.

144
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,230
So let's say we take this $5 million

145
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,090
and we start hiring people.

146
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:28,170
And really our first step is to build out our website,

147
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,590
and just kind of have a working site going.

148
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,745
So let's say we burn through $4 million of that

149
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:35,760
and we built a site.

150
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,990
So let's say we only have a million dollars left--

151
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,160
this is maybe six months in the future we all quit our jobs.

152
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,550
We got some fancy loft-like office space.

153
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,150
We got a Foosball table.

154
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,870
And we also built a website,

155
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,090
we hired some graphic designers and things.

156
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,480
And so, we burned through most of our cash,

157
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,230
and we're starting to get a little bit worried,

158
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,610
because we haven't made a profit yet.

159
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:04,060
But we have a neat website.

160
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,420
Something that-- when we went to the angel investors

161
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,639
we just had an idea, a business plan,

162
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:12,974
we just had-- hopefully we had our charisma

163
00:08:12,974 --> 00:08:15,648
and we were able to sell the guy on the idea.

164
00:08:15,648 --> 00:08:17,400
He thought we were going to be

165
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,120
the next dominant sock player in the world.

166
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,500
But now we actually built something.

167
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,239
We took his money and,

168
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:23,790
as promised, we built a nice website.

169
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,150
And now, we need to raise more money.

170
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,240
One, because we've hired 50 people.

171
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,640
And this million dollars isn't going to last us too long.

172
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,030
And that would be a shame.

173
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,650
To run out of cash just when we're getting off the ground.

174
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,669
We now actually have a real website

175
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:39,110
and offices and all of that.

176
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,486
And we want to raise some money

177
00:08:41,486 --> 00:08:44,320
because we want to put up some AdWords on Google,

178
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,798
so people know about our site.

179
00:08:45,798 --> 00:08:46,462
We want to spend, you know,

180
00:08:46,462 --> 00:08:49,350
a couple million dollars for a Super Bowl ad,

181
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,620
so people know that they can get socks online now.

182
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,890
So we have to raise more money.

183
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,934
And now at this stage,

184
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,050
we would go back to the venture capital community.

185
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,220
But we wouldn't go to the angels.

186
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,030
The angels are the guys who like the big picture,

187
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,550
who want just to kind of throw some money into an early idea.

188
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,460
It's usually a relatively small amount.

189
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:09,090
Actually, $5 million would be a large amount for an angel.

190
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:13,230
We want to go to kind of real professional VC's now.

191
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,220
And what we would do is we would go to a seed VC.

192
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,580
So seed VCs are kind of the first round.

193
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,560
And each round is kind of,

194
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,030
every time you have to go back to the till to raise money,

195
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,910
that's kind of a round of financing.

196
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,560
But seed investors-- so there's a lot of words for it--

197
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,020
but seed investors are usually VC investors

198
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,620
who are actual professionals at what they do.

199
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,460
They're actually managing other people's money.

200
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,210
And we'll do another video on how they raise that money,

201
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,130
and it's very related to how private equity confirms,

202
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,690
and hedge funds also raise their money.

203
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,901
But they're usually managing other people's money,

204
00:09:46,901 --> 00:09:49,860
while an angel investor is usually, you know,

205
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,610
he's just sitting on top of a big pile of money and likes to play with it.

206
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,390
So they're managing other people's money,

207
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,540
and they tend to have some fancy MBAs that they just hired,

208
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,098
who will make models and do projections,

209
00:10:00,098 --> 00:10:02,028
and negotiate a little bit harder with you

210
00:10:02,028 --> 00:10:04,480
when you're actually trying to get a value on your business.

211
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,450
But we have to go to these guys.

212
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,630
Now they have some value.

213
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:10,290
They'll connect us with other dudes.

214
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,610
And they have experience starting businesses.

215
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,253
They can introduce us to

216
00:10:14,253 --> 00:10:15,570
other people who have done similar things.

217
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,630
And all the rest-- help us network,

218
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,690
and help us manage the business.

219
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,990
So we go to a venture capitalist,

220
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,230
and we get the door closed a lot of times on us.

221
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,363
But one venture capitalist,

222
00:10:24,363 --> 00:10:26,310
one seed venture capitalist finally comes to us.

223
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,700
And the terminology can be a little ambiguous here,

224
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,180
but we'll call it our Series A financing.

225
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,380
Series A.

226
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,370
Sometimes it'll be called your seed financing,

227
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,690
but we'll call it Series A because we want to formalize it.

228
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,068
And just so you know,

229
00:10:40,068 --> 00:10:43,610
the A is because it's our first real formal round of financing.

230
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,550
In our second round, which I'll do probably in the next video,

231
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,910
it will be Series B, and then Series C,

232
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,290
and then Series D.

233
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,770
Every time we run out of cash,

234
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:51,860
we want to go back to the till.

235
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,470
We've already done a Series A, now we want to do a Series B,

236
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,350
and a Series C, and so forth and so on.

237
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,290
And eventually we'll hopefully get to some type of an IPO,

238
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,090
which I'll talk about it the next video.

239
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,992
Because I just realized I'm out of time again.
