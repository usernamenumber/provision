If a commodoty trader tells you that a market is in backwardation, they are essentially saying that it

2
00:00:07,267 --> 00:00:16,800
costs more to buy whatever commodoty they are talking about now, so now it costs more than it would to

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,733
buy it later; to go into a futures contract to buy that whatever that commodity may be, silver, gold, or oil; to buy it later.

4
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:34,733
So, later is cheaper. So the question you might ask yourself, or any trader may ask themselves:

5
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:45,467
Is this bullish or is this bearish? Is this a bullish situation? And there is no obvious rule of thumb

6
00:00:45,467 --> 00:00:51,267
here, but if someone says, "look, to get something now costs more than to get something later, what does

7
00:00:51,267 --> 00:00:56,067
that tell you about what is happening in the market?" Well it tells you that people are desperate. So

8
00:00:56,067 --> 00:01:02,200
Because if they were not desperate, the rational thing to do would be to wait a little while and just

9
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:07,333
get it cheaper for later or if you don't need that oil right now or if you don't need that corn right

10
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:15,267
now, or if you dont need that gold right now, you could say, "look, I could enter into a futures contract

11
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:22,200
for delivery of that gold or oil or corn or whatever it is at a later date for a cheaper price and I

12
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,000
wouldn't even need to store it between now and then." So if people were rational and weren't desperate,

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,600
this wouldn't happen, but because they are willing to do this, they are willing to pay more now for a

14
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:42,867
future delivery date it shows you that there might be some type of shortage. In the case of oil, maybe

15
00:01:42,867 --> 00:01:48,333
the oil supply hs been disrupted somehow. In the case of corn, for whatever reason some crops have been

16
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:54,800
destroyed and people need to eat and all the rest. For commodotys that aren't used, so to speak, like

17
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:01,800
gold if you see backwardation there I wouldn't say that, well it's definitely still desperation, but

18
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:08,067
its not out of a core need, if gold goes into backwardation it is more because of some irrational desire

19
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:13,533
to have their hands on the gold now than have their hands on the gold later. Maybe they think society

20
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:20,000
is going to collapse and the future delivery dates of gold arent actually going to hold up. Who knows

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,800
what they are? So, in general, when people talk about backwardation, because of this desperation in t

22
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:32,267
the market, people tend to perceive it as a bullish signal. Obviously if people are desperate there is

23
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:38,733
demand for this thing. My arguent is that you cannot just look at one tea leaf out of a bunch of tea

24
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:42,800
leafs and say whether it is bullish or bearish, but what you could say is that there is something somewhat

25
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,867
abnormal going on in the market due to some type of desperation. It is a little less irrational if it

26
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:54,333
is due to storage, but it could be very irrational if it is due to just wanting your hands on it. Because

27
00:02:54,333 --> 00:03:00,733
frankly, if you wanted to buy gold just for the sake of investing in gold, you aren't going to eat it

28
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:05,733
or use it to fuel your car or anything like that, it would make complete sense... or even better, if

29
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:11,533
you already held gold in this type of a market that is undergoing backwardation, the rational thing to

30
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:19,200
do would be to sell you gold now for more money and agree to buy it back later for cheaper. And so when

31
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,733
this later date comes about, you will still have your gold and you will have made some risk-free profits.
