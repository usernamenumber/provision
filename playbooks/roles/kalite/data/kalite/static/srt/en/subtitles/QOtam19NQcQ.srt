1
00:00:00,606 --> 00:00:03,299
I've written the same subtraction problem twice.

2
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:10,962
Here we see we're subtracting 172 from 629. And all I did here is I expanded out the numbers.

3
00:00:10,962 --> 00:00:20,203
I wrote 629 as 600 plus 20 plus 9 and I rewrote a 172. The 1 is one hundred (so that's there),

4
00:00:20,203 --> 00:00:26,633
this is 7 tens, it's in the tens place so it's 70. And then the 2 is two ones so it just represents 2.

5
00:00:26,633 --> 00:00:29,033
And we will see why this is useful in a second.

6
00:00:29,033 --> 00:00:32,900
So let's just start subtracting. We will start with the ones place.

7
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,200
So we have 9 minus 2, well that's clearly just 7.

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,213
And over here we can also say: "Well, 9 minus 2 (we have the subtraction out front), that is going to be 7."

9
00:00:44,213 --> 00:00:48,624
Pretty straightforward. But then something interesting happens when we get to the tens place.

10
00:00:48,624 --> 00:00:54,801
We're going to try to subtract 2 minus 7 or we're going to subtract 7 from 2.

11
00:00:54,801 --> 00:01:00,281
And we haven't learned yet how to do things like negative numbers (which we'll learn in the future) so we have a problem.

12
00:01:00,281 --> 00:01:04,460
How do you subtract a larger number from a smaller number?

13
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:10,637
Well, luckily we have something in our toolkit called Regrouping, sometimes called Borrowing.

14
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:17,974
And that's why this is valuable. When we're trying to subtract the 7 from the 2, we're really trying to subtract this 70 from this 20.

15
00:01:17,974 --> 00:01:22,201
Well, we can't subtract the 70 from the 20 but we have other value in the number.

16
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:24,033
We have value in the hundreds place.

17
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:31,967
So why don't we take a hundred from the 600 so that becomes 500 and give that hundred to the tens place?

18
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:37,619
If we give that hundred to the tens place, what is a 100 plus 20?

19
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:43,367
Well, it's going to be 120.

20
00:01:43,367 --> 00:01:50,482
So all I did: I didn't change the value of 629. I took a hundred from the hundreds place and I gave it to the tens place.

21
00:01:50,482 --> 00:01:57,634
Notice: 500 plus 120 plus 9 is still 629. We haven't changed the value.

22
00:01:57,634 --> 00:02:00,281
So how would we do that right over here?

23
00:02:00,281 --> 00:02:06,597
Well if we take a hundred from the hundreds place, this 6 hundred becomes a 5... 5 hundred.

24
00:02:06,597 --> 00:02:10,544
And we give that hundred to the tens place, it's going to be 10 hundreds.

25
00:02:10,544 --> 00:02:15,978
So this will now become a 12.

26
00:02:15,978 --> 00:02:23,873
But notice, this 12 in the tens place represents 12 tens or a 120.

27
00:02:23,873 --> 00:02:27,309
So this is just another way of representing what we've done here.

28
00:02:27,309 --> 00:02:29,631
There's no magic here. This is often called Borrowing.

29
00:02:29,631 --> 00:02:37,805
Well, you say: "Hey, I took a 1 from the 6 and I gave it to the 2 but wait, why has this 2 become a 12? Why was I able to add 10?"

30
00:02:37,805 --> 00:02:41,613
Well, you've added 10 tens or a hundred.

31
00:02:41,613 --> 00:02:47,975
You took a hundred from here so 6 hundred became 5 hundred, and then 20 became a hundred and 20.

32
00:02:47,975 --> 00:02:49,879
But now we're ready to subtract.

33
00:02:49,879 --> 00:03:00,100
12 tens minus 7 tens is 5 tens. Or you could say a 120 minus 70 is 50.

34
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,557
And then finally you have the hundreds place.

35
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:12,867
5 minus 1 is equal to 4. But that's really 500 minus 100 is equal to 400.

36
00:03:12,867 --> 00:03:16,867
And so you get 457 which is the same thing as 400 plus 50 plus 7.
