1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,670
Let's do some examples
of solving equations.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,110
And you're going to see the
equations in this video,

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,320
they're not going to require a
lot of steps, but I really

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,970
want to focus on what's actually
happening on the

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:14,020
equation, and why it makes sense
to do the steps that

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:14,910
we're doing.

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,495
So this first equation here,
we have x-- I'll rewrite it

8
00:00:18,495 --> 00:00:22,890
--x plus 11 is equal to 7.

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,280
So that's telling us-- And I
have this little dot here, let

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,510
me eliminate, let me
clear that dot.

11
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,950
Don't want you to think I have
some type of a decimal there.

12
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:32,820
There you go.

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,200
So back to the problem.

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,130
So what is this saying?

15
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,950
This is saying, some number
plus 11 is equal to 7.

16
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,840
And you may already be able
to do this in your head.

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,730
You know, what do I have to
add to 11 to get to 7?

18
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:46,650
So it's going to have
to be some type

19
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,375
of a negative number.

20
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:49,780
But we're going to learn how
to do this systematically.

21
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,860
So what we want to do is, when
we solve an equation, it

22
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,885
should be of the form,
when we're all done,

23
00:00:54,885 --> 00:00:56,890
x is equal to something.

24
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,950
And that's going to
be our answer.

25
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:01,840
We'll know what number satisfies
this equation.

26
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,470
Now, to get there, what we want
to do is to just have

27
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,460
this x on the left-hand
side of the equation.

28
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,000
We don't want this 11 there.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,150
We want to get rid of this 11
somehow, on the left-hand side

30
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,220
of this equation.

31
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,570
Now to do that, we can't just
get rid of it only on the

32
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:15,310
left-hand side.

33
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,950
You might want to just say, hey,
let me subtract 11 from

34
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,640
the left-hand side
of the equation.

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,130
But this is an equation.

36
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,310
Anything you do to one side of
the equation, you have to do

37
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,110
to the other side
of the equation.

38
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:31,850
If x plus 11 is equal to
7, x plus 11 minus 11

39
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,230
won't equal 7 anymore.

40
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,820
You'll have to also subtract
11 from the 7.

41
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,230
Now they're equal.

42
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,950
Remember, I want to really
emphasize this.

43
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,300
I want you to really
think about what

44
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,840
this equality means.

45
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,810
Equation, it comes from the
notion of equality.

46
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,670
This is equal to this.

47
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,640
These two things are equivalent
quantities.

48
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,050
Now, in order for this equal to
hold true, anything I do to

49
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:59,470
this, if I'm subtracting 11 from
this quantity, in order

50
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,480
for the equality to hold true,
I also have to subtract 11

51
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,530
from this quantity right here.
x plus 7 and 7 are equal.

52
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,940
So they're still going to be
equal after I subtract 11.

53
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,830
Now let's focus on the
left-hand side.

54
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:17,360
Negative 11 plus x plus 11,
negative 11 plus 11, they're

55
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,480
going to cancel out, right?

56
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,910
11 minus 11 is 0.

57
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,270
So you're going to be with left
with just an x is equal

58
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,446
to 7 minus 11.

59
00:02:27,446 --> 00:02:29,910
Now what's 7 minus 11?

60
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,810
You can draw a number line
out, if you like.

61
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:39,030
If we draw a number line right
here-- 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

62
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,880
7 is there.

63
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,550
And if you subtract 11 from
that, you go back 1, 2, 3, 4,

64
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:52,460
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

65
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,790
8, 9, 10, 11.

66
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,320
That takes you to negative 4.

67
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,370
7 minus 11 is negative 4.

68
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,560
That's our first equation.

69
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,120
Now we have 7 times some
number-- this is the new

70
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,570
problem --7 times some number
x is equal to 21.

71
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,860
This is going to be a different
x than this one

72
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,750
right here.

73
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,560
So how, once again, do we get
it in the form of x is equal

74
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,120
to something?

75
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,770
Remember, we've got x is
equal to something.

76
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,460
How do we get into that form?

77
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,000
Let me rewrite the problem.

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,020
7 times something
is equal to 21.

79
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,250
Well, I could think
of it two ways.

80
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,360
If I divide 7 times
x by 7, what am I

81
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,250
going to be left with?

82
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,920
If I divide that by 7, what am
I going to be left with?

83
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,780
7 times something divided by
7, that's just going to be

84
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,470
that something.

85
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,090
That's just going to
end up with an x.

86
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,620
But if I do it on the left-hand
side of the

87
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,500
equation, I have
to do it on the

88
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,340
right-hand side of the equation.

89
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,280
Remember, 7x is equal to 21.

90
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,130
It's the same thing as 21.

91
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,190
In order for this to be equal to
that when I divide by 7 on

92
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,020
the left, I also have to divide
by 7 on the right.

93
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:02,020
And when I do that, 7 times x
divided by 7-- that's just

94
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:07,250
going to be x --and then 21
divided by 7 is equal to 3.

95
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,710
So the solution to this equation
is x is equal to 3.

96
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,900
And you can verify it.

97
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,880
Take 3, plug it into
that equation.

98
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,130
7 times 3 is indeed 21.

99
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,329
Same thing over here.

100
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,120
Take x is equal to negative 4.

101
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,550
Negative 4 plus 11 is the
same thing as 11 minus

102
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,180
4, is indeed 7.

103
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,090
Let's do this one here.

104
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,700
This one looks a little bit
more difficult, but you're

105
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,700
going to see, it's
not too bad.

106
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:38,020
So we have 5x over 12
is equal to 2/3.

107
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,290
Now, how do you isolate
the x over here?

108
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,960
What can we multiply or divide
by to isolate it?

109
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,220
Well, what if we were to
multiply both sides of this

110
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,850
equation by 12 over 5?

111
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,230
What's going to happen?

112
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:57,520
So if I multiply the left-hand
side by 12 over 5-- And

113
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,630
remember, anything I do to one
side of an equation, I have to

114
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,550
do to the other side
of an equation.

115
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,140
So if I multiply the left side
by 12 over 5, I have to

116
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,320
multiply the right side by 12
over 5 in order for that

117
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,200
equality to hold true.

118
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,470
But why would I pick
12 over 5?

119
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,990
Because I wanted to pick a
number that cancels perfectly

120
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,000
with the 5 over 12.

121
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,180
Right?

122
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,340
I have a 5 over 12 here.

123
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,820
12 over 5 times 5 over 12, the
12's cancel out, the 5's

124
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,390
cancel out, and you're
left with just an x.

125
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:30,260
So you get x is equal to
2/3 times 12 over 5.

126
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,910
You can divide the 12
by 3 and get a 4.

127
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,120
You can divide the 3
by 3 and get a 1.

128
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,160
So you get 2 times 4 is
equal to 8 over 1

129
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,620
times 5, which is 5.

130
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,940
So x is equal to 8/5.

131
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,590
Now you might say, hey, Sal,
over here you divided by 7,

132
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,130
here you're multiplying by the
inverse of the coefficient.

133
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,390
When do I know what to do?

134
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,080
And the answer is, you
can do either.

135
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,790
I could have done this exact
same problem that way.

136
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,100
I started with 7x
is equal to 21.

137
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,630
Instead of dividing by 7, I
could have said, let me

138
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,910
multiply by the inverse of 7.

139
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,800
So I could have multiplied by
the inverse of 7 on both sides

140
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,870
of the equation.

141
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,020
This is equivalent
to dividing by 7.

142
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:12,930
You can verify it.

143
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,640
When you multiply by 1/7, that's
the exact same thing as

144
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,130
dividing by 7.

145
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,580
So if you work this out,
these would cancel out.

146
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,750
This is 1/7 times 7/1.

147
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,940
The 7's cancel out.

148
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:27,890
You get x is equal to 21 over
7, which is equal to 3.

149
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:33,950
Likewise, over here,
I have 5x over 12.

150
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,150
Let me write it this way.

151
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:41,360
I could write it as, 5 over
12x is equal to 2/3.

152
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,650
This is the exact
same problem.

153
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,990
I'm just separating the
x out a little bit.

154
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,890
5/12 times x is 5x over 12.

155
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,490
Now here, I could just say, let
me divide both sides by

156
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,940
the coefficient 5 over 12.

157
00:06:53,940 --> 00:07:00,520
So I could have just divided
by 5 over 12.

158
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,550
But what does it mean to
divide by 5 over 12?

159
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:08,070
That's the same thing as
multiplying by 12 over 5.

160
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,725
Dividing by a fraction is the
same thing as multiplying by

161
00:07:10,725 --> 00:07:11,500
its inverse.

162
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,140
So this and this, we're doing
the exact same thing.

163
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:19,750
Whether you divide by the
coefficient, like we did over

164
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,320
here, or whether you multiply
by the inverse of the

165
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,350
coefficient, you're doing the
exact same operation.

166
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,760
Now let's do some of these other
problems. And this is

167
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,990
really just to show you that the
variable isn't always x.

168
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,180
We can solve for q.

169
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,610
We can solve for z.

170
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:33,740
We can solve for s.

171
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,100
We can solve for anything.

172
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,710
So let's solve these
down here.

173
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:42,790
So we have-- and I'll rewrite
it --you have q minus 13 is

174
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,540
equal to negative 13.

175
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,380
So once again, we want
to isolate the q.

176
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,300
We want it to be, q is
equal to something.

177
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,880
Then we will have solved
our problem.

178
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,220
So how can we isolate the q?

179
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,590
How can we get rid of this 13?

180
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,315
What if we add 13 to both
sides of this equation?

181
00:07:58,315 --> 00:08:02,300
If I add 13 to both sides of this equation

182
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,110
And I'm adding 13, because if
I add 13 to negative 13, or

183
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,680
minus 13 right here,
I'm going to get 0.

184
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,910
So the left-hand side of this
equation is going to become q,

185
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,900
and then what is the right-hand
side, right?

186
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,720
That and that will cancel out.

187
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,480
And the right-hand
side, negative 13

188
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,590
plus 13, is just 0.

189
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,775
So our solution is,
q is equal to 0.

190
00:08:21,775 --> 00:08:23,230
And we can check it.

191
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:28,100
0 minus 13 is indeed
negative 13.

192
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,120
So it works.

193
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,810
Actually I forgot to check
this one over here.

194
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,380
Let's check it.

195
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,500
The fun thing about
algebra, you can

196
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,919
always check your answer.

197
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,600
We got x is equal to
8/5 over here.

198
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,010
Let's check our answer.

199
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:44,880
5 over 12 times x times 8
over 5 is equal to what?

200
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,910
5's cancel out.

201
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,990
You can divide the 8
by 4 and get a 2.

202
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,130
You could divide the 12
by 4 and get a 3.

203
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,990
It equals 2/3.

204
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,200
So we can verify.

205
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,950
That's the neat thing.

206
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,600
Once you get your answer, you
can always make sure, if you

207
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,500
have enough time, that you
got the right answer.

208
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,180
Let's do these last two.

209
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:11,330
We have z plus 1.1 is
equal to 3.0001.

210
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,810
Once again, we want to get
rid of this 1.1 on

211
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:14,840
the left-hand side.

212
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,370
The best way to do that that I
can think of is subtracting

213
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,970
1.1 from both sides, or adding
negative 1.1, however

214
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:22,750
you want to do it.

215
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,290
If I do it on the left, I've
got to do it on the right.

216
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,205
Otherwise the equality won't
still hold true.

217
00:09:27,205 --> 00:09:30,880
If this is equal to this, in
order for the two sides to be

218
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,530
equal, anything I do
to the left, I have

219
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,070
to do to the right.

220
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,630
So let's see.

221
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:39,390
If I subtract 1.1 from z plus
1.1, those two cancel out, and

222
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:50,960
I'm left with just a z is equal
to 3.0001 minus 1.1.

223
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,852
So here we're going
to do a little bit

224
00:09:51,852 --> 00:09:53,500
of subtracting decimals.

225
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,590
That's probably the hardest
part of this problem.

226
00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:00,030
So 3.0001 minus 1.1.

227
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,320
You want to align
the decimals.

228
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,570
Minus 1.1.

229
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,830
Minus 1.1 minus

230
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:06,510
Just like that.

231
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:10,890
And we can even add some 0's
there, just to make it clear.

232
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,260
And let's do our subtraction.

233
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,730
1 minus 0 is 1.

234
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,360
0 minus 0 is 0.

235
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,460
0 minus 0 is 0.

236
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,180
Uh oh, we don't have-- We
can't do 0 minus 1.

237
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,470
We can regroup, or
we can borrow.

238
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:28,840
So this will become a 10,
which is really a 1.

239
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,090
And we're going to take
a 1 from here, so this

240
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:33,120
becomes a 2, right?

241
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,970
We borrowed from the 3, we
regrouped the numbers.

242
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,260
We took the whole 1 and put it
in the tenths place, so it

243
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,840
becomes 10/10.

244
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,660
So 10 minus 1 is 9.

245
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,100
We have our decimal space.

246
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,460
And then 2 minus 1 is 1.

247
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:53,380
So our answer is z is
equal to 1.9001.

248
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,220
And we can verify that.

249
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,470
What's z plus 1.1?

250
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:00,365
What's z plus 1.1?

251
00:11:00,365 --> 00:11:01,980
Let's add it up.

252
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:08,090
You get a 1, 00, 9.1 is 10, 1
plus 1 plus 1 is 3, we have

253
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:11,870
our decimal sign, and
we got 3.0001.

254
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,770
That's a good review of
subtracting decimals.

255
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:15,290
All right.

256
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,390
And we have this last problem.

257
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:19,920
21s is equal to 3.

258
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,890
Like we said, we could do
this two ways, which are

259
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,530
essentially the same way.

260
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,750
21 times some number
is equal to 3.

261
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,670
Well, what happens if
we multiply both

262
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:33,550
sides by 1 over 21?

263
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,050
By the inverse of
the coefficient.

264
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,050
The coefficient is just the
number that sits out in front

265
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,450
of the variable, that's
multiplying the variable.

266
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:44,990
Well, 1 over 21 times 21 is just
1, so we get s is equal

267
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,000
to 3 over 21.

268
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,830
And 3 over 21 is the same
thing as 1 over 7.

269
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,180
And we can verify that.

270
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,540
What is 21 times 1 over 7?

271
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,360
It's equal to 21 over 7.

272
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,370
21 divided by 7.

273
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,000
Which is 3.

274
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,940
And just to really hit the point
home, I could have done

275
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,520
this problem-- Instead of
multiplying by 1 over 21--

276
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,240
let's see, 21s is equal to 3
--I could've, instead of

277
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,640
multiplying by 1 over 21, a
completely equivalent thing to

278
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:18,000
do would have been to just
divide both sides by 21.

279
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,290
So these would cancel out.

280
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:26,590
You'd get s is equal to 3
over 21, which is 1/7.

281
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:29,840
Anyway, hopefully you found
those examples useful.
