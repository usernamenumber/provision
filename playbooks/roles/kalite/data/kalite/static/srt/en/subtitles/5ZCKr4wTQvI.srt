00:00:01,184 --> 00:00:08,336
Find the perimeter of the parallelogram. We have a parallelogram right over here, opposite sides are parallel.

2
00:00:08,336 --> 00:00:13,584
That side is parallel to that side right over here. This side is parallel to that side right over here.

3
00:00:13,584 --> 00:00:16,535
And also in a parallelogram, opposite sides have the same length.

4
00:00:16,535 --> 00:00:18,623
Now, we have to worry about the perimeter here.

5
00:00:18,623 --> 00:00:27,804
Which essentially just says that if we had a field the size and shape of this parallelogram, and we wanted to make a fence around the field that was the shape of this parallelogram,

6
00:00:27,804 --> 00:00:30,395
how long would that fence have to be?

7
00:00:30,395 --> 00:00:35,079
Obviously, it would be the sum of the lengths of the sides.

8
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:39,039
So, we wouldn't even have to worry about this thing over here, we can ignore it for the sake of this problem.

9
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:44,327
We don't care about the actual height, or this altitude right over here, we just care about the lengths of the sides.

10
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:56,030
So the perimeter of this parallelogram is going to be 12 inches, plus 8 inches, plus 12 inches, plus 8 inches.

11
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:08,450
12 + 8 is 20, 12 + 8 is 20, so this is all going to add up to 40 inches. And we're done.

12
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:14,522
I guess this is a very small field, this is only 8 inches. I guess it's a little plot of land,

13
00:01:14,522 --> 00:01:16,918
a little parallelogram plot of land. Anyway, we're done.

14
00:01:16,918 --> 99:59:59,999
Its perimeter is 40 inches.
