1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,914
What is the average rate of change of y(x)

2
00:00:03,914 --> 00:00:09,176
over the interval -5 < x < -2?

3
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:11,839
So this is x = -5.

4
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:16,370
When x = -5, y(x) = 6.

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:23,137
And when x = -2, y(x) = 0.

6
00:00:23,137 --> 00:00:25,520
So to figure of the average rate of change –

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:34,745
so the average rate of change of y(x) with respect –

8
00:00:34,745 --> 00:00:36,983
and we can assume it’s with respect to x –

9
00:00:36,983 --> 00:00:42,839
with respect to x –

10
00:00:42,839 --> 00:00:44,901
And let me make that a little bit neater.

11
00:00:44,901 --> 00:00:46,722
– with respect to x …

12
00:00:46,722 --> 00:00:50,968
This is going to be the change in y(x) over that interval

13
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:53,436
over the change in x over that interval.

14
00:00:53,436 --> 00:00:57,564
And the shorthand for 'change' is this triangle symbol ‘delta.’

15
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,232
Delta y –

16
00:00:59,232 --> 00:01:00,319
I’ll just write y.

17
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:01,428
I could write delta y(x).

18
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:02,655
It’s delta y –

19
00:01:02,655 --> 00:01:05,657
– change in y over our change in x.

20
00:01:05,657 --> 00:01:07,820
That’s going to be our average rate of change

21
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,149
over this interval.

22
00:01:09,149 --> 00:01:11,831
So how much did y change over this interval?

23
00:01:11,831 --> 00:01:15,182
So y went from a 6 to a 0.

24
00:01:15,182 --> 00:01:16,370
So let's say that this is –

25
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,765
We can kind of view this as our end point, right over here.

26
00:01:18,765 --> 00:01:22,437
So this is our 'end' and this is our 'start.'

27
00:01:22,437 --> 00:01:23,765
And we could have done it the other way around,

28
00:01:23,765 --> 00:01:25,292
and we would [have gotten an identical] result.

29
00:01:25,292 --> 00:01:27,075
Since this is higher up on the list,

30
00:01:27,075 --> 00:01:28,017
let’s call this the 'start.'

31
00:01:28,017 --> 00:01:29,908
And this is – the x is a lower value.

32
00:01:29,908 --> 00:01:31,800
We'll call that our 'start.' This is our 'end.'

33
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,412
So we start at 6.

34
00:01:33,412 --> 00:01:34,916
We end at 0.

35
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:38,116
So our change in y is gong to be -6.

36
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:41,552
We went down by 6 in the y direction.

37
00:01:41,552 --> 00:01:44,509
It's -6. You could say that's a 0 - 6.

38
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:45,766
And our change in x –

39
00:01:45,766 --> 00:01:49,298
well, we were at -5, and we go up to -2.

40
00:01:49,298 --> 00:01:52,130
We increased by 3.

41
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,967
So we increased by 3.

42
00:01:53,967 --> 00:01:54,757
So we went –

43
00:01:54,757 --> 00:01:59,631
When we increase x by 3, we decreased y(x) by 6.

44
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:01,672
Or, if we want to simplify this right over here,

45
00:02:01,672 --> 00:02:04,836
(-6)/3 is the same thing as -2.

46
00:02:04,836 --> 00:02:07,210
So our average rate of change of y(x)

47
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:12,483
over the interval from -5 to -2 is -2.

48
00:02:12,483 --> 00:02:18,550
Every time, on average, x increased by 1, y [changed] by -2.
