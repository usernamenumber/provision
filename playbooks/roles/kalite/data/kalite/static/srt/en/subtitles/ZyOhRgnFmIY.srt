A candy machine creates small chocolate wafers in the shape of circular discs. The Diameter of each wafer is 16 millimeters. Whats it the area of each candy?

2
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:22,206
So, the candy they say is in the shape of circular disc and they tell us that the diameter is 16 millimeters.

3
00:00:22,206 --> 00:00:25,834
If i draw a line across the circle, that goes through the center.

4
00:00:25,834 --> 00:00:33,235
The length of the line all the way across the circle through the center is 16 millimeters.

5
00:00:33,235 --> 00:00:40,362
The Diameter here is 16 millimeters.

6
00:00:40,362 --> 00:00:48,017
And they want us to figure out the area of the surface of the candy. Essentially the area of this circle.

7
00:00:48,017 --> 00:00:58,668
When we think about area, we know that the area of the circle is pi times the radius of the circle square.

8
00:00:58,668 --> 00:01:02,617
They gave us the diameter, what is the radius?

9
00:01:02,617 --> 00:01:05,950
well, you might remember that the radius is half of the diameter.

10
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:18,001
Distance from the center of the circle to the outside, to the boundary of the circle.So, it will be this distance over here, which is exactly half of the diameter. So, would be 8 millimeters.

11
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:34,635
So, where we see the radius, we can put 8milimeters.
So, the Area is going to be equal to pi times 8 millimeters square, which would be 64 pie millimeters square.

12
00:01:34,635 --> 00:01:53,616
And, typically this is written as pi after 64. So, you might often see it as 64 pie millimeter squared.

13
00:01:53,616 --> 00:01:56,952
Now, this is the answer 64 pi millimeters squared.

14
00:01:56,952 --> 00:02:02,399
But sometimes it is not satisfying to leave it as 64 pi millimeter squared.

15
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,484
You might well say, that what number it is close to. I want a decimal representation of this.

16
00:02:07,484 --> 00:02:23,976
And we could start to use the approximate values of pie. So, the most rough approximate value which is tensed to be used is saying that pi, a very rough approximation, is equal to 3.14.

17
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:33,418
So, in that case we can that this will be equal to 64 times 3.14 millimeters squared.

18
00:02:33,418 --> 00:02:38,516
We can get a calculator to figure out what this will be in decimal form.

19
00:02:38,516 --> 00:02:47,683
So, we have 64 times 3.14, gives us 200.96

20
00:02:47,683 --> 00:02:58,235
So, we can say that the area is approximately equal to 200.96 square millimeters.

21
00:02:58,235 --> 00:03:08,666
Now if we want to get a more accurate representation of this, pi just actually keeps going on and on forever, we could use the calculator's internal representation of pi.

22
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:23,139
In which case, we will say 64 times, and than we have to look for the pi on the calculator, it's up here this yellow, so I'll use the 2nd function to get the pi there.

23
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:29,090
Now, we are using the calculator's internal representation of pi which is going to be more precise than what I had in the last one.

24
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:33,620
And you can 201.06 (to the nearest hundred)

25
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:54,726
So, more precise is 201.06 square millimeters. So, this is closer to the actual answer,

26
00:03:54,726 --> 00:04:02,510
because the calculator's representation is more precise than this very rough approximation of what pi is.
