00:00:00,828 --> 00:00:04,078
We have been doing a bunch of these videos with these convex lenses,

2
00:00:04,078 --> 00:00:08,442
where we where we draw parallel rays and rays that go through the focal point,

3
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:12,046
to figure out what the image of an object might be.

4
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:13,758
What I want to do in this video is to come up with

5
00:00:13,758 --> 00:00:21,756
an algebraic relationship between the distance of the object from the convex lens,

6
00:00:21,756 --> 00:00:26,761
the distance of the image from the convex lens (usually on the other side)

7
00:00:26,761 --> 00:00:29,852
and the focal length.

8
00:00:29,852 --> 00:00:30,873
So lets see if we can do this.

9
00:00:30,873 --> 00:00:37,495
To save you the pain of having to watch me draw straight lines I drew this ahead of time.

10
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:42,710
And so we can imagine this green thing right here is the object

11
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,894
This is the object.

12
00:00:43,894 --> 00:00:48,626
And these two little pink points here are the focal points.

13
00:00:48,626 --> 00:00:50,764
They are the focal length away.

14
00:00:50,764 --> 00:00:52,080
And I did what we always do:

15
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,862
I drew one parallel ray from the tip of that arrow to the actual convex lens

16
00:00:57,862 --> 00:01:01,407
and it gets refracted, so it goes through the focal point on the right hand side.

17
00:01:01,407 --> 00:01:02,792
It goes all the way over there.

18
00:01:02,792 --> 00:01:07,246
Then I drew a ray that goes through the focal point on the left hand side

19
00:01:07,246 --> 00:01:09,814
and when it gets refracted it becomes parallel.

20
00:01:09,814 --> 00:01:15,514
Then it actually intersects with that previous ray, up, right over here,

21
00:01:15,514 --> 00:01:22,112
and so this gives us a sense of what the image will look like:

22
00:01:22,112 --> 00:01:27,179
It is inverted, it is real and in this case it is larger than the actual object.

23
00:01:27,179 --> 00:01:29,216
W\hat I want to do is to come up with a relationship with these values.

24
00:01:29,216 --> 00:01:31,158
Lets see if we can label them here,

25
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:34,245
and then just do a little geometry and a little algebra

26
00:01:34,245 --> 00:01:37,377
to figure out if there is an algebraic relationship right here.

27
00:01:37,377 --> 00:01:44,662
So the first number, the distance of the object. That is this distance from here to here.

28
00:01:44,662 --> 00:01:47,750
Or we can just label it here, since it is already drawn for us.

29
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,064
This is the distance of the object.

30
00:01:49,064 --> 00:01:51,429
This is the way we drew it.

31
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:53,341
This was the parallel light ray.

32
00:01:53,341 --> 00:02:00,242
But before it got refracted it traveled the distance from the object to the actual lens.

33
00:02:00,242 --> 00:02:09,756
Now the distance from the image to the lens, that is this right over here, this is how far this parallel light ray had to travel.

34
00:02:09,756 --> 00:02:13,128
So this is the distance from the image to the lens.

35
00:02:13,128 --> 00:02:22,086
Then we have the focal distance; the focal length, and that is just this distance right here.

36
00:02:22,086 --> 00:02:29,397
Or we can view it on this side as well. This right here is also our focal length.

37
00:02:29,397 --> 00:02:31,927
So I want to come up with some relationship

38
00:02:31,927 --> 00:02:34,573
and to do that I am going to draw some triangles here

39
00:02:34,573 --> 00:02:39,965
so what we can do is; and the whole strategy, I am going to keep looking for similar triangles

40
00:02:39,965 --> 00:02:47,113
and then trying to find a relationship or ratios that relate these three things to each other.

41
00:02:47,113 --> 00:02:48,979
So let me find some similar triangles.

42
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:53,694
The best thing I can think of to do is to redraw this triangle over here.

43
00:02:53,694 --> 00:02:55,408
Let me just flip it over.

44
00:02:55,408 --> 00:03:01,553
Let me just draw the same triangle on the right hand side of this diagram.

45
00:03:01,553 --> 00:03:08,611
If i were to draw the same triangle it would look like this.

46
00:03:08,611 --> 00:03:15,594
Let me just be clear, this is this triangle right here, I just flipped it over.

47
00:03:15,594 --> 00:03:18,855
and so if we want to make sure we are keeping track of the same sides

48
00:03:18,855 --> 00:03:27,259
if this length right here is d sub zero [ d0 ] or d nought or sometimes we can call it d zero, whatever we want to call it

49
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:36,375
Then this length up here is also going to be d zero [ d0 ].

50
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:40,691
The reason why I wanted to do that is now we can do something interesting.

51
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:43,795
We can relate this triangle up here to this triangle down here

52
00:03:43,795 --> 00:03:46,231
and actually, we can see that they are going to be similar.

53
00:03:46,231 --> 00:03:49,247
And then we can relate, we can get some ratios of sides

54
00:03:49,247 --> 00:03:53,478
and then what we can do is show that this triangle over here is similar to this triangle over here

55
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:57,778
get a couple more ratios and then we might be able to relate all of these things.

56
00:03:57,778 --> 00:04:01,496
The first thing we have to prove to ourselves is that the triangles really are similar.

57
00:04:01,496 --> 00:04:08,452
So the first thing to realise is that this angle right here is definitly the same thing as that angle right over there

58
00:04:08,452 --> 00:04:10,705
something called opposite angles or vertical angles

59
00:04:10,705 --> 00:04:15,000
they are on opppsite sides of lines that are intersecting, so they are going to be equal.

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,956
Now the next thing, this comes out of the fact that both of these lines

61
00:04:18,956 --> 00:04:22,615
this line is parallel to that line over there

62
00:04:22,615 --> 00:04:27,508
and you can look at, I guess you can call it alternate interior angles

63
00:04:27,508 --> 00:04:32,208
if you look at the angles again with the parallel lines, with the transversal of parallel lines from geometry.

64
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:35,534
We know that this angle, since they are alternate interior angles

65
00:04:35,534 --> 00:04:41,059
this angle is going to be the same value as this angle, right.

66
00:04:41,059 --> 00:04:46,484
Cause they are both, you can view this line here as a transversal of two parallel lines.

67
00:04:46,484 --> 00:04:49,913
These are alternate interior angles, so they will be the same.

68
00:04:49,913 --> 00:04:56,916
Now we can make that exact same argument for this angle and this angle.

69
00:04:56,916 --> 00:05:00,467
And so what we see is that this triangle up here has the same

70
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:04,145
three angles as this triangle down here.

71
00:05:04,145 --> 00:05:08,561
So these two triangles are similar, these are both

72
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:11,274
and this is really more of a review of geometry than optics

73
00:05:11,274 --> 00:05:16,844
these are similar triangles.

74
00:05:16,844 --> 00:05:18,199
They are similar.

75
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:22,796
Because they are similar the ratios of corresponding sides are going to be the same

76
00:05:22,796 --> 00:05:25,444
so d0 corresponds to this,

77
00:05:25,444 --> 00:05:31,693
they are both opposite that pink angle.

78
00:05:31,693 --> 00:05:42,347
So the ratio of d0 to d1 is, let me write this over here, so the ratio of d0 to d1 ...

79
00:05:42,347 --> 00:05:45,368
This is the ratio of corresponding sides, is going to be the same thing.

80
00:05:45,368 --> 00:05:48,644
Let me make some labels here. That's going to be the same thing

81
00:05:48,644 --> 00:05:54,909
As the ratio of this side right over here, we call that A

82
00:05:54,909 --> 00:06:01,145
it is opposite this magenta angle right over here

83
00:06:01,145 --> 00:06:06,509
that is going to be the same thing as the ratio of that side to this side over here. To side B.

84
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:12,198
And once again we can keep track of because side B is opposite the magenta angle on this bottom triangle.

85
00:06:12,198 --> 00:06:17,229
So that is how we know this side, its corresponding side of the other similar triangle is that one

86
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:19,840
they are both opposite the magenta angles.

87
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:27,910
So we know that d0 to d1 is as A is to B

88
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:28,944
So that is interesting.

89
00:06:28,944 --> 00:06:33,584
We have been able to relate these two things to these kind of two arbitrary lengths.

90
00:06:33,584 --> 00:06:36,434
We somehow have to connect these two things to the focal length.

91
00:06:36,434 --> 00:06:39,511
To connect them to a focal length,

92
00:06:39,511 --> 00:06:45,777
What we might want to do is relate A and B, A sits on the same triangle as the focal length right over here.

93
00:06:45,777 --> 00:06:47,399
So lets look at this triangle over here.

94
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:50,210
Let me put it in a better colour.

95
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:55,101
So lets look at this triangle over here that I am highlighting in green.

96
00:06:55,101 --> 00:06:57,082
This triangle in green.

97
00:06:57,082 --> 00:07:05,077
and lets look at that in comparison to this triangle that I am also highlighting in green.

98
00:07:05,077 --> 00:07:09,168
Now the first thing that I am going to show you is that these are also similar triangles

99
00:07:09,168 --> 00:07:14,430
This angle right over here and this angle are going to be the same.

100
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,551
They are opposite angles of intersecting lines.

101
00:07:17,551 --> 00:07:21,451
And then we can make a similar argument, alternate interior angles,

102
00:07:21,451 --> 00:07:23,212
or there is a couple of arguments we can make,

103
00:07:23,212 --> 00:07:26,712
one you can see that this is a right angle over here, this is a right angle,

104
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:31,309
if two angles of two triangles are the same then the third angle also has to be the same.

105
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:37,710
So we can also say that this thing, let me do this in another colour, I don't want to be repetitive too much with the colours,

106
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,815
we can say that this thing is going to be the same thing as this thing.

107
00:07:41,815 --> 00:07:46,060
Or another way we could have said it is that this line over here,

108
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,659
which is kind of represented by the lens

109
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:52,137
or the lens or the line that is parallel to the lens,

110
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:55,484
is parallel to the object over there,

111
00:07:55,484 --> 00:07:58,091
and you could make the same alternate interior argument there.

112
00:07:58,091 --> 00:08:02,493
But the other thing is just look, I've two triangles, two of the angles in those two triangles are the same so

113
00:08:02,493 --> 00:08:11,712
the third angle has to be the same. Now, since all three angles are the same, these are also both similar triangles, so we can do a similar thing

114
00:08:11,712 --> 00:08:19,635
we can say A is to B; remember both A and B are opposite the 90 degree side, they are both the hypotenuse of these similar triangles

115
00:08:19,635 --> 00:08:25,296
So A is to B as, we can say, this base length right here

116
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:29,745
it got overwritten a little bit, but this base length right over here is f

117
00:08:29,745 --> 00:08:31,032
That is our focal legnth.

118
00:08:31,032 --> 00:08:36,997
As f in this triangle is related to this length in this triangle

119
00:08:36,997 --> 00:08:41,454
they are both opposite that white angle

120
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,045
so as f is to this length right over here

121
00:08:44,045 --> 00:08:45,225
so what is this length

122
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:51,244
This whole distance is di, but this length is the whole distance minus the focal length

123
00:08:51,244 --> 00:08:54,100
this is di minus the focal length

124
00:08:54,100 --> 00:09:01,016
so A is to B as f is to di minus the focal length

125
00:09:01,016 --> 00:09:04,281
And again we have a relationship between the distance

126
00:09:04,281 --> 00:09:07,545
of the object, the distance of the image and the focal length

127
00:09:07,545 --> 00:09:08,966
And now all we have to do is a little bit of algebra.

128
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,319
This is equal to this, and this is equal to that

129
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:13,375
so this blue thing has to be equal to thist magenta thing

130
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,300
and now we just have to do some algebra

131
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,218
So lets do that

132
00:09:16,218 --> 00:09:32,816
So we got d_0 to d_i is equal to the ratio of the focal length to the difference of the image distance

133
00:09:32,816 --> 00:09:34,019
minus the focal length.

134
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:39,617
And here we just have to do some algebra, lets just simplify this, let's cross multiply it

135
00:09:39,664 --> 00:09:43,021
lets multiple d_0 times this thing over here

136
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:54,009
we get d0<i>di - d0</i>f [we are just distributing it]

137
00:09:54,009 --> 00:10:03,914
Just cross multiplying, which really is just the same thing as multiplying both sides by both denominators.

138
00:10:04,068 --> 00:10:13,856
That is going to be equal to di*f.

139
00:10:13,856 --> 00:10:18,146
and now we can add this term over here to both sides of this equation.

140
00:10:18,146 --> 00:10:19,994
I am just going to switch to a neutral colour.

141
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:33,864
So we get d0<i>di = di</i>f + d0*f.

142
00:10:33,864 --> 00:10:38,432
So lets see here we could factor out the f, our focal length

143
00:10:38,432 --> 00:10:46,402
so we get d0*di is equal to f(di+d0)

144
00:10:46,402 --> 00:10:51,569
and then what can we do, we could divide both sides by f

145
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:56,743
So this will become over f

146
00:10:56,743 --> 00:11:03,815
essentially cancelling it out, and then

147
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:05,420
Lets me just re-write what we have here.

148
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:16,902
d0*di / f = di + d0

149
00:11:16,902 --> 00:11:24,054
now lets divide both sides by d0*di

150
00:11:24,054 --> 00:11:26,701
Cancels out over here,

151
00:11:26,701 --> 00:11:29,781
So we are left with on the left hand side

152
00:11:29,781 --> 00:11:33,879
one over the focal length is equal to this thing over here

153
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:35,590
and we can separate this thing out

154
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:40,542
this thing over here, this is the same thing, we just separate out the numerators, is the same thing as

155
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:46,998
= di/( d0 x di) + d0/( d0 x di)

156
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:53,162
but the di's cancel out, and we just have a one, here the d0s cancel out and you just have a one

157
00:11:53,162 --> 00:11:57,550
So this is equal to one over the distance of the object

158
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:02,184
and this is plus one over the distance of the image.

159
00:12:02,338 --> 00:12:05,048
So from the get-go this was a completely valid formula,

160
00:12:05,048 --> 00:12:06,815
we actually had acheved what we wanted.

161
00:12:06,815 --> 00:12:11,687
But this is a neater formula, you dont have the di's or d0's repeated

162
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:15,013
right here we have an algebraic relationship for a convex mirror

163
00:12:15,013 --> 00:12:22,482
that relates the focal length to the distance of the object and the distance of the image.

164
00:12:22,482 --> 00:12:26,990
Any way, that is pretty neet how itt came out to be a clean formula.
