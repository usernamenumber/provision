1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,400
   

2
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,470
I think we've had some pretty
good exposure to the quadratic

3
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:07,550
formula, but just in case you
haven't memorized it yet, let

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:08,760
me write it down again.

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,770
So let's say we have a quadratic
equation of the

6
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:18,180
form, ax squared plus bx,
plus c is equal to 0.

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,670
The quadratic formula, which we
proved in the last video,

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:25,010
says that the solutions to this
equation are x is equal

9
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:31,390
to negative b plus or minus the
square root of b squared,

10
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:37,590
minus 4ac, all of
that over 2a.

11
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,080
Now, in this video, rather than
just giving a bunch of

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,770
examples of substituting in the
a's, the b's, and the c's,

13
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,240
I want to talk a little bit
about this part of the

14
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,110
quadratic formula, this
part right there.

15
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:55,390
The b squared minus 4ac.

16
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,150
And we've seen it in a couple of
the problems we've done as

17
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,420
examples, that this kind of
determines what our solution

18
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,000
is going to look like.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,610
If, for example, b squared minus
4ac is greater than 0,

20
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,950
we're going to have two
solutions, right?

21
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:20,070
The square root of some
positive number that's

22
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,600
non-zero, there's going to be
a positive and negative

23
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,190
version of it-- we're always
going to have a b over 2a or

24
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,540
negative b over 2a-- so you're
going to have negative b plus

25
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,560
that positive square root, and
a negative b minus that

26
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,330
positive square root,
all over 2a.

27
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:40,970
So if the discriminant is
greater 0, then that tells us

28
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,670
that we have two solutions.

29
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:48,350
Now I just used a word, and
that word is discriminant.

30
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,170
And all that is referring
to is this part of

31
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,596
the quadratic formula.

32
00:01:52,596 --> 00:01:56,980
That right there-- let me do it
in a different color-- this

33
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:03,040
right here is the discriminant
of the quadratic equation

34
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,290
right here.

35
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,556
   

36
00:02:06,556 --> 00:02:09,030
And you just have to remember,
it's the part that's under the

37
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,700
radical sign of the
quadratic formula.

38
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,960
And that's why it matters,
because if this is greater

39
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,120
than 0, you're having a positive
square root, and

40
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,980
you'll have the positive and
negative version of it, you'll

41
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,860
have two solutions.

42
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:26,820
Now, what happens if b squared
minus 4ac is equal to 0?

43
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,930
If this is equal to 0-- if you
take b squared minus 4, times

44
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,170
a, times c, and that's equal to
0-- that tells us that this

45
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,040
part of the quadratic formula
is going to be 0, and the

46
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,970
square root of 0 is just 0.

47
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:43,450
And then, actually, your only
solution is going to be x is

48
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,970
going to be equal to
negative b over 2a.

49
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,480
Or another way to think
about it is you

50
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,090
only have one solution.

51
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,530
So if the discriminant
is equal to 0, you

52
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,756
only have one solution.

53
00:02:58,756 --> 00:03:01,300
   

54
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,320
And that solution is actually
going to be the vertex, or the

55
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,510
x-coordinate of the vertex,
because you're going to have a

56
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,860
parabola that just touches the
x-axis like that, just touches

57
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,640
there, or just touches like
that, just touches at exactly

58
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,490
one point, when b squared
minus 4ac is equal to 0.

59
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:24,130
And then the last situation
is if b squared minus 4ac

60
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,380
is less than 0.

61
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:31,370
   

62
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,880
Then over here, you're going to
get a negative number under

63
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,870
the radical.

64
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,770
And we saw an example of
that in the last video.

65
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,570
If we're dealing with real
numbers, we can't take a

66
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,960
square root of a negative
number, so this means that we

67
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,310
have no real solutions.

68
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,990
In the future, you're going to
see that we will have complex

69
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,300
solutions, but if we're dealing
with real numbers we

70
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,110
have no real solution.

71
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,340
Because this makes no sense.

72
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,760
The square of a negative number,
at least it makes no

73
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,830
sense in the real numbers.

74
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,030
And then there's more
you can think about.

75
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:06,340
If we do have a positive
discriminant, if b squared

76
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,350
minus 4ac is positive, we can
think about whether the

77
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,460
solutions are going to
be rational or not.

78
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,160
If this is 2, then we're going
to have the square root of 2

79
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,120
in our answer, it's going to
be an irrational answer, or

80
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,079
our solutions are going
to be irrational.

81
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,590
If b squared minus 4ac is 16,
we know that's a perfect

82
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,010
square, you take the square
root of a perfect square,

83
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,950
we're going to have
a rational answer.

84
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,570
Anyway, with all of that talk,
let's do some examples,

85
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,500
because I think that's
what makes all

86
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,700
of these ideas tangible.

87
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,510
So let's say I have the equation
negative x squared

88
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,670
plus 3x, minus 6
is equal to 0.

89
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,830
And all I'm concerned about is
I just want to know a little

90
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,990
bit about what kinds of
solutions this has.

91
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,630
I don't want to necessarily
even solve for x.

92
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,430
So if you're in a situation like
that, I can just look at

93
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,100
the discriminant.

94
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,320
I can just look at b
squared minus 4ac.

95
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:06,620
So the discriminant here is
what? b squared is 9 minus 4,

96
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:12,140
times a-- negative 1-- times
c, which is negative 6.

97
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,870
So what is this equal to?

98
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,220
This negative and that negative
cancel out, but we

99
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,420
still have that negative
out there, so it's 9

100
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,450
minus 4, times 6.

101
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:25,640
This is 9 minus 24, which
is less than 0.

102
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,190
So we're going to have a number
smaller than 0 under

103
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,070
the radical.

104
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:34,970
So we have no real solutions.

105
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,210
That was this scenario
right here.

106
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,970
And so this graph is going to
point downwards, because we

107
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,940
have a negative sign there,
so it probably looks like

108
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,520
something like that.

109
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,870
If that's the x-axis, the
graph is dipping down.

110
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:52,270
Its vertex is below the x-axis
and it's downward-opening, so

111
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,080
it never intersects
the x-axis.

112
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,680
We have no real solutions.

113
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,660
Let's do another one.

114
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:02,425
Let's say I have-- I'll do this
one in pink-- let's say I

115
00:06:02,425 --> 00:06:07,280
have the equation, 5x squared
is equal to 6x.

116
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,530
Well, let's put this in the
form that we're used to.

117
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,550
So let's subtract 6x from both
sides, and we get 5x squared

118
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:17,860
minus 6x is equal to 0.

119
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,560
And let's calculate
the discriminant.

120
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,320
So, we want to get b squared.

121
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:29,730
b squared is negative
6 squared minus 4,

122
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,070
times a, times c.

123
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,380
Well, where is the c here?

124
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,240
There is no c here.

125
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,580
There's a plus 0 that I'm
not writing here.

126
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,780
There's no c.

127
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,470
So in this situation,
c is equal to 0.

128
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,670
There is no c in
that equation.

129
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,500
So times 0.

130
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,930
So that all cancels out.

131
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,990
Negative 6 squared
is positive 36.

132
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,800
The discriminant is positive.

133
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,300
You'd have a positive 36 under
the radical right there, so

134
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,110
not only is it positive, it's
also a perfect square.

135
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:01,250
So this tells me that I'm going
to have two solutions.

136
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,390
So I'm going to have
two real solutions.

137
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,610
And not only are they're going
to be real, but I also know

138
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,100
they're going to be rational,
because I have the

139
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,160
square root of 36.

140
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,270
The square root of 36 is
positive or negative 6.

141
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,680
I don't end up with an
irrational number here, so two

142
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,055
real solutions that
are also rational.

143
00:07:19,055 --> 00:07:22,540
   

144
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:26,160
This is this scenario
right there.

145
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,440
And you could also have
irrational in this scenario,

146
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,160
so it's this [? here ?]

147
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,080
plus the irrational.

148
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,530
Let's do a couple more, just
to get really warmed.

149
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:41,160
Let's say I have 41x squared
minus 31x, minus

150
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,820
52 is equal to 0.

151
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,420
Once again, I just want to
think about what type of

152
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,240
solution I might be
dealing with.

153
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,330
So b squared minus 4ac.

154
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,540
b squared.

155
00:07:51,540 --> 00:08:01,350
Negative the 31 squared minus
4, times a, times 41, times

156
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,560
c-- times negative 52.

157
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,480
So what do I have here?

158
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,260
This is going to be a
positive 31 squared.

159
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,690
The negative times
the negative,

160
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,510
these are both positive.

161
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,920
So I'm going to have
a positive, right?

162
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,050
This is the same thing as 31
squared, plus-- this is a

163
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,220
positive number right here, I
mean, we could calculate it,

164
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,290
but it's 4 times 41, times 52.

165
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:26,240
All I care about is my
discriminant is positive.

166
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,550
It is greater than 0,
so that means I

167
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,980
have two real solutions.

168
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,039
And we could think about whether
this is some type of

169
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,700
perfect square.

170
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,850
I don't know.

171
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:37,990
I'm not going to do it here.

172
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,909
That would take a little
bit of computation.

173
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:44,780
So we know they're real, we
don't know if they're rational

174
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,810
or irrational solutions.

175
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,180
Let's do one more of these.

176
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:58,370
Let's say I have x squared
minus 8x, plus

177
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,050
16 is equal to 0.

178
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,620
Once again, let's look
at the discriminant.

179
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:08,460
b squared, that's negative 8
squared minus 4, times a,

180
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,350
which is 1, times
c, which is 16.

181
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:17,300
This is equal to 64 minus
64, which is equal to 0.

182
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:27,070
So we only have one solution,
and by definition it's going

183
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,000
to be rational.

184
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,600
I mean, you could actually
look at it right here.

185
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:36,360
It's x minus 4, times x
minus 4 is equal to 0.

186
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,615
The one solution is x
equal to positive 4.

187
00:09:40,615 --> 00:09:43,610
And when I say by definition of
the quadratic formula, you

188
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,390
look there, if this is a 0,
all you're left with is

189
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,230
negative b over 2a, which is
definitely going to be

190
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,110
rational, assuming you have a,
b, and c are, of course,

191
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,480
rational numbers.

192
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,410
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.

193
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,550
It's a quick way.

194
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,470
You don't have to go all the way
to solving the solution,

195
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:00,080
you just want to have to say
what types of solutions or how

196
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,910
many solutions, how many real
solutions, or inspect whether

197
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,120
they're real or rational.

198
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,320
The discriminant can be kind
of a useful shortcut.

199
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,640
And I also think it makes you
kind of appreciate the parts

200
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,590
of the quadratic formula
a little bit better.

201
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:13,866
