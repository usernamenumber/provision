1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
   

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,490
Solve the equation, 5 over
x minus 1 is equal to

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,130
3 over x plus 3.

4
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:07,930
And they give us two constraints
here. x can't be

5
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,410
negative 3 or 1.

6
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,570
And that's because if x was
negative 3, this expression

7
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,100
right here, you'd be dividing
by 0, it'd be undefined.

8
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,420
If x was 1, this expression
right here would be dividing

9
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,480
by 0 and it would
be undefined.

10
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,520
So let's see what
we can do here.

11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,000
So let me just rewrite
it so we have some

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,010
space to work with.

13
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:26,940
So 5 over x minus 1 is equal
to 3 over x plus 3.

14
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,230
We're going to assume
these constraints

15
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,370
throughout this video.

16
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,690
Now, I don't like having my x
terms in the denominator, so

17
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:37,330
let's see if we can get them
out of the denominator.

18
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,670
Well, a good place to start, if
we don't want this x plus 3

19
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,930
in the denominator right here,
we can multiply both sides of

20
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,695
this equation by x plus 3.

21
00:00:45,695 --> 00:00:49,310
   

22
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,510
Anything you do to one side
you have to do the other.

23
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,190
Now, by the same argument,
I don't like having

24
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,250
this x minus 1 here.

25
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,330
So let's multiply both sides of
the equation by x minus 1.

26
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:05,710
   

27
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,010
Now, when we do this, what's
going to happen?

28
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,310
Well, the whole point of
multiplying by x minus 1 is so

29
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,500
that that cancels
out with that.

30
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,150
And the whole reason behind
multiplying by x plus 3 is so

31
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:19,010
that this cancels
out with this.

32
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:31,410
So we end up with 5 times
x plus 3 is equal to 3

33
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,680
times x minus 1.

34
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,230
   

35
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,600
And all we did is we multiplied
both sides of the

36
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,260
equation by both denominators.

37
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,940
Both sides of the equation by
x plus 3 times x minus 1.

38
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,140
And this is where the whole
notion of cross multiplying

39
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,440
comes from.

40
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,100
When we did that, it looks like
we just took 5 times x

41
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,460
plus 3 is equal to 3
times x minus 1.

42
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,690
Which is a legitimate thing to
do, but it just comes from the

43
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:02,000
idea of multiplying both sides
by both denominators,

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,520
essentially in one step.

45
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,420
But now this is a pretty

46
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,750
straightforward linear equation.

47
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,300
We can just distribute the
numbers and get the x's on one

48
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,060
term-- on one side and just
solve for things.

49
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,550
So let's see, we have
5 times x plus 3.

50
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,500
That's the same thing as
5x plus 15 when you

51
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,780
distribute the 5.

52
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:22,780
And that's going to be equal
to 3x minus 3 when you

53
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,300
distribute the 3.

54
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,170
Now, let's get all the x's
on the left-hand side.

55
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,080
So let's subtract 3x
from both sides.

56
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,730
   

57
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,770
And we get 2x plus 15 is equal
to-- those cancel out-- is

58
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,710
equal to negative 3.

59
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:44,840
And then we can subtract
15 from both sides.

60
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,290
And we're left with 2x, this 2x,
is equal to-- negative 3

61
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,320
minus 15 is negative 18.

62
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,005
Divide both sides by 2.

63
00:02:54,005 --> 00:02:57,700
Divide both sides of the
equation by 2, and we're left

64
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,680
with x is equal to negative 18
over 2, which is negative 9.

65
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,390
We get x is equal
to negative 9.

66
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:09,400
And, of course, we say well,
it's good it doesn't equal one

67
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,010
of these things.

68
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,970
That would have messed
things up.

69
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,600
And now let's test. Let's make
sure that x does not equal

70
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,660
negative 9 satisfies
this equation.

71
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,010
Let's make sure it
satisfies it.

72
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:25,410
So 5 over negative 9 minus 1
is equal to-- let's see, 5

73
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,840
over negative 9 minus
1 is negative 10.

74
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,170
So it's equal to 5
over negative 10,

75
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,410
which is negative 1/2.

76
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,550
That's where I substitute
it into the

77
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,370
left-hand side of the equation.

78
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,160
Now, what happens when I
substitute it into the

79
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,410
right-hand side of
the equation?

80
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,760
   

81
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:47,540
3 over negative 9 plus 3 is
equal to 3 over negative 6,

82
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,610
which is equal to
negative 1/2.

83
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:53,110
So the left-hand side does equal
the right-hand side when

84
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:57,620
x is equal to negative 9.

85
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,400
And to some degree, they didn't
even have to write this

86
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,760
condition here, because the only
x for which this is true

87
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,070
is x is equal to negative 9.

88
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:09,090
That's the only thing that you
can legitimately put in here

89
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,260
and this equality holding.

90
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,066
