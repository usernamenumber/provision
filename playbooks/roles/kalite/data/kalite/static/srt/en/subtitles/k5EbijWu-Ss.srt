99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Lets say you are trying to make some kind of product

2
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And the Product is for the United States

3
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, ideally, you would like to know the 'Mean Height of Men' in the United States

4
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Let me write this down...

5
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
"Mean Height of Men in the US"

6
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So how would you do that?

7
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
When I talk about the mean, I am talking about the Arithmetic Mean

8
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If I were to talk about some other types of means; and there are other types of means,like the Geometric Mean, I would specify

9
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But when people just say mean, they are usually talking about the Arithmetic Mean.

10
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
So, how would you go about finding the mean height of men in the US?

11
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, the obvious one is you go and ask or measure every man in the US

12
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
take their height, add them all together, and then divide by the number of men there are in the US.

13
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
But the question you would ask yourself is

14
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Whether that is practical?

15
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Because you have on the order, see over here about 300 million people in the US

16
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
roughly half of them will be men, or at least still be male
