00:00:01,127 --> 00:00:05,264
What we are going to try to understand in this video

2
00:00:05,264 --> 00:00:09,646
is the balance of payments.

3
00:00:09,646 --> 00:00:16,263
It's really how a country accounts for the different ways that money is flowing into the country or

4
00:00:16,263 --> 00:00:21,264
payments are happening into a country or payments are happening outside of a country.

5
00:00:21,264 --> 00:00:25,814
And right over here I have information for the United States in 2011

6
00:00:25,814 --> 00:00:29,447
all of the numbers right over here are denominated in dollars

7
00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:35,164
and in green I have all the reasons why currency or why payments would be made to the US

8
00:00:35,164 --> 00:00:40,415
either the government of the US or the federal reserve of the US or to citizens of the US

9
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:45,897
and in orange I have all the reasons why payments would be made to folks outside of the US

10
00:00:45,897 --> 00:00:49,147
either the government, central banks or private citizens.

11
00:00:49,147 --> 00:00:54,931
And for this video, I'm going to first focus on the left hand, these reasons right over here.
