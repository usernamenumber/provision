1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620
   

2
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,060
We've got the function f of x
is equal to x plus 2 squared

3
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:07,350
plus 1, and we've constrained
our domain that x has to be

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,380
greater than or equal
to negative 2.

5
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,390
That's where we've
defined our function.

6
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:13,180
And we want to
find its inverse.

7
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,560
And I'll leave you to think
about why we had to constrain

8
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,750
it to x being a greater than
or equal to negative 2.

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,960
Wouldn't it have been possible
to find the inverse if we had

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,390
just left it as the
full parabola?

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,900
I'll leave you -- or maybe I'll
make a future video about that.

12
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,450
But let's just figure
out the inverse here.

13
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,520
So, like we've said in
the first video, in the

14
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,930
introduction to inverses, we're
trying to find a mapping.

15
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,120
Or, if we were to say that y --
if we were to say that y is

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,350
equal to x plus 2
squared plus 1.

17
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,480
This is the function you give
me an x and it maps to y.

18
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,870
We want to go the other way.

19
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,980
We want to take, I'll give you
a y and then map it to an x.

20
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,430
So what we do is, we
essentially just solve

21
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,920
for x in terms of y.

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,610
So let's do that one
step at a time.

23
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:00,600
So, the first thing to do, we
could subtract 1 from both

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,610
sides of this equation.

25
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:09,200
y minus 1 is equal to
x plus 2 squared.

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,440
And now to solve here,
you might want to

27
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,270
take the square root.

28
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,180
And that actually will be
the correct thing to do.

29
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,115
But it's very important to
think about whether you want

30
00:01:15,115 --> 00:01:17,680
to take the positive or
the negative square

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,080
root at this step.

32
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,200
So we've constrained our domain
to x is greater than or

33
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,770
equal to negative 2.

34
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:27,500
So this value right here, x
plus 2, if x is always greater

35
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,870
than or equal to negative
2, x plus 2 will always be

36
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,480
greater than or equal to 0.

37
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:37,170
So this expression right here,
this right here is positive.

38
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,160
This is positive.

39
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,130
So we have a positive squared.

40
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:44,840
So if we really want to get to
the x plus 2 in the appropriate

41
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,370
domain, we want to take
the positive square root.

42
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,530
And in the next video or the
video after that, we'll solve

43
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,530
an example where you want to
take the negative square root.

44
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,650
So we're going to take
theundefined positive square

45
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,880
root, or just the principal
root, which is just the square

46
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,910
root sign, of both sides.

47
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:06,740
So you get the square root of y
minus 1 is equal to x plus 2.

48
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,800
And one thing I should have
remembered to do is, from

49
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,630
the beginning we had
a constraint on x.

50
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:15,840
We had for x is greater than
or equal to negative 2.

51
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,520
But what constraint
could we have on y?

52
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,000
If you look at the graph right
here, x is greater than

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,430
equal to negative 2.

54
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,610
But what's why?

55
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,880
What is the range of y-values
that we can get here?

56
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,620
Well, if you just look at
the graph, y will always be

57
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,060
greater than or equal to 1.

58
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,670
And that just comes from the
fact that this term right

59
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:40,400
here is always going to be
greater than or equal to 0.

60
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,910
So the minimum value that the
function could take on is 1.

61
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,620
So we could say for x is
greater than or equal to

62
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,960
negative 2, and we could add
that y is always going to be

63
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,790
greater than or equal to 1.

64
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,710
y is always greater
than or equal to 1.

65
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,130
The function is always
greater than or equal

66
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,160
to that right there.

67
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,530
To 1.

68
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,730
And the reason why I want to
write it at the stage is

69
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,830
because, you know, later
on, we're going to swap

70
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,000
the the x's and y's.

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,800
So let's just leave that there.

72
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,130
So here we haven't explicitly
solved for x and y.

73
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:14,700
But we can write for y is
greater than or equal to 1,

74
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,300
this is going to be the domain
for our inverse, so to speak.

75
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,040
And so here we can keep
it for y is greater

76
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,980
than or equal to 1.

77
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,790
This y constraint's
going to matter more.

78
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,260
Because over here,
the domain is x.

79
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,710
But for the inverse, the domain
is going to be the y-value.

80
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,480
And then, let's see.

81
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,520
We have the square root of y
minus 1 is equal to x plus 2.

82
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,990
Now we can subtract
2 from both sides.

83
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:44,570
We get the square root of y
minus 1 minus 2, is equal

84
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:51,430
to x for y is greater
than or equal to 1.

85
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,810
And so we've solved
for x in terms of y.

86
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,960
Or, we could say, let me just
write it the other way.

87
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,420
We could say, x is equal to,
I'm just swapping this. x is

88
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:06,200
equal to the square root of y
minus one minus 2, for y is

89
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,110
greater than or equal to one.

90
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,550
So you see, now, the way
we've written it out.

91
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,640
y is the input into the
function, which is going to be

92
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,970
the inverse of that function.

93
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,880
x the output. x is
now the range.

94
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,440
So we could even rewrite
this as f inverse of y.

95
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,170
That's what x is, is equal to
the square root of y minus 1

96
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:30,110
minus 2, for y is greater
than or equal to 1.

97
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,760
And this is the
inverse function.

98
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,160
We could say this
is our answer.

99
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,600
But many times, people want
the answer in terms of x.

100
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,400
And we know we could
put anything in here.

101
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,750
If we put an a here, we
take f inverse of a.

102
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,750
It'll become the square root
of a minus 1 minus 2, 4.

103
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,180
Well, assuming a is greater
than or equal to 1.

104
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,530
But we could put an x in here.

105
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,840
So we can just rename
the the y for x.

106
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,950
So we could just do
a renaming here.

107
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,630
So we can just rename y for x.

108
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,340
And then we would get -- let
me scroll down a little bit.

109
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,150
We would f inverse of x.

110
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:03,870
I'll highlight it here.

111
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,530
Just to show you, we're
renaming y with x.

112
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:10,180
You could rename it with
anything really, is equal to

113
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,680
the square root of x minus 1.

114
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,980
Of x minus 1.

115
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:23,380
Minus 2 for, we have to
rename this to, for x being

116
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,840
greater than or equal to 1.

117
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,300
And so we now have our inverse
function as a function of x.

118
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,200
And if we were to graph it,
let's try our best to graph it.

119
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,290
Maybe the easiest thing to do
is to draw some points here.

120
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,700
So the smallest value
x can take on is 1.

121
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,370
If you put a 1 here,
you get a 0 here.

122
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,880
So the point 1, negative 2,
is on our inverse graph.

123
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,000
So 1, negative 2
is right there.

124
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,040
And then if we go to 2,
let's see, 2 minus 1 is 1.

125
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,430
The principle root
of that is 1.

126
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,100
Minus 2.

127
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,710
So it's negative 1, so
the point, 2, negative

128
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,960
1 is right there.

129
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,890
And let's think about it.

130
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:02,180
Let's see.

131
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,410
If we did 5, I'm trying
take perfect squares.

132
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:07,730
5 minus 1 is 4, minus 2.

133
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,330
So the point 5, 2 is,
let me make sure.

134
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,350
5 minus 1 is 4.

135
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,220
Square root is 2.

136
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,090
Minus 2 is 0.

137
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,850
So the point 5, 0 is here.

138
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,330
And so the inverse graph, it's
only defined for x greater

139
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,200
than or equal to negative 1.

140
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,040
So the inverse graph is going
to look something like this.

141
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,260
It's going to look something
like, I started off

142
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,200
well, and it got messy.

143
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,760
So it's going to look
something like that.

144
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,820
Just like that.

145
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,520
And just like we saw, in the
first, the introduction to

146
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,190
function inverses, these are
mirror images around

147
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,510
the line y equals x.

148
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:45,070
Let me graph y equals
x. y equals x.

149
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:49,370
y equals x is that
line right there.

150
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,060
Notice, they're mirror
images around that line.

151
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:57,520
Over here, we map
the value 0 to 5.

152
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,250
If x is 0, it gets mapped to 5.

153
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,270
Here we go the other way.

154
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:06,120

00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,660
We've essentially
swapped the x and y.
