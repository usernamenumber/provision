1
00:00:00,689 --> 00:00:02,032
Let's say that you're curious about people's TV watching habits.

2
00:00:02,032 --> 00:00:09,815
And, in particular, how much TV do people in the country watch.

3
00:00:14,329 --> 00:00:16,736
So what you're concerned with, if we imagine the entire country,

4
00:00:16,736 --> 00:00:19,043
and we've already talked about, especially if we're talking about a country like the United States, but pretty much any country has a large population.

5
00:00:19,043 --> 00:00:24,173
And the United States we're talking about on the order of 300 million people.

6
00:00:24,173 --> 00:00:38,894
Ideally, if you could somehow magically do it, you'd survey or somehow observe all 300 million people and take the mean of how many hours of TV they watch on average.

7
00:00:38,894 --> 00:00:39,573
On a given day.

8
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:43,192
And that will give you, that will give you, the parameter. The Population Mean.

9
00:00:43,192 --> 00:00:50,240
But we have already talked about in a case like this that's very impractical, even if you tried to do it, by the time you did it your data might be stale.

10
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:55,694
Some people might have passed away, other people might have been born. Who knows what might have happened?

11
00:00:55,694 --> 00:01:06,611
So this is a truth that is out there, this is, there is a theoretical population mean for the amount of, the average or the mean of average hours of TV watched per day.

12
00:01:06,611 --> 00:01:09,078
By Americans.

13
00:01:09,078 --> 00:01:11,458
There is a truth here a any give point in time.

14
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:15,124
It's just pretty much impossible to come up with the exact answer.

15
00:01:15,124 --> 00:01:17,533
Come up with this exact truth.

16
00:01:17,533 --> 00:01:31,812
But you don't give up, you say "Well, may I don't have to survey all 300 million or observe all 300 million. Instead I'm just doing to observe a sample. I'm just going to observe a sample right over here."

17
00:01:31,812 --> 00:01:35,740
And lets say, just to make the computation simple, you do a sample of 6.

18
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:41,056
We'll talk about later why 6 might not be as large of a sample as you'd like.

19
00:01:41,056 --> 00:01:44,287
But you survey how much TV these folks watch.

20
00:01:44,287 --> 00:01:54,994
And you get that they - you find one person who watched 1 and a half hours, another watched 2 and a half hours, another person watched 4 hours.

21
00:01:54,994 --> 00:02:00,908
And then you get one person who watched 2 hours, and then you get 2 people who watched 1 hour each.

22
00:02:00,908 --> 00:02:09,509
So given this data from your sample, what do you get as your sample mean?

23
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:20,223
Well the sample, which we would denote by lower case x with a bar over it, is just the sum of all these divided by the number of data points we have.

24
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:30,588
So let's see: we have 1.5 + 2.5 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 1.

25
00:02:30,588 --> 00:02:33,156
And all of that divided by six, which gives us- lets see.

26
00:02:33,156 --> 00:02:43,324
The numerator 1.5 + 2.5 is 4 + 4 is 8 + 2 is 10 + 2 more is 12. So this is going to be 12 over 6.

27
00:02:43,324 --> 00:02:47,188
Which is equal to 2 hours of Television.

28
00:02:47,188 --> 00:02:55,660
So at least for your sample you say "My sample mean is 2 hours of television." It's an estimate, it's a statistic that is trying to estimate this parameter, this thing that is very hard to know

29
00:02:56,461 --> 00:03:02,916
But it's our best shot. Maybe we'll get a better answer if we have more data points, but it's what we have so far.

30
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:12,205
Now the next question you ask yourself is "While I just don't want to estimate my population mean, I also, I also want to estimate another parameter."

31
00:03:12,205 --> 00:03:17,978
"I also am interested in estimating my population varience."

32
00:03:17,978 --> 00:03:24,690
So once again, because we can't survey everyone in the population, this is pretty much impossible to know.

33
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:32,625
But we're going to attempt to estimate this parameter. We attempted to estimate the mean now will also attempt to estimate this parameter, this varience.

34
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,078
Parameter

35
00:03:34,078 --> 00:03:35,922
So how would you do it?

36
00:03:35,922 --> 00:03:43,989
Well, reasonable logic would say, "Maybe we'll do the same thing to the sample as we would have done with the population."

37
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:51,555
When you do the population varience you take each point, each data point in the population, find the difference between that and the normal, the population mean.

38
00:03:51,555 --> 00:03:59,520
Take the square of that difference and then add up the squares of all those differences and then divide by number of data points you have.

39
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:07,074
So let's try that over here. Let's try to find. Take each of these data points, take each of these data points and find the difference

40
00:04:07,074 --> 00:04:07,820
- I'm going to do that in a different color -

41
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:15,600
The difference between that data point, The difference between that data point and our sample mean.

42
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,570
Not our population mean, we don't know what the population mean. The sample mean.

43
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:24,640
So that first Data point plus the second data point.

44
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:31,678
So that's 4 minus 2 squared plus 1 minus 2 squared

45
00:04:31,678 --> 00:04:38,803
and this is what you would have done if you were taking a population varience. If this were your population this is how you would find your population mean.

46
00:04:38,803 --> 00:04:45,953
You would find the squared distance for each of thos data points and then divide by the number of data points.

47
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,680
Let's just think about this for a little bit.

48
00:04:47,680 --> 00:05:13,439
1 minus 2, squared, then you have 2.5 minus 2 squared. 2.5 minus 2, 2 being the sample mean. Plus let me see (this green color) plus 2 minus 2, squared, plus 1 minus 2 squared and then maybe you would divide by the number of data points you have.

49
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,895
Where you have the number of data points. So in this case we're dividing by 6.

50
00:05:16,895 --> 00:05:20,075
And what would we get in this circumstance?

51
00:05:20,075 --> 00:05:36,873
Well, if we just do the computation: 1.5-2 is -.5, we square that. this becomes a positive 0.25 4-2 squared is going to be 2 squared so that's 4.

52
00:05:36,873 --> 00:05:55,675
1-2 squared is just -1 squared so that's 1. 2.5 - 2 is .5 squared, is 0.25. 2-2 squared, well that's just 0. and then 1-2 squared is, is 1.

53
00:05:55,675 --> 00:06:05,244
it's negative 1 squared so we just get 1. and if we add all of this up, let me see. let me add the whole numbers first.

54
00:06:05,244 --> 00:06:11,693
4+1 is 5 plus 1 is 6, and we have 2 .25. so this is, let me write this in a neutral color, this is going to be 6.5 over

55
00:06:11,693 --> 00:06:21,164
over this 6 right over here. and we could write this as well there's a couple of ways we could write this, but I'll just get the calculator out and we can just calculate it.

56
00:06:21,164 --> 00:06:39,035
so 6.5 divided by 6, if we round it's approximately 1.08.

57
00:06:39,035 --> 00:06:47,476
so it's approximately 1.08. Is this calculation.

58
00:06:47,476 --> 00:06:59,727
Now, what we have to think about is whether this is the best calculation, whether this si the best estimate for the population varience, given the data we have.

59
00:06:59,727 --> 00:07:08,054
You can always aruge that we could have more data, but given the data we have, is this the best calculation we can make to estimate the population varience?

60
00:07:08,054 --> 00:07:10,802
And I'll have you think about for a second.

61
00:07:10,802 --> 00:07:16,412
Well, it turns out this is close, this is close, to the best calculation.

62
00:07:16,412 --> 00:07:23,070
The best estimate we can make given the data we have. And sometimes this will be called the sample varience.

63
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:27,488
But it's a particular type of sample varience where we just divide by the number of data points we have.

64
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:37,123
So people will write an N over here. This is one way to difine a sample varience and an attempt to estimate our population varience.

65
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:50,096
But it turns out, in the next video I'll give you an intuitive explanation of why it turns out this way, and then I'd also like to write a computer simulation for experimentally it makes you feel a little better.

66
00:07:50,096 --> 00:07:55,387
But it turns out you're to get a better estimate, and it's a little weird and voodoo-ish at first, when you first think about it.

67
00:07:55,387 --> 00:08:02,408
You're going to get a better estimate for your population varience for your population varience if you don't divide by 6.

68
00:08:02,408 --> 00:08:08,571
If you doint divide by the number of data points you have, but you divide by one less than the number of data point you have.

69
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:12,518
So how would we do that? We can note that as sample varience.

70
00:08:12,518 --> 00:08:22,921
When most people talk about the sample varience, they're talking about the sample varience wher eyou do this calculation, but instead of dividing by 6 you were to divide by 5.

71
00:08:22,921 --> 00:08:26,941
So they'd say you divide by N-1.

72
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:43,249
So what would we get in those circumstances? Well, the top part is going to be the exact same, we're going to get 6.5. but on the denominator our N is 6, we have six data points, but were' going to divide by one less than six

73
00:08:43,249 --> 00:08:49,436
We're going to divide by 5. And 6.5 divided by 5 is equal to 1.3.

74
00:08:49,436 --> 00:08:55,655
So when we calculate our sample varience by this technique, which is the more mainstream technique, but it seems voodoo.

75
00:08:55,655 --> 00:09:00,241
Why are we dividing by N-1, where for population varience we'd divide by N?

76
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:04,821
But remember, we're trying to estimate the population varience. But it turns out this is a better estimate.

77
00:09:04,821 --> 00:09:11,162
Because this, this calculation is underestimating what the population varience is.

78
00:09:11,162 --> 00:09:17,871
This is a better estimate. We don't know what it is. These both could be way off. It could be just by chance what we happened to sample.

79
00:09:17,871 --> 00:09:23,901
Over many samples, and there's many ways to think about it, this is going to be a better calculation.

80
00:09:23,901 --> 00:09:26,501
It's going to give you a better estimate.

81
00:09:26,501 --> 00:09:31,515
So how would we write this down? How would we write this down with Mathematical notation?

82
00:09:31,515 --> 00:09:42,137
Well, we could - remember, we're taking the sum and we're taking each of the data points, so we'll start with the first data point, all the way to the Nth data point.

83
00:09:42,137 --> 00:09:50,488
This lower case n says 'hey, we're looking at the sample'. If I'd said Upper case N, that usually denotes we're looking at the whole population.

84
00:09:50,488 --> 00:09:53,595
But here we're looking at a sample of size lower case n.

85
00:09:53,595 --> 00:10:01,702
And we're taking each data point. So each x sub i, and from it we're subtracting, we're subtracting the sample mean.

86
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:15,052
And then we're squaring it, we're taking the sum of the square distances, and then we're dividing not by number of data points we have, but by one less than the number.

87
00:10:15,052 --> 00:10:16,795
Of data points we have.

88
00:10:16,795 --> 00:10:20,889
So this calculation, where we summed up all of this, then we divided by 5, not by 6.

89
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:27,464
THis is the standard definition of sample. of sample varience.

90
00:10:27,464 --> 00:10:34,415
So I'll leave you there, and in the next video I'll attempt to give you an intuition of why we're dividing by N-1.

91
00:10:34,415 --> 00:10:38,000
Instead of dividing by N.
