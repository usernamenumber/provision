1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520
   

2
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,450
I've got a function f and it's
a mapping from the set

3
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:08,340
x to the set y.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,180
And let's just say for the sake
of argument, let's say

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,430
that f is invertible.

6
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,760
   

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,960
What I want to know is what
does this imply about this

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,460
equation right here.

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,320
The equation f of
x is equal to y.

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,580
I want to know that for every
y that's a member of our

11
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,500
co-domains.

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:38,420
So for every y, let me write
this down, for every y that's

13
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:46,830
a member of my co-domain is
there a unique, in all caps

14
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:54,730
UNIQUE, solution x that's
a member of our domain.

15
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:58,030
Such that, and I could write
such that well, I'll just

16
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:58,990
write it out.

17
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,140
I was going to write the mathy
way, but I think it's nicer to

18
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,510
write in the actual
words sometimes.

19
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,110
Such that f of x
is equal to y.

20
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,810
So if we just, let me
just draw everything

21
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,410
out a little bit.

22
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,640
We have our set x right here.

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,900
This is x.

24
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,180
We have our co-domain y here.

25
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,420
We know that f, if you take some
point here, let's call

26
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:27,450
that a, it's a member of x and
you apply the function f to

27
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,210
it, it will map you to some
element in set y.

28
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,870
So that's f of a right there.

29
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:37,550
This is, so far, what
this tells us.

30
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:41,560
Now I want to look at this
equation here, and I want to

31
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,280
know that if I can pick any y
in this set any lower-case y

32
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,590
in this set y.

33
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:51,490
So let's say I pick
something here.

34
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:54,150
Let's say that's b.

35
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,370
I want to know is there a
unique solution to the

36
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:01,690
equation f of x is equal to b.

37
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:06,920
Is there a unique solution?

38
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,110
So one, I guess, you have to
think, is there a solution.

39
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,600
So is there a solution to
saying, look is there some x

40
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,210
here that if I apply the
transformation f to it that I

41
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:21,140
get there, and I also want
to know is it unique.

42
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,800
For example, if this is the only
one that is unique, but

43
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,750
it's not unique if there's some
other guy, if there is

44
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,690
more than one, solution.

45
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,680
If there is some other guy
in x that if I apply the

46
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,080
transformation I also go to b.

47
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,795
This would make it non-unique,
not unique.

48
00:02:35,795 --> 00:02:38,590
   

49
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,000
So what I want to concern
ourselves with in this video

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,780
is somehow, is invertibility
related to the idea of a

51
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,500
unique solution to this for
any y in our co-domain.

52
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,820
So let's just work through our
definitions of invertibility

53
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,310
and see if we can get anywhere
constructive.

54
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:03,940
So by definition, f is
invertible implies that there

55
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,340
exists this little backward
looking, three-looking thing,

56
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,580
this means there exists.

57
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,670
I think it's nice to be exposed
sometimes to the mathy

58
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,380
notations Let me just
write that.

59
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:18,140
   

60
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:26,070
That means there exists some
function, let's call it f

61
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:39,910
inverse, that's a mapping from
y to x, such that, and

62
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,530
actually the colons are also the
shorthand for such that,

63
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,780
but I'll write it out.

64
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,855
   

65
00:03:48,855 --> 00:03:57,090
Such that the composition of f
inverse with f is equal to the

66
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,130
identity on x.

67
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,910
So, essentially, it's saying
look, if I apply f to

68
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:05,060
something in x then I apply f
inverse to that, I'm going to

69
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,160
get back to that point which is,
essentially, equivalent.

70
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,560
Or it isn't just essentially
equivalent, it is equivalent

71
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,850
to just applying the identity
function, So that's i x.

72
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,769
So you just get what
you put into it.

73
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:19,722
Such that this inverse function,
the composition of

74
00:04:19,722 --> 00:04:21,320
the inverse with the function,
is equal to

75
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,730
the identity function.

76
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:27,650
And that the composition of the
function with the inverse

77
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,540
function is equal to the
identity function on y.

78
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:35,800
So if you started y and you
apply the inverse, then you

79
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,260
apply the function to that,
you're going to end up back at

80
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,490
y at that same point.

81
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,880
And that's equivalent
to just applying

82
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,350
the identity function.

83
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,860
So this is what invertibility
tells me, this is how I

84
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,990
defined invertibility
in the last video.

85
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,400
Now we concerned ourselves-- so
we are concerned with this

86
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,400
equation up here.

87
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,650
We're concerned with the
equation, I will write it in

88
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:01,920
pink, f of x is equal to y.

89
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,930
And what we want to know for
any y, or any lower-case

90
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,790
cursive y in our big set
y, is there a unique

91
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,050
x solution to this.

92
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,760
So, what we can do is we know
that f is invertible.

93
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,600
I told you that from
the get-go.

94
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,930
So given that f is invertible,
we know that there is this f

95
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:26,240
inverse function, and I can
apply that f inverse function.

96
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,880
It's a mapping from y to x.

97
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,240
So, I can apply it to
any element in y.

98
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,280
So for any y, let's say that
this is my y right there.

99
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,670
So I can apply my f
inverse to that y.

100
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,520
And I'm going to go over here
and, of course, y is

101
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,260
equal to f of x.

102
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,470
These are the exact
same points.

103
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,560
So let's apply our f inverse
function to this.

104
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,790
So if I apply the f inverse
function to both sides of the

105
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:59,850
equation, this right here's an
element in y, and this is the

106
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:00,850
same element in y.

107
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:01,100
Right?

108
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,570
They are the same element.

109
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,630
Now, if I apply the mapping, the
inverse mapping, to both

110
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:10,740
of that, that's going to take
me to some element in x.

111
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,070
So let's do that.

112
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:19,990
So, if I take the inverse
function on both sides of this

113
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:24,150
equation, where some element
over here in y, and I'm taking

114
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,650
the inverse function to get to
some element in x, what's this

115
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,330
going to be equal to?

116
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,940
Well, on the right-hand side,
we could just write the f

117
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,440
inverse of y.

118
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,850
That's going to be some
element over here.

119
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:39,150
But what does the left-hand
side of this equation

120
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,470
translate to?

121
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,810
The definition of this inverse
function is that when you take

122
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,520
the composition with f, you're
going to end up with the

123
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,410
identity function.

124
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,820
This is going to be equivalent
to-- let me write it this way.

125
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,330
This is equal to the composition
of f inverse with

126
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:56,790
f of x, which is equivalent to
the identity function being

127
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,120
applied to x.

128
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,090
And then the identity function
being applied to x is what?

129
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:01,970
That's just x.

130
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:05,310
This thing right here
just reduces to x.

131
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,750
This reduces to x.

132
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,040
So, we started with the idea
that f is invertible.

133
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,340
We use the definition of
invertibility that there

134
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,760
exists this inverse function
right there.

135
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,140
And then we essentially apply
the inverse function to both

136
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,590
sides of this equation and say,
look you give me any y,

137
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:26,340
any lower-case cursive y in this
set y, and I will find

138
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,100
you a unique x.

139
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:33,660
This is the only x that
satisfies this equation.

140
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,760
Remember how do I know
it's the only x?

141
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,130
Because this is the only
possible inverse function.

142
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:42,690
   

143
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,740
Only one inverse function
which is true.

144
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,550
I proved that to you
in the last video.

145
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,880
That if f is invertible,
it only has one

146
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,050
unique inverse function.

147
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:55,030
We tried before to have maybe
two inverse functions, but we

148
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,140
saw they have to be
the same thing.

149
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,590
So since we only have one
inverse function and it

150
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:03,940
applies to anything in this big
upper-case set y, we know

151
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,800
we have a solution.

152
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,630
And because it's only one
inverse function, and

153
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:10,980
functions only map to one value
in this case, then we

154
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,470
know this is a unique
solution.

155
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,680
So let's write this down.

156
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,660
So we've established that if f
is invertible, I'll do this in

157
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:35,409
orange, then the equation f of
x is equal to y for all.

158
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:37,470
That little v that it looks
like it's filled up with

159
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:44,660
something, for all y, the member
of our set y, has a

160
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,910
unique solution.

161
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:56,160
   

162
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,370
And that unique solution, if you
really care about it, is

163
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,710
going to be the inverse
function applied to y.

164
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,440
It might seem like a bit of a
no brainer, but you can see

165
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,436
you have to be a little bit
precise about it in order to

166
00:09:07,436 --> 00:09:08,460
get to the point you want.

167
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,740
Let's see if the opposite
is true.

168
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,680
Let's see if we assume-- let's
see if we start from the

169
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:23,010
assumption, that for all y that
is a member of our set Y,

170
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:29,530
that the solution, that the
equation f of x, is equal to y

171
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:36,490
has a unique solution.

172
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:39,440
Let's assume this and see if it
can get us the other way.

173
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,690
If given this, we can
prove invertibility.

174
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,060
So let's think about
the first way.

175
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:49,650
So we're saying that for any y--
let me draw my sets again.

176
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,350
   

177
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:59,210
So this is my set X and this
is my set Y right there.

178
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,440
Now we're working for the
assumption that you can pick

179
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,670
any element in Y right here,
and then the equation right

180
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,550
here has a unique solution.

181
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,700
Let's call that unique
solution.

182
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,220
Well, we could call
it whatever.

183
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,610
But a unique solution x.

184
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,130
So you can pick any point here,
and I've given you,

185
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:21,810
we're assuming now, that, look,
you pick a point in Y, I

186
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,880
can find you some point
in X such that f of

187
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,360
x is equal to y.

188
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,040
And not only can I find
that for you,

189
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,580
that is a unique solution.

190
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,390
So given that, let me define
a new function.

191
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,450
Let me define the function s.

192
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:40,890
The function s is a mapping
from y to x.

193
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:47,740
It's a mapping from y to x and s
of, let's say s of y, where,

194
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:52,420
of course, y is a member
of our set capital-Y.

195
00:10:52,420 --> 00:11:09,540
s of y is equal to the unique
solution in x to f of x is

196
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,310
equal to y.

197
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,060
Now, you're saying, hey, Sal, it
looks a little convoluted.

198
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,010
But think about it.

199
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,980
This is a completely valid
function definition.

200
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,470
Right?

201
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,520
We're starting with the idea
that you give me any y here.

202
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:25,260
You give me any member of this
set, and I can always find you

203
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,010
a unique solution to
this equation.

204
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:31,450
Well OK, so that means that any
guy here can be associated

205
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:34,280
with a unique solution in the
set X, where the unique

206
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,610
solution is the unique
solution to

207
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,920
this equation here.

208
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,160
So, why don't I just define a
function that says, look I'm

209
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,380
going to associate every member
y with its unique

210
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,210
solution to f of x
is equal to y.

211
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,760
That's how I'm defining this
function right here.

212
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,430
And, of course, this is
a completely valid

213
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,920
mapping from y to x.

214
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,630
And we know that this only has
one legitimate value because

215
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:59,830
this, any value y, any
lower-case value y, in this

216
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:03,430
set has a unique solution
to f of x is equal to y.

217
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,430
So this can only equal
one value.

218
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,680
So it's well defined.

219
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:15,670
So let's apply, let's take some
element here, let me do a

220
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,050
good color, let's
say this is b.

221
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,520
And b is a member of y.

222
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,970
So let's find, so let's just map
it using our new function

223
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:24,450
right here.

224
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:29,650
So let's take it, and map it,
and this is s of b right here.

225
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:35,390
s of b which is a member of x
Now, we know that s of b is a

226
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,450
unique solution by definition.

227
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,650
I know it seems a little
circular, but it's not.

228
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,600
We know that s of
b is a solution.

229
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:56,720
So we know that s of b is the
unique solution to f of x is

230
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,530
equal to b.

231
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:01,670
Well, if this is the case, if
this is good, we just got this

232
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,640
because this is what
this function does.

233
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:08,350
It maps every y to the unique
solution to this equation.

234
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,910
Because we said that every
y has a unique solution.

235
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,810
So, if this is the case,
then what happens if I

236
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:17,150
take f of s of b.

237
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,190
Well, I just said this is the
unique solution to this.

238
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:23,250
So if I put this guy in here,
what am I going to get?

239
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,410
I'm going to get b.

240
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:31,810
Or other way of saying this is
that the composition of f with

241
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:37,730
s applied to b is equal to b.

242
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:41,440
Or another way to say it, is
that we take the composition

243
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,290
of f with s, this is the same
thing, because if I apply s to

244
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:49,090
b, and then I apply f back to
that, that's the composition,

245
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,170
I just get back to b.

246
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,100
That's what's happening here.

247
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,370
So this is the same thing as
the identity function on y

248
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,730
being applied to b.

249
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:58,400
So it's equal to b.

250
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,520
So we can say that the
composition-- we can say that

251
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,670
there exists, and we know that
this function exists, or that

252
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,700
we can always construct this.

253
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,450
So we already know
that this exists.

254
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,650
This existed by me constructing
it, but I've,

255
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,960
hopefully, shown you that
this is well defined.

256
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:20,100
That from our assumption that
this always has a unique

257
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,710
solution in x for any y here, I
can define this in a fairly

258
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,330
reasonable way.

259
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,700
So it definitely exists.

260
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,230
And not only does it exist,
but we know that the

261
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:33,020
composition of f with this
function that I just

262
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:42,710
constructed here is equal to
the identity function on y.

263
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:46,460
Now let's do another
little experiment.

264
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:50,240
Let's take a particular-- let
me just draw sets again.

265
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,850
   

266
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,190
This is our set X.

267
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:58,790
Let me take some member
of set X, call it a.

268
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:02,880
Let me take my set
Y right there.

269
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,350
And so we can apply the function
to a and we'll get a

270
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,210
member of set Y.

271
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,960
Let's call that right there.

272
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:15,880
Let's call that f of
a right there.

273
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,120
Now, if I apply my magic
function here that always, I

274
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,170
can give you any member of set Y
and I'll give you the unique

275
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,800
solution in X to
this equation.

276
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,400
So, let me apply that to this.

277
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,290
Let me apply s to this.

278
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:33,440
So, if I apply s to this it'll
give me the unique solution.

279
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,580
So, let me write this down.

280
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:44,050
So if I apply s to this, I'm
going to apply s to this-- and

281
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,050
maybe I shouldn't point it back
at that, I don't want to

282
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,400
imply that it necessarily
points back at that.

283
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,490
So, let me apply s
that, s to this.

284
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,200
So what is this going
to point to?

285
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,040
What is that point going
to be right there?

286
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:03,790
So that's going to be s of this
point, which is f of a,

287
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:06,840
which we know is the
unique solution.

288
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:15,570
So, this is equal to the
unique solution to the

289
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:23,670
equation f of x is equal
to this y right here.

290
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,360
Or this y right here is
just called f of a.

291
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,240
Right?

292
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,820
Remember, the mapping s just
mapped you from any member of

293
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,010
a to the unique solution
to the equation f of

294
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,600
x is equal to that.

295
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,650
So this is the mapping from f of
a to the unique, so this s

296
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:44,340
of f of a is going to be a
mapping to the-- or this right

297
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,360
here, is going to be the
unique solution to the

298
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,880
equation f of x is equal
to this member of y.

299
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,740
And what's the remember
y I called?

300
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:55,760
It's called f of a.

301
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,120
Well, you could go say this in
a very convoluted way, but if

302
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,880
I were to just, before you
learned any linear algebra, if

303
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,470
I said look if I have the
equation f of x is

304
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,020
equal to f of a.

305
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,160
What is the unique solution
to this equation?

306
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,290
What does x equal?

307
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,693
x would have to be equal to a.

308
00:17:14,693 --> 00:17:17,510
   

309
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:21,030
So the unique solution to the
equation f of x is equal to f

310
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,810
of a is equal to a.

311
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:31,590
And we know that there's only
one solution to that because

312
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:34,170
that was one of our starting
assumptions.

313
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,660
So this thing is equal to a.

314
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:42,080
Or we could write s of
f of a is equal to a.

315
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,640
Or that the composition of s
with f is equal or applied to

316
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,350
a is equal to a.

317
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:54,920
Or that the composition of s
with f is just the identity

318
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,320
function on the set x.

319
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:57,570
Right?

320
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:00,390
This is a mapping right
here from x to x.

321
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,630
So we could write that the
composition of s with f is the

322
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,700
identity on x.

323
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,480
So, what have we done so far?

324
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,970
We started with the idea that
you pick any y in our set

325
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:18,290
capital-Y here and we're going
to have a unique solution x

326
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,550
such that this is true.

327
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,490
Such that f of x
is equal to y.

328
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,560
That's what the assumption
we started off with.

329
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,080
We constructed this function
s that immediately maps any

330
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,810
member here with its unique
solution to this equation.

331
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:31,540
Fair enough.

332
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,040
Now from that, we said this
definitely exists.

333
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,850
Not only does it exist, but
we figured out that the

334
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:39,310
composition of f with our
constructed function is equal

335
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:42,530
to the identity on the set y.

336
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:46,290
And then we also learned that
s-- the composition of s with

337
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:50,110
f is the identity
function on x.

338
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,180
Let me write this.

339
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,940
So we learned this, and we
also learned that the

340
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:58,380
composition f with s is equal
to the identity on y.

341
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,040
And s clearly exists because I
constructed it, and we know

342
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,010
it's well defined because every
y-- for every y here

343
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,300
there is a solution to this.

344
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:13,720
So given that I was able to find
for my function f, I was

345
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,760
able to find a function that
these two things are true.

346
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,580
This is by definition.

347
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,830
What it means to
be invertible.

348
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:24,320
   

349
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,840
Remember, so this means
that f is invertible.

350
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,510
Remember f being invertible,
in order for f to be

351
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:34,780
invertible, that means there
must exist some function from,

352
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:39,250
so if f is a mapping from to x
to y, invertibility means that

353
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:43,720
there must be some function f
inverse that is a mapping from

354
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:51,500
y to x such that, so I can write
there exists a function,

355
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:58,610
the inverse function composed
with our function should be

356
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:03,240
equal to the identity on x.

357
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,070
And the inverse and the function
in the composition of

358
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:09,300
the function, with the inverse
function, should be the

359
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,340
identity on y.

360
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,370
Well, we just found
a function.

361
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,530
It exists, and that
function is s.

362
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:17,950
Where both of these
things are true.

363
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:21,200
We can say that s is
equal to f inverse.

364
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,910
So f is definitely invertible.

365
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,380
So, hopefully, you found
this satisfying.

366
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:29,220
This proof is very subtle and
very nuanced because we keep

367
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,340
bouncing between our
sets X and Y.

368
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:36,760
But what we've shown is that if
f, in the beginning part of

369
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,290
this video, we show that if f
is invertible then there is

370
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:45,450
for any y a unique solution to
the equation f of x equals y.

371
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,560
And the second part of the
video, we showed that the

372
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:54,650
other way is true, That if-- let
me put it this way, that

373
00:20:54,650 --> 00:21:04,840
if for all Y, a member of
capital Y, there is a unique

374
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:15,870
solution to f of x is equal to
x, then f is invertible.

375
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:20,260
So the fact that both of these
assumptions imply each other,

376
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,120
we can write our final
conclusion of the video.

377
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:29,540
That f being invertible, if f,
which is a mapping from x to y

378
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:35,770
is invertible, this is true if
and only if, and we could

379
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:38,540
write that either as
a two-way arrow.

380
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:43,000
Or we could write if for if and
only if so both of these

381
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,380
statements imply each other.

382
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:49,900
If and only if for all y, for
every y that is a member of

383
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:59,300
our set y there exists a
unique-- I can actually write

384
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:07,720
that like that means there's
exists a unique x for the-- or

385
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:17,970
let me write this way there
exists a unique solution to

386
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:27,050
the equation f of
x is equal to y.

387
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,880
So that was our big takeaway
in this video.

388
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,440
That invertibility of a function
implies there's a

389
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,630
unique solution to this equation
for any y that's in

390
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:39,790
the co-domain of our function.

391
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:40,276
