00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,984
There's some news out today
about how many jobs,

2
00:00:04,984 --> 00:00:08,051
or at least a claim of how many jobs,
have been created so far from the stimulus plan.

3
00:00:08,051 --> 00:00:09,660
And at first, the numbers
look impressive.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:19,315
The administration said that
650,000 jobs were created from $150 billion of stimulus spending so far.

5
00:00:19,315 --> 00:00:36,884
So let me write that down: 650,000 jobs from $150 billion of spending.

6
00:00:36,884 --> 00:00:40,505
So what does that turn out
to on a per-job basis?

7
00:00:40,505 --> 00:00:42,692
Let's see, let's get a
calculator out here.

8
00:00:42,692 --> 00:00:57,498
If I spent $150 billion to get
650,000 jobs

9
00:00:57,498 --> 00:01:03,252
let me just divide by 650,000

10
00:01:03,252 --> 00:01:08,777
I get
to $230,000 per job.

11
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:18,515
So that is equal to $230,000
per job, which is claimed to be saved.

12
00:01:18,515 --> 00:01:21,520
So obviously, they're not just
outright paying the salary,

13
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,880
these people were adding some
value to begin with.

14
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,390
So these were clearly
very good jobs.

15
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:33,297
So $230,000, I think it's fair
to say, is more than the majority of us make.

16
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:38,694
So these are very good jobs.

17
00:01:38,694 --> 00:01:48,211
Now, there's a further claim
that at least another 350,000 jobs were created from $189
billion of tax relief.

18
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:53,747
We got $189 billion less to
the government and that created 350,000 jobs.

19
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:57,493
So let's see what that
turns out to be.

20
00:01:57,493 --> 00:02:10,357
we have 350,000 jobs from $189 billion.

21
00:02:10,357 --> 00:02:15,341
That's $189 billion
in tax relief.

22
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,383
Let's see what that is
on a per job basis. Get the calculator out.

23
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:41,301
And so, if we have $189 billion,
so you divide that by 350,000 jobs.

24
00:02:41,301 --> 00:02:45,630
And you get $540,000 per job.

25
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:54,581
So this is equal to $540,000 per
job,

26
00:02:54,581 --> 00:03:02,047
which are even better than the $230,000 jobs
that we were able to save with $150 billion.

27
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:10,375
So clearly some very highly paid
people are being able to keep their jobs by virtue
of the stimulus package.
