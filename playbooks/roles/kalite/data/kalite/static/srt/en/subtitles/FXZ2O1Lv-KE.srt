1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,360
   

2
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,960
In the last video, we learned
about what is, quite

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,340
possibly, the most profound
idea in statistics.

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,780
And that's the central
limit theorem.

5
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,930
And the reason why it's so neat
is we can start with any

6
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,010
distribution that has a well
defined mean and variance.

7
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,950
Actually I made this--
I wrote the standard

8
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:14,850
deviation in the last few.

9
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,640
That should be the mean.

10
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,670
And let's say it
has some variance.

11
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:19,620
I could write it like that.

12
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,890
Or I could write the
standard deviation there.

13
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,420
But as long as it has a well
defined mean and standard

14
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,830
deviation, I don't care what
the distribution looks like.

15
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,170
What I can do is take
samples, in the last

16
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,920
video, of say size 4.

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,600
So in that means I take,
literally, four instances

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,910
of this random variable.

19
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,040
This is one example.

20
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,550
I take their mean.

21
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,850
And I consider this the sample
mean from my first trial.

22
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,840
Or, you could almost say,
for my first sample.

23
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,430
I know it's very confusing
because you can

24
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,860
consider that a sample.

25
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,970
The set to be a sample.

26
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,760
Or you can consider each of its
members of the-- Each member

27
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,680
of the set as a sample.

28
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,540
So that can be a little
bit confusing there.

29
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,900
But I have this
first sample mean.

30
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,650
And then I keep doing
that over and over.

31
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:00,370
In my second sample,
my sample size is 4.

32
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,110
I got four instances of
this random variable.

33
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,830
I average them.

34
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,650
I have another sample mean.

35
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,230
And the cool thing about the
central limit theorem is, as I

36
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,990
keep plotting the frequency
distribution of my sample

37
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,570
means, it starts to approach
something that approximates

38
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:16,980
the normal distribution.

39
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,420
And it's going to do a better
job of approximating that

40
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,710
normal distribution
as n gets larger.

41
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,760
And just so we have a little
terminology on our belt, this

42
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,610
frequency distribution right
here that I plotted out.

43
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:34,830
Or here or up here, that
I started plotting out.

44
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,950
That is called-- And it's kind
of confusing because we use

45
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,360
the word sample so much.

46
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:48,340
That is called the
sampling distribution

47
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:52,340
of the sample mean.

48
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,650
And let's dissect
this a little bit.

49
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,840
Just so that this long
description of this

50
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,720
distribution starts to make
a little bit of sense.

51
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,980
When we say it's the sampling
distribution, that's telling us

52
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,190
that it's being derived from--
It's the distribution of some

53
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,430
statistic, which in this case,
happens to be the sample mean.

54
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,390
And we're driving it from
samples of an original

55
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,050
distribution.

56
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,080
So each of these-- So
this is my first sample.

57
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,540
My sample size is 4.

58
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,540
I'm using the
statistic the mean.

59
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,710
I actually could have done
it with other things.

60
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,990
I could have done the mode or
the range or other statistics.

61
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:28,710
But the sampling distribution
of the sample mean is

62
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,660
the most common one.

63
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,460
Is probably in my mind the best
place to start learning about

64
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,550
the central limit theorem.

65
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,020
And even, frankly,
sampling distribution.

66
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,140
So that's what it's called.

67
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,060
And just as a little bit of
background-- And I'll prove

68
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,360
this to you experimentally,
not mathematically.

69
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,480
But I think the experimental
is, on some levels, more

70
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,850
satisfying than statistics.

71
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:53,000
That this will have the same
mean as your original

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,240
distribution right here.

73
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,960
So it has the same mean.

74
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,770
But we'll see in the next video
that this is actually going

75
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,910
to be-- It's going to
start approximating a

76
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,120
normal distribution.

77
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,840
Even though my original
distribution that this is

78
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,370
kind of generated from is
completely non-normal.

79
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,950
So let's do that with
this app right here.

80
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,910
And just to give proper credit
where credit is due, this is--

81
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,420
I think it was developed
at Rice University.

82
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:23,270
This is from
onlinestatbook.com.

83
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,240
And this is their app, which I
think is really neat app

84
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,980
because it really helps you to
visualize what a sampling

85
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,240
distribution of the
sample mean is.

86
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,540
So I can literally create my
own custom distribution here.

87
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,860
So let me make something
kind of crazy.

88
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:40,510
So you can do this in theory
with a discrete or a continuous

89
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,710
probability density function.

90
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,320
But what they have here could
take on 1 of 32 values.

91
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,440
And I'm just going to set the
different probabilities of

92
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,590
getting any of those 32 values.

93
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,255
So clearly this right here is
not a normal distribution.

94
00:03:52,255 --> 00:03:55,335
It looks a little bit bimodal,
but it doesn't have long tails.

95
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:58,050
But what I want to do is first
just use a simulation to

96
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,170
understand, or to better
understand, what the sampling

97
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,710
distribution is all about.

98
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,200
So what I'm going to do
I'm going to take-- We'll

99
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,870
start with 5 at a time.

100
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,940
So my sample size
is going to be 5.

101
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,153
And so when I click animate,
what it's going to do is it's

102
00:04:12,153 --> 00:04:15,300
going to take five samples
from this probability

103
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,760
distribution function.

104
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,410
It's going to take five samples
and you're going to see

105
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,770
them when I click animate.

106
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:22,230
It's going to average them and
plot the average down here.

107
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,110
And then I'm going
to click it again.

108
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,350
It's going to do it again.

109
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,000
So there you go.

110
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,450
I got five samples from there.

111
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,550
It averaged them.

112
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,370
And it hit there.

113
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,980
What did I just do?

114
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,860
I clicked-- Oh.

115
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,740
I wanted to clear that.

116
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,270
Let me make this
bottom one none.

117
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,250
So let me do that over again.

118
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,600
So I'm going to
take 5 at a time.

119
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,780
So I took five samples
from up here.

120
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,860
And then it took its mean.

121
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,250
And plotted the mean there.

122
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,930
Let me do it again.

123
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,340
Five samples from this
probability distribution

124
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,950
function, plotted
it right there.

125
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,810
I could keep doing-- It'll take
some time, but, as you can see,

126
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,380
I plotted it right there.

127
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,180
Now, I could do this
a thousand times.

128
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:56,870
It's going to take forever.

129
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,320
Let's say I just wanted
to do it 1,000 times.

130
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,260
So it's-- This program, just
to be clear, it's actually

131
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,370
generating the random numbers.

132
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,370
This isn't like a
rigged program.

133
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,580
It's actually going to generate
the random numbers according

134
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,690
to this probability
distribution function.

135
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,180
It's going to take five at
a time, find their means

136
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,030
and plot the means.

137
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,900
So if I click 10,000, it's
going to do that 10,000 times.

138
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,630
So it's going to take 5 numbers
from here 10,000 times.

139
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:21,000
And find their means
10,000 times.

140
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,650
And then plot the
10,000 means here.

141
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,010
So let's do that.

142
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:25,660
So there you go.

143
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,190
Notice, it's already looking a
lot like a normal distribution.

144
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,000
And, like I said, the
original mean of my crazy

145
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,500
distribution here was 14.45.

146
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,120
And the mean of, after doing
10,000 samples or 10,000

147
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,980
trials, my mean here is 14.42.

148
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,680
So I'm already getting pretty
close to the mean there.

149
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,980
My standard deviation,
you might notice,

150
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,920
is less than that.

151
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,790
We'll talk about that
in a future video.

152
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,200
And this skew and kurtosis.

153
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,600
These are ideas-- These are
things that help us measure

154
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,790
how normal a distribution is.

155
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,650
And I've talked a little
bit about it in the past.

156
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,360
And let me actually just
diverge a little bit.

157
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,200
Just so it's interesting.

158
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,150
And they're fairly
straightforward concepts.

159
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,175
Skew literally tells-- So
if this is-- Let me do

160
00:06:06,175 --> 00:06:08,700
it in a different color.

161
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,570
If this is a perfect normal
distribution, and clearly

162
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:14,800
my drawing is very
far from perfect.

163
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,960
If that's a perfect
distribution, this would

164
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,670
have a skew of 0.

165
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,890
If you have a positive skew,
that means you have a

166
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,430
larger right tail than you
would've otherwise expect.

167
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,520
So something with a positive
skew might look like this.

168
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,830
It would have a large
tail to the right.

169
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,320
So this would be a positive
skew, which makes it a

170
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,860
little less than ideal
for normal distribution.

171
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,100
And a negative skew
would look like this.

172
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,470
It has a long tail to the left.

173
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,220
So negative skew might
look like that.

174
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,820
So that is a negative skew.

175
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,880
If you have trouble remembering
it, just remember which

176
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,910
direction the tail is going.

177
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,820
This tail is going towards
the negative direction.

178
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,730
This tail is going to
the positive direction.

179
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,040
So something has no skew, that
means that it's nice and

180
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,120
symmetrical around its mean.

181
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,950
Now kurtosis, which sounds like
a very fancy word, is similarly

182
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,750
not that fancy of an idea.

183
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,640
Kurtosis.

184
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,690
So, once again, if I were
to draw a perfect normal

185
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:10,120
distribution-- Remember, there
is no one normal distribution.

186
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,500
You could have different
means and different

187
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,560
standard deviations.

188
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,850
Let's say that's a perfect
normal distribution.

189
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:21,910
If I have positive kurtosis,
what's going to happen is, I'm

190
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,970
going to have fatter tails.

191
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,390
Let me draw it a little
nicer than that.

192
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:28,290
I'm going to have fatter
tails, but I'm going to

193
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,960
have a more pointy peak.

194
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,230
I didn't have to draw
it that pointy.

195
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,320
Let me draw it like this.

196
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,590
I'm going to have fatter tails,
and I'm going to have a

197
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,390
more pointy peak than
a normal distribution.

198
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,810
So this, right here,
is positive kurtosis.

199
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,180
So something that has positive
kurtosis, depending on how

200
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,530
positive it is, it tells you
it's a little bit more pointy

201
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,400
than a real normal
distribution.

202
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,260
Positive kurtosis.

203
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,220
And negative kurtosis has
smaller tails, but it's

204
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,250
smoother near the middle.

205
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,500
So it's like this.

206
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,140
So something like this would
have negative kurtosis.

207
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,030
   

208
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,670
So maybe in future videos,
we'll explore that

209
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,610
in more detail.

210
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,840
But in the context of the
simulation, it's just

211
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,220
telling us how normal
this distribution is.

212
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,240
So when our sample size was n
equal 5, and we did 10,000

213
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,700
trials, we got pretty close
to a normal distribution.

214
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,965
Let's do another 10,000 trials
just to see what happens.

215
00:08:20,965 --> 00:08:23,070
It looks even more like
a normal distribution.

216
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,875
Our mean is now the
exact same number.

217
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,510
But we still have a
little bit of skew and a

218
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,930
little bit of kurtosis.

219
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,640
Now let's see what happens if
we were to do the same thing

220
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,510
with a larger sample size.

221
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,530
And we could actually do
them simultaneously.

222
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,050
So here's n equal 5.

223
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,780
Let's do here n equals 25.

224
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,680
Let's let me clear them.

225
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,620
I'm going to do the sample--
sampling distribution

226
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,140
of the sample mean.

227
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,890
As I'm going to run 10,000
trials-- So I'll do one

228
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,410
animated trial, just so you
remember what's going on.

229
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,640
So I'm literally taking first
5 samples from up here.

230
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,620
Find their mean.

231
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,020
Now I'm taking 25
samples from up here.

232
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,370
Find it's mean.

233
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,850
And then plotting it down here.

234
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,660
So here the sample size is 25.

235
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,160
Here it's 5.

236
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,060
I'll do it one more time.

237
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,270
I take 5, get the
mean, plot it.

238
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:07,830
Take 25, get the mean, and
then plot it down there.

239
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,710
This is a larger sample size.

240
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,750
Now that thing that I just did,
I'm going to do 10,000 times.

241
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,520
   

242
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,640
And that's interest-- Remember,
our first distribution was just

243
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,010
this really crazy, very
non-normal distribution.

244
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,190
But once we did it-- whoops.

245
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,720
I didn't want to
make it that big.

246
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,620
But once we-- Scroll
up a little bit.

247
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,990
So here, what's interesting.

248
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,520
They both look a little normal.

249
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,580
But if you look at the skew
and the kurtosis when our

250
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,310
sample size is larger,
it's more normal.

251
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:40,000
This has a lower skew than when
our sample size was only 5.

252
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,390
And it has a less negative
kurtosis then when our

253
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,290
sample size was 5.

254
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:47,420
So this is a more
normal distribution.

255
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,700
And, one thing that we're going
to explore further in a future

256
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,420
video, is not only is it more
normal in it's shape, but it's

257
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,700
also tighter fit
around the mean.

258
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,500
And you can even think about
why that kind of make sense.

259
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,710
When you're sample size is
larger, your odds of getting

260
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,720
really far away from
the mean is lower.

261
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,070
Because it's very low
likelihood if you're taking 25

262
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,210
samples or 100 samples that
you're just going to get a

263
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,470
bunch of stuff way out here, a
bunch of stuff way out here.

264
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,010
You're very likely to get a
reasonable spread of things.

265
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,230
So it makes sense that your
mean-- your sample mean is

266
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,710
less likely to be far
away from the mean.

267
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,110
We're going to talk a
little bit more about

268
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,920
that in the future.

269
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,410
But hopefully this kind
of satisfies you, at

270
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,120
least experimentally.

271
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,700
I haven't proven it to you with
mathematical rigor, which

272
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,240
hopefully we'll do
in the future.

273
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,290
But hopefully this satisfies
you, at least experimentally,

274
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,610
that the central limit theorem
really does apply to

275
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:32,290
any distribution.

276
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,170
I mean this is a
crazy distribution.

277
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,090
I encourage you to use this
applet at onlinestatbook.com

278
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:40,400
and experiment with other
crazy distributions to

279
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,500
believe for yourself.

280
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,390
But the interesting things are
that we're approaching a normal

281
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:48,320
distribution, but as my sample
size got larger, it's a better

282
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,100
fit for normal distribution.

283
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,585
