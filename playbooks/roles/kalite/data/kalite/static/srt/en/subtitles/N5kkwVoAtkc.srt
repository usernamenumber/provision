1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,550
   

2
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,660
A bit of a classic implicit
differentiation problem

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:10,900
is the problem y is
equal to x to the x.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,810
And then to find out what
the derivative of y

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,350
is with respect to x.

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,520
And people look at that, oh you
know, I don't have just a

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,800
constant exponent here, so I
can't just use the power

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,300
rules, how do you do it.

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,090
And the trick here is really
just to take the natural log of

10
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,860
both sides of this equation.

11
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,530
And this is going to build
up to what we're going to

12
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,460
do later in this video.

13
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,530
So If you take the natural log
on both sides of this equation,

14
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,570
you get the natural log of y is
equal to the natural

15
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,880
log of x to the x.

16
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,750
Now our power rules, or I guess
our natural log rules, say

17
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,550
look, if I'm taking the natural
log of something to the

18
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,730
something, this is equivalent
to, I can rewrite the natural

19
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,690
log of x to the x as being
equal to x times the

20
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,550
natural log of x.

21
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,380
So let me rewrite
everything again.

22
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,910
If I take the natural log of
both sides of that equation, I

23
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:06,190
get the natural log of y is
equal to x times the

24
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,530
natural log of x.

25
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,100
And now we can take the
derivative of both sides of

26
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,350
this with respect to x.

27
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,640
So the derivative with respect
to x of that, and then

28
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,440
the derivative with
respect to x of that.

29
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,710
Now we're going to apply a
little bit of the chain rule.

30
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,520
So the chain rule.

31
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,730
What's the derivative of
this with respect to x?

32
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,840
What's the derivative of
our inner expression

33
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,330
with respect to x?

34
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:35,390
It's a little implicit
differentiation, so it's dy

35
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,600
with respect to x times the
derivative of this whole

36
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,710
thing with respect to
this inner function.

37
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,150
So the derivative of
natural log of x is 1/x.

38
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,690
So the derivative of
natural log of y with

39
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,840
respect to y is 1/y.

40
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,080
So times 1/y.

41
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,600
   

42
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,450
And the derivative of this--
this is just the product rule,

43
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:59,740
and I'll arbitrarily switch
colors here-- is the derivative

44
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,610
of the first term, which is 1,
times the second term, so times

45
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:08,760
the natural log of x plus the
derivative of the second term,

46
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,550
which is 1/x times
the first term.

47
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,380
So times x.

48
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:23,280
And so we get dy/dx times 1/y
is equal to natural log of x

49
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,140
plus-- this just turns out to
be 1-- x divided by x, and

50
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,260
then you multiply both
sides of this by y.

51
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:35,590
You get dy/dx is equal
to y times the natural

52
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,610
log of x plus 1.

53
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,360
And if you don't like this y
sitting here, you could just

54
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,410
make the substitution.

55
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,620
y is equal to x to the x.

56
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,410
So you could say that the
derivative of y with respect to

57
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:52,890
x is equal to x to the x times
the natural log of x plus 1.

58
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,950
And that's a fun problem, and
this is often kind of given as

59
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:59,810
a trick problem, or sometimes
even a bonus problem if people

60
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,180
don't know to take the natural
log of both sides of that.

61
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,290
But I was given an even more
difficult problem, and

62
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,550
that's what we're going
to tackle in this.

63
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,270
But it's good to see this
problem done first because it

64
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,900
gives us the basic tools.

65
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,350
So the more difficult
problem we're going to

66
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:17,700
deal with is this one.

67
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,610
Let me write it down.

68
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:26,990
So the problem is y is equal
to x to the-- and here's the

69
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:30,640
twist-- x to the x to the x.

70
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,700
And we want to find out dy/dx.

71
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,310
We want to find out
the derivative of y

72
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,630
with respect to x.

73
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,300
So to solve this problem we
essentially use the same tools.

74
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,320
We use the natural log to
essentially breakdown this

75
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,000
exponent and get it into
terms that we can deal with.

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,780
So we can use the product rule.

77
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,300
So let's take the natural log
of both sides of this equation

78
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,810
like we did last time.

79
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:58,570
You get the natural log of y
is equal to the natural log

80
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:02,630
of x to the x to the x.

81
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,230
   

82
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,910
And this is just the
exponent on this.

83
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:12,820
So we can rewrite this as x to
the x times the natural log

84
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:17,260
times the natural log of x.

85
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,200
So now our expression our
equation is simplified to the

86
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,770
natural log of y is equal to x
to the x times the

87
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:26,940
natural log of x.

88
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,890
But we still have this
nasty x to the x here.

89
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,600
We know no easy way to take the
derivative there, although I've

90
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,310
actually just shown you what
the derivative of this is, so

91
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,720
we could actually just
apply it right now.

92
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,890
I was going to take the natural
log again and it would turn

93
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:45,250
into this big, messy, confusing
thing but I realized that

94
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,340
earlier in this video I
just solved for what the

95
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,230
derivative of x to the x is.

96
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,660
It's this thing right here.

97
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,390
It's this crazy
expression right here.

98
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:57,890
So we just have to remember
that and then apply and

99
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,620
then do our problem.

100
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,350
So let's do our problem.

101
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:05,480
And if we hadn't solved this
ahead of time, it was kind of

102
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,470
an unexpected benefit of doing
the simpler version of the

103
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:12,640
problem, you could just keep
taking the natural log of this,

104
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,930
but it'll just get a
little bit messier.

105
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,970
But since we already know what
the derivative of x to the

106
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,150
x is, let's just apply it.

107
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,540
So we're going to take
the derivative of both

108
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,530
sides of the equation.

109
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:26,060
Derivative of this is equal
to the derivative of this.

110
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,160
We'll ignore this for now.

111
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,780
Derivative of this with respect
to x is the derivative of

112
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,700
the natural log of y
with respect to y.

113
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,160
So that's 1/y times
the derivative of y

114
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,965
with respect to x.

115
00:05:38,965 --> 00:05:40,630
That's just the chain rule.

116
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,010
We learned that in
implicit differentiation.

117
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:48,870
And so this is equal to the
derivative of the first term

118
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,760
times the second term, and I'm
going to write it out here just

119
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,280
because I don't want to skip
steps and confuse people.

120
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,615
So this is equal to the
derivative with respect to x of

121
00:05:57,615 --> 00:06:03,370
x to the x times the natural
log of x plus the derivative

122
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,690
with respect to x of
the natural log of

123
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:11,040
x times x to the x.

124
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,100
So let's focus on the right
hand side of this equation.

125
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,980
What is the derivative of x
to the x with respect to x?

126
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,920
Well we just solved that
problem right here.

127
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,730
It's x to the x natural
log of x plus 1.

128
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:30,040
So this piece right there--
I already forgot what it

129
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,720
was-- it was x to the x
natural log of x plus 1.

130
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:41,130
That is x to the x times the
natural log of x plus 1.

131
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,810
And then we're going to
multiply that times

132
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,070
the natural log of x.

133
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:48,050
   

134
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,560
And then we're going to add
that to, plus the derivative

135
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,910
of the natural log of x.

136
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:59,310
That's fairly straightforward,
that's 1/x times x to the x.

137
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:03,010
   

138
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,690
And of course the left
hand side of the equation

139
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:10,432
was just 1/y dy/dx.

140
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:14,740
And we can multiply both sides
of this now by y, and we get

141
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:22,470
dy/dx is equal to y times all
of this crazy stuff-- x to the

142
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:27,840
x times the natural log of x
plus 1 times the natural log of

143
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:34,520
x plus 1/x times x to the x.

144
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,000
That's x to the negative 1.

145
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,890
We could rewrite this as x
to the minus 1, and then

146
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:39,750
you add the exponents.

147
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:44,650
You could write this as x
to the x minus 1 power.

148
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:48,640
And if we don't like this
y here, we can just

149
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,890
substitute it back.

150
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:53,440
y was equal to this, this
crazy thing right there.

151
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,110
So our final answer for this
seemingly-- well on one level

152
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,120
looks like a very simple
problem, but on another level

153
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,220
when you appreciate what it's
saying, it's like oh there's a

154
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:07,480
very complicated problem-- you
get the derivative of y with

155
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,370
respect to x is equal
to y, which is this.

156
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:21,480
So that's x to the x to the x
times all of this stuff-- times

157
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:27,580
x to the x natural log of x
plus 1 times the natural log

158
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:34,080
of x, and then all of that
plus x to the x minus 1.

159
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,940
So who would have thought.

160
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,460
Sometimes math is elegant.

161
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,870
You take the derivative of
something like this and

162
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,080
you get something neat.

163
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,320
For example, when you take
the derivative of natural

164
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,774
log of x you get 1/x.

165
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:46,340
That's very simple and elegant,
and it's nice that math

166
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,030
worked out that way.

167
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,130
But sometimes you do something,
you take an operation on

168
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,070
something that looks pretty
simple and elegant, and you get

169
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:55,420
something that's hairy and not
that pleasant to look

170
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,800
at, but is a pretty
interesting problem.

171
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,080
And there you go.

172
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,524
