1
00:00:00,434 --> 00:00:03,266
Simplify 16x plus 14

2
00:00:03,266 --> 00:00:08,267
minus the entire expressions 3x squared plus x - 9.

3
00:00:08,267 --> 00:00:10,416
So when you subtract an entire expression,

4
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:12,333
this is the exact same thing as having

5
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:19,436
16x + 14 and then your adding the opposite of this whole thing.

6
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,469
Or you're adding negative 1 times

7
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:28,085
3x squared + x - 9.

8
00:00:28,085 --> 00:00:29,202
Or another way to think about this is to

9
00:00:29,202 --> 00:00:32,468
distribute this negative sign along all of those terms.

10
00:00:32,468 --> 00:00:34,768
That's essentially what we're about to do here.

11
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:38,753
We're just adding the negative of this entire [expression].

12
00:00:38,753 --> 00:00:39,916
We're adding the opposite of it.

13
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,383
So this first part, I'm not going to change it,

14
00:00:41,383 --> 00:00:43,637
that's still just 16x + 14.

15
00:00:43,637 --> 00:00:46,369
But now I'm going to distribute the negative sign here.

16
00:00:46,369 --> 00:00:49,635
so -1 times 3x squared is -3x squared

17
00:00:49,635 --> 00:00:57,981
-1 times (positive) x is -x

18
00:00:57,981 --> 00:01:02,162
Minus positive 1x.

19
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,364
-1 times -9

20
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:06,063
remember, you have to consider this negative right over here, it is part of the term.

21
00:01:06,063 --> 00:01:08,631
-1 times -9 is (pos.) 9

22
00:01:08,631 --> 00:01:10,749
negative times a negative is a positive.

23
00:01:10,749 --> 00:01:14,081
so then we have positive 9.

24
00:01:14,081 --> 00:01:16,349
and now we just have to combine like terms.

25
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:17,880
so what's our highest degree term?

26
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,297
We'd like to write in that order.

27
00:01:19,297 --> 00:01:21,198
We have only one x squared term.

28
00:01:21,198 --> 00:01:22,915
(second degree term)

29
00:01:22,915 --> 99:59:59,999
We only have one of those.

30
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Okay, -3x squared.

31
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
And then, what do we have in terms of first degree terms?

32
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
It's just an x, x to the first power.

33
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Well, we have a 16x,

34
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
and from that, we're going to subtract an x.

35
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
Subtract one x.

36
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
so 16x - 1x is 15x.

37
99:59:59,999 --> 99:59:59,999
If you have 16 of something, and you subtract one of it, you're going to have 15 of that something.
