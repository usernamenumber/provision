1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,610
Well, I had to stop that last presentation because

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,620
I ran out of time.

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,990
But now we can start up right where we left off.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,480
So far, we had figured out the slope and it made sense to

5
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,340
us because we figured out the slope was minus four / three.

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,240
You could look at it two ways.

7
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,960
When the run is three, the rise is negative four.

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,720
So rise we went down by negative four, we ran three, and

9
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,300
you can keep doing that on the line and you'll keep

10
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,330
ending up on the line.

11
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,310
You could've also gone down eight and then moved over six.

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,240
Or you could move over six and go down eight.

13
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,640
If you went down eight you would've showed up here.

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,650
Then you would've come down back here.

15
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:40,870
Whatever the slope is, if you change the y by the rise, and

16
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,000
you change the run by the x, you should end up

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,350
on the line again.

18
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,410
I know I'm doing this over and over again, but I think

19
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,720
it'll slowly sink in.

20
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,020
But anyway, where we left off we were going to solve for b so

21
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:55,090
that we could figure out the final equation for this line.

22
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,770
Well, just like we did the last time, we just have to

23
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,240
substitute a y or an x that we know works for this line.

24
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,090
We know either of these coordinates will work,

25
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,590
and then we solve for b.

26
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,490
Let's try this first one: two comma negative three.

27
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,580
So y is negative three.

28
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,060
Don't get confused between x and y.

29
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:19,970
y is negative three equals minus four / three times x, which is two.

30
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,560
Plus b.

31
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:29,590
And then we get negative three equals negative eight / three plus b.

32
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:35,940
And then we get b is equal to-- well, three is equal to minus nine / three.

33
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,120
And then I'm just going to put this on the other side.

34
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,030
So that's plus eight / three.

35
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,260
So we get minus one / three is the y-intercept.

36
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:51,720
So the equation of this line is y is equal to minus four / three x and

37
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,420
then this y-intercept is minus one / three.

38
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,100
I know this is extremely messy, but the equation of this line

39
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,140
once again, is y equals minus four / three x minus one / three.

40
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,910
Now let's look at the graph and see if that makes sense.

41
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,870
Well, let's see.

42
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,800
The y-intercept is right here.

43
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,060
That's where you intersect the y-axis at the point.

44
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,310
And we would know exactly what that point is.

45
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:19,680
It's zero comma negative one / three.

46
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,570
That's the y-intercept, and it makes sense.

47
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,760
And even when you look at an equation it's pretty obvious

48
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,770
that this is going to be the y-intercept because when x

49
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,530
equals zero this term gets crossed out.

50
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,090
Because zero times negative four / three.

51
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,740
And then y would equal negative one / three.

52
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:37,120
Let's do one more just to bore you.

53
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,770
And because my wife is a resident and she works thirty

54
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,140
hours of time and I have nothing better to do.

55
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,270
All right.

56
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,060
Let me put that graph back there.

57
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,990
I joke, but you don't realize that it's true.

58
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,800
Let's put the graph back there and I'm going to do

59
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,770
another random points.

60
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,560
I'm going to go a little faster this time.

61
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:05,550
So let's say I had negative eight comma five and I had-- let me

62
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:11,840
think of a good one-- two comma-- I'm just going

63
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,130
to make up a number.

64
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:19,780
two comma, let's say zero.

65
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,790
That's interesting.

66
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,550
two comma zero.

67
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,430
So let's graph negative eight comma five.

68
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,650
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

69
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,060
one, two, three, four, five.

70
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,230
Right there is minus eight comma five.

71
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,270
And then one, two, and then zero is right here.

72
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,930
So that's two comma zero.

73
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,400
And now let me draw the line.

74
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:47,740
Oh my God.

75
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,770
I thought I was using the line tool.

76
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,340
That's horrendous.

77
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,200
I wish there was an undo tool.

78
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,140
That was horrendous.

79
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,290
That was unacceptable.

80
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,450
That's a little bit better.

81
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,450
Just so you know that the line doesn't end there.

82
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:05,180
Lines go on forever and ever in the coordinate axis.

83
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,460
There you go.

84
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,370
OK.

85
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,760
So let's figure out the slope of this line.

86
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:13,410
Well, change in y over change in x.

87
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,770
I'm using the line tool again.

88
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,990
I'm a spaz today.

89
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,930
Let's take this as a starting point.

90
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,120
We'll get five minus zero.

91
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,420
y sub one minus y sub two.

92
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,760
Over x sub one-- minus eight minus two.

93
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,630
So it equals five over minus ten.

94
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,720
And that equals minus one / two.

95
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,370
So that means for every two we go over, we go down one.

96
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,140
Well, for every one we go down, we go over two,

97
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:43,790
which makes sense.

98
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,410
If we go down two, we'll go over four.

99
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,740
Because two / four is the same thing as one / two.

100
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,320
I hope that makes sense to you.

101
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,620
I know this is a downwards sloping line.

102
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,590
So that was fast.

103
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,220
So we know that the equation of the line so far is y is

104
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:02,160
equal to minus one / two x plus b.

105
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,510
Now we just solve for b.

106
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,090
Let's substitute some numbers in here.

107
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:06,830
Well, let's use this one.

108
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,600
This is interesting: two comma zero.

109
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,610
So y is zero.

110
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,270
Equals minus one / two times two plus b.

111
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:19,120
Well, zero is equal to and this is minus one plus b.

112
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,170
And we get b equals one.

113
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,050
This is a pretty easy problem.

114
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:29,310
So now we get y is equal to minus one / two x plus one.

115
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,100
OK, now let's see if this actually looks right

116
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,880
on our problem.

117
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,190
Well, this is telling us that the y-intercept

118
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,300
is at the point zero, one.

119
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,020
zero, one is right here.

120
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,950
And our algebra confirms our drawing.

121
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,310
This is the y-intercept and we see that the

122
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,980
slope is negative one / two.

123
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,580
It makes sense because it's a downward sloping line,

124
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,710
but it's not too steep.

125
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,330
For every one that we go down, we go over two.

126
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,190
So that's negative one / two.

127
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:05,560
Or you could say for every two we run, we rise negative one.

128
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,800
Either one, we end up on a line again.

129
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,270
So I hope that helps.

130
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,120
I think you are definitely ready to do a lot of these

131
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,430
slope problems that we have on the Khan Academy.

132
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,680
So I hope you have fun and if you any questions you can

133
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,400
attend one of the seminars.

134
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,320
Have fun.
