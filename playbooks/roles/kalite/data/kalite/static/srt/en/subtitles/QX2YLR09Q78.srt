1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660
   

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,960
This is just a quick review
of what we were

3
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,050
doing in the last video.

4
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:08,320
We had this oddly shaped pipe
and the fluid coming in had

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,780
input velocity V1.

6
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,010
The pressure on the left-hand
side pushing to the right is

7
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:19,530
P1, and the area of
this hole is A1.

8
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,090
Everything that the same
variables with the 2 on it is

9
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,800
coming out of the pipe.

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,500
What we just set up in that last
video is we said by the

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:33,280
law of conservation of energy,
essentially the joules, the

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,080
energy at this point in the
system, or that we're putting

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,570
into the system, has to be equal
to the energy coming out

14
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,650
of the system.

15
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,360
We used that information to set
up this big equation, but

16
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,320
it's not too complicated.

17
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,560
We figured out that the work
going into the system was the

18
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,730
input pressure times the mass of
volume over some period of

19
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:58,590
time divided by the density of
whatever type of liquid we

20
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,580
had, which was the
potential energy.

21
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,350
This is just typically mgh,
where the mass is the mass of

22
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,040
this column of fluid.

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,530
We're saying, how much work
was done over some

24
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,550
period of time T?

25
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:11,710
That's the way I would
think about it.

26
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,510
How much energy was there over
some period of time T?

27
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,920
The kinetic energy over that
period of time would have been

28
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,300
the mass of this volume of
fluid times its velocity

29
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,370
squared divided by 2.

30
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,870
That's typical kinetic energy.

31
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,510
Of course, that has to be
equal to essentially the

32
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:35,250
output energy, and so this is
the output work, or how much

33
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,060
work a column of water could
do on the output side.

34
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,110
It's an equivalent volume
of water, remember that.

35
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,840
In some period of time T,
whatever volume of water this

36
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,240
was, an equivalent volume of
water-- maybe it'll be a

37
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,505
longer cylinder now, because
it's going to be going faster.

38
00:01:53,505 --> 00:01:56,040
   

39
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,040
So on the output side, it's
this longer cylinder that

40
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,700
we're talking about, but it's
going to be the same volume

41
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,655
and the same mass.

42
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:06,640
So what we say is that the work
that this column can do

43
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,650
in that same amount of time
would be the output pressure

44
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,556
times the mass of this column
divided by the density of the

45
00:02:13,556 --> 00:02:15,690
column-- which is the same
because the density of the

46
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,230
liquid is the same throughout--
times the mass of

47
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,820
this column, which is the same
as the mass of this column

48
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,890
because the volume and the
density hasn't changed, so

49
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,510
they're the same mass.

50
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,960
Now, this column has more
potential energy.

51
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,060
It's up at h2, which I'm
assuming is higher than h1.

52
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,590
This kinetic energy is just the
mass of this cylinder of

53
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,780
fluid times its velocity
squared, which is the output

54
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,840
velocity divided by 2.

55
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,770
This is potential energy
out, and this is

56
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,920
kinetic energy out.

57
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,930
These equal each other.

58
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:57,180
This setup is Bernoulli's
equation, but let's see if we

59
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,150
can clean it up so that we can
get rid of variables that we

60
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,020
don't have to know about.

61
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,280
One thing that we see is that
there's an m in every term, so

62
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,990
let's get rid of them.

63
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,860
Divide both sides of
this equation by m.

64
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:12,070
   

65
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,320
We get that.

66
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,940
   

67
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,640
I don't like this density in the
denominator here, so let's

68
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,590
multiply both sides of this
equation by density, and what

69
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,800
we're left with is-- let me
write this in a vibrant color.

70
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,860
   

71
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:32,470
P, the input pressure, plus--
and we're multiplying

72
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,320
everything by this rho,
this density.

73
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:42,050
So we have input pressure plus
rho g h1, the input height,

74
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:49,760
the initial height, plus
rho v squared over 2.

75
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,920
   

76
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,290
This is rho v squared over
2, and that equals-- we

77
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:05,600
multiplied both sides by rho, so
we get the input velocity,

78
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,990
so that equals the pressure
out plus the density times

79
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,260
gravity times the
output height.

80
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,019
   

81
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:16,935
Let's make everything
consistent.

82
00:04:16,935 --> 00:04:20,145
I wrote 2's here, so let's just
say this is pressure 2,

83
00:04:20,145 --> 00:04:26,880
this is height 2, plus rho times
the velocity squared.

84
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,100
   

85
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,180
This is Bernoulli's equation,
and it has all sorts of what I

86
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,230
would say is fairly neat
repercussions.

87
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:41,790
For example, let's assume that
the height stays constant, so

88
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,070
we can ignore these middle
terms. If the height is

89
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:50,770
constant, if I have a higher
velocity and this whole term

90
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,810
is constant, then my pressure
is going to be lower.

91
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,490
Think about it: If height is
constant, this doesn't change,

92
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,520
but if this velocity increases,
but this whole

93
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,360
thing is constant, pressure
has to decrease.

94
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,400
Similarly, if pressure
increases, then velocity is

95
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,430
going to decrease.

96
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,360
That might be a little
unintuitive, but the other

97
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,270
way, it makes a lot of sense.

98
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,840
When velocity increases, this
pressure is going to decrease,

99
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,050
and that's actually what makes
planes fly and all sorts of

100
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,330
neat things happen,
but we'll get more

101
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,550
into that in a second.

102
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,920
Let's see if we can use
Bernoulli's equation to do

103
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,790
something useful.

104
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,740
You should memorize this,
and it shouldn't

105
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,710
be too hard to memorize.

106
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:33,140
It's pressure, and then you
have this potential energy

107
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,370
term, but instead of mass,
you have density.

108
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,160
You have this kinetic
energy term.

109
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,410
It's not kinetic energy
anymore, because we

110
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,180
manipulated it some,
but instead of

111
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,290
mass, you have density.

112
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,070
With that said, let's
do a problem.

113
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,170
I'll keep this down here, since
you probably haven't

114
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,680
memorized it as yet.

115
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,076
Let me erase everything else.

116
00:05:53,076 --> 00:05:55,930
That's not how I wanted
to erase it.

117
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:59,070
   

118
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,900
That's how I wanted
to erase it.

119
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,960
I wanted to erase it like that
without getting rid of

120
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,155
anything useful.

121
00:06:06,155 --> 00:06:07,940
OK, that's good enough.

122
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,464
And then let me clean up.

123
00:06:10,464 --> 00:06:12,568
Clean up all this stuff.

124
00:06:12,568 --> 00:06:17,580
   

125
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,300
Let's say that I have a cup.

126
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:26,330
   

127
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,100
I'll just draw a cup.

128
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,715
It's easier to draw sometimes
then to draw straight lines

129
00:06:31,715 --> 00:06:32,680
and all of that.

130
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,170
No, that's too dark.

131
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,420
Do purple.

132
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,280
   

133
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,120
I'm using a super-wide tool.

134
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,440
I have to switch the length.

135
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,410
OK, so that's my cup.

136
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,110
It has some fluid.

137
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:47,870
Actually, let's say it has a
top to it, and I have some

138
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,090
fluid in it.

139
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,910
Maybe it happens to be red.

140
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:55,370
We haven't been dealing with
red fluids as yet,.

141
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:59,450
Let me-- oh, I didn't
want to do that.

142
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,980
So you know there's
a fluid there.

143
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,780
And let's say that there's no
air here, so this is a vacuum.

144
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,660
   

145
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,840
Let's say that h-- we don't know
what units are, but let's

146
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,150
say h meters below the
surface of the fluid.

147
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,350
This is all fluid here.

148
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:26,860
I poke a hole right there, and
fluid starts spurting out.

149
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:32,870
My question to you is, what is
this output velocity of the

150
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,120
fluid as a function
of this height?

151
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,000
Let me tell you something
else.

152
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,930
Let's say that this hole is so
small, let's call the area of

153
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:44,840
that hole A2, and let's say that
the surface area of the

154
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,600
water is A1.

155
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,570
Let's say that hole is so small
that the surface area

156
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:59,560
the water-- let's say that A2
if equal to 1/1,000 of A1.

157
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,270
This is a small hole relative
to the surface

158
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:05,340
area of this cup.

159
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,790
With that said, let's see what
we can do about figuring out

160
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,430
the velocity coming out.

161
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,030
Bernoulli's equation tells us
that the input pressure plus

162
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,700
the input potential energy plus
the input kinetic energy

163
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,100
is equal to the output,
et cetera.

164
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,960
   

165
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,190
So what is the input pressure?

166
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,690
Well, the input pressure, the
pressure at this point,

167
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,340
there's no air or no fluid above
it, so the pressure at

168
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,500
that point is zero.

169
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,020
What is the input height?

170
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,280
Let's just assume that the hole
is done at height 0, h

171
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:45,060
equals 0, so the input
height h1 is just h.

172
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:49,930
If this is 0, then this height
right here is h.

173
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,440
What is the input velocity?

174
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,950
We know from the continuity
equation, or whatever that

175
00:08:54,950 --> 00:09:00,580
thing was called, that the input
velocity times the input

176
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,030
area is equal to the
output velocity

177
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,330
times the output area.

178
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:09,660
   

179
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:15,360
We also know that the output
area is equal to 1/1,000 of

180
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:22,810
the input area-- and this is
area 2-- so we know that the

181
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:28,510
input velocity times area 1 is
equal to the output velocity

182
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,230
times 1/1,000 of area 1.

183
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:36,590
We could say area 1 over
1,000 and divide both

184
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,030
sides by area 1.

185
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:42,170
We know that the input velocity
is equal to V2 over

186
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,290
1,000, so that's good to know.

187
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:51,790
These are the three inputs into
the left-hand side of

188
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,570
Bernoulli's equation.

189
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:57,150
What's on the right-hand side
of Bernoulli's equation?

190
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,400
What's P2?

191
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,280
   

192
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,850
What's the pressure
at this point?

193
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:05,820
Oh, I just ran out of time.

194
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,290
I'll continue this into
the next video.

195
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:08,300
