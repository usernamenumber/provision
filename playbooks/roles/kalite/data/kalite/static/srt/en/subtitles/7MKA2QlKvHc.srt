1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,940
   

2
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,630
The goal of this video is to
start with our definition of

3
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,690
the cross product and the result
that we started off

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,370
with or that we got to in a
different video-- I think it

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,610
was three videos ago-- where
we found out that the dot

6
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:17,140
product of two nonzero vectors,
a dot b, is equal to

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,070
the product of their lengths.

8
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:23,540
So the product of the length
of a with the length of b

9
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,780
times the cosine of the
angle between them.

10
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,310
We're going to start with
these two things.

11
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:30,680
This definition of a cross
product in R3, the only place

12
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,290
it really is defined, and
then this result.

13
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:42,300
And we want to get to the result
that the length of the

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,870
cross product of two vectors.

15
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,660
And so obviously, when
you take a cross

16
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,760
product you get a vector.

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,910
But if you take its length you
get a number again, you just

18
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,580
get a scalar value, is equal to
the product of each of the

19
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,180
vectors' lengths.

20
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,610
It's the product of the length
of a times the product of the

21
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:01,050
length of b times the sin of
the angle between them.

22
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,590
Which is a pretty neat outcome
because it kind of shows that

23
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,200
they're two sides of
the same coin.

24
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,340
Dot product has cosine,
cross product has sin.

25
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,320
I'm sure you've seen
this before.

26
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,060
Well you definitely have seen
it if you've watched my

27
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,360
physics playlist. And I even do
a whole video where I talk

28
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,360
about the intuition behind
what this really means.

29
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,790
And I encourage you to re-watch
that, and I'll

30
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,180
probably do that again in the
linear algebra context.

31
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:27,270
But the point of this video
is to prove this to you.

32
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,380
Is to prove that with this and
this, I can get to this.

33
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,100
Now if you're just believe me,
and you just say, oh I've seen

34
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:33,630
that before.

35
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,270
And I just think it definitely
is the case, then you don't

36
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,380
have to watch the rest of this
video because I'll tell you

37
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,270
right now, it's going
to get dirty.

38
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,340
It's going to be a hairy,
hairy proof.

39
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:48,530
But if you're willing to watch
and bear with me, let's start

40
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,380
proving this result.

41
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,910
So the place I'm going to start
is with the idea of

42
00:01:54,910 --> 00:02:01,570
taking the length of
a cross b squared.

43
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,080
That's a cross b right there.

44
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,460
So I'm essentially taking the
length of this vector squared.

45
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,860
And we saw in many videos and
I've used this idea multiple

46
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,550
times, that if I just have some
arbitrary vector, let me

47
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,600
just say some arbitrary
vector.

48
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,580
And I take its length squared,
that's just equal to that

49
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,590
vector dotted with itself or
the square of each of its

50
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:26,420
terms summed up all the
way to xn squared.

51
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,410
So what will this be equal to?

52
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,780
Well this is just equal
to that vector.

53
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,640
And we only have three
components, so it's equal to

54
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,960
the sum of the squares of each
of these components.

55
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,010
Let me write this down.

56
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:41,410
It's equal to this
term squared.

57
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,020
So let me write that down.

58
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:50,750
a2 b3 minus a3 b2 squared.

59
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,990
Plus this term squared.

60
00:02:52,990 --> 00:03:02,490
So plus a3 b1 minus
a1 b3 squared.

61
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:06,240
And then finally, plus
that term squared.

62
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:15,560
So plus a1 b2 minus
a2 b1 squared.

63
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,670
And what is this equal to?

64
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,590
Well let's just expand it out.

65
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,930
Let's expand that out.

66
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:25,070
So this term right here, we're
just going to have to do our

67
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,550
expansion of the square
of a binomial.

68
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,960
And we've done this
multiple times.

69
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:35,120
So this is going to be equal
to a2 squared b3 squared.

70
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,180
And then we're going to have
these two multiplied by each

71
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,230
other twice.

72
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,030
So minus 2.

73
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,150
I'm just multiplying this out.

74
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:46,740
Minus 2 times a2 a3 b2 b3.

75
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,460
I'm just rearranging them
to get the order right.

76
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:54,620
Plus a3 squared b2 squared.

77
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,870
That term squared.

78
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,200
   

79
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,500
Then I have to add this term.

80
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:08,490
So plus a3 squared b1 squared
minus 2 times both of these

81
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,370
terms multiplied.

82
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:16,019
Minus 2 times a1 a3 b1 b3.

83
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,620
Plus that term squared.

84
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,470
a1 squared b3 squared.

85
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,190
And then finally, this
term squared.

86
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:37,240
So plus a1 squared b2 squared
minus 2 times a1 a2 b1 b2.

87
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,080
Plus a2 squared b1 squared.

88
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,840
So there you go.

89
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,450
And let's see if we can write
this in a form-- well, I'm

90
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,090
going to write this in
a form that I know

91
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,170
will be useful later.

92
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:51,880
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to factor out the a2,

93
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,090
a1, a3 squared terms. So I could
write this as-- let me

94
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,360
pick a new neutral color.

95
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,940
So this is equal to, if I just
write a1 squared, where's my

96
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,610
a1 squared terms?

97
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,070
I got that one right there and
I have that one right there.

98
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:14,720
So a1 squared times b2 squared
plus b3 squared.

99
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,300
This would be 3 squared.

100
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,180
Good enough.

101
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,370
Now where are my a2
squared terms?

102
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:25,800
a plus a2 squared times-- I have
that one and that one.

103
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,470
So times b1 squared.

104
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,050
That's that.

105
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,300
Plus b3 squared.

106
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,480
   

107
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,220
And then finally, let me
pick another new color.

108
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,870
I can go back to yellow.

109
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:42,690
Plus a3 squared times--
well that's that

110
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:43,970
term and that term.

111
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,510
So b1 and b2.

112
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:49,830
So b1 squared plus b2 squared.

113
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,760
And obviously, I can't forget
about all of that mess that I

114
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,450
have in the middle, all of
this stuff right here.

115
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,470
   

116
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:03,680
So plus, or maybe I should write
minus 2 times all of

117
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,250
this stuff.

118
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:11,580
Let me just write it real fast.
So it's a2 a3 b2 b3 plus

119
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:17,340
a1 a3 b1 b3.

120
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:24,940
Plus a1 a2 b1 b2.

121
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,440
There you go.

122
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,510
Now let's put this aside
for a little bit.

123
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:34,540
Let me put this on the side
for a little bit.

124
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,150
We'll let that equation rest
for a little while.

125
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,990
And remember, this is just an
expansion of the length of a

126
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,900
cross b squared.

127
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,040
That's all this is.

128
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,330
So just remember that.

129
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,660
And now, let's do another
equally hairy and cumbersome

130
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,350
computation.

131
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,990
Let's take this result
up here.

132
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:58,150
We know that the magnitude or
the length of a times the

133
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,880
length of b times the angle
between them is

134
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,680
equal to a dot b.

135
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,860
Which is the same thing as
if we actually do the dot

136
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:17,670
product, a1 times b1 plus a2
times b2 plus a3 times b3.

137
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:22,830
Now, just to kind of make sure
that I get to do the hairiest

138
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:27,800
problem possible, let's take
the square of both sides.

139
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,600
If we square this side,
you get a squared b

140
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,630
squared cosine squared.

141
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,260
Then you got a dot b
squared or you get

142
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,710
this whole thing squared.

143
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,700
So what's this whole
thing squared?

144
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,980
For me, it's easier to just
write out the thing again.

145
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:47,020
Instead of writing a square,
just multiply that times a1 b1

146
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:52,050
plus a2 b2 plus a3 b3.

147
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:56,250
And let's do some polynomial
multiplication.

148
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,270
So first, let's multiply this
guy times each of those guys.

149
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,380
So you have a1 b1 times--
well there a1 b1.

150
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,320
I'm going to do it right here.

151
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:11,620
You get a1 squared b1 squared
plus a1-- plus this

152
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,290
guy times this guy.

153
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:22,650
Plus a1 a2 times b1 b2.

154
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,530
Plus this guy times that guy.

155
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:31,870
Plus a1 a3 times b1 b3.

156
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,120
Fair enough.

157
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,250
Now let's do the second term.

158
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,960
We have to multiply this guy
times each of those guys.

159
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,960
So a2 b2 times a1 b1.

160
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,870
Well that's this
one right here.

161
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:50,560
a2 b2 times a1 b1.

162
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,700
I wrote it right here because
this is really the same term

163
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,790
and eventually, we want
to simplify that.

164
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,430
So that's that times that guy.

165
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,990
Then we have this guy times
that over there.

166
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,340
So let me write it over here.

167
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:07,860
So that's a2 squared
b2 squared.

168
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,740
Put a plus right there.

169
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,910
And then finally, this middle
guy times this third guy.

170
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,400
So let me write it over here.

171
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:27,410
Plus-- so a2 a3 b2 b3.

172
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,063
Now, we only have one left.

173
00:09:29,063 --> 00:09:33,020
   

174
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,940
Maybe I'll do it in
this blue color.

175
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,620
I have to multiply this guy
times each of those guys.

176
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,840
So a3 b3 times a1 b1.

177
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,030
That's the same thing as
this term right here.

178
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,240
Because you have a3.

179
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,170
Let me write it right here.

180
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:51,730
You have a3 b3 times a1 b1.

181
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,480
   

182
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,150
Then you have this guy times
that guy, which is this

183
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:04,710
because it's a3 b3
times a2 b2.

184
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,390
Let me put a little
plus sign there.

185
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,940
And then finally, you have
this guy times himself.

186
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:14,170
So you have a3 squared
b3 squared.

187
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,630
And so if you add up all
of this business

188
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,880
here what do you get?

189
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,420
   

190
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,050
I'll switch to another color.

191
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:30,870
You have a1 squared
b1 squared.

192
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,180
Plus, and I'm doing these colors
in a certain way on

193
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,570
purpose, plus a2 squared
b2 squared.

194
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,670
   

195
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:45,800
Plus a3 squared b3 squared.

196
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,950
Plus, and let me do it in this,
I'll do it in white.

197
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,250
Plus, what do you have here?

198
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,640
You have this term times 2.

199
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,880
You have this term times 2.

200
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,700
And then you have this
term times 2.

201
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,970
So plus 2 times a1-- let
me write that down.

202
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:11,490
Plus 2 times a1 a2 b1 b2--
that's that term.

203
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:12,920
Plus this one right here.

204
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:18,040
Plus a1 a3 b1 b3.

205
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,790
Finally, plus this one.

206
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:24,860
a2 a3 plus b2 b3.

207
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,000
And you might have noticed
something interesting already.

208
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,640
If you compare this term right
here, if you compare that guy

209
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,600
right there to this guy right
there, they're the same thing.

210
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,260
You have an a1 a2 b1
b2, a1 a2 b1 b2.

211
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,340
This term and that term
are the same.

212
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,200
Let's look at the other terms.
Let me pick a nice color.

213
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,300
a1 a3 b1 b3, a1 a3 b1 b3.

214
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,140
That term and that
term is the same.

215
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:57,130
And then finally, if you
compare a2 a3 b2 b3.

216
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:57,920
This shouldn't be a plus.

217
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,760
This is just this one.

218
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,240
So a2 a3-- they're
all multiplied.

219
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,530
a2 a3 b2 b3, a2 a3 b2 b3.

220
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,020
This term and this
term is the same.

221
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,850
And in this expression, when we
expanded it out, we have 2

222
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,840
times this, positive
2 times this.

223
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,780
And this term right here when
we expanded it out, we have

224
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:19,190
minus 2 times this.

225
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:22,220
So let's see if we can simplify
things a little bit.

226
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:27,490
So what happens if we add
this guy to this guy?

227
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,780
Let's do it.

228
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,740
So it's a little exciting.

229
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:37,150
So we get a cross b, the
length of that squared.

230
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:40,310
And we're going to add to that
this expression right here, so

231
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:47,130
plus the length of a squared
times the length of b squared

232
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:50,180
times the cosine of the angle
between them squared.

233
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,490
What's that going to equal?

234
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:55,610
It's going to be equal to this
thing plus this thing.

235
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:56,810
Let's do a simplification.

236
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,680
What's this thing
plus this thing?

237
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,560
Well we already said this is
the minus 2 times this.

238
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,650
This is the plus 2 times this.

239
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:07,000
So this guy-- let me
be very clear.

240
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,200
This right here is going
to cancel out.

241
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,360
When we add the two terms
it's going to cancel

242
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,170
out with this guy.

243
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,740
These guys are going
to cancel out.

244
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,750
Thank God.

245
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,550
Cancel out.

246
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,730
Makes our life a little
bit easier.

247
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:20,620
And what are we left with?

248
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:25,810
We're left with this right here
plus that right there.

249
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,160
Then we see we have an a1
squared term, so we just add

250
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,690
the coefficients on
the a1 squared.

251
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,300
We add the coefficients
of the a2 squared.

252
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,900
We add the coefficients
of the a3 squared,

253
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,280
and what do we get?

254
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:41,560
We get a1 squared times this
coefficient plus this

255
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,340
coefficient.

256
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:48,040
So you get b1 squared plus b2
squared plus b3 squared.

257
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,700
Things are starting to
look a little bit

258
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,470
orderly all of a sudden.

259
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:57,930
And then you have plus a2
squared times all of their

260
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:58,900
coefficients added up.

261
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:05,300
So b1 squared plus b2 squared
plus b3 squared.

262
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:11,470
And then finally, in yellow,
you have plus a3-- sorry, I

263
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:14,240
was trying to do
that in yellow.

264
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,180
You have a3 squared
and you have that.

265
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,410
You have b1 squared, b2 squared
and b3 squared.

266
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:26,540
So b1 squared plus b2 squared
plus b3 squared.

267
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,240
And as you see, we're
multiplying all of these

268
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,543
things by this b1 squared plus
b2 squared plus b3 squared, so

269
00:14:31,543 --> 00:14:34,520
we can actually factor that out
and we get something very

270
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,140
interesting.

271
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:40,260
So this is equal to, if we
factor this thing out of all

272
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:45,340
the terms, we get b1 squared
plus b2 squared plus b3

273
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:51,010
squared times my a squared
terms. Times a1 squared plus

274
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:55,250
a2 squared plus a-- I'm getting
excited, the home

275
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,580
stretch is here-- a3 squared.

276
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,360
So these two things are
equal to each other.

277
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,270
But what's this thing?

278
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,320
What's another way I
could write this?

279
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,960
This is the same thing as b
dot b or the length of my

280
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,720
vector b squared.

281
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,980
And what's that?

282
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,460
That's the length of my
vector a squared.

283
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,850
This is my length of my
vector a squared.

284
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,740
That's just a dot a.

285
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,050
Let me rewrite everything.

286
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:29,230
So we have the length of a--
that's a darker green.

287
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:34,150
a cross b squared
plus this thing.

288
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:40,320
Plus the length of-- plus,
let me actually just

289
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,400
copy and paste it.

290
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,720
It gets monotonous.

291
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,370
Plus that thing right there.

292
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,620
   

293
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,535
Why isn't it?

294
00:15:49,535 --> 00:15:52,010
If I control, copy and paste.

295
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,370
So it's not working.

296
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:57,520
All right, so plus that thing.

297
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,200
The length of a squared times
the length of b squared times

298
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,560
the cosine of the angle
squared between

299
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,950
them is equal to that.

300
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:10,120
Now what if we subtract
this from both sides?

301
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,140
What do we get?

302
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:17,720
We get the length of a cross
b squared is equal

303
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,720
to this minus this.

304
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,450
And we can factor-- so
let me write that.

305
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,240
Actually, let me just subtract
this on this line.

306
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,680
So if I subtract it from both
sides, I could get that out

307
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,220
there and I'll put the minus the
length of a squared times

308
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:36,430
the length of b squared times
the cosine squared of the

309
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,680
angle between them.

310
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,200
And we can factor this a squared
b squared, the lengths

311
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,680
of the two vectors out, right?

312
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,630
I'm just switching the order.

313
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:49,170
So this is equal to the lengths
of a squared times the

314
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:56,150
length of b squared times-- and
this is exciting-- time,

315
00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:00,100
when you factor this out of
this, you just get a 1, minus

316
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,120
cosine squared of theta.

317
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,380
And what is 1 minus cosine
squared of theta?

318
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,290
Well, sin squared of theta plus
cosine-- this is the most

319
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,460
basic trig identity.

320
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:15,290
Sin squared of theta plus cosine
squared of theta is

321
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,440
equal to 1.

322
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,240
So if you subtract cosine
squared from both sides you

323
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,140
get sin squared of theta is
equal to 1 minus cosine

324
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,010
squared of theta.

325
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:29,310
So this is sin squared
of theta.

326
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,650
And then what happens if
you take the square

327
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,510
root of both sides?

328
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,250
This is really exciting.

329
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:40,530
You get the length of vector a
crossed with vector b is equal

330
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:46,450
to the length of vector a times
the length of vector b

331
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:50,120
times the sin of the
angle between them.

332
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,790
I just took the square root
of both sides of this.

333
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,460
And we finally get our result.

334
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,340
I never thought I
would get here.

335
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,820
And so hopefully you're
satisfied.

336
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,200
You never have to take
this as kind of a

337
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,690
leap of faith anymore.

338
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,470
And hopefully you're satisfied
with this.

339
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,020
And I'm going to stop recording
this video before I

340
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,410
make a careless mistake or the
power goes out; that would

341
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,000
ruin everything.

342
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,084
