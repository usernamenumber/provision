1
00:00:01,513 --> 00:00:05,067
So let's compare these 2 alkenes.and even though they look similar to each other

2
00:00:05,067 --> 00:00:08,729
they are actually different compounds.The reason they are different molecules is

3
00:00:08,729 --> 00:00:12,733
because of their double bond.We know double bonds do not have any free rotation about them

4
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:17,180
So these are 2 different stereo isomers of each other.

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:22,836
So no free rotation around the double bond means the molecule in the left can not rotate to look like molecule in the right.

6
00:00:22,836 --> 00:00:30,980
so let's name these 2 molecule.So if I start this with carbon number 1 this is carbon 2,3,4.

7
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,558
4 carbon alkene so that will be butene.

8
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:39,482
and the double bond starts at carbon 2 so that will be 2-butene like that.

9
00:00:39,482 --> 00:00:44,114
over here in the right 1,2,3 and 4.

10
00:00:44,114 --> 00:00:47,057
So a 4 carbon alkene starting with double bond at 2

11
00:00:47,057 --> 00:00:49,579
so this also be 2-butene.

12
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:53,157
But we need a way to distinguish between these 2 molecules because

13
00:00:53,157 --> 00:00:57,313
we know they are different they are stereo isomers of each other.

14
00:00:57,313 --> 00:01:00,915
and there are 2 systems that you could use to distinguish between these 2.

15
00:01:00,915 --> 00:01:04,173
So the first system that we will use is cis-tran system.

16
00:01:04,173 --> 00:01:08,409
So when you are using this cis trans system you look for 2 identical groups

17
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:12,977
This methyl group here and methyl group over here.

18
00:01:12,977 --> 00:01:16,783
and I can see if I extend this double bond I can see my 2 identical groups

19
00:01:16,783 --> 00:01:20,326
are on the same side and we call that cis.

20
00:01:20,326 --> 00:01:25,574
so cis-2-butene is the molecule on the left.The 2 identical groups are on the same side

21
00:01:25,574 --> 00:01:31,573
of the double bond.On the right we have a methyl group over here and a methyl group over here

22
00:01:31,573 --> 00:01:34,906
and if we look at the position of the double bond we can see that our 2 identical

23
00:01:34,906 --> 00:01:38,974
double groups are across from each other they are on opposite side.

24
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:44,984
so we use the word trans to describe that situation .SO this is trans-2-butene on the right.

25
00:01:44,984 --> 00:01:50,709
trans means across.So if we take trans Atlantic flight you are taking a flight across the Atlantic

26
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:55,569
which of these 2 stereo isomers is more stable.

27
00:01:55,569 --> 00:02:01,369
Well if you think about steric hindrance about how bulky methyl group is you want to keep

28
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:07,504
bulky group as far away from each other as they possibly can.

29
00:02:07,504 --> 00:02:10,072
this methyl group over here when its across from methyl group its much further

30
00:02:10,072 --> 00:02:13,402
away then if its on the same side as in the situation on the left here.

31
00:02:13,402 --> 00:02:17,735
So the molecule in the right is actually more stable so this is actually more stable.

32
00:02:17,735 --> 00:02:26,621
trans-2-butene is more stable than cis-2-butene and the reason is decreased steric hindrance.

33
00:02:26,621 --> 00:02:30,098
Alright let's do another example of the cis trans system.

34
00:02:30,098 --> 00:02:37,830
So here a double bond like this and I want to figure out whether this molecule is cis or trans.

35
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,253
I would need to look forward 2 identical groups.And I have this isopropyl group over here and

36
00:02:42,253 --> 00:02:46,761
methyl group here so those are not 2 identical groups.I could use hydrogens though

37
00:02:46,761 --> 00:02:52,961
So i know there is hydrogen here and I know there is hydrogen over here.So those are the same things

38
00:02:52,961 --> 00:02:57,305
So I can think about those 2 groups in relation to each other and once I go ahead and draw

39
00:02:57,305 --> 00:03:02,164
on my double bond line in here I can see those 2 hydrogens are on opposite sides

40
00:03:02,164 --> 00:03:08,850
So this would be the trans stereo isomer for this molecule.

41
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:13,569
So you can sometimes use the cis-trans system sometimes you can't use the cis trans system.

42
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:19,164
Another system that can be used at any time is EZ system.

43
00:03:19,164 --> 00:03:26,760
So let's go ahead and talk about the EZ system.So let's look at a molecule here and

44
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,356
when we look at the stereo chemistry of the double bond for this molecule and the

45
00:03:31,356 --> 00:03:36,904
EZ system everything is based on highest priority based on atomic number.

46
00:03:36,904 --> 00:03:40,918
So we are going to look at the atoms connected to our double bond

47
00:03:40,918 --> 00:03:46,829
and we are going to assign priority based on atomic numbers.If I look at the carbon on the left

48
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:50,752
I am gonna look at the atom directly bonded to that carbon.

49
00:03:50,752 --> 00:03:55,165
so Br bonded to that carbon and I have carbon bonded to that carbon.

50
00:03:55,165 --> 00:04:02,659
So Br's atomic number vs carbons.Obviously Br has a higher atomic number so it gets a number 1.

51
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:08,433
and the carbon having a lower atomic number gives this substituent a lower priority.

52
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:10,588
so this would be a number 2.

53
00:04:10,588 --> 00:04:14,603
So we have a higher priority gets number 1 and lower priority gets number 2.

54
00:04:14,603 --> 00:04:17,164
Over here in the right whats bonded to the carbon on the right

55
00:04:17,164 --> 00:04:22,021
there is a hydrogen over here and there is a oxygen and we know that Oxygen has a higher

56
00:04:22,021 --> 00:04:27,358
atomic number than hydrogen and so this oxygen down here get number 1 and

57
00:04:27,358 --> 00:04:32,853
hydrogen get number 2.We use our same trick that we did before we kind of extend

58
00:04:32,853 --> 00:04:40,699
this double bond here so its easier to see which sides are highest priority groups are on

59
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:46,664
so in this case our 2 highest priority groups are number 1 over here which is Br

60
00:04:46,664 --> 00:04:50,164
and number 1 over here which is the OCH3.

61
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:54,691
So our 2 highest priority groups are on opposite sides from each other .Opposite sides

62
00:04:54,691 --> 00:05:00,257
of the double bond.So we call this the E stereo isomer.so this is E which comes from the

63
00:05:00,257 --> 00:05:04,165
German word entgegen which means opposite.

64
00:05:04,165 --> 00:05:12,435
So the 2 highest priority groups are on the opposite sides of double bond is E.

65
00:05:12,435 --> 00:05:19,632
So let's go ahead and switch that up again and so this time let's put the methyl group

66
00:05:19,632 --> 00:05:30,427
over here and Br down here.and we will keep this side exactly same OCH3 like that.

67
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:35,706
Alright so assign priority well we know that Br is a higher priority than carbon

68
00:05:35,706 --> 00:05:41,430
so this is highest priority substituent so this will get number 1.

69
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:47,364
and then the methyl group is gonna get number 2.over here we already know OCH is gonna get number 1

70
00:05:47,364 --> 00:05:52,165
and hydrogen is gonna get number 2 so this time when we look at our 2 highest priority groups

71
00:05:52,165 --> 00:05:56,860
and we look at the double bond we can see that our 2 highest priority groups are on the

72
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:04,664
same side of the double bond.and this is called the Z which comes from the German

73
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:09,167
word Zusammen which means together.

74
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:15,565
So when your 2 highest groups are together or on the same side it is Z.

75
00:06:15,565 --> 00:06:25,029
The ways to remember this is to think to yourself Ze Zame Zid.

76
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:31,107
If your 2 highest priority groups are on ze zame zid you know you are dealing with Z stereo isomer.

77
00:06:31,107 --> 00:06:38,441
Let's do another example of EZ system.This example is going to be little bit harder.

78
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:46,099
here is our double bond and here is our Br here is our cl and let's put

79
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:54,260
aldehyde in here and then let's make this alcohol.so CH2OH.

80
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:59,167
So assign E or Z to this molecule.

81
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:02,823
SO once again we start with the carbon on left and we look at the Br compare it to

82
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:09,320
cl.So we know that Br has a higher atomic number than Cl.So Br gets higher priority

83
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,623
and cl gets lower priority.

84
00:07:11,623 --> 00:07:17,621
Over here on the right we have a carbon and a carbon so that's a tie.

85
00:07:17,621 --> 00:07:21,429
So obviously we need to keep going.We need to find the first point of difference for all.

86
00:07:21,429 --> 00:07:26,109
and so the easiest thing to do in this case is to go ahead and draw the molecule

87
00:07:26,109 --> 00:07:33,105
expand a little bit.so attach this carbon on one end of our double bond.this is our carbon.

88
00:07:33,105 --> 00:07:37,838
so this is the carbon double bonded to an oxygen and the easiest thing to do is to

89
00:07:37,838 --> 00:07:41,917
pretend like that carbon is bonded to 2 different oxygens.

90
00:07:41,917 --> 00:07:45,857
even though it is actually only bonded to 1.We have seen this old trick before.

91
00:07:45,857 --> 00:07:53,867
and then this is hydrogen here.and then down here we have a carbon bonded to 2 hydrogens

92
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:57,695
and then bonded to O and then this oxygen also bonded to hydrogen.

93
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:00,578
let's go ahead and assign priority now.

94
00:08:00,578 --> 00:08:05,335
So this the carbon bond right side of our double bond.

95
00:08:05,335 --> 00:08:08,914
This carbon on the top here we have a tie between these 2 carbons.

96
00:08:08,914 --> 00:08:13,955
so we go to the next one.next atom that are bonded to this atom.

97
00:08:13,955 --> 00:08:17,342
So that would be oxygen oxygen hydrogen.

98
00:08:17,342 --> 00:08:23,856
so Oxygen oxygen hydrogen for the top one bottom one will be oxygen hydrogen hydrogen.

99
00:08:23,856 --> 00:08:27,712
OHH for the bottom one there.

100
00:08:27,712 --> 00:08:33,618
Comparing oxygen to oxygen top keep going

101
00:08:33,618 --> 00:08:39,159
first point of difference oxygen vs hydrogen oxygen has a higher atomic number so

102
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:42,434
of course it would get the highest priority.

103
00:08:42,434 --> 00:08:45,579
so I go back over here to the molecule in the left and ai say my aldehyde end up to getting

104
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:48,760
higher priority than alcohol like that.

105
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,344
So now I go ahead and put my double bond there like that.

106
00:08:52,344 --> 00:08:57,040
and I think to myself where are my 2 highest priority substituents.

107
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:04,691
My 2 highest priority groups this one and this one they are on ze zame zid.

108
00:09:04,691 --> 00:09:09,854
So this must be Z stereo isomer for this molecule.

109
00:09:09,854 --> 00:09:15,432
So the EZ system works for any double bond.Cis trans system is somewhat limited.

110
00:09:15,432 --> 00:09:19,023
So you will see some people don't really like the Cis trans system.

111
00:09:19,023 --> 00:09:23,772
I prefer using the EZ system all the time but historical for reasons the Cis and trans still come

112
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:27,372
up a lot inorganic chemistry textbooks.
