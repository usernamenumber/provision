00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,350
Write the equation of a line that is parallel to the line 2x - 4y = 8 and goes through the point (3,0).

2
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:15,600
So because this line is parallel to this right over here.

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,133
it is parallel,

4
00:00:17,133 --> 00:00:20,067
that just means that it has the exact same slope.

5
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:24,800
So we're essentially saying find the equation of a line that has the same slope as this line

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,933
and goes through this point.

7
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:29,200
So first, let's figure out what the slope of this line is

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,000
and the easiest way to do that is to put this in kind of slope, y intercept form.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,933
So we have 2x - 4y = 8.

10
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:40,400
We want to solve for y.

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,133
We want this to be in the form y = mx + b.

12
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:47,800
So let's subtract 2x from both sides

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,667
so we can isolate the y's on the left.

14
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:53,467
So that cancels out and we have

15
00:00:53,467 --> 00:00:58,600
-4y = -2x + 8

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,267
And I'm writing the -2x first just because that gets us closer to the mx + b form.

17
00:01:03,267 --> 00:01:07,200
Now we can divide both sides of this equation by -4

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,867
so we can isolate the y.

19
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:11,867
So we divide everything by -4.

20
00:01:11,867 --> 00:01:14,867
and the left-hand side, we just have a

21
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:19,400
y is equal to (a -2 divided by -4 is 1/2)

22
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,467
so y is equal to 1/2x (and then 8 divided by -4 is -2)

23
00:01:25,467 --> 00:01:29,867
so we could write plus -2 or we could just write minus 2.

24
00:01:29,867 --> 00:01:33,800
So we just rewrote this line over here

25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,467
but because we wrote it in mx + b form we now know its slope.

26
00:01:37,467 --> 00:01:41,333
The slope of this line is 1/2;

27
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:45,333
that right there is the slope.

28
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:48,667
so the equation of the line that we care about it is going to have the same slope.

29
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:55,200
It's going to have the form y is equal to 1/2x plus some y intercept.

30
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,867
It's not exactly this line,

31
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,333
b is going to be different than this -2 here,

32
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:01,333
but it's going to have the same slope.

33
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:07,333
They're going to intersect the y axis in a different place but theyr'e going to be parallel to each other.

34
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,333
So now we need to figure out how to figure out b.

35
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:13,333
And to do that we have this information right over here.

36
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:22,133
On this line, the one we care about, when x is 3, y is 0.

37
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:29,067
Or we could say that 0 = 1/2 * 3 + b.

38
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:32,333
We just have to find a b that sets up this equation

39
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,482
so that when x is equal to 3, y is equal to 0.

40
00:02:34,482 --> 00:02:39,800
So we get 0 = 3/2 + b,

41
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:46,232
subtract 3/2 from both sides,

42
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:52,815
and we get -3/2 = b,

43
00:02:52,815 --> 00:02:55,067
or b = -3/2

44
00:02:55,067 --> 00:02:59,200
So we have the equation for our line that is now parallel to this equation

45
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,129
and goes through the point (3,0).

46
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:05,600
It is y is equal to (it has the same slope as this guy up here)

47
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:14,513
1/2x and now we know it's y intercept, -3/2,

48
00:03:14,513 --> 00:03:17,087
and we are done.

49
00:03:17,087 --> 00:03:20,620
And, actually, if you're interested you could graph these two and see that they're parallel.

50
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,385
So if you were to graph these,

51
00:03:22,385 --> 00:03:24,867
I'll do a very rough graph very fast,

52
00:03:24,867 --> 00:03:27,600
so this is my y axis,

53
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,400
this is my x axis.

54
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,656
This line up here, (I'll do it in blue),

55
00:03:33,656 --> 00:03:36,000
which is the same thing as this line right over here,

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,067
I just algebraically manipulated it

57
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:45,200
has a y intercept at -2 and has a slope of 1/2

58
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,733
so that means that for every one it goes over, it only goes a half up

59
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:51,667
or for every 2 it goes over it only goes 1 up.

60
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:53,333
So it's going to look something like this

61
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,933
I'll try my best to draw it.

62
00:03:55,933 --> 00:03:57,600
It's going to look something like that.

63
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,467
And so this line over here,

64
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:03,267
it's y intercept is at -3/2

65
00:04:03,267 --> 00:04:05,400
and -3/2 is the same thing as -1 1/2,

66
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:17,856
so it's going to be right above it and it has the exact same slope, so it's going to be right above it and so it would look like that.

67
00:04:17,856 --> 99:59:59,999
They're parallel but they're different lines because they have different y intercepts.
