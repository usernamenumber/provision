1
00:00:00,535 --> 00:00:05,286
Let's say we've got two countries: country A and country B

2
00:00:05,286 --> 00:00:08,202
And at the start of our little hypothetical thought experiment

3
00:00:08,202 --> 00:00:11,119
they have a very stable exchange rate, maybe it's one for one.

4
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:16,970
Every A, if you were to go into a foreing currency markets, you could get a B for it.

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:23,368
So there's this kind of this stable supplying demand between this two currencies.

6
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:30,370
Now let's say for whatever reason folks in A start to believe that country B is the hot place to invest.

7
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:35,118
They want to buy country B's real state, they want to invest in country B's stock market.

8
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:44,537
and so if they wanna buy stuff in B they essentially have to hold more B's currency and so more and more people in A

9
00:00:44,537 --> 00:00:51,702
want to exchange their "A's" for country B's currency. So you have this huge supply of A comming out to the foreign exchange markets

10
00:00:51,702 --> 00:00:57,701
but you still have the same amount of B that wanna go the other way, maybe, you know,

11
00:00:57,701 --> 00:01:02,503
these are maybe there to either invest in country A or maybe buy some of country's A exports,

12
00:01:02,503 --> 00:01:03,969
or whatever it might be.

13
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:09,287
But if we just let this happen on it's own when all of a sudden there's a much larger demand for converting

14
00:01:09,287 --> 00:01:16,568
A into B than converting B into A, you'll have a situation where the B will just get more expensive.

15
00:01:16,568 --> 00:01:19,170
There's more demand for B than there are for A.

16
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,904
It'll get more expensive in terms of A.

17
00:01:21,904 --> 00:01:28,500
So if you look at it from country A's point of view, you're now having to pay more A per B

18
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,081
At a completely equivalent statement from country B's perspective

19
00:01:32,081 --> 00:01:39,638
you now have to pay fewer B's per A.

20
00:01:39,638 --> 00:01:48,170
Now, let's say for whatever reason you are the central bank (right over here) of country B

21
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,414
and you don't like your currency becoming stronger,

22
00:01:51,414 --> 00:01:54,035
maybe you just don't like the volatility in the exchange market,

23
00:01:54,035 --> 00:01:58,332
you don't like the idea that the exchange rates go up and down so dramatically,

24
00:01:58,332 --> 00:02:02,169
maybe you just don't want your exports to get expensive or that imports

25
00:02:02,169 --> 00:02:03,748
from another country to get cheap.

26
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:07,037
For whatever reason you do not like this movement happening

27
00:02:07,037 --> 00:02:11,638
and so what you're going to do is, because you have the right to do it,

28
00:02:11,638 --> 00:02:13,770
because you are the central bank of your country,

29
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:19,332
you can print more of your currency (right here the currency pies)

30
00:02:19,332 --> 00:02:24,902
so you're gonna print more of these, you could print more of them

31
00:02:24,902 --> 00:02:26,102
just like that

32
00:02:26,102 --> 00:02:29,637
and then you could use that extra bit that you've just printed to buy more A's

33
00:02:29,637 --> 00:02:36,505
and so now you've kind of renormalized the supply and the demand for B.

34
00:02:36,505 --> 00:02:38,170
But what's going to be the end product of that?

35
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:42,915
Well, you did succesfully keep your currency from appreciating relative to the A's

36
00:02:42,915 --> 00:02:45,969
which, based on how this was all set up, that was your goal,

37
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:50,502
but the other thing that you ended up with is such a printed B's that you're able to buy A

38
00:02:50,502 --> 00:02:58,170
at the open market, you now, on your balance sheet, you have a bunch of A.

39
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,302
And so when people talk about foreign currency reserves

40
00:03:02,302 --> 00:03:10,104
and pretty much every bank, every central bank has

41
00:03:10,104 --> 00:03:11,838
foreign currency reserves,

42
00:03:11,838 --> 00:03:13,569
this is what they're talking about.

43
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:18,462
That central bank printed their own currency and went out to currency for and exchange markets

44
00:03:18,462 --> 00:03:21,236
and bought other countries' currencies.

45
00:03:21,236 --> 00:03:23,378
And there's multiple reasons for them doing it.

46
00:03:23,378 --> 00:03:26,837
This might be one of them, or it might be to protect them in the case that

47
00:03:26,837 --> 00:03:29,546
this whole dinamic reverses in the other direction,

48
00:03:29,546 --> 00:03:33,546
specially if it reverses in a very dramatic way.
