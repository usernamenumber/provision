1
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:17,833
If you start with the plain piece of wood,

2
00:00:18,049 --> 00:00:19,708
how do you go about making this in different shapes.

3
00:00:19,907 --> 00:00:22,678
It depends on what kind of tools you wanna use.

4
00:00:22,938 --> 00:00:25,616
Any time you take a raw product,

5
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,254
and you use tools and machinery to turn it into something useful,

6
00:00:28,254 --> 00:00:30,547
what you're doing is manufacturing.

7
00:00:30,747 --> 00:00:32,365
Manufacturing has changed over time

8
00:00:32,516 --> 00:00:34,944
and we use different tools now, than we used to long ago.

9
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:37,953
But all of those tools can accomplish the same functions.

10
00:00:38,123 --> 00:00:41,643
So, what happens if you want to make a flower that looks like this?

11
00:00:42,474 --> 00:00:46,366
There is various ways that you can do that and various levels of automation.

12
00:00:46,366 --> 00:00:49,624
Automation is using computers and technology to help us

13
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,666
instead of just using our own hands.

14
00:00:51,882 --> 00:00:54,613
Carpenters used to do everything by hand.

15
00:00:54,783 --> 00:00:57,132
So, say we wanna drill that hole in the middle of the flower.

16
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,674
How would you drill a hole by hand?

17
00:01:00,812 --> 00:01:03,166
This is the tool called the brace and bit.

18
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:07,922
The drill bit is here that has sharp edges that allow to drill into the wood.

19
00:01:07,922 --> 00:01:09,871
So, the way you would use this,

20
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:12,503
is you position the drill bit where you'd like to make the hole,

21
00:01:12,503 --> 00:01:16,600
you apply pressure, and then by hand, you rotate the drill bit

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,678
and have a drill into the wood.

23
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:23,536
It is effective but it takes a very long time and quite a bit of elbow-grease

24
00:01:23,536 --> 00:01:26,224
to get the hole to the through.

25
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:31,876
We have a hole, ladies and gentlemen.

26
00:01:33,231 --> 00:01:36,425
We can drill a hole by hand, but we can also use technology

27
00:01:36,487 --> 00:01:38,414
to help us do it faster and with less work.

28
00:01:38,661 --> 00:01:40,668
This is called the power drill.

29
00:01:40,836 --> 00:01:43,277
It uses the same drill that the hand drill did,

30
00:01:43,431 --> 00:01:46,199
except now, we have a motor attached with the battery

31
00:01:46,199 --> 00:01:47,495
that helps us do some of the work.

32
00:01:47,726 --> 00:01:48,800
So, with this

33
00:01:55,737 --> 00:01:57,045
we can drill right through.

34
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,848
This is a piece of equipment called a CNC mill,

35
00:02:00,002 --> 00:02:03,143
which is a computer controlled piece of equipment that we can program

36
00:02:03,143 --> 00:02:05,333
to cut whatever shape we want.

37
00:02:05,394 --> 00:02:08,866
In this case we're going to be using this for drilling a hole,

38
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:11,971
just like we used the power drill and just like we used the hand drill.

39
00:02:12,293 --> 00:02:16,600
Because this equipment is automated, instead of cranking on hand drill by hand,

40
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,695
all we have to do is hit a button.

41
00:02:25,168 --> 00:02:27,403
So, now we figured out how to drill the hole

42
00:02:27,557 --> 00:02:29,368
so that we have a nice centre for a flower,

43
00:02:29,506 --> 00:02:31,366
but what happens when we wanna make the petals?

44
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:35,118
Now, instead of drilling, we're gonna have to use the technique called cutting.

45
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,846
One of the earliest methods was just with the saw.

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,733
These are two examples of hand saws. There are two different kinds of hand saws.

47
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:44,482
One is called a pull saw and one is called a push saw.

48
00:02:44,482 --> 00:02:46,953
This is an example of a Japanese pull saw

49
00:02:47,184 --> 00:02:51,131
and what you can see is that the teeth here face a little bit backwards.

50
00:02:51,362 --> 00:02:52,785
That means that when you cut,

51
00:02:52,785 --> 00:02:55,224
you'll be pulling in this direction in order to make the cut.

52
00:02:56,315 --> 00:02:58,235
This is an example of a push saw

53
00:02:58,235 --> 00:03:00,969
and you can see that the teeth face slightly forward

54
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:04,641
and that means that you're cutting while you're pushing the saw through the material.

55
00:03:10,132 --> 00:03:14,817
Just like our hand saw had a blade middle metal with teeth on it to cut your material,

56
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:16,974
this is a machine called a band saw

57
00:03:17,282 --> 00:03:21,859
that has the same blade right down here, also made on the metal with teeth to cut your material

58
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:24,572
but instead of pulling the blade by hand,

59
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:27,513
you have a motor up here which turns the blade for us.

60
00:03:27,837 --> 00:03:31,163
So using this machine we can cut right to our material.

61
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:41,836
Just like using a band saw was a more automated way than using a hand saw

62
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:44,757
in order to cut material a water jet is even more automated.

63
00:03:45,481 --> 00:03:50,153
A water jet is controlled by a computer that we can program to cut any shape we want.

64
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:56,284
It takes an abrasive grit and it mixes it with a high pressure high velocity stream of water

65
00:03:56,531 --> 00:03:59,798
that goes through a tiny nozzle to blast through almost any material.

66
00:04:00,184 --> 00:04:05,101
The nozzle traces out the contours of whatever shape that was wanted.

67
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,895
So, today we've looked at using manufacturing processes to make a flower

68
00:04:15,895 --> 00:04:19,493
in order of increasing automation we've looked at drilling

69
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:23,595
from a hand drill to a power drill on the way to a computer controlled mill

70
00:04:23,595 --> 00:04:27,793
and then for cutting, we've looked at starting with the hand saw,

71
00:04:27,793 --> 00:04:31,912
moving to a band saw, on the way up to automated water jet.

72
00:04:32,065 --> 00:04:34,505
All of these tools do essentially the same things

73
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:38,769
and at the end of the day, you' ve turned your plain piece of wood into a beautiful flower.

74
00:04:39,124 --> 00:04:41,388
Thank goodness manufacturing has become automated

75
00:04:41,757 --> 00:04:45,763
and it's moved from hands on to hands off or I might still be here

76
00:04:45,763 --> 00:04:48,281
drilling a hole with the hand drill.
