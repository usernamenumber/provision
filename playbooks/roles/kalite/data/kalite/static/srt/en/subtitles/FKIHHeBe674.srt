1
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:19,480
It was painted in 1821 and this painting in a a poll a few years back it was dubbed the number two most

2
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,379
loved painting in Britain.

3
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:27,313
So let's talk about why that might be. It's large, it is very large.

4
00:00:27,313 --> 00:00:33,679
And, very British, in the sense that it shows what was intended to be quintessential

5
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:38,379
country sightseeing, It's painted in Suffolk which is an area of the country

6
00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:41,063
which is very green, beautiful and rural.

7
00:00:41,063 --> 00:00:45,629
Constable actually was the artist who was best known for painting these beautiful

8
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:50,129
pastoral scenes in the English countryside and something about it is unique

9
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:53,629
because what they are doing is reflecting the landscape back on to Britain

10
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:58,313
because before this everyone was always looking to Italy, abroad to that sense of

11
00:00:58,313 --> 00:01:01,500
Arcadia, beautiful paradise that you wanted to go and capture.

12
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,617
People travelling around in Rome and copying people who had gone before like

13
00:01:04,617 --> 00:01:07,517
Claude and their kind of ideas of light and colour

14
00:01:07,517 --> 00:01:10,100
and what picturesque, beautiful places would look like.

15
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,384
What Constable is doing, is turning the lense back on the UK

16
00:01:13,384 --> 00:01:17,550
and saying 'Hey' we have paradise here on our own, look at our wonderful countryside

17
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,500
and in addition this is, so it's the begining of the 1820's

18
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:26,297
The early 19th century was prime Industrial Revoulotion time in London

19
00:01:26,297 --> 00:01:30,034
and this scene was actually painted not in the countryside

20
00:01:30,034 --> 00:01:32,600
but in Constable's London studio.

21
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,017
He did a lot of preparation sketches out in the countryside

22
00:01:36,017 --> 00:01:38,401
but he actually painted this in his studio.

23
00:01:38,401 --> 00:01:41,300
He's looking at this Industrial Revoloution that's

24
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,901
eating up the British countryside.

25
00:01:42,901 --> 00:01:47,401
He's sort of holding up this beautiful, green, still, peasant lifestyle

26
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:52,083
as something that's really in reaction to that industrialisation.

27
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:55,750
It's definitely got a homely and very nostalgic feel to it

28
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:00,300
and that's relevant to Constable because this land was actually owned by his father,

29
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,883
So although it's nostalgic for a sort of a industry before the

30
00:02:03,883 --> 00:02:05,767
machination revouloution, before it came along, it's also

31
00:02:05,767 --> 00:02:07,773
sort of nostalgic to his own childhood

32
00:02:07,773 --> 00:02:12,023
and I think you can see that closeness to the land

33
00:02:12,023 --> 00:02:13,973
that he's managed to capture his own pasion

34
00:02:13,973 --> 00:02:15,174
and his own feeling.

35
00:02:15,174 --> 00:02:18,157
There is a sense of fondness about the way this is painted,

36
00:02:18,157 --> 00:02:20,053
I mean he's very careful with the brush strokes

37
00:02:20,053 --> 00:02:23,070
to pay a lot of attention, you know that dog in the front

38
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,203
that's standing on the shore looking very attentively

39
00:02:26,203 --> 00:02:28,836
at the man in the middle of the pond and

40
00:02:28,836 --> 00:02:32,119
that's the hay wain, by the way, refers to this carriage,

41
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:34,669
right in the middle, the wain being a carriage carrying hay.

42
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:39,000
It's interesting because it's focussing on work,

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,432
they're crossing the river, they've got their horses,

44
00:02:40,432 --> 00:02:42,315
the lady in the background there she seems to be

45
00:02:42,315 --> 00:02:44,365
washing some clothes, or something in the river.

46
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:48,182
So there is a view of working life going on here,

47
00:02:48,182 --> 00:02:51,465
but at the same time, it's very still and quiet

48
00:02:51,465 --> 00:02:54,215
and Constable himself he was part of this

49
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,966
land owning, wealthier class.

50
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:59,082
He's not actually somebody who would be working

51
00:02:59,082 --> 00:03:00,682
in this way, so at the same time there's kind of a

52
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:04,432
idealising of the peasant workers and also

53
00:03:04,432 --> 00:03:07,165
not really showing them at work, this feels

54
00:03:07,165 --> 00:03:10,483
much more still then it would if you were actually watching

55
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:12,332
a carriage forward across a stream.

56
00:03:12,332 --> 00:03:14,566
If you were to listen to this painting, you can imagine

57
00:03:14,566 --> 00:03:16,865
the noise of the river and the racking of the wheels on the

58
00:03:16,865 --> 00:03:19,299
carriage and the dog I'm sure is not standing there quietly.

59
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,683
He's probably about to bark at the noise and the animals

60
00:03:21,683 --> 00:03:24,665
going by. So there is a very concious choice that

61
00:03:24,665 --> 00:03:27,496
Constable is making, to make this almost like a snapshot

62
00:03:27,496 --> 00:03:30,027
of the beautiful English countryside and that

63
00:03:30,027 --> 00:03:32,615
you could just stumble across this and it could be happening

64
00:03:32,615 --> 00:03:35,915
anywhere, this painting itself, this type of painting in

65
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:39,083
Constable's paintings in general, but this one has been

66
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,599
reproduced many, many times and shows up

67
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,932
as the prime number one with a star illustration of

68
00:03:45,932 --> 00:03:48,532
this sort of English landscape painting from the

69
00:03:48,532 --> 00:03:51,015
beginning of the nineteenth century and I think

70
00:03:51,015 --> 00:03:53,915
there is, the potential, to be over saturated with

71
00:03:53,915 --> 00:03:56,665
reproductions and images of The Hay Wain so that when

72
00:03:56,665 --> 00:03:58,632
you actually stand in front of it, you feel

73
00:03:58,632 --> 00:04:00,132
like you already know it.

74
00:04:00,132 --> 00:04:02,465
It's interesting that it's so popular now because, when it was

75
00:04:02,465 --> 00:04:05,449
first exhibited, it wasn't popular, it wasn't a huge success

76
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:08,383
and he actually took his paintings to the salons of

77
00:04:08,383 --> 00:04:11,133
Paris, where he had a little bit more recognition and then

78
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:14,650
came back to the UK. But the British public didn't

79
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,029
appreciate this in the first offer.

80
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:18,352
See how far they've come.
