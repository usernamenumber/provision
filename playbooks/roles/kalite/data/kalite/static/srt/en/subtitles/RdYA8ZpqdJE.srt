1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,780
   

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,510
Solve the equation, 5 over
2x minus 4 over 3x is

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:06,880
equal to 7 over 18.

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,720
And they tell us that x can't to
be equal to 0, because that

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,000
would make these two expressions
here undefined.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,265
Hopefully the answer here is not
0, and then this becomes--

7
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,970
this is kind of extra,
unnecessary information.

8
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,990
So let's figure out
how to solve this.

9
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,970
So a good place to start-- I
don't like having x's in my

10
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:23,950
denominators.

11
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,450
So let's multiply-- and in fact,
in general, I don't like

12
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,785
having fractions in
my equations.

13
00:00:27,785 --> 00:00:30,330
So let's see if we can multiply
both sides of this

14
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,920
equation by some things that
will get rid of the fractions.

15
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,450
So let me just rewrite it
so we have some space.

16
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:41,200
5 over 2x, and then we have
minus 4 over 3x is

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,580
equal to 7 over 18.

18
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,990
Now, if we want to get rid of
the 2 in the denominator here,

19
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,450
we could multiply
everything by 2.

20
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,900
If we want to get rid of this 3
in the denominator, we could

21
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,380
multiply everything by 3.

22
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,570
If we want to get rid of this
18 in the denominator, we

23
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,980
could multiply everything
by 18.

24
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,960
And 18 also includes
a 2 and a 3.

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,850
The prime factorization
of 18 is 2 times 9,

26
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,200
which is 3 times 3.

27
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,360
So when you're multiplying both
sides of the equation by

28
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,740
18, you're actually multiplying
it by a 2 and a 3

29
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,230
and another 3.

30
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:24,410
So let's just multiply both
sides of this equation by 18.

31
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:28,150
So I'll multiply this term
right here by 18.

32
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,600
And then, this term
right here by 18.

33
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,850
That'll get rid of all of
these numbers in the

34
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:33,960
denominator.

35
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,700
18 divided by 3 is 6.

36
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,410
18 divided by 2 is 9.

37
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,360
But we don't just have numbers
in the denominator, we also

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,020
have these x's in
the denominator.

39
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,120
So let's also multiply both
sides of the equation by x, so

40
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,510
that we get rid of these.

41
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,400
So we're essentially going to
multiply both sides of the

42
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,390
equation by 18x.

43
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,870
We're taking, essentially,
the least common multiple

44
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,430
of 2x, 3x and 18.

45
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,490
This is the smallest number that
is divisible by all three

46
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,610
of these characters.

47
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,012
Now, when we do that our
denominators will disappear.

48
00:02:04,012 --> 00:02:06,350
x divided by x is 1.

49
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,490
18 divided by 2 is 9.

50
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:13,390
So this term becomes 9
times 5, which is 45.

51
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:17,690
And then this term right here,
x divided by x is 1.

52
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,660
18 divided by 3 is 6.

53
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,890
So you have 6 times 4 is 24,
but you have a subtraction

54
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:29,770
sign here so minus 24 is equal
to-- let me do that in that

55
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:33,470
yellow-- is equal to-- and then
you have this term, 7

56
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,310
over 18 times 18x.

57
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,010
Well, the 18's cancel out and
you're just left with 7 times

58
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,810
x is equal to 7x.

59
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,150
And now this becomes a much,
much simpler equation.

60
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,980
Now, what's 45 minus 24?

61
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,430
Let's see, 45 minus 20
would be would be 25.

62
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,435
Then you subtract
4 more, it's 21.

63
00:02:54,435 --> 00:02:58,580
So you get 21 is equal to 7x.

64
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:04,786
Divide both sides by 7 and
you get x is equal to 3.

65
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:07,930
   

66
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,070
And let's verify that
that works.

67
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,410
So we have 5 over 2x.

68
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:17,190
So that's the same thing as
5 over 2 times 3, minus 4

69
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,670
over 3 times 3.

70
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:28,620
So this is 5/6 minus 4 over
18-- sorry, 4 over 9.

71
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,410
We want to find a common
denominator.

72
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,900
18 is the least common multiple
of 6 and 9, so let's

73
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,070
put it over 18.

74
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:40,510
5/6 is the same thing
as 15 over 18.

75
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,950
Multiply the numerator
and denominator by 3.

76
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:46,130
4/9 is the same thing
as 8 over 18.

77
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:49,030
Multiply the numerator
and denominator by 2.

78
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,230
15 minus 8.

79
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,260
So this becomes 15 minus
8 over 18, which is

80
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,820
equal to 7 over 18.

81
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,690
So it works out.

82
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:02,190
5 over 2x when x is equal to 3,
minus 4 over 3x when x is

83
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,150
equal to 3 is indeed
equal to 7/18.

84
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,690
So we're done.

85
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:07,733
