1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,450
   

2
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,510
Divide and express as a
simplified rational.

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,090
State the domain.

4
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,580
We start off with
this expression.

5
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,760
We actually have one rational
expression divided by another

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,960
rational expression.

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,850
And like we've seen multiple
times before, these rational

8
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,640
expressions aren't defined when
their denominators are

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,920
equal to 0.

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,150
So p plus 5 cannot be equal to
0, or if we subtract both

11
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,070
sides of this-- we can't call
it an equation, but we could

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,070
call it a not-equation-- by
negative 5, if we subtract

13
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,400
negative 5 from both sides, you
get p cannot be equal to--

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,380
these cancel out-- negative 5.

15
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,010
That's what that tells us.

16
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,130
Over here, we could do the same
exercise for p plus 20

17
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,060
also cannot be equal to 0.

18
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,390
If it was, this expression
would be undefined.

19
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,300
Subtract 20 from both sides.

20
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,700
4p cannot be equal
to negative 20.

21
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,330
Divide both sides by 4.

22
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,410
p cannot be equal
to negative 5.

23
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:57,860
So in both situations, p being
equal to negative 5 would make

24
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:02,840
either of these rational
expressions undefined.

25
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:16,700
So the domain here is the set
of all reals such-- or p is

26
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:22,010
equal to the set of all reals
such that p does not equal

27
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,870
negative 5, or essentially all
numbers except for negative 5,

28
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:25,800
all real numbers.

29
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,260
We've stated the domain, so now
let's actually simplify

30
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,870
this expression.

31
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,160
When you divide by a fraction or
a rational expression, it's

32
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,320
the same thing as multiplying
by the inverse.

33
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,360
Let me just rewrite this
thing over here.

34
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:47,390
2p plus 6 over p plus 5 divided
by 10 over 4p plus 20

35
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,050
is the same thing as multiplying
by the reciprocal

36
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:56,840
here, multiplying by
4p plus 20 over 10.

37
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,470
I changed the division into a
multiplication and I flipped

38
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,870
this guy right here.

39
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,530
Now, this is going to be equal
to 2p plus 6 times 4p plus 20

40
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,350
in the numerator.

41
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,770
I won't skip too many steps.

42
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:09,419
Let me just write that.

43
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:16,480
2p plus 6 times 4p plus 20 in
the numerator and then p plus

44
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,070
5 times 10 in the denominator.

45
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,940
Now, in order to see if we can
simplify this, we need to

46
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,690
completely factor all of the
terms in the numerator and the

47
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,850
denominator.

48
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,590
In the numerator, 2p plus 6, we
can factor out a 2, so the

49
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:38,750
2p plus 6 we can rewrite
it as 2 times p plus 3.

50
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:43,240
Then the 4p plus 20, we
can rewrite that.

51
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:50,870
We can factor out a 4 as--
so 4 times p plus 5.

52
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,030
Then we have our p plus 5 down
there in the denominator.

53
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,630
We have this p plus 5.

54
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,280
We can just write it down
in the denominator.

55
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,230
   

56
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,960
Even 10, we can factor that
further into its prime

57
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,540
components or into its
prime factorization.

58
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:12,710
We can factor 10
into 2 times 5.

59
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,610
That's the same thing as 10.

60
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,690
Let's see what we
can simplify.

61
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,690
Of course, this whole time, we
have to add the caveat that p

62
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,610
cannot equal negative 5.

63
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,540
We have to add this restriction
on the domain in

64
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,240
order for it to be the same
expression as the one we

65
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,730
started off with.

66
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:27,680
Now, what can we cancel out?

67
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,240
We have a 2 divided by a 2.

68
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,330
Those cancel out.

69
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,550
We have a p plus 5 divided
by a p plus 5.

70
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,800
We know that p plus 5 isn't
going to be equal to 0 because

71
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,910
of this constraint, so we
can cancel those out.

72
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,050
What are we left with?

73
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:46,980
In the numerator, we have 4
times p plus 3, and in the

74
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:52,610
denominator, all we have is that
green 5, and we're done!

75
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,550
We could right this as 4/5 times
p plus 3, or just the

76
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,720
way we did it right there.

77
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,060
But we don't want to forget
that we have to add the

78
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,260
constraint p cannot be equal
to negative 5, so that this

79
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,980
thing is mathematically
equivalent to

80
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,640
this thing right here.

81
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:09,866
