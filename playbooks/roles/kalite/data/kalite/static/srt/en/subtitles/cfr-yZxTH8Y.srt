1
00:00:01,075 --> 00:00:11,139
Let's divide 500 and 18 by 0.7.

2
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:15,269
So we're dividing this whole number by a decimal.

3
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:22,618
So we can also write this as 518 divided by.

4
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:24,406
Let's write it a little bigger.

5
00:00:24,406 --> 00:00:38,069
We're going to have to some work with it. 518 divided by 0.7.

6
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:44,333
So the first thing we do since we have this decimal here we're dividing by decimal is try to turn this into a whole number somehow.

7
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:47,951
Well the best way to turn this into a whole number is to multiply it by ten.

8
00:00:47,951 --> 00:00:53,451
Which is essentially multiplying by shifting the decimal point over to the right.

9
00:00:53,451 --> 00:00:56,475
So this would become 7.

10
00:00:56,475 --> 00:01:01,366
But we can't just do that only for what we're dividing by we also have to do that to the 518.

11
00:01:01,366 --> 00:01:02,539
So that the value does not change.

12
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:04,941
So we need to multiply booth of these times ten.

13
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:12,743
So if we moved the decimal over to the right with the 0.7 to turn into a 7 we also need to move the decimal over the right to 518.

14
00:01:12,743 --> 00:01:16,336
Now you're probably saying "I don't see a decimal in 518".

15
00:01:16,336 --> 00:01:23,113
Well there is one you just didn't have to write it cause it's 518 point 00 and we can add as many zeroes as we want.

16
00:01:23,113 --> 00:01:30,140
So if we move the decimal to the write it becomes 5,180.

17
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:49,536
So really what we're saying is 518 divided by 0.7 is the same thing as 5,180 divided by divided by 7.

18
00:01:49,536 --> 00:01:59,139
Notice all we did by moving the decimal one place to the right is we multiplied both of these numbers by 10 which is not going to change the accuracy of the decimal.

19
00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:11,345
One other way of thinking about this, if you wanted to write this as a fraction this is the same thing as 518 over 0.7 0.7.

20
00:02:11,345 --> 00:02:17,609
You multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 10 you'll get 5,180.

21
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:23,783
You'll get 5,180 over 7.

22
00:02:23,783 --> 00:02:25,873
Over 7.

23
00:02:25,873 --> 00:02:29,366
So let's clean this up a little bit so we remember what we did.

24
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:31,870
So we move the decimal over to the right.

25
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,803
So now this is just a seven.

26
00:02:33,803 --> 00:02:35,745
The decimal is there.

27
00:02:35,745 --> 00:02:37,694
In fact we don't have to write the decimal anymore.

28
00:02:37,694 --> 00:02:41,604
It is just 7.

29
00:02:41,604 --> 00:02:44,139
Solet's just write this as a 7.

30
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:51,779
Then the 518 the decimal is now out here so this now 5,180.

31
00:02:51,779 --> 00:02:54,207
So let's increase, increase this sign over here.

32
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,782
Now this is just a strait up long division problem.

33
00:02:56,782 --> 00:02:59,618
How many times does 7 go into 5?

34
00:02:59,618 --> 00:03:02,950
We'll it goes in 0 times

35
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:07,006
Actually let's just cut to the chase 7 doesn't go into 5.

36
00:03:07,006 --> 00:03:09,069
It does go into 51.

37
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:10,810
7 times 7 is 49.

38
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,290
So it goes 7 times .

39
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,073
7 times 7 is 49.

40
00:03:15,073 --> 00:03:18,537
Subtract 51 minus 49 is 2.

41
00:03:18,537 --> 00:03:23,535
Now we can bring down this 8.

42
00:03:23,535 --> 00:03:26,618
7 goes into 28 4 times.

43
00:03:26,618 --> 00:03:29,535
4 times 7 is 28.

44
00:03:29,535 --> 00:03:32,002
subtract and you get a 0.

45
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:36,809
Now we bring out another 0.

46
00:03:36,809 --> 00:03:39,066
Now we can at least bring out the decimals place.

47
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:41,204
So bring down another 0 right over here.

48
00:03:41,204 --> 00:03:45,451
What I say by when you get to the decimal place you can put the decimal place up here to make sure keeping track of the right place values.

49
00:03:45,451 --> 00:03:48,403
Or that we have the decimal int he right place.

50
00:03:48,403 --> 00:03:50,697
So you know some very particular what I'm doing .

51
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,461
7 goes into 51.

52
00:03:52,461 --> 00:03:54,406
I put the 7 right above the 1 in the 51's place.

53
00:03:54,406 --> 00:03:56,703
So 7 goes into 28.

54
00:03:56,703 --> 00:04:01,950
I'm putting the 4 right above the 8 int he ones place when we're doing division.

55
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,363
So now we can say how many times 7 goes into 0.

56
00:04:04,363 --> 00:04:08,739
We'll it goes into zero times 0 times 7 in the end is 0.

57
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:10,472
So yo subtract and you have no remeinder .

58
00:04:10,472 --> 00:04:12,806
So we could keep going and will just keep getting zeroes like this.

59
00:04:12,806 --> 00:04:16,445
But you see that this is equal to 740.

60
00:04:16,445 --> 00:04:20,000
700 and 40.
