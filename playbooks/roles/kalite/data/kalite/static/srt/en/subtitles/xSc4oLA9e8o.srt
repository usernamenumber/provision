1
00:00:00,302 --> 00:00:04,574
Let's think about the situation when we have a completely fair coin here

2
00:00:04,574 --> 00:00:09,497
let me draw, I'll assume it's a quarter or something, so this is a quarter,

3
00:00:09,497 --> 00:00:15,163
let me draw a faint attempt at a profile of George Washington, well that will do.

4
00:00:15,163 --> 00:00:19,435
It's a fair coin and we're gonna flip it a bunch of times and figure out the different probabilities.

5
00:00:19,435 --> 00:00:21,867
So let's start with a straight forward one.

6
00:00:21,867 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's just flip it once, so with one flip of the coin, what's the probability of getting heads?

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,667
Well, there's 2 equally likely possibilities and the one with heads is 1 of those 2

8
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:35,667
equally likely possibilities, so there's a one half chance.

9
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:39,497
Same thing if we would of asked what is the probability of getting tails?

10
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:45,906
There are two equally likely possibilities and one of those gives us tails, so one half.

11
00:00:45,906 --> 00:00:50,375
And so this is one thing to realize: if you take the probabilities of heads plus the

12
00:00:50,498 --> 00:00:54,869
probabilities of tails, you get one half plus one half, which is one,

13
00:00:54,869 --> 00:01:00,767
and this is generally too: the sum of the probabilities of all of the possible events

14
00:01:00,767 --> 00:01:05,733
should be equal to 1, and that makes sense, 'cause you're taking, you're adding up

15
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:10,240
all of these fractions , the numerator and then add up to all of the possible events

16
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,770
the denominator is always all the possible events, so you'll have all the possible events

17
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,113
over all the possible events when you add all of these things up.

18
00:01:17,113 --> 00:01:18,600
Now let's take it up a notch.

19
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,300
Let's figure out the probability of ... I'm going to take this coin and I'm going to flip it twice.

20
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:28,840
... the probability of getting a heads and then getting another heads.

21
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,183
The probability of getting a head and then another head.

22
00:01:32,183 --> 00:01:33,855
There's two ways to think about it .

23
00:01:33,855 --> 00:01:37,268
One way is just to think about all of the different possibilities:

24
00:01:37,468 --> 00:01:39,899
I could get a head on the first flip and a head on the second flip,

25
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:43,793
head on the first flip, tail on the second flip,

26
00:01:43,793 --> 00:01:47,601
I could get tails on the first flip , heads on the second flip,

27
00:01:47,601 --> 00:01:54,521
or I could get tails on both flips. So there's four distinct equally likely possibilities.

28
00:01:54,521 --> 00:01:57,911
Four distinct equally likely outcomes here. And one way to think about it

29
00:01:57,911 --> 00:02:01,998
is on the first flip I have 2 possibilities, on the second flip I have another 2 possibilities,

30
00:02:01,998 --> 00:02:07,200
I could have heads or tails, heads or tails, and so I have 4 possibilities for each of

31
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,543
these possibilities, for each of these two I have 2 possibilities here.

32
00:02:10,543 --> 00:02:14,200
So either way I have 4 equally likely possibilities.

33
00:02:14,338 --> 00:02:17,390
And how many of those meet our constraints?

34
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:22,585
Well we have it right over here, this one right over here having 2 heads meet our constraints.

35
00:02:22,985 --> 00:02:28,815
So this is ... and there's only one of those possibilities, I've only circled one

36
00:02:28,935 --> 00:02:32,000
of these four scenarios, so there is a one forth chance of that happening.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,967
Another way you could think about this, and this is because these are INDEPENDENT EVENTS

38
00:02:36,967 --> 00:02:41,982
and this is a very important idea to understand in probability. We'll also study scenarios

39
00:02:41,982 --> 00:02:45,558
that are not independent, but these are independent events.

40
00:02:45,558 --> 00:02:50,852
What happens in the first flip, in no way affects what happens in the second flip,

41
00:02:50,852 --> 00:02:53,467
and this is actually one thing that many people don't realize.

42
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:55,914
There's something called "The Gambler's Fallacy" when someone thinks:

43
00:02:55,914 --> 00:02:59,072
"If I got a bunch of Heads in a row, then all of a sudden becomes more likely

44
00:02:59,072 --> 00:03:03,667
on the next flip to get a tails. That is not the case. Every flip is an independent event.

45
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:07,199
What happenned in the past in these flips does not affect the probabilities

46
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,914
going forward. So the probability of getting a head on the first flip

47
00:03:10,914 --> 00:03:15,067
in no way ... or the fact that you got a heads on the first flip, in no way affects

48
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:17,230
that you got a heads on the second flip.

49
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,528
So if you make that assumption, you could say that the probability of getting

50
00:03:20,528 --> 00:03:24,568
heads and heads, or heads and then heads is going to be the same thing as getting

51
00:03:24,568 --> 00:03:29,600
probability ... as the probability of getting heads on the first flip

52
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,067
times the probability of getting heads on the second flip.

53
00:03:34,067 --> 00:03:37,710
And we know that the probability of getting heads on the first flip is 1/2,

54
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:41,054
and the probability of getting heads on the second flip is 1/2,

55
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:45,001
and so we have one half times one half, which is is equal to one forth,

56
00:03:45,001 --> 00:03:48,391
which is exactly what we got when we tried out all of the different scenarios,

57
00:03:48,391 --> 00:03:50,667
all of the equally likely possibilities.

58
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:53,314
Let's take it up another notch.

59
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:58,067
Let's figure out the probability ... and we kind of bit ignoring tails, so...

60
00:03:58,067 --> 00:04:00,327
let's pace on the tension to tails,

61
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:06,666
the probability of getting tails, and then heads and then tails. So this exact series of events.

62
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:13,910
I'm saying this exact order: the first flip is a tails,

63
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:17,533
second flip is a heads and then third flip is a tail.

64
00:04:17,533 --> 00:04:22,316
Once again these are all independent events: the fact that I got tails on the first flip

65
00:04:22,316 --> 00:04:25,400
in no way affects the probability of getting a heads on the second flip

66
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,142
and that in no way affects the probability of getting a tails on the third flip.

67
00:04:29,142 --> 00:04:32,304
So, because these are independent events we can say it is the same thing as

68
00:04:32,366 --> 00:04:37,316
the probability of getting tails on the first flip, times the probability of getting

69
00:04:37,316 --> 00:04:42,146
heads on the second flip, times the probability of getting tails on the third flip.

70
00:04:42,146 --> 00:04:47,267
And we know these are all independent events, so this right over here is one half

71
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:54,041
times one half, times one half. 1/2 times 1/2 is one fourth,

72
00:04:54,564 --> 00:04:59,933
1/4 times 1/2 is equal to one eighth. So this is equal to one eighth.

73
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:03,601
And we can verify. Let's try all of the different scenarios again.

74
00:05:03,601 --> 00:05:06,730
So you could get heads, heads, heads,

75
00:05:06,945 --> 00:05:09,458
you could get heads, heads, tails,

76
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,920
you could get heads, tails, heads,

77
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:16,116
you could get heads, tails, tails,

78
00:05:16,193 --> 00:05:21,968
you can get tails, heads, heads,

79
00:05:21,968 --> 00:05:24,383
this is a little tricky sometimes, you want to make sure you're being

80
00:05:24,383 --> 00:05:33,299
exhaustive in all the different possibilities here, you could get tails, heads, tails,

81
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:36,643
you could get tails, tails, heads,

82
00:05:36,643 --> 00:05:39,383
or you could get tails, tails, tails.

83
00:05:39,383 --> 00:05:45,043
And what we see here is that we got exactly eight equally likely possibilities

84
00:05:45,335 --> 00:05:49,785
We have eight equally likely possibilities, and the tail, head, tail

85
00:05:49,785 --> 00:05:53,733
is exactly one of them. It is this possibility right over here.

86
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:57,733
So it is one of eight equally likely possibilities.
