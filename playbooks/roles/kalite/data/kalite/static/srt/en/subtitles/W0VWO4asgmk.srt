1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,610
Welcome to the
presentation on limits.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,290
Let's get started with some--
well, first an explanation

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:07,530
before I do any problems.

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,110
So let's say I had-- let me
make sure I have the right

5
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,070
color and my pen works.

6
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:17,480
OK, let's say I had the limit,
and I'll explain what a

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,840
limit is in a second.

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,780
But the way you write it is you
say the limit-- oh, my color is

9
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,860
on the wrong-- OK, let me
use the pen and yellow.

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:38,181
OK, the limit as x
approaches 2 of x squared.

11
00:00:38,181 --> 00:00:42,550
13
00:00:42,55 --> 00:00:46,34
Now, all this is saying is what
value does the expression x

12
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,680
squared approach as
x approaches 2?

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,130
Well, this is pretty easy.

14
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,065
If we look at-- let me
at least draw a graph.

15
00:00:53,065 --> 00:00:57,010
I'll stay in this yellow color.

16
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,420
So let me draw.

17
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,813
x squared looks something
like-- let me use

18
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,610
a different color.

19
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,900
x square looks something
like this, right?

20
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,730
23
00:01:10,73 --> 00:01:20,04
And when x is equal to 2, y,
or the expression-- because

21
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,320
we don't say what
this is equal to.

22
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,570
It's just the expression-- x
squared is equal to 4, right?

23
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:27,650
27
00:01:27,65 --> 00:01:33,1
So a limit is saying, as x
approaches 2, as x approaches 2

24
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,920
from both sides, from numbers
left than 2 and from numbers

25
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,940
right than 2, what does
the expression approach?

26
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,630
And you might, I think, already
see where this is going and be

27
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,920
wondering why we're even going
to the trouble of learning this

28
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,040
new concept because it seems
pretty obvious, but as x-- as

29
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,320
we get to x closer and closer
to 2 from this direction, and

30
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,530
as we get to x closer
and closer to 2 to this

31
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,940
direction, what does
this expression equal?

32
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,670
Well, it essentially
equals 4, right?

33
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,690
The expression is equal to 4.

34
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:08,090
The way I think about it is as
you move on the curve closer

35
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:12,390
and closer to the expression's
value, what does the

36
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,500
expression equal?

37
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,660
In this case, it equals 4.

38
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,850
You're probably saying, Sal,
this seems like a useless

39
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,690
concept because I could have
just stuck 2 in there, and I

40
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,850
know that if this is-- say this
is f of x, that if f of x is

41
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,590
equal to x squared, that f of 2
is equal to 4, and that would

42
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,050
have been a no-brainer.

43
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:33,840
Well, let me maybe give you one
wrinkle on that, and hopefully

44
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,970
now you'll start to see what
the use of a limit is.

45
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:51,620
Let me to define-- let me say
f of x is equal to x squared

46
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:59,390
when, if x does not equal 2,
and let's say it equals

47
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:04,270
3 when x equals 2.

48
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:04,560
Interesting.

49
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,600
So it's a slight variation on
this expression right here.

50
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,490
So this is our new f of x.

51
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,670
So let me ask you a question.

52
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:16,300
What is-- my pen still works--
what is the limit-- I used

53
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:23,180
cursive this time-- what is the
limit as x-- that's an x--

54
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,580
as x approaches 2 of f of x?

55
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,590
60
00:03:29,59 --> 00:03:30,21
That's an x.

56
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,120
It says x approaches 2.

57
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,800
It's just like that.

58
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,250
OK, so let me graph this now.

59
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,360
So that's an equally
neat-looking graph as

60
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,100
the one I just drew.

61
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,790
Let me draw.

62
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,100
So now it's almost the same as
this curve, except something

63
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,330
interesting happens
at x equals 2.

64
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,715
So it's just like this.

65
00:03:53,715 --> 00:03:58,480
It's like an x squared
curve like that.

66
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,710
But at x equals 2 and
f of x equals 4, we

67
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,890
draw a little hole.

68
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,050
We draw a hole because it's
not defined at x equals 2.

69
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,320
This is x equals 2.

70
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,960
This is 2.

71
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,680
This is 4.

72
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,690
This is the f of x
axis, of course.

73
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:19,820
And when x is equal to
2-- let's say this is 3.

74
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,860
When x is equal to 2,
f of x is equal to 3.

75
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,240
This is actually
right below this.

76
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,610
I should-- it doesn't look
completely right below it,

77
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,730
but I think you got
to get the picture.

78
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,400
See, this graph is x squared.

79
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,983
It's exactly x squared until
we get to x equals 2.

80
00:04:35,983 --> 00:04:40,030
At x equals 2, We have a
grap-- No, not a grap.

81
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,770
We have a gap in the
graph, which maybe

82
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,720
could be called a grap.

83
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,540
We have a gap in the graph, and
then we keep-- and then after x

84
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,350
equals 2, we keep moving on.

85
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:54,300
And that gap, and that gap
is defined right here, what

86
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,350
happens when x equals 2?

87
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,300
Well, then f of x
is equal to 3.

88
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,960
So this graph kind of goes--
it's just like x squared, but

89
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,470
instead of f of 2 being 4, f
of 2 drops down to 3, but

90
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,260
then we keep on going.

91
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,400
So going back to the limit
problem, what is the

92
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,880
limit as x approaches 2?

93
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,050
Now, well, let's think
about the same thing.

94
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,200
We're going to go-- this
is how I visualize it.

95
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:28,050
So as x approaches 2 from this
side, from the left-hand side

96
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:35,200
or from numbers less than 2, f
of x is approaching values

97
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,520
approaching 4, right? f of x
is approaching 4 as x

98
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,540
approaches 2, right?

99
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,200
I think you see that.

100
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,820
If you just follow along the
curve, as you approach f of 2,

101
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,420
you get closer and closer to 4.

102
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:53,010
Similarly, as you go from the
right-hand side-- make sure

103
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,370
my thing's still working.

104
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,780
As you go from the right-hand
side, you go along the

105
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:05,200
curve, and f of x is also
slowly approaching 4.

106
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,120
So, as you can see, as we
go closer and closer and

107
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,610
closer to x equals 2, f of
whatever number that is

108
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,540
approaches 4, right?

109
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,860
So, in this case, the
limit as x approaches

110
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:21,130
2 is also equal to 4.

111
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,120
Well, this is interesting
because, in this case, the

112
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:35,980
limit as x approaches 2 of f
of x does not equal f of 2.

113
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,170
Now, normally, this
would be on this line.

114
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:41,300
In this case, the limit as you
approach the expression is

115
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,030
equal to evaluating the
expression of that value.

116
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,450
In this case, the limit isn't.

117
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,220
I think now you're starting to
see why the limit is a slightly

118
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,260
different concept than just
evaluating the function at

119
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,770
that point because you have
functions where, for whatever

120
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,530
reason at a certain point,
either the function might not

121
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:01,640
be defined or the function kind
of jumps up or down, but as you

122
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,370
approach that point, you still
approach a value different than

123
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,700
the function at that point.

124
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,110
Now, that's my introduction.

125
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:12,020
I think this will give you
intuition for what a limit is.

126
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,110
In another presentation, I'll
give you the more formal

127
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,460
mathematical, you know,
the delta-epsilon

128
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,890
definition of a limit.

129
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,190
And actually, in the very next
module, I'm now going to

130
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,210
do a bunch of problems
involving the limit.

131
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,510
I think as you do more and more
problems, you'll get more and

132
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,380
more of an intuition as
to what a limit is.

133
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,490
And then as we go into drill
derivatives and integrals,

134
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,350
you'll actually understand why
people probably even invented

135
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,910
limits to begin with.

136
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,930
We'll see you in the
next presentation.
