1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,969
Consider the following experiment.

2
00:00:05,969 --> 00:00:08,873
You have two pieces of metal – copper and zinc –

3
00:00:08,873 --> 00:00:11,716
which you connect to conducting wires.

4
00:00:11,716 --> 00:00:14,374
And you then submerge the metals in an electrolyte –

5
00:00:14,374 --> 00:00:16,266
in this case, vinegar.

6
00:00:23,021 --> 00:00:26,329
You will observe that bubbles will form around the zinc –

7
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:28,635
but not on the copper.

8
00:00:28,635 --> 00:00:31,956
The metals seem dissimilar in this way.

9
00:00:31,956 --> 00:00:35,576
And if you then connect the two wires holding the metals,

10
00:00:35,576 --> 00:00:36,946
something changes.

11
00:00:36,946 --> 00:00:41,212
Tiny bubbles begin to form around the copper terminal.

12
00:00:41,212 --> 00:00:42,974
It seems as though something is being

13
00:00:42,974 --> 00:00:46,065
pulled from the zinc, through the wire –

14
00:00:46,065 --> 00:00:49,525
allowing a reaction to occur on the copper side.

15
00:00:49,525 --> 00:00:53,471
And it turns out [that] this is a flow of electrical charge –

16
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:56,845
as electrons are pulled away from the zinc, towards

17
00:00:56,845 --> 00:01:01,110
the copper, through the conductive path in the wire.

18
00:01:02,415 --> 00:01:06,254
Think of this flow as the result of a charge imbalance –

19
00:01:06,254 --> 00:01:10,237
or 'electrical pressure' – between the two metals –

20
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:13,362
as compared to the instantaneous discharge observed

21
00:01:13,362 --> 00:01:16,023
with static electricity experiments.

22
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,928
And towards the end of the 18th century,

23
00:01:19,928 --> 00:01:23,692
Alessandro Volta had been investigating this effect.

24
00:01:23,692 --> 00:01:24,721
More importantly,

25
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:27,476
he found that chaining these cells together,

26
00:01:27,476 --> 00:01:31,942
would amplify this flow of charge.

27
00:01:31,942 --> 00:01:35,032
By 1800, he simplified things even further –

28
00:01:35,032 --> 00:01:37,612
removing the jar – which provided more electrolyte

29
00:01:37,612 --> 00:01:39,140
than was actually needed.

30
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,720
He writes: "[using] a few dozen small round

31
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,075
disks of copper (pieces of coin for example)

32
00:01:45,075 --> 00:01:47,558
and [an] equal number of plates of zinc,

33
00:01:47,558 --> 00:01:50,360
I prepare circular pieces of spongy matter

34
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,168
capable of retaining water.

35
00:01:52,168 --> 00:01:55,706
I continue coupling a plate of copper with one [of] zinc,

36
00:01:55,706 --> 00:01:57,455
and always in the same order,

37
00:01:57,455 --> 00:01:59,866
and interpose, between each of these couples,

38
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:01,510
a moistened disk.

39
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,565
This continues until I have a column

40
00:02:03,565 --> 00:02:07,559
as high as possible, without danger of it falling."

41
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:10,478
This is known, famously, as the 'voltaic pile' –

42
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:12,295
the first battery in history to provide

43
00:02:12,295 --> 00:02:17,609
a continuous flow of electrical charge – or 'current.'

44
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:19,704
More cells resulted in an increased

45
00:02:19,704 --> 00:02:21,678
'electrical pressure' at the two ends.

46
00:02:21,678 --> 00:02:24,760
And 'electrical pressure' was an early term

47
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,066
for what we now call 'voltage' – after Volta.

48
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:31,176
Now, if the two leads of a voltaic pile were brought into

49
00:02:31,176 --> 00:02:35,161
direct contact, a series of shocks could be observed.

50
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,890
Now, at first, the utility of electric current

51
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:43,280
as a communication method was not immediately obvious,

52
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,142
aside from [its ability to produce] faint sparks and bubbles.

53
00:02:46,142 --> 00:02:47,143
One idea was to use

54
00:02:47,143 --> 00:02:50,820
the presence of bubbles to signal letters.

55
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,583
And the 'bubble telegraph' used this method –

56
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:56,286
though it involved 26 difference circuits –

57
00:02:56,286 --> 00:02:58,210
one for each letter.

58
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,286
And it was based on the fact that the battery providing

59
00:03:00,286 --> 00:03:02,481
the current can be placed at a distance,

60
00:03:02,481 --> 00:03:05,136
away from the jars containing the leads

61
00:03:05,136 --> 00:03:06,756
creating the bubbles –

62
00:03:06,756 --> 00:03:08,854
an inventive, although clumsy, system,

63
00:03:08,854 --> 00:03:10,442
which was never adopted.

64
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,796
But very soon, everything changed,

65
00:03:14,796 --> 00:03:18,330
after a famous demonstration in 1819.

66
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,318
It was found that if we simply pass a wire

67
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:24,920
near a compass, and connect it to a battery,

68
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,027
as soon as the wire made contact with the battery,

69
00:03:28,027 --> 00:03:32,651
the needle jumped – without any physical contact.

70
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:36,081
The only explanation was that the current-carrying wire

71
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:39,879
was creating a temporary magnetic 'field.'

72
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:42,286
This was followed by a series of tests

73
00:03:42,286 --> 00:03:45,451
to figure out the direction of this field.

74
00:03:45,451 --> 00:03:48,145
First, we assumed it was pointing along the wire –

75
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,378
with the current – or perhaps,

76
00:03:50,378 --> 00:03:53,782
emanating outwards from the wire – as heat would travel.

77
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:01,949
But eventually, it was deduced that it must be traveling

78
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:06,429
around the wire – in perpendicular circles.

79
00:04:06,429 --> 00:04:09,752
So, a loop of wire would create a magnetic field

80
00:04:09,752 --> 00:04:12,807
which points through the center of the loop,

81
00:04:12,807 --> 00:04:15,138
and around the outside.

82
00:04:17,694 --> 00:04:20,618
This led to the 'galvanometer,' which was designed

83
00:04:20,618 --> 00:04:24,253
to detect – and measure – electrical current.

84
00:04:24,253 --> 00:04:26,682
And it was just simply a coil of wire,

85
00:04:26,682 --> 00:04:29,208
with a compass suspended in the center.

86
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:35,193
Now, when electric current was applied to the coil,

87
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,887
a magnetic field would push through

88
00:04:41,887 --> 00:04:44,916
the middle of the coil, and around the outside.

89
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,400
So the needle would always point

90
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,305
perpendicular to the direction of the force,

91
00:04:49,305 --> 00:04:52,617
which was balanced on either side of the needle.

92
00:04:52,617 --> 00:04:54,180
And the stronger the current,

93
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,318
the stronger the deflection of the needle.

94
00:04:58,318 --> 00:05:01,900
By 1824, William Sturgeon demonstrated a way

95
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,348
to increase the strength of this field even more.

96
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:07,790
Simply by wrapping a coil of wire

97
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,848
around a piece of iron – such as a nail –

98
00:05:10,848 --> 00:05:13,580
a magnetic force could be amplified –

99
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,032
because iron seemed to be a better medium

100
00:05:16,032 --> 00:05:18,917
for supporting the formation of magnetic fields.

101
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:21,510
We call this 'permeability.'

102
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,041
And by wrapping a wire many times,

103
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,199
the strength of the field could be

104
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,723
amplified thousands of times.

105
00:05:27,723 --> 00:05:30,743
And this [kind of device] is known as an 'electromagnet.'

106
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:35,812
So, suddenly, it was possible to create magnetic fields –

107
00:05:35,812 --> 00:05:39,678
which could move needles with precision and force –

108
00:05:39,678 --> 00:05:43,496
using electric current applied at a distance –

109
00:05:43,496 --> 00:05:47,697
using a long loop of wire, and a strong battery.

110
00:05:47,697 --> 00:05:49,298
At the time, our understanding

111
00:05:49,298 --> 00:05:51,854
of information was in its infancy.

112
00:05:51,854 --> 00:05:54,967
People were thinking about information in a message

113
00:05:54,967 --> 00:05:58,339
as the number of letters in a message.

114
00:05:58,339 --> 00:05:59,660
So the goal was intuitive.

115
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,850
Who could come up with the fastest way to transmit letters?

116
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,294
Whoever had the fastest system would, therefore,

117
00:06:06,294 --> 00:06:08,473
reduce the cost per message

118
00:06:08,473 --> 00:06:11,300
for the sender using the system.

119
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:16,834
And a gold mine was waiting for whoever got there first.
