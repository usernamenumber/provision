1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,650
   

2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,650
We're trying to test whether
a new low-fat diet actually

3
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,940
helps obese people
lose weight.

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,790
100 randomly assigned people are
assigned to group one and

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,410
put on the low-fat diet.

6
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,280
Another 100 randomly assigned
obese people are assigned to

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,770
group two and put on a diet of
approximately the same amount

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,610
of food, but not
as low in fat.

9
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,010
So group two is the control,
just the no diet.

10
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,660
Group one is the low
fat group, to see

11
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,870
if it actually works.

12
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,740
After four months, the mean
weight loss was 9.31 pounds

13
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,540
for group one.

14
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,960
Let me write this down.

15
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,310
Let me make it very clear.

16
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:46,590
So the low fat group, the mean
weight loss was 9.31 pounds.

17
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:52,140
So our sample mean for group
one is 9.31 pounds, with a

18
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,120
sample standard deviation
of 4.67.

19
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,840
And both of these are obviously
very easy to

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,650
calculate from the
actual data.

21
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:08,310
And then for our control group,
the sample mean, 7.40

22
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,560
pounds for group two.

23
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,280
   

24
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,800
With a sample standard deviation
of 4.04 pounds.

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,100
And now, if we just look at it
superficially, it looks like

26
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,670
the low-fat group lost more
weight, just based on our

27
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,820
samples, than the
control group.

28
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,040
If we take the difference
of them.

29
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,910
So if we take the difference
between the low-fat group and

30
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:50,250
the control group, we get 9.31
minus 7.40 is equal to, let's

31
00:01:50,250 --> 00:02:01,860
get the calculator out, 1.91.

32
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,070
So the difference of our
samples is 1.91.

33
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,639
So just based on what we see,
maybe you lose an incremental

34
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:14,210
1.91 pounds every four months
if you are on this diet.

35
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:18,180
And what we want to do in this
video is to get a 95%

36
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,700
confidence interval around
this number.

37
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,910
To see that in that 95%
confidence interval, maybe, do

38
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,610
we always lose weight?

39
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,480
Or is there a chance that we can
actually go the other way

40
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,630
with the low-fat diet?

41
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,850
So in this video, 95%
confidence interval.

42
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,190
In the next video, we'll
actually do a hypothesis test

43
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,650
using this same data.

44
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:42,770
And now to do a 95% confidence
interval, let's think about

45
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,020
the distribution that we're
thinking about.

46
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,350
So let's look at the
distribution.

47
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,190
Of course we're going to think
about the distribution that

48
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,860
we're thinking about.

49
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,500
We want to think about the
distribution of the difference

50
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,390
of the means.

51
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,600
So it's going to have
some true mean here.

52
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:06,950
   

53
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,030
Which is the mean of
the difference

54
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,370
of the sample means.

55
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,490
Let me write that.

56
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,330
It's not a y, it's
an x1 and x2.

57
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:19,980
So it's the sample mean of x1
minus the sample mean of x2.

58
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,830
And then this distribution right
here is going to have

59
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,165
some standard deviation.

60
00:03:25,165 --> 00:03:28,270
   

61
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,330
So it's the standard deviation
of the distribution of the

62
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:36,110
mean of x1 minus the
sample mean of x2.

63
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,900
It's going to have some standard
deviation here.

64
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,960
And we want to make an
inference about this.

65
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,030
Or I guess, the best way to
think about it, we want to get

66
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,360
a 95% confidence interval.

67
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,230
Based on our sample, we want to
create an interval around

68
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,630
this, where we're confident that
there's a 95% chance that

69
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:56,780
this true mean, the true mean
of the differences, lies

70
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,010
within that interval.

71
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:03,200
And to do that let's just think
of it the other way.

72
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:14,220
How can we construct an interval
around this where we

73
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,990
are 95% sure that any sample
from this distribution, and

74
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:22,950
this is one of those samples,
that there is a 95% chance

75
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,470
that we will select from this
region right over here.

76
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:30,800
So we care about a 95% region
right over here.

77
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,960
So how many standard deviations
do we have to go in

78
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,370
each direction?

79
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,980
And to do that we just have
to look at a Z table.

80
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,740
And just remember, if we have
95% in the middle right over

81
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,940
here, we're going to have 2.5%
over here and we're going to

82
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,930
have 2.5% over here.

83
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,020
We have to have 5% split
between these

84
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,900
two symmetric tails.

85
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,140
So when we look at a Z table,
we want the critical Z value

86
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,120
that they give right
over here.

87
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,300
And we have to be
careful here.

88
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,245
We're not going to look up 95%,
because a Z table gives

89
00:05:00,245 --> 00:05:03,640
us the cumulative probability
up to that critical Z value.

90
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,480
So the Z table is going to
be interpreted like this.

91
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,400
So there's going to be some Z
value right over here where we

92
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,940
have 2.5% above it.

93
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,190
The probability of getting a
more extreme result or Z score

94
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,080
above that is 2.5%.

95
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,040
And the probability of getting
one below that

96
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:27,620
is going to be 97.5%.

97
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,640
But if we can find whatever Z
value this is right over here,

98
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,335
it's going to be the same
Z value as that.

99
00:05:32,335 --> 00:05:34,930
And instead of thinking about
it in terms of a one tail

100
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,450
scenario, we're going to think
of it in a two tail scenario.

101
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:46,760
So let's look it up for
97.5% on our Z table.

102
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,920
Right here.

103
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,450
This is 0.975, or 97.5.

104
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:56,760
And this gives us
Z value of 1.96.

105
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,760
So Z is equal to 1.96.

106
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:09,380
Or 2.5% of the samples from this
population are going to

107
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:14,050
be more than 1.96 standard
deviations away from the mean.

108
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,550
So this critical Z value right
here is 1.96 standard

109
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,260
deviations.

110
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,450
This is 1.96 times the standard

111
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:28,460
deviation of x1 minus x2.

112
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,700
And then this right here is
going to be negative 1.96

113
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,840
times the same thing.

114
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,870
Let me write that.

115
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,010
So this right here,
it's symmetric.

116
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,550
This distance is going to be
the same as that distance.

117
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:44,900
So this is negative 1.96 times
the standard deviation of this

118
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,150
distribution.

119
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,900
   

120
00:06:48,900 --> 00:07:03,110
So let's put it this way,
there's a 95% chance that our

121
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,590
sample that we got from our
distribution-- this is the

122
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,080
sample as a difference of
these other samples.

123
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:28,730
There's a 95% chance that 1.91
lies within 1.96 times the

124
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,940
standard deviation of
that distribution.

125
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,210
So you could view
it as a standard

126
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:36,380
error of this statistic.

127
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,760
So x1 minus x2.

128
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,370
   

129
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,370
Let me finish that sentence.

130
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:48,360
There's a 95% chance that 1.91,
which is the sample

131
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,470
statistic, or the statistic that
we got, is within 1.96

132
00:07:52,470 --> 00:08:00,380
times the standard deviation
of this distribution of the

133
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,090
true mean of of the
distribution.

134
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,680
Or we could say it the
other way around.

135
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:15,830
There's a 95% chance that the
true mean of the distribution

136
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:24,090
is within 1.96 times the
standard deviation of the

137
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:28,800
distribution of 1.91.

138
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,900
These are equivalent
statements.

139
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,429
If I say I'm within three feet
of you, that's equivalent to

140
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,480
saying you're within
three feet of me.

141
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,549
That's all that's saying.

142
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:37,760
But when we construct it this
way, it becomes pretty clear,

143
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,679
how do we actually construct
the confidence interval?

144
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,340
We just have to figure out
what this distance

145
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,750
right over here is.

146
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,730
And to figure out what that
distance is, we're going to

147
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,010
have to figure out what the
standard deviation of this

148
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,310
distribution is.

149
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:56,460
Well the standard deviation of
the differences of the sample

150
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,980
means is going to be equal to,
and we saw this in the last

151
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,820
video-- in fact, I think I have
it right at the bottom

152
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:09,050
here-- it's going to be equal
to the square root of the

153
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:13,255
variances of each of those
distributions.

154
00:09:13,255 --> 00:09:18,960
   

155
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,550
Let me write it this way.

156
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:30,270
So the variance, I'll
kind of re-prove it.

157
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:35,570
The variance of our distribution
is going to be

158
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:38,690
equal to the sum of the
variances of each of these

159
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,940
sampling distributions.

160
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:46,100
   

161
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,730
And we know that the variance
of each of these sampling

162
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,120
distributions is equal to the
variance of this sampling

163
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,870
distribution, is equal to the
variance of the population

164
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:02,290
distribution, divided
by our sample size.

165
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,880
And our sample size in
this case is 100.

166
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,880
And the variance of this
sampling distribution, for our

167
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:15,010
control, is going to be equal
to the variance of the

168
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:20,840
population distribution for
the control divided by its

169
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,270
sample size.

170
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:25,250
And since we don't know
what these are, we

171
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,480
can approximate them.

172
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,520
Especially, because our n is
greater than 30 for both

173
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,190
circumstances.

174
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:37,180
We can approximate these with
our sample variances for each

175
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,780
of these distributions.

176
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,920
So let me make this clear.

177
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,480
Our sample variances for each
of these distributions.

178
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,950
So this is going to be our
sample standard deviation one

179
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:51,630
squared, which is the sample
variance for that

180
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,770
distribution, over 100.

181
00:10:54,770 --> 00:11:00,540
Plus my sample standard
deviation for the control

182
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,190
squared, which is the
sample variance.

183
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,590
Standard deviation squared
is just the

184
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,760
variance divided by 100.

185
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:14,080
And this will give us the
variance for this

186
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,220
distribution.

187
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,920
And if we want the standard
deviation, we just take the

188
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,970
square roots of both sides.

189
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:25,620
If we want the standard
deviation of this distribution

190
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,110
right here, this is the variance
right now, so we just

191
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:31,620
need to take the square roots.

192
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,430
Let's calculate this.

193
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,160
We actually know these values.

194
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,695
S1, our sample standard
deviation for

195
00:11:37,695 --> 00:11:39,830
group one is 4.67.

196
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,070
We wrote it right
here, as well.

197
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:51,000
It's 4.76 and 4.04.

198
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,620
The S is 4.67, we're going
to have to square it.

199
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,300
And the S2 is 4.04, we're going
to have to square it.

200
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,580
So let's calculate that.

201
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:09,040
So we're going to take the
square root of 4.67 squared

202
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:18,440
divided by 100 plus 4.04
squared, divided by 100.

203
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,072
And then close the
parentheses.

204
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:23,030
   

205
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:29,940
And we get 0.617.

206
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,390
Let me write it right here.

207
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:36,330
This is going to be
equal to 0.617.

208
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:39,720
So if we go back up over here,
we calculated the standard

209
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,220
deviation of this distribution
to be 0.617.

210
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,720
So now we can actually calculate
our interval.

211
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,700
Because this is going
to be 0.617.

212
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:58,150
So if you want 1.96 times that,
we get 1.96 times that

213
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:02,240
0.617, I'll just write the
answer we just got.

214
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:11,770
So we get 1.21.

215
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:18,660
So the 95% confidence interval
is going to be the difference

216
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:27,190
of our means, 1.91, plus or
minus this number, 1.21.

217
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,040
So what's our confidence
interval?

218
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,620
So the low end of our confidence
interval, and I'm

219
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:40,130
running out of space, 1.91 minus
1.21, that's just 0.7.

220
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,360
So the low end is 0.7.

221
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:51,630
And then the high end, 1.91
plus 1.21, that's 2.12.

222
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,770
let me just make sure of that.

223
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:56,710
My brain sometimes doesn't work
properly when I'm making

224
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,200
these videos.

225
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:08,450
3.12.

226
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:14,110
So just to be clear, there's not
a pure 95% chance that the

227
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:19,000
true difference of the true
means lies in this.

228
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,680
We're just confident that
there's a 95% chance.

229
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,280
And we always have to put a
little confidence there,

230
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:28,110
because remember, we didn't
actually know the population

231
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,640
standard deviations, or the
population variances.

232
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,930
We estimated them
with our sample.

233
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:35,330
And because of that, we don't
know that it's an exact

234
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:35,850
probability.

235
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,300
We just have say we're confident
that it is a 95%

236
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,040
probability.

237
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,510
And that's why we just say it's
a confidence interval.

238
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,760
It's not a pure probability.

239
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,115
But it's a pretty neat result.

240
00:14:46,115 --> 00:14:49,510
   

241
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,600
So we're confident that there's
a 95% chance that the

242
00:14:52,600 --> 00:15:00,820
true difference of these two
samples-- and remember, let me

243
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:10,720
make it very clear, the expected
value of the sample

244
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,990
means is actually the same thing
as the expected value of

245
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,130
the populations.

246
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:18,720
And so, what this is giving us
is actually a confidence

247
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,530
interval for the true difference
between the

248
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:22,280
populations.

249
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,630
If you were to give everyone,
every possible

250
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,080
person, diet one.

251
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,500
And every possible
person diet two.

252
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,120
This is giving us a confidence
interval for the true

253
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,610
population means.

254
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,790
And so when you look at this,
it looks like diet one

255
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,080
actually does do something.

256
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,450
Because in any case, even at the
low end of the confidence

257
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,650
interval, you still have
a greater weight

258
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,400
loss than diet two.

259
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,070
Hopefully, that doesn't
confuse you too much.

260
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,430
In the next video, we're
actually going to do a

261
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:48,400
hypothesis test with
the same data.

262
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:48,867
