1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,730
   

2
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,870
We're on problem 60.

3
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:10,060
Given the equation y is equal
to x to the n where x is

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,920
greater than 0 and n is
less than 0, which

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,340
statement is valid?

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,860
So let's see, x is greater than
0 and n is less than 0.

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:23,420
So the exponent is negative,
but the base is positive.

8
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,860
So I'll just tell
you right now.

9
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,510
Your gut reaction might be to
say, oh, if I have a negative

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,070
exponent, maybe I somehow
end up with a

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,600
negative number somehow.

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,140
But you have to remember, a
negative exponent, it just

13
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,930
tells you that it's really
just the inverse of the

14
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:35,760
positive exponent.

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,320
So this is equal to 1 over
x to the minus n.

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,000
And if n is less than
0, then minus n is

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,080
greater than 0, right?

18
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,510
So you could say this is the
same thing as 1 over x to some

19
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,490
other letter m, where m is minus
m, but then m would be

20
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,540
greater than 0, right?

21
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,720
So no matter how negative this
exponent is, especially if

22
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,890
this base is positive, you're
going to end up with a

23
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:02,580
positive number.

24
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,769
You're going to end up with very
small fractions if this

25
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,370
gets large enough.

26
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,550
It could be 1 over x to the
hundredth power or something.

27
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,350
So it could be a very
small number.

28
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,980
It can approach zero.

29
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,410
But it will always be
a positive number.

30
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:18,250
So y is always going to
be greater than 0.

31
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,050
Choice A.

32
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,820
Problem 61.

33
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,420
If x is a real number, which
best describes the value of x

34
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,290
for which the inequality
the square root of x

35
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,520
greater than 0 is true?

36
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,640
So I'm assuming we're dealing
with the real numbers, and if

37
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,470
I get an imaginary number here,
it's actually just even

38
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,210
hard to compare it in terms
of magnitude to 0.

39
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,610
So they're actually just asking
us what the domain is.

40
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,540
What x's can we put in here and
get an answer where we can

41
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,220
make some type of sense
out of the statement?

42
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,230
So obviously, I could put
a positive x here.

43
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:56,010
x could be greater than 0.

44
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,330
Any x greater than 0 will
have a square root.

45
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,280
And all of their square roots
will be greater than 0.

46
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,490
I mean, you could square both
sides of that equation and you

47
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,390
get x is greater than 0.

48
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,280
You could put x is equal to 0
there, but then the inequality

49
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,450
wouldn't be true, right?

50
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,280
Because the square root
of 0 is equal to 0.

51
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,420
So if you put x is equal to 0
there, that would work, you

52
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,870
can take the square root of 0,
but it just won't make the

53
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,770
inequality true.

54
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,000
So x can't be equal to 0.

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,870
So x can be greater than 0.

56
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,860
It can't be greater than
or equal to 0.

57
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,420
Not all values of x work.

58
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,590
I can't put a negative
number in there.

59
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,400
I mean, they say
no values of x.

60
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:36,900
No, sure.

61
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,720
We can put any positive number
there that works.

62
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,060
So the answer is A.

63
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,290
Next problem.

64
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,100
Let me turn the page.

65
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:54,960
   

66
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,210
Let me copy and paste.

67
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:02,390
   

68
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,760
Which of the following
conclusions is true about the

69
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,820
statement below: x squared is
equal to the square root of x.

70
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,030
All right, so once again,
let's think

71
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,080
about it a little bit.

72
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,360
x squared is equal to the
square root of x.

73
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,790
I mean, it definitely works for
the number 1 and it works

74
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,300
for the number 0.

75
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,170
If you square both sides of that
equation, you get x to

76
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:31,110
the fourth is equal to x.

77
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,760
x could be equal to 0, but if
you assume that x does not

78
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,820
equal 0, you could divide both
sides of this equation by x

79
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:42,220
and you get x to the third
is equal to 1.

80
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,970
And the only number that
I know works for that

81
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,240
is the number 1.

82
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,530
But anyway, the statement
is always true.

83
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,730
No, it's not always true.

84
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,130
I put a 2 there.

85
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,980
Is 2 squared equal to the
square root of 2?

86
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,740
No, 4 does not equal the
square root of 2.

87
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,940
So the statement is
not always true.

88
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,415
The statement is true
when x is negative.

89
00:03:58,415 --> 00:03:59,700
No, x can't even be negative.

90
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,150
You can't take the square root
of a negative number.

91
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,400
You'd end up with imaginary
numbers and it

92
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,600
just gets very strange.

93
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,220
The statement is true when
x is equal to 0.

94
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:07,740
Sure.

95
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,890
It could be 0.

96
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,520
The statement is never true.

97
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:11,930
No.

98
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:16,040
Clearly, it's true when x is
equal to 0 or x is equal to 1.

99
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,070
So the answer is C.

100
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,190
I didn't even have to do this
stuff on the side right here.

101
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,440
But, hopefully, it
was instructive.

102
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,960
   

103
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,210
Next problem.

104
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,940
   

105
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,520
I copied it now I
have pasted it.

106
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,620
All right.

107
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,450
Let me try with the
larger pen.

108
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:41,140
Abelardo wants to create several
different 7-character

109
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,060
screen names.

110
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,990
He wants to use arrangements of
the first three letters of

111
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:48,280
his first name, ABE-- that's
why they made his name

112
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,180
Abelardo-- followed by
arrangements of the 4 digits

113
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,860
in 1984, the year
of his birth.

114
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,180
How many different screen
names can he

115
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,370
create in this way?

116
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,950
All right, so he's got 7.

117
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:02,510
So think about it.

118
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,260
Let's just think about
each slot.

119
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,830
So slot number 1-- that
pen's too fat.

120
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:14,280
Slot number 1, slot number 1,
spot number 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

121
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,700
So slot number 1, how many
different choices

122
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,600
can he put in there?

123
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,270
He can put in an A,
a B or an E there.

124
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,440
So he has three different
choices for slot number 1 I'll

125
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,400
do that in a different color.

126
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,350
He has three different choices
for slot number 1.

127
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,600
Once he picks slot number 1, how
many choices does he have

128
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,730
left for slot number 2?

129
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:37,190
Well, he has two letters left
out of the A, B and E, right?

130
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,410
So he has only two
options left.

131
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,880
And once he gets to slot number
3, he has to just pick

132
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,190
whatever leftover letter
is there in A, B and E.

133
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,310
So he only has one option.

134
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,700
But then when he gets to fourth
digit, now he's trying

135
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,270
to pick from 1984.

136
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,680
For the fourth digit, once he
has four options, he can pick

137
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,180
the 1, the 9, the 8 or the 4.

138
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,080
He has four options.

139
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,190
Then on the fifth digit, he
would have picked one of the

140
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,530
four, so he has three
of them left.

141
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,760
By the sixth digit, he only
has two of them left.

142
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,540
By the seventh digit, he's
forced to pick whatever's

143
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,530
leftover, what he hasn't
picked yet.

144
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:09,850
He has one digit left.

145
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:13,330
So the combinations, you just
multiply all of them.

146
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:17,180
3 times 2 is 6 times 1 is 6.

147
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,870
6 times 4 is 24.

148
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:24,380
24 times 3 is 72.

149
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:29,130
72 times 2 is 144
times 1 is 144.

150
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:32,010
So there's 144 different
screen names he can

151
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,510
create in this way.

152
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,760
Next problem.

153
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,290
   

154
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:45,884
64.

155
00:06:45,884 --> 00:06:47,550
I've copied it.

156
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,860
And now I'm pasting it.

157
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,580
A train is made up of a
locomotive, seven different

158
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,520
cars and a caboose.

159
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,780
If the locomotive must be first
and the caboose must be

160
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,520
last, how many different ways
can the train be ordered?

161
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,350
So we don't even have
to worry about the

162
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,870
locomotive and the caboose.

163
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,940
They're always going to be
in the same position.

164
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,690
The locomotive's first, caboose
is last. So we just

165
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,170
have to worry about the seven
different cars, the order that

166
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,990
they're in.

167
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,360
It's really the same problem
as the last one.

168
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,320
In some ways, it's a
little bit easier.

169
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,010
So let's just say that's
the position.

170
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:25,615
Position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

171
00:07:25,615 --> 00:07:28,320
And let's say we just have to
decide which car we put in

172
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,090
each position, or how many
different options do we have.

173
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,660
So let's say we are filling
the slots starting with

174
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,340
position 1.

175
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,770
Well, we have seven cars
to choose from.

176
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:39,885
The seven is different
from them.

177
00:07:39,885 --> 00:07:42,000
That's not including the
locomotive and the caboose, so

178
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,330
we have seven cars
to pick from.

179
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,310
We've picked one of them.

180
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,780
Then in slot 2, we have
six cars to pick from.

181
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,440
Slot 3, we have five cars to
pick from because we've

182
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,590
already picked two.

183
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,890
And in slot 4, four
cars to pick from,

184
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,700
three cars, two cars.

185
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,690
And then in slot 7, we've
already picked six of the

186
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,120
cars, so whatever's leftover,
we have to pick.

187
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,220
So let's see what
this number is.

188
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,990
1 times 2 is 2.

189
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,080
2 times 3 is 6.

190
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,600
6 times 4 is 24.

191
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,510
24 times 5 is 120.

192
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:18,550
120 times 6 is 720.

193
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:21,080
720 times 7-- I'm just going
to have to do a little bit

194
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,850
multiplication here on the
side-- 720 times 7.

195
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,140
7 times 0 is 0.

196
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,000
7 times 2 is 14.

197
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,940
7 times 7 is 49 plus 1 is 50.

198
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,740
5,040.

199
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,850
So there's 5,040 different
ways that the

200
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,100
train can be ordered.

201
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,977
   

202
00:08:42,977 --> 00:08:43,770
Let's see.

203
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,020
Next problem.

204
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:49,570
   

205
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,000
Maybe I'll just clear
all of this.

206
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,130
All right.

207
00:08:54,130 --> 00:09:02,730
Let me copy the-- all right.

208
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,240
Teresa and Julia are among 10
students who have applied for

209
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,460
a trip to Washington, D.C.

210
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,460
Two students from the group
will be selected at

211
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,660
random for the trip.

212
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,920
What is the probability that
Teresa and Julia will be the

213
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,220
two students selected?

214
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,160
So let's think about this.

215
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,310
There are 10 students who have
applied for the trip.

216
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,980
Two students from the group
will be selected at

217
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,040
random for the trip.

218
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,390
What is the probability Teresa
and Julia will be the two

219
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,020
students selected?

220
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,680
All right, so let's think about
student 1 selected and

221
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,880
student 2 selected.

222
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,500
What's the probability that
Teresa is the first student?

223
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,210
So what's the probably that we
get Teresa and then we get

224
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,630
Julia, that Teresa is the first
student selected and

225
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,080
that Julia is the second
student selected?

226
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,380
Well, the probability that
Teresa is the first-- well,

227
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,260
let me take a step back.

228
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,530
There's two ways that what
they want to happen could

229
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,930
happen, that Teresa and
Julia will be the

230
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,700
two students selected.

231
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,820
Either Teresa is the first
student selected and then

232
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:03,650
Julia is the second; or Julia is
the first student selected

233
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,490
and Teresa is the second.

234
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,790
So if we figure out the
probability of this happening

235
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,440
and the probability of this
happening, then we can just

236
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,770
add those probabilities together
and then we have the

237
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:16,020
probability of either
of those happening.

238
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,420
All right, so let's do that.

239
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:22,616
The probability of Teresa
happening is-- let me do this

240
00:10:22,616 --> 00:10:24,170
in a different color.

241
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,790
There's 10 students, so there's
a probability that we

242
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:29,270
pick Teresa first. And then
once we've picked Teresa

243
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:32,550
first, the probability that we
pick Julia next, well, now

244
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,580
there's 9 students
left, right?

245
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,400
Because you've already picked
Teresa, so there's a 1 in 9

246
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,390
chance you pick Julia.

247
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,900
So that is equal to 1 in 90.

248
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,980
So there's a 1 in 90 chance
of this happening.

249
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,120
There's a 1 in 90 chance
of that happening.

250
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,080
And then what's the chance
of this happening?

251
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,610
What's the chance of
that happening?

252
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,440
Well, it's the same thing.

253
00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:00,170
This is 1 in 10 and this
is 1 in 90, right?

254
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:04,690
And so you have a 1 in 90
chance of it happening.

255
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:08,370
And so, what is the probability
of either of these

256
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,310
things happening?

257
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,360
Of this combination or
this combination?

258
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,020
Well, you just add them
together, and you get 2 out of

259
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:20,970
90, which is equal to 1 out
of 45, which is choice A.

260
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,160
And I'm out of time.

261
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,070
See you in the next video.

262
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:24,400
