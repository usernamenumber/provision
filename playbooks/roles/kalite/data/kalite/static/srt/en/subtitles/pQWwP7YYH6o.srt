1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,510
   

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,780
In the last video, I showed
you that the definition of

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,189
efficiency, eta, is the work
that we do given the amount of

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,450
heat we are given
to work with.

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,020
And we showed that for an
engine, that could also be

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:21,390
rewritten as 1 minus Q2 over
Q1, or essentially, 1 minus

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,570
the heat we output from our
engine divided by the amount

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,570
of heat we input from
our engine.

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,940
Now we applied this formula to
a Carnot cycle, and we said,

10
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,946
hey, for a Carnot engine,
we could get an

11
00:00:31,946 --> 00:00:34,240
efficiency of this.

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,490
So let me write this here.

13
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:41,310
So the efficiency for Carnot,
eta for Carnot, is 1

14
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,800
minus T2 over T1.

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,060
To get this result, we had to
use the fact that we were

16
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,290
dealing with the Carnot cycle
to use, you know, we were

17
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,902
moving along these isotherms,
and so I was able to take the

18
00:00:49,902 --> 00:00:52,500
natural log of them and do all
of that, and I was able to get

19
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,140
this for the efficiency
of a Carnot engine.

20
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,040
And let me be very clear.

21
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,360
This is the efficiency that
can only be attained by a

22
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,030
Carnot engine.

23
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,560
The other definitions of
efficiency-- so when I just

24
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,710
defined efficiency as equal to
the work performed divided by

25
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:13,280
the heat, let me call it the
heat input-- or when I defined

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:21,690
it as the net heat in.

27
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:26,610
So Q1 minus Q2 over Q1.

28
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,510
This applies to all
heat engines.

29
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,370
This is true for all
heat engines,

30
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,090
including the Carnot engine.

31
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,940
A heat engine is an engine
that operates on heat.

32
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,320
I probably should have said
that a while ago.

33
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,740
And this engine that I made,
this Carnot engine, is

34
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,930
definitely a engine that is
operating on heat, because

35
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,810
it's taking heat here,
and later it releases

36
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,590
the heat down here.

37
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,180
The cycle just shows what's
happening to that engine.

38
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,450
And I just want to make
that distinction, too.

39
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,730
The engine is the actual
physical thing.

40
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,660
The cycle just describes
what's happening to it.

41
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:00,540
So with that said, I said that
this is only true for a Carnot

42
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,150
heat engine.

43
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,848
Now, what I'm about to embark
on-- and I don't know if I'm

44
00:02:04,848 --> 00:02:05,830
going to finish it
in this video.

45
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:09,520
It might take into the next
video to do it properly-- is

46
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,690
to show you that if we're
operating a heat engine

47
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,560
between two temperature
sources-- so I have my hot

48
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:24,240
temperature source, I'll call
that TH for T hot, and it's

49
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:30,830
transferring some heat, Q1, and
some other heat is coming

50
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:39,410
out at Q2, and I'm performing
some work, and then my other

51
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,770
cold temperature reservoir,
I'll call that T

52
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:42,820
cold, is down here.

53
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,670
And that's where I'm releasing
the heat, too.

54
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,770
I'm going to show over the next
few videos that the most

55
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,960
efficient engine is this
theoretical Carnot engine.

56
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,520
That no engine can get more
efficient than this.

57
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,650
So if this is a Carnot
engine, this is the

58
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,220
most efficient engine.

59
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,380
Or this is the ideal, where
nothing is lost. Well, I'll go

60
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,710
into that in more detail.

61
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,510
No engine can get more efficient
than this Carnot

62
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,670
heat engine.

63
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,900
So to get there, to prove it to
you, I'm just going to play

64
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,680
with the Carnot engine a little
bit, just to show you

65
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,430
some of the tools that it
has at its disposal.

66
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,970
So one of the things-- let me
just draw a PV diagram.

67
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:36,180
   

68
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,400
In the Carnot cycle we've done
so far, we've kind of always

69
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,330
moved in one direction.

70
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,660
We had our isothermal
expansion.

71
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,100
It went something like that.

72
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,630
That was isothermal.

73
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,670
Then we had our adiabatic
expansion-- and the whole time

74
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:55,815
we were going in that
direction-- and

75
00:03:55,815 --> 00:03:57,990
it went like that.

76
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:01,660
Then we had our isothermal
contraction.

77
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,426
It went something like this.

78
00:04:03,426 --> 00:04:06,560
   

79
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,230
And then we had our adiabatic
contraction, to get to where

80
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,500
we were to begin with.

81
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,590
So then we went back
like that.

82
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,960
And the whole time, we
went in this kind

83
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,519
of clockwise direction.

84
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:19,800
We went in the clockwise
direction, and we took in heat

85
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,410
up here-- because we were doing
work-- we took in heat

86
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,580
to keep our temperature
constant, and then we released

87
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,650
heat here to keep our
temperature from

88
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,530
going up from Q2.

89
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:35,520
And so if I were to draw this
another way-- well, I just did

90
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,580
one like that, but let
me draw it like this.

91
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:42,370
I could also depict it like
this, where that's my engine,

92
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,230
this is my hot reservoir--
let me put this as

93
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:49,180
T1-- T1 is up here.

94
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,760
It transferred Q1 to
my Carnot engine.

95
00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:00,360
My Carnot engine did some work,
and then left over, it

96
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,130
transferred into my cold
reservoir, T2,

97
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,580
it transferred Q2.

98
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,490
This is another way of depicting
what went on in this

99
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,060
Carnot cycle.

100
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,040
And here I've actually
drawn the engine.

101
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,630
Now, one of the tools I want to
show you is that this is a

102
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,900
reversible reaction.

103
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,810
Or that we can take this and
go the other way around.

104
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,520
And it's dependent upon an
assumption that I threw out a

105
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,420
long time ago.

106
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,900
So when I first drew these, I
kind of introduced you to the

107
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,940
idea of a quasistatic process.

108
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,690
   

109
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:37,520
And quasistatic just means,
look, you do it really slowly,

110
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,460
so that you can always say that
you're close enough to

111
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,700
equilibrium that your
macro state

112
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,300
variables are always defined.

113
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,830
And that was the whole
justification for dealing with

114
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,370
pebbles like this.

115
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,890
Instead of just doing it
wholesale, instead of just

116
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,150
moving all the pebbles, and just
getting to this state,

117
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,930
from A to B kind of jumping, I
wanted to do it gradually, so

118
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,570
that I would be defined at
every point in between.

119
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,760
That's what quasistatic
did for us.

120
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,970
And when I actually made the
video quasistatic processes, I

121
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,570
said, you know, quasistatic
processes, for the most part,

122
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:07,830
are reversible.

123
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:11,820
And sometimes I used the
words interchangeably.

124
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,480
Now, by definition, our
theoretical Carnot cycle is

125
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,760
said to be, not only is it
quasistatic, but it is also

126
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,100
reversible.

127
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,990
Which means at any point in
time-- let's say we've moved a

128
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,980
couple of pebbles, and we've
gotten right here.

129
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,540
If we want to, if we're in the
mood, we can add some pebbles

130
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,080
back, and just follow this right
back to where we were.

131
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,040
That's what reversible means.

132
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,770
It means you can reverse
something.

133
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:41,180
Now, what has to be ideal about
the system in order for

134
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,930
that to be true?

135
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:48,950
Well, it means that the actual
movement of our piston, of

136
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,720
this movable ceiling, that it
shouldn't have any friction.

137
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,000
Because if some of the heat is
lost to friction, then when we

138
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,610
go back, we would have lost
some of our heat.

139
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,670
Some heat would have been
destroyed, just going from one

140
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,360
state forward and back.

141
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,350
So the assumption that we have
to make in order for the

142
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,530
Carnot cycle to be reversible
is that it's frictionless.

143
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:14,640
   

144
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,770
So the Carnot heat engine, this
theoretical engine, is a

145
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,750
frictionless engine, which is
theoretically impossible.

146
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,150
To be completely frictionless.

147
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,150
To be-- but we'll talk more
about that in the future.

148
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:27,800
So if you have a completely
frictionless engine, and it's

149
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,890
quasistatic, it's
also reversible.

150
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:31,983
So if we want to do
it reversible,

151
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:33,250
what does that mean?

152
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,770
It means I could start in this
state, my state A that I've

153
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,680
labelled before, but instead
of going around that way, I

154
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,520
could go around the other way.

155
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:46,050
So what I could do first, is I
could adiabatically expand

156
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:51,960
first-- so maybe let me redraw
it, so I do it the other way.

157
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,810
So I could reverse
this reaction.

158
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,120
And it would happen the
exact same way.

159
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,060
And that's an artifact of that
I'm always in equilibrium, and

160
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,490
that my system is frictionless,
that I don't

161
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,050
lose energy just going
back and forth.

162
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:08,120
So I could start at state
A here, and then I could

163
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,060
adiabatically contract.

164
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,925
Adiabatic contraction would look
something like this, and

165
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:15,590
it'll get to that state.

166
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:19,530
Then I can isothermically
expand.

167
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,780
So I'm going like this.

168
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,650
   

169
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:30,300
And as I isothermically expand--
so I'm going like

170
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,010
this, I'm all along an
isotherm-- I'd doing some

171
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,710
isothermic expansion-- so in
this case, I'm doing work, but

172
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:40,440
I'm doing work isothermically,
right?

173
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,330
At some cold isotherm.

174
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,450
Let's call it T2, right?

175
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,840
Just like this was T2.

176
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,080
So in this case, if I'm
expanding, and I'm staying at

177
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,180
T2, and I'm sitting
on top of my T2

178
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:57,210
reservoir, heat is coming.

179
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,900
This area under the curve,
the work I'm

180
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,200
doing, is the heat added.

181
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:08,080
This is Q2, and that is given
to me by my T2 reservoir.

182
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,460
So everything is going
in reverse.

183
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,060
That's the whole idea.

184
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:17,910
Then I adiabatically contract,
like that, and then I

185
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:23,800
isothermically contract,
like that, to get

186
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,480
back where I started.

187
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,840
When I isothermically contract,
what's happening?

188
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,820
Work is being done to me, so now
all of this area over here

189
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,090
will be negative.

190
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,040
And in order to keep my
temperature constant, I have

191
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,580
to release heat.

192
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,740
So I'm releasing heat, but
I'm doing it at a high

193
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,100
temperature.

194
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,100
So I'm releasing it into
my T1 reservoir.

195
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,330
So it's the exact same thing
as it happened before, but

196
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,510
since when I go in a reverse
direction, some

197
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,160
work is being applied.

198
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,570
So now, when you look at it this
way, when you figure out

199
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,930
all of the areas,
the area in here

200
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,720
will actually be negative.

201
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,530
And the reason why I'm saying
that is because the positive

202
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,380
work values are going
to be this.

203
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,320
This is going to be the
positive, what I'm doing in

204
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,420
blue right here.

205
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,200
And the negative work
values are going to

206
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,090
be all of this stuff.

207
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,190
So if you wanted to figure out
the total work done, it's

208
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,070
going to be negative.

209
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:20,210
So what's happening, if I run
the Carnot cycle in reverse--

210
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:24,300
so I'll call it the Carnot
refrigerator.

211
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,790
No, that's not what
I wanted to do.

212
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,870
I'll call it Carnot reverse.

213
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:33,740
But it's handy that R also
stands for refrigerator.

214
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,820
This is the Carnot engine.

215
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:42,170
It does work by using heat, by
taking advantage of the heat

216
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:45,170
difference between this hot--
you could view this as the T

217
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:48,040
hot and the T cold.

218
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,640
Now, a reverse Carnot engine, or
maybe you call it a Carnot

219
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,990
refrigerator, does
the opposite.

220
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,830
That's exactly what I
just drew over here.

221
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:02,440
What it does is, it starts with
a cold body-- I'll call

222
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:09,970
that T cold, or T2-- it takes
some smaller amount of heat

223
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,780
from the cold body.

224
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,550
Some work has to be input
into the system

225
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,190
in order to do this.

226
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,630
And then it puts more heat-- you
can kind of view it as a

227
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:25,250
combination of this work and
this heat taken from the cold

228
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,060
body-- and it gives it
to the warm body.

229
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,300
Sorry.

230
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,320
This is Q2, and it
gives it Q1.

231
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,090
So everything just happens
completely in reverse.

232
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,180
And that's just a byproduct
of, this is reversible.

233
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,990
So I can just go and I can do,
if this is the way we went

234
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,740
before, when we're an engine,
if we want to be a

235
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,560
refrigerator, we go the other
direction, and everything just

236
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,540
gets reversed.

237
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,600
And I want you to really
understand

238
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,420
that this is doable.

239
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,670
That there's nothing
wrong with this.

240
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,080
You might say, doesn't this
defy the second law of

241
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,230
thermodynamics?

242
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:57,960
We're taking heat from a cold
body to a warm body?

243
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,640
And my answer will be the
same thing I said

244
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,030
on my entropy videos.

245
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,020
I said, well, no.

246
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,240
We're applying some work.

247
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,290
This is a refrigerator.

248
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,740
So some work has to be done
in order to do this.

249
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,010
And whatever object that is
doing the work-- it may be

250
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,150
some, in the case of your
refrigerator, it's a

251
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,710
compressor.

252
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:19,280
That is adding more entropy to
the universe than the entropy

253
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,300
that's being destroyed
by our refrigerator.

254
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,100
So this does not defy the second
law of thermodynamics.

255
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:30,410
Now, I want to make another
point about the Carnot engine.

256
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:33,070
Let me take the reverse
Carnot engine.

257
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,530
Let me call it the Carnot
refrigerator.

258
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,610
So if we take that-- and this is
really just more math than

259
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:39,860
anything else.

260
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,220
   

261
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:48,090
If we're taking in Q2, adding
in some work, and producing

262
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:52,380
Q1, we can scale this
up arbitrarily.

263
00:12:52,380 --> 00:13:03,910
If we take x times Q2 in, and
we put in x times W in, then

264
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:07,930
we're going to put x times Q1
into our top reservoir.

265
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,070
And that makes sense,
because these are

266
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,450
just arbitrary numbers.

267
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,780
For example, if we have two
Carnot engines in parallel,

268
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,870
you can just kind of view that
whole thing as two Carnot

269
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,630
engines doing it together, so
all of these would be 2s.

270
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,010
If we had three Carnot engines
doing it together, all of

271
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,520
those would be three, you could
just view them as one

272
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,020
collective engine.

273
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:31,090
Now, with that said, I think
I've laid the framework for at

274
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:36,820
least the ideas that will let us
show that the Carnot engine

275
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:41,060
is the most efficient engine
that's able to be produced.

276
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:46,120
And given that the Carnot
engine's efficiency is this--

277
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,200
and we're going to prove that
it's the most efficient

278
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,630
engine-- this becomes the upper
bound on efficiency for

279
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:56,080
any engine that anybody
can or will ever make.

280
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,350
And I'll kind of
do the crowning

281
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,490
touch in the next video.
